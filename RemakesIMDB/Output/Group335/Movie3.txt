		<shortDescription>Dacascos is Charlton Heston is Will Smith...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Behold the inevitable straight to video incarnation of Matheson's now thrice adapted "I Am Legend" which effectively combines the titles of the two latest ("Omega Man" and "I Am Legend") into one that will fool the unsuspecting movie renter/buyer. As with most knock-offs available from The Asylum, the much labored over box art promises a far more interesting and far more expensive film (it may be a tragedy that these are some of the last examples of good movie-related graphics). But since this is from The Asylum I'll assume you all also know what sort of inexpensive film to expect.Trashing the straight-to-DVD industry aside, it is hardly the worst movie of its kind (that honor belongs to "Forsaken" with turns the story into a vampire road movie). "I Am Omega" has pretty good location use and competent production value. The editing is fairly stellar and the zombies weren't that laughable (although they were no substitute for the cloaked mutants of "The Omega Man"). And mercifully there are no bad video after effects like a lot of these low budget movies do.The main problem is the slowness. The flashbacks in this version of the story (which cause the first 30 minutes to drag badly) choose to explain Dacascos' character as a tortured soul rather than unfold the explanations for the world being near over. The decision to use mindless zombies rather than intelligent mutants makes the action a little repetitive and doesn't actually help much with the horror. Red necks and the token female are added to give our heroes someone else to deal with. Director Furst and writer Meed add an explosion count down to move things along as well.It won't hurt you too much if you keep your expectations low. If you're new to The Asylum, this is perhaps one of the better examples you'll find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am Omega (2007) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard about this one, another apocalyptic combo takeoff on I AM LEGEND and THE OMEGA MAN, that was independently produced on a low budget and released direct to DVD on the Asylum label. It's about a man who is one of the few survivors on Earth after some sort of catastrophe (it's never made clear) has turned people into grotesque and marauding zombies. He meets up with a couple of other guys who need his aid in reaching one known female survivor somewhere who may have the cure within her own blood. There is nothing that's new or unique here, but it functions very much like a "LAST MAN ON EARTH meets DAWN OF THE DEAD", and is more of a zombie film than anything else. On that level I think it succeeds pretty well in spite of the lack of funds... the ghoul makeup and special effects are actually quite good, and there is a decent amount of one-on-one threat and action with the creatures (who are played by real people). In fact, while watching this I thought to myself how much better this aspect of the movie played out than ANY of the silly and needlessly cartoon-like "dwellers" of Will Smith's mega-budgeted I AM LEGEND (which wasn't released until after this, also in 2007) ! Sometimes less is more in this regard, and a tiny budget requires more realism. Sure, there are many curious mistakes (how do computers still work, and why are there lights everywhere at night, for instance?) but I got the impression that hearts were in the right place and the filmmakers did the best with what they had. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Dacascos stars a lone soldier looking to blow up the city to destroy zombies that are overtaking the world, seems that you can be effected by their blood, but through kickboxing and gunfire Dacascos saves the day and perhaps the last woman on earth. Here's the deal I Am Omega is better than average for an asylum released product. Indeed the thing that is strange about Asylum films is that where as people liked Cannon and Full Moon, this group is universally hated and though their movies sell well the public opinion is of disgust and dislike. I Am Omega actually isn't too awful of a movie. I mean it's still a bad movie but it does have it's moments of goofy fun and with the reuniting cast of Kickboxer 5's Geoff Meed and Mark Dacascos the movie is watchable for fans of Dacascos. I think the main problem with this movie is that we know so little about how the apocalypse came and many loose ends are left at the end. That being said some of the action is okay and the movie's fast pace made it watchable. As for Asylum, I understand why people dislike their films, Transmorphers, Snakes On A Train and so on were all really awful films but I give credit to this one, in that I think fans of Dacascos will enjoy this movie. The bad acting (from everyone but Dacascos), the cheap production values and underwritten script detract the casual viewer but like I said fans of B.movies may find some enjoyment in this.* * out of 4-(Fair)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For an Asylum Film, not bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>okay, I am only given this a four because I also watched "Undead or Alive", a truly repulsive "zombie comedy" starring the unfunny Chris Kataan. So this little Asylum stink bomb actually took on a new luster after watching that abomination.If you've seen the Omega Man or Last Man on Earth, you'll understand the plot. The majority of the human race has been wiped out by a plague that turns people into flesh-eating zombies. A single survivor lives in a fortress home and fights off nightly attacks by Zombies. During the day, he is planting bombs with the intent of blowing up an entire city. (It is never clear why he wants to do this, other than killing off all the Zombies.) He gets a call from a woman trapped in the city. Yes, humanity has fallen, but the internet still works. She is the only person immune to the plague, and maybe they can make a vaccine from her blood. He meets up with two survivalist types who help him rescue her, but they intend to kill the girl so that a world where survivalists aren't considered nuts will continue.Well, anyway, after losing the survivalists, the Hero finds the girl, and they find a car in an underground parking garage where surprisingly, the lights are still on. Yes, humanity has fallen, but the lights are still on. After a running battle with zombies who spend way too much time doing the sneak past the camera maneuver, they meet up with the surviving survivalist, who shoots the hero in all his limbs and leaves him to die.A final battle ensues where he rescues the girl from imminent rape, and the hero and the girl ride off into the sunset, watching the city blow up in a cheap special effects sequence.Okay, it isn't good, but you have to admire works like this, where a lot of beginning filmmakers can show their stuff. It is a lot better than garbage like Undead or Alive, where people who should know better make bad movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this I asked myself, why doing an "Omega" movie, just before I am Legend comes to the big screen. Is this supposed to be just another remake of The Omega man? Well, while watching it, I was still asking the same question to myself... And I could not answer it even after the cast rolled. Well, I enjoy end-of-the-world and post-apocalyptic movies, that's why I watched this title. But it seriously lacks originality. Casting and acting is in line with the budget, cinematography is quite weak, but the weakest point here is the screenplay, that once tries to be funny than in another minute it tries to be serious. The world as we know it has ended, after all, and the zombies are on the loose, for god's sake. Don't make the fancy move with the machete when you are one of the last survivors on Earth, just silence that damn creepy zombie, please!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another remake of I AM LEGEND has Mark Dascasvcos as one of very few humans left on our planet after some major catastrophe. Everyone else is now a flesh-eating zombie. Mark D. plays a former military type who is planting bombs around the city to take out as many zombies as possible. He also shoots and beats to death as many as his schedule allows. In the middle of everything, a distress call comes in and he finds a lone survivor in the heart of the city, a young female. He reluctantly embarks on a mission to save her, in the company of two other ex-military guys who show up seemingly out of the blue. Lots of decent fight scenes, as befitting the film's legendary kickboxing star. OMEGA is moody, well photographed and has a great first half that loses some steam in the second. The gore is cartoonish, and the goofy-looking zombies are clearly played by stuntmen in rubber monster suits. No harm done, assuming you can accept the lead in this umpteenth version of the Richard Matheson story being a kickboxing machine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starts of nicely. Mark Dacascos kills some wicked zombie thingies and plants some bombs to create havoc. In the mean-time he starts going mad and hears voices after the prolonged period of isolation.This part of the movie actually works with Dacascos hearing stuff that is not there, talking to himself and doing an adequate acting job to go with it.Unfortunately it goes downhill when new characters arrive and Mark ends up going on a rescue mission into the heart of the zombie manifestation. Plot-holes start appearing galore and no logic is really given behind the actions of main protagonists.Not terrible, mildly adequate piece of fun, but to be quickly forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dacascos is The Last Man on Earth?except for the other men.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a post apocalyptic world ravaged by disease, embittered survivor Renchard (Mark Dacascos) leads a life of solitude dedicated to the destruction of the mutated plague victims that killed his wife and son.Having planted high-explosive time-bombs all over the city where the zombie-like creatures now reside, Renchard is forced by two highly trained special forces soldiers, Mike and Vincent (Ryan Lloyd and Geoff Meed), to lead a dangerous mission into zombie central to rescue immune damsel in distress Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins), who might just hold the answer to a cure for the epidemic.I might be stating the bloody obvious here, but martial arts star Mark Dacascos really doesn't possess the necessary acting chops to convincingly portray a lonely, tortured soul pushed to the edge of his sanity in a world gone wild?which is why Asylum mockbuster 'I Am Omega' works best whenever director Griff Furst abandons character development in favour of showcasing his lead performer's undoubted ability to kick ass.Between the banal scenes in which Renchard goes crazy, listens to imaginary radio broadcasts, urinates morosely on the Vasquez Rocks (surely US cinema's most overused filming location) and gibbers like a loon, he exterminates any zombies stupid enough to wander onto his patch, which gives Dacascos a chance to show off his moves, splatter heads, and shoot stuff. During these moments we get some genuinely tense action and several effective scares and for a while 'I Am Omega' looks set to fulfil its potential as an enjoyable piece of B-movie trash.Unfortunately, once Renchard enters the city and the clock ticks inexorably towards the inevitable explosive ending, matters get progressively sillier. It ultimately all falls apart in a mess of plot holes and culminates in an extremely dumb finale that sees our battered and bruised hero not only managing to run and push a car, despite having been shot in the legs, but also perform an impressive combination of martial arts moves to beat the bad guy and save the day.5.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 6 for the hilarious 'zombie in the dumpster' scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Dacascos Versus Zombies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, "I Am Omega" is an "I Am Legend" knock-off from those copycats at The Asylum, but the Will Smith movie stank like three-day old tomatoes rotting in the sun with its pretentious plot about the last guy alive with recurring flashbacks about his family and the destruction of New York City. In "Universal Soldiers" director Griff Furst's low-budget,predictable, but exciting,straight-to-DVD, B-movie "I Am Omega," Renchard (Mark Dacascos of "Cradle 2 the Grave") is one of the last survivors of a mysterious pestilence that has mutated virtually everybody else into ravenous, bloodthirsty zombies. Renchard is holed up alone in a compound of a house in the mountains wired to an alarm system, barbed wire, and a satellite computer link. Thank God that he doesn't have a dog! He does, however, have a mannequin with which to interact. Anyway, one day Renchard receives an incoming video message on his lap-top from Brianna who has holed herself up in a laboratory in the city that he is trying to destroy because it has become a haven for zombies. Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins of "Dracula's Curse") has a built-in resistance to the pestilence, and she is desperately trying to reach a sanctuary called Antioch. Repeatedly, she contacts Renchard, but he wants nothing to do with her because he is going crazy himself. It doesn't help matters that she resembles his late wife. When he isn't staring at photos of his family, he is killing zombies left, right, center, and sideways. By the way, the zombies look pretty nauseating which adds at least a star to this fast-moving, 85-minute Apocalyptic tale."I Am Omega" is one of those horror movies where zombies spring out of nowhere to scare you with their ugly, hideous faces while blood dribbles down their lips. Daniel Maldondado's editing adds a visceral quality to their attacks. These zombies share little in common, for example, with the zombies that menaced Vincent Price in the original Richard Matheson movie. Those zombies staggered around, but these undead demons could be Olympic medal winners what with the way they scramble from here to there. Our physically fit hero uses his combat skills with automatic weapons and his martial arts prowness, but he is like Custer at the Last Stand. These zombies keep popping up like dragon's teeth sown in the earth. Indeed, these feral combat scenes give this movie it's edge, and that edge escalates when a couple of normal but insane soldiers show up about 36 minutes into the action in a van at Richard's place one day. They convince him to lead them into the city so they can rescue Brianna. These guys, however, aren't completely honest with our resourceful hero. Mindless Asylum action galore with no science speculative or otherwise in sight predominats, but the adrenalin-laced hand-held camera-work salvages this nonsense. Actually, Alexander Yellen's photography is a notch above what you usually get from this kind of tripe. There's an amusing showdown in a high rise parking lot where our hero tries to crank a car while the zombies assemble behind him and he has to face them down alone with this kick-boxing skills. "I Am Omega" clearly is not for everybody's taste but it ranks as a better-than-average opus from Asylum. Nothing really surprising happens here, but Furst stages the action with a senes of style and gusto. The sympathetic Renchard (Dacascos in a good performance)and his woebegone plight along with the momentum in the action scenes partially redeems this derivative, one-dimensional slaughterhouse saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalyptic Survival Horror Not bad !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got done watching this movie. Seems like a solid story and I like the parallels with the I am legend movies. Seems like they tie in well and flush out more of the background. Be warned this is low budget but that does not mean it is a waste of time. People who complain about them not having money to make it better need to chill out and realize that the story is solid. The acting is great except for the girl who I just wanted to die. Whenever she talked she ruined the movie. The guys did a great job with their characters and they really came to life. I would have given this an 8 but that horrid acting from that girl made me give it a 4. She turned low budget film into a disaster. I would rather watch babies get kicked out windows then watch her in another movie.Yes this movie is low budget so why complain about that. If you like good stories that are survival horror or apocalyptic you might like this. I liked it except for that girl who just ruined the movie for me. Her acting is very out of character and it shows unfortunately. Luckily her horrible attempt at acting didn't lower the morale of the other actors on the set.Hope this gets remade with the same people minus the stupid girl who has no talent!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombie movie goes martial arts.The big flaw of the movie is: you've kind of seen it all, because I am Legend is out pretty fresh and maybe you have by now seen the Omega-Man also. The story is ripped!!! AND the script sometimes ain't very good: it happens to be illogical and often you just don't know, what the heck the guys are doing and what for.BUT: The acting in Omega is still pretty good - partially you'll find some gems. O.k. it's not character, but it's decent enough for a SF/horror/martial arts. What do you expect? Klaus f***ing Kinski??? The camera work is sometimes really good, no joke some really bright shining jewels in there, also the light and the locations, especially in the beginning, when Renchard is on his own. I liked the scene when you really don't know if it's his imagination that haunts him or a monster. The zombie-make up is good, the sounds they make on the other hand is quite simple.I don't like the attitude to just judge a movie because there is some supposed to be original out there somewhere which can boast with a STAR or so. I don't think Will Smith did such a brilliant Job in Legend and - hey the Legend Script was also kind of obvious, wasn't it :D? Omega at least has one big surprise/turning point, and this makes it more interesting than Legend, no joke, this rip off has genius own ideas about the Last-man-on-Earth-against-the-zombies-Topic.Try to forget that there is Legend, that there is 28 days, weeks whatsoever and try to take this movie as it is, without bias.SEE! Not so bad, eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on another review here saying give it a chance, I did. Sorry I did now as there really is a reason why this horrible movie has such a bad score.Now it was obviously low budget. That I could deal with if it was the only bad thing about itThe worst thing about it was bad camera work. It felt like you were looking at the movie from inside a jerky box. For some reason the movie was shot with a very narrow lens and almost always right on top/front. Was this movie filled with the the intention of being shown on a three inch ipad screen? I could best describe what I saw was like seeing through a one eyed man..with very bad near sight in his one good eye. There was no real distinction between opening/establishment shots, closeups or anything else.Between the narrow frame and jerkiness I started to feel slightly ill, somewhat like motion sickness. Just horrible!Don't even think about seeing this movie unless you want to give your self a headache, and, or, you just like wasting your time.You are lot better off finding the original very entertaining "The Omega Man" 1971, or if you like a bit of the horror genre see the classic "The Last Man on Earth" 1964.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been remarkably good, even on a low budget. Many zombie movies have proved this (the original Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days Later). And it's really hard, in my estimation, to make a BAD zombie movie. It's like bad pizza. But nothing is absolute, as this film demonstrates. It's roughly just a martial arts movie with orcs. There's little context for the film and you're never really sure what the hero is even doing there. Pity, really, they didn't spend a bit more time crafting an intriguing low budget zombie ep that calls back to the Omega Man version (hippy, black power zombies who avoid technology).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After brushing over this movie on my collection for over 1 year, i decided, screw it, i'll give it ago.I thought it was an I AM LEGEND rip off. I enjoyed every minute of this film, from its slow familiar start, its what I AM LEGEND should have been, to the bitter cliché end, the bad guy getting defeated or maybe not (watch it )because what I AM LEGEND lacks in action, this makes up for it.I must say the female character Jennifer Lee Wiggins certainly is slightly pleasing to the eye.This movie is an a good example of money well spent, unlike their Hollywood big budget counterparts who blow money like its out of fashion and yet creates a piece of garbage one wouldn't fart at... or god forbid, pee on.It was a pleasure watching this movie, although Mark Dacascos is looking rather too slim but im guessing he had to shed a few pounds to get that 'starving' appearance.In conclusion, don't judge a book by its cover (cheap ripoff) because you'll be surprised at what 3 million can provide.When the zombie apocalypse comes, stay at home, with a good stock of beer, popcorn, a good woman (not a zombie or blow up doll) and enjoy some good movies like this one!Peace y'all! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination but it's not bad and definitely a lot better than old jug ears effort. Here's why I'd rather watch this a million times than watch Will Smith doing his pitiful Shrek/nervous breakdown scene one more time.The people in this film aren't computer generated and though they don't look great they don't look like computer game bad guys skating over the floor. This is a definite improvement. In the odd scene they actually look quite good.It leaves the more philosophical aspects of the book and two films alone. Fair enough, it's not like we haven't seen it done and rather it was absent than messed up and garbled like Legend.There's a small amount of chemistry between the characters, in Legend there's all the spark of a pair of rubber gloves rubbing together. The characters are all pretty simple but they do have a personality of sorts, again a step up from Legend.Lastly the main character doesn't really express any emotions which is fair enough, I prefer that to the two faces Will Smith can pull off. You can accept a man who is totally robbed of emotion but it's harder to accept a man that only has two facial expressions and flicks through them and gets his movie described by some genius on here as "an acting buffet."It's not a perfect movie, some bits are a bit weak but I genuinely enjoyed it so give it a chance you might like it too. For a cheap rip off it's surprisingly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A shameful attempt at anything, I almost committed suicide at the end of this "film". I came into this movie with VERY low expectations, I paid fifty cents to watch and I still felt ripped off. Starting off with a highly disturbing beginning, we see a zombie murder a woman the hop the fence like the cops are after him. Makes sense? Immediately after a small child is sexually molested by a zombie. Didn't need to see that, thank you.It then cuts to the most boring series of images and sounds ever compiled. To be honest I had no idea what was happening for a significant part of the film. There was an entire scene with a clock that appeared to be possessed that had no relevance to anything that was going on. I feel bad for the alarm clock for having to be in this movie. Not to mention the beginning with the sexually molested boy is completely dropped as soon as possible. After this we watch our "hero" engage in a series of completely inane activities including peeing on rocks, chasing rabbits, but nothing that progressed the "story". Speaking of the "story" nothing at all related to the plot happens for 45 minutes. When Omega receives an incoming video the director thought they were hot stuff trying to fake out the audience by having him put his cursor over deny before going to accept twice in a 5 minute span. Real slick.Eventually two guys show up at Omega's doorstep claiming to be from Antioch, a place where the survivors come from (apparently Omega isn't the last man alive as the box would tell you). They ask him to help rescue the girl from the video chat who, of course, happens to be immune to the zombie disease. After he refuses they blow up his house with a bazooka. Taking it rather well, Omega decides to help them after all. Never does he even question why they destroyed his home. Before leaving there is a crappy and random fight scene where everyone tries to act tough and looks like an idiot. It seems like these 3 might be the main group for the rest of the film until literally the next scene one of them is killed and the other stays to have sex with his body (wonder if he's gonna make it out). After staring at a shoe for a little too long Omega engages in one of the worst scenes in the entire movie. A true disgrace to all of cinema, we then see Omega "fight" some zombies. The editing in this scene is so bad it has to be seen to be believed. Omega walks forward before abruptly cutting to a zombie running towards the camera. We then see two frames of Omega readying his weapon before cutting again to a scene that looks like it was shot for an entirely different movie that features a female soldier firing an entirely different weapon in front of a forest. Why this is necessary I have no idea, but they used this same "trick" three times in the one fight.After you finish laughing at this scene you see Omega rescue the girl and then hot wire a car. Naturally the car stalls, giving a small group of zombies enough time to sneak up to the vehicle (incredible). Doing the only thing that he can, Omega shows off his "cool" nun-chuck "skills", apparently trying to woo them into halting their attack. While he's doing this the girl makes the smart decision and ditches him. Unfortunately he manages to catch up and they continue on their journey until they hit a speed bump and their car detonates. This is when, in a shocking twist that will truly be remembered in the Hollywood hall of fame for distilling cinematography down to the perfect core, that one dude somehow smells them out and pulls up in his van. After trying to act tough again and flexing the zombies to death, there's a second and even more intense twist. The guy was actually bad! He then shoots Omega twenty or forty times (no blood is to be found) and grabs the girl to have an unholy threesome with the dead body from before (this actually happens).Omega swaps back and forth from being on the verge of death from his bullet wounds to being able to push a car out of the city. Somehow he stumbles across the van again and gives chase. Now in the gripping climax of the film Omega, miraculously at full strength, beats the bad guy, one dude, in a fight. Breathtaking. After this the movie just stops. Thank God. I'm actually amazed that not one person involved in this project did even a satisfactory job. The writing is uninspired, stale, and overall disturbing. The plot is bone-chillingly bad, the dialogue is woah, and even the credits managed to be flawed. The music sounds like it was composed in one afternoon by a guy randomly hitting at a keyboard. I genuinely believe that the editing was done by the director's 13 year. old nephew who can "do computers". The acting was truly mesmerizing, in the same way as a train accident. The only thing that didn't make me want to cry were the costumes which would get a hearty round of applause at a high school play. Unfortunately it seems this is where ALL of the budget went. Terrible effort.Sickening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martial artist MARK DACASCOS who never did become the "VANDAMME OF THE MID 90'S" as he was once poised to be by many film critics, stars as one of the few men left on an post apocalyptic earth, which naturally like in the other 32923532923 zombie films of it's type that has been made in the past five years, is over run by mutant zombies. Still haunted by the murders of both his wife &amp; son &amp; on the verge of going insane, Dacasco's character RENCHARD, receives contact from a lone survivor somewhere in the deserted city that is set to blow up within a matter of hours. He teams with two American soldiers, to infiltrate the city &amp; rescue the girl who's blood type can be used as a cure for preventing future generations from being transformed into zombies, should they ever get bitten or have the zombies blood on them which is how the virus is spread. However as Renchard soon finds out, the zombies are not the only thing that he should be watching out for...I AM OMEGA is yet another ASYLUM rip-off of better made, not to mention better financed Hollywood films, ripping the plot straight from RICHARD MATHESON'S I AM LEGEND &amp; OMEGA MAN, why ASYLUM hasn't had the pants sued right off them &amp; shut down by Hollywood bigwigs is unknown. Probably because one day in court with their high priced lawyers is more money than ASYLUM has ever had to spend on their rip-off's. Usually ASYLUM films are really bad, badly acted, cheap looking, poor special effects &amp; even horrible direction, &amp; a deadly dull story to put you right to sleep, however lately, at least with their past few releases this past year &amp; late last year, ASYLUM is actually starting to put a little bit more of a professional effort into their productions &amp; a little more money, such is the case with this low budget film. MARK DACASCOS does very good here &amp; is even able to show off his martial arts moves in many scenes, he also teams up with his KICKBOXER 5 co-star GEOFF MEED (Who also wrote the script) &amp; the film has surprisingly many moments of suspense &amp; better direction, not to mention production values than other ASYLUM released films. The zombie make-up is pretty cool &amp; the story moves at a fast pace &amp; is pretty interesting all the way through. Highly recommended to sci-fi/action/horror fans.***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's No Quiet Earth Obviously But It Had Some Pretty Good Qualities for An Asylum Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I am a sucker for the whole Last Man On Earth concept. How a person would deal with the loneliness and isolation has always appealed to me. Now needless to say if your looking for something deep and thought provoking I Am Omega shouldn't be at the top of your list. For that two more obscure films I recommend with the same concept are the excellent Quiet Earth starring the late Bruno Lawrence and the criminally unseen The Noah which was unreleased and hardly viewed for years.I Am Omega ranks among Asylum's better efforts which may not be saying much but with titles like Transmorphers and The Da Vinci Treasure it's become way too easy to dump on these guys. The truth is they have had some entertaining efforts in between the more ridiculous mockbusters but much like Uwe Boll the scorn on the internet has become so extreme that even the rare decent release is going to get slammed irregardless.The good points first- The zombies actually look great for the low budget. Some time and effort was put into them and it shows. Also Dacascos briefly get's to flex his acting chops early on in the film. I knew it wasn't to be but I would have liked to see more of Dacascos and his daily routine coping with the situation. Once the marines show up this film becomes more pedestrian. The fight choreography is solid for the budget and there was even a couple decent jump scenes although the film is never in any way scary or suspenseful.The bad- The budget hampers the film at several different points. One cool scene involving a dumpster and a grenade cuts away and the final explosion is pretty weak but it's forgivable with money obviously going elsewhere. I admired the effort being put into the Zombies. Where the film really suffers is with the supporting cast backing up Dacascos. Jennifer Lee Wiggins is lovely but comes off as being way to cheery for being in the middle of a Zombie apocalypse with most of humanity wiped out. The two marines particularly Geoff Meed were annoying as hell. Meed has a physical presence but cannot act his way out of a paper bag. It would have been better if he played it more straight as the comedy falls flat.All in all I enjoyed the film and if you enjoy the last man on earth premise and don't expect something the quality of a Quiet Earth you should enjoy it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I'm an Iron Chef fan. But to see "chairman" Mark Dacascos in a lead role in a movie for the first time was a revelation.After the initial shock of his presence in the film (I'd never seen him in anything but the food channel show) I quickly forgot about it and marvelled at his acting skill and martial arts wizardry. This guy is good, and deserves more attention.It will be pointed out ad nauseum that this movie is a deliberate pre-make of "I am Legend", but in my opinion at least, the movie itself, even ignoring budget constraints, is better than Legend in every respect.The few actors in the film carried their roles with equal aplomb, and Jennifer Lee Wiggens was positively excellent. The zombie effects and camera-work are super, the character development carefully controlled, and the entire ambiance of the film works. Sure, there are a few holes, but they can be cheerfully ignored.This is one of the half dozen best zombie movies I've seen. It's even better on subsequent viewings - to me the mark of a superior flick. Don't hesitate on this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible I Am Legend rip-off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am Omega is set in a post apocalyptic world which is now overrun by flesh eating zombies, only a small number of humans still exist including Renchard (Mark Dacascos) who lives out in the sticks on his own in total isolation. One night Renchard unexpectedly gets a video message from a woman named Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) who is naturally immune to the zombie virus &amp; her blood may lead to a cure for the virus. After a bit of persuasion Renchard agrees to travel to her &amp; save her in one last desperate effort to save the human race...Directed by Griff Furst this is a bottom of the barrel Asylum produced low, low budget 'mockbuster' rip-off of The Last Man on Earth (1964), The Omega Man (1971) &amp; the recent Will Smith Hollywood blockbuster I Am Legend (2007) with even it's title being a rather unfunny combination of The Omega Man &amp; I Am Legend. The script by Geoff Meed (who also stars in the thing as Vincent) is simply terrible thus proving his writing skills are as limited as his acting skills. OK so I Am Legend &amp; The Omega Man both had some sort of back-story, some reason why the Earth is overrun with zombies but here in I Am Omega no explanation is given at all. None. Zip. Nothing. The film starts with the Earth overrun with zombies &amp; we just have to accept it. Then there's no explanation as to why certain people still survive, OK so Brianna is immune but what about Renchard, Vincent &amp; Mike? Why are they still alive? What happened to all the other people on Earth? There's nowhere near enough zombies to account for them. Then there's some rubbishy subplot about blowing an entire city up with a few homemade bombs, to destroy an entire city would take a nuclear bomb not two or three homemade bombs strapped to sign posts! The plot is just awful, the first half of I Am Omega consists of nothing more than following Renchard around, while in I Am Legend there was enough of a budget for plenty of action here we gets scenes of him shaving, eating dinner &amp; driving around. There's also a touch of a George A. Romero zombie flick here, the zombies are all rotten flesh eaters &amp; can actually come out during the day. The set-pieces are poor, the dialogue is poor, the character's are poor &amp; the plot is one of the worst around. Why didn't it just rip-off the genetic experiment gone wrong explanation from I Am Legend? Most of the rest of the film is a straight unashamed rip-off anyway. Also why oh why did Renchard &amp; Brianna choose a convertible car with the top down while trying to flee hordes of flesh eating zombies? Wouldn't a car with a roof actually make a bit more sense? Frankly they deserved to get eaten. Also when a zombie got near Renchard's house a headache inducing alarm would sound which is OK but wouldn't a loud alarm just attract more zombies?Like a lot of modern films I Am Omega has a lot of it's colour bleached out &amp; certain scenes aren't too far away from being black and white. Why can't filmmakers just shot scenes 'as is', you know nice strong colour depth on proper 35mm film with grain the size of cannonballs. I fear those days are long gone unfortunately. There's nothing in the way of horror, the fight scenes are poor &amp; there's a CGI computer effect when Renchard's house blows up that looks so bad I think I could have done a better job on my home PC. The zombies are all on set prosthetic make-up effects rather than the CGI of I Am Legend, they look alright but with the camera shaking around all over the place we never get a good look at them &amp; they don't really do much apart from stand there &amp; create problems for the character's. Gore wise there's nothing here, there's a rotten skeleton, a few zombies &amp; a few bullet wounds.Filmed in California the film looks cheap, it feels cheap &amp; I found it pretty hard to sit through at times. The acting is poor, Dacascos is there for rent money while no-one else of any note appears.I Am Omega is one of the most blatant rip-offs ever, it's nowhere near as good as it's original sources &amp; is a pretty poor mess of a film all round. Some sort of plot &amp;/or explanation for whats going on might have been nice for a start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only seen a few of these Asylum direct-to-video ripoffs, so I can't definitively say that this is the absolute worst piece of garbage ever produced by that esteemed company. But, if it isn't, then I honestly can't imagine the film that would be considered worse than I Am Omega.The plot really isn't worth describing in any detail. Just take the rage zombies from 28 Days Later... and slap them into a decimated version of Omega Man and you've pretty much got the entire film. As slap-dash as the whole thing is, at least the crappy soundtrack helps obscure both the actors lack of talent and the scripts lack of anything resembling coherence.Not that this gawdawful turd's target market is looking for witty repartee, mind you. But even the action fanboy drool-cases who stumble upon this thing thinking they've found Lawrence's I Am Legend must feel vaguely cheated at the unique cheapness of this least-effort ripoff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair Adaptation (or Rip)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am Omega (2007)** (out of 4) The Asylum hits back with their own cash-in on Will Smith's I AM LEGEND. This adaptation of the Richard Matheson story features Mark Dacascos as Renchard, the last man on Earth who has had this title since an unknown thing happened which caused everyone to die (the cause is never made clear in the film). Thanks to the internet that is still working for some reason, Renchard manages to find out about a woman living nearby and she just happens to know where a colony of survivors is. First the two must destroy the zombie creatures that are stalking them. Anyone who knows anything about The Asylum knows that the company truly has turned out some of the worst movies in recent memory and it's rather shocking how good I AM OMEGA turned out. It's far from being a good movie and it's certainly not in the same league as the Smith version (or the Price and Heston ones) but at the same time it really does seem that the filmmaker's hearts were in the right place. For the most part the subject matter is taken very serious and we're given a pretty good look at someone who is all alone in the world. I thought the early scenes building up the situation of the lead character were handled very well and I thought that there was some nice atmosphere to be found as well. Another good thing were the actual monsters as they looked very good and I thought they made for great villains. They seem like a cross between your typical zombies and the monsters from THE ALLIGATOR PEOPLE but either way they look fine. The performances are decent but they're really not asked to do too much. The main problems with the film is that we've simply seen this story so many times before and nothing new is done with it here. I'd also say that some of the CGI gunshot wounds look very bad and at 90-minutes things start to drag towards the end. Still, I AM OMEGA is a masterpiece when you compare it to other films from the studio but this still remains only for those interested in seeing every version of the original story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalyptic cash-in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The production company The Asylum are garnering quite the reputation cashing in on big budget movies with similarly titled, similarly themed B-movies. And here's another. After Transmorphers and The Da Vinci Treasure we have I Am Omega, an amalgamation of The Omega Man and I Am Legend, which can be thought of as the less well heeled older sibling to the Will Smith mega-hit. So is it any good? Well, the first half of the movie is actually remarkably effective, as Mark Dacascos' Renchard (not Robert Neville as in both book and reputable movies) lives in isolation in the ruined city, fending off mutants as he strives to survive all the while, apparently, losing his mind a piece at a time. He has an objective though. He plants some bombs to detonate in several hours, just enough time for him to get out of the city (and go where?) when, suddenly, he receives a video call from a fellow survivor. But can he get to her before the bombs go off? It's when he leaves the confines of his shelter and meets up with the two hard-boiled marine sorts that things start to go wrong. Clearly nowhere near as good as I Am Legend, but here's the question you have to ask yourself: Is it 400 times worse than the Smith movie? Is it? Well, is it? Thought not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tough and resourceful Renchard (a sturdy and credible portrayal by Mark Dacascos) has managed to survive a deadly plague that has turned most of the population into dangerous mutant zombies. Director Griff Furst, working from a tight and absorbing script by Geoff Meed, relates the engrossing story at a brisk pace, maintains a dark, grim, and serious tone throughout, makes fine use of desolate backwoods locations, delivers a handy helping of bloody violence, and stages the action with real flair and skill. Decascos makes for a strong and believable protagonist as he struggles to keep his sanity, vigorously mixes it up with the ghouls, and uses a gun, a machete, and his own bare hands to take out the fiends. Moreover, there are sound supporting performances by the gorgeous Jennifer Lee Wiggins as the spunky Brianna, Meed as happy-go-lucky redneck Vincent, and Ryan Lloyd as Vincent's laconic partner Mike. The rot-faced zombies are truly grotesque and frightening. The last third with Renchard rescuing Brianna from a zombie-infested city is extremely tense, gripping, and exciting. Alexander Yellen's sharp cinematography gives the picture an effectively bleak sun-bleached look. David Raiklen's rattling ominous score hits the rousing spot. A worthwhile movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dacascos enters The Asylum and shows that he's no legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fans of Richard Matheson's work, the seminal "I Am Legend", this movie is yet another adaptation . . . . . . and one to be avoided by all but the most undiscerning viewers.Mark Dacascos stars as the (last?) man left to stand against the zombies/infected who have managed to overrun the planet. There is no explanation of the outbreak and, unlike in other versions, no vampiric connotations as these bad boys don't keep themselves out of sight during daylight hours.From Asylum (the masters of the rip-off/cash-in and responsible for the risible Snakes On A Train) we get, unsurprisingly, yet another cheap, uninvolving, inferior version of a major release (by which I mean The Omega Man and not the even worse I Am Legend). Dacascos is actually very good in the lead role though he's hampered with a script riddled with plot holes and illogicality. He gets a few scenes in which to show off his physical prowess but, sadly, the majority of the film is a slow, ponderous look at a man trying to keep himself sane in a world gone mad. Yes, I know how cheesy that sounds.Director Griff Furst shows some talent, hidden deep deep deep down amongst the dross, but spends most of the movie fluffing any chance to provide something genuinely enjoyable, showcasing some variable special effects and not managing to cover up the numerous flaws that are glaringly obvious. It's hard to muck up this badly with such great source material but Furst almost manages it, saving the movie from a lower rating thanks to some decent gory deaths and a few moments of half-decent action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***There may be spoilers*** Movies like this just leave me speechless. They start off with so much promise, and then they just blow it. They work hard in their active search for self-destruction. Dacascas is the last man on Earth, well, no he's not. There's others. And Dacascas slowly goes insane he gets a e-mail from the desperate Wiggins looking to get rescued. He turns her down only to be forced by two psycho soldiers to go help her. I wouldn't go to my own execution with these two annoying scuzzballs, but Dacascas has no choice and we're off to the races. Even the novel was low budget with little in the way of FX, so you would think that a good no-budget movie could be made from this. They almost did it. Dacascas does his best, and Wiggins is certainly cute and does her best. The rest don't even try, the zombies emote more, and they look ripped off from a bad Italian zombie flick. The first half or so is a fairly decent modern adaptation of the Matheson novel, but after that it's just awful, and the ending doesn't come close to the novel's, leaving itself open for a possible sequel, as about the halfway mark the "last man" is really "the last woman". One of the problems is that the filmmakers constantly have Dacascas do stupid things. Like turning his back on a pair of killers, using a convertible (?) to plow through a bunch of zombies, etc. The acting is terrible, the pacing jerky, and the movie lacks logic, I mean, we have burrowing zombies (?). As I said the first half has promise, but if you have to go to the bathroom after that, just stay there until the movie ends and you'll be better off. Here's hoping that Matheson at least got royalties for this.</fullReview>

All the 'dialogue' came out forced, clichéd, and seemingly designed with the express intent of making the viewer hate the cast. In addition, there was absolutely no creativity shown as far as the telling of what was originally a great story. The whole plot followed the textbook framework a high school A/V student would be expected to write within.In point of fact, I found it so disappointing, I actually started up an IMDb account just to get my frustration out for this sole movie!

		<fullReview>I'm sorry but I quite liked this film. First of all, Dacassos really gives a great and very intense performance as the lone survivor of a plague. To me Dacassos is more believable than Smith in the big budget version. What I think Furst did better than any film version of Matheson's novel is in the first 30 minutes to play with the concept of what is real and what is imagination. Admitedly, he sometimes aklmost lifted dialogue verbatim from the Omega Man but then again look at what Danny Boyle did in 28 Days Later. There obviously are budgetary restraints but within that framework Furst works pretty effectively. There are some really great shots and visually as well as in terms of the timing and drmaturgy I think the film is actually well made. You have to bear in mind that the problem with most b or rather c films is that they are simply downright boring and that's something that never happens in this film. So when I'm giving 8 / 10, I'm not comparing this to Citizen Kane but within the framework of what the Furst sets out to do he actually succeeds.</fullReview>

The title I Am Omega is an amalgamation of I Am Legend &amp; The Omega Man, the Charlton Heston film based on I Am Legend. I Am Omega itself is Asylum's mockbuster on the Will Smith big budget film of I Am Legend. The atmosphere of I Am Omega is well played out and Mark Dacascos makes for a very good lead for what was believed the last man alive on Earth. For an Asylum film, I Am Omega is pretty good way above par with other Asylum films. Also Jennifer Lee Wiggins is very good as I Am Omega's only female cast member and a pretty one at that too. Both she and Dacascos carried the film above the quality that is expected of Asylum movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that is saying a lot, as the rest of what I've seen(which is a good twenty plus so far) have been utter rubbish. By all means it is not perfect, starting with a first thirty minutes that drags far too much consequently everything takes too long to get going and ending with a rather dumb finale. The music also could've been less generic, and I wish I could have learned more about the characters in general. However, while they aren't going to win many awards the photography is decent, likewise with the effects and there is some atmospheric scenery. The script may have some moments of repetitiveness but is amusing yet serious on the whole(for The Asylum that is an achievement), and while derivative the story does have some suspenseful moments, some exciting action and the hilarious zombie in the dumpster sequence. The acting is not bad either, Mark Dracascos is actually very good in a role that has allowed him to do much more with what he's got. All in all, surprisingly decent, and by far the best of The Asylum movies I've seen so far. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Asylum, for those of you who are not in the know, is an independent movie company that makes ultra low budget rip-offs of big Hollywood movies. Some of their movies include "Snakes On A Train", "Transmorphers", and "Allan Quatermain And The Temple Of Skulls". So you've probably guessed that this effort of theirs is a rip-off of the Will Smith movie "I Am Legend". I only got it because I just had to pay $1.25 for it, and even then I felt like I was ripped off when I watched it. Fans of Dacasco will be sorely disappointed by the fact he does very little of what could be considered martial arts. Even those who haven't seen any of his other movies will find plenty more to be disappointed by. In the first 30 minutes of the movie, just about nothing of consequence happens. And it's not until the 45 minute mark that any attempts at serious action happen. And the action is not very well done - most of it is just simple and quick shooting of zombies, while the more elaborate action scenes being so dark and poorly directed you'll often wonder just what's going on. The darkness and technical shoddiness make it hard to read or hear some things. And the movie is full of stupidities like electricity and Internet access available after months of not being maintained by authorities, tires shrieking on dirt roads, a hero who wears boots while sleeping in bed, and a lot more. This stuff may sound amusing, but trust me, these things aren't aggressively bad to be considered so-bad-it's-good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The production values on this title, given the obvious low budget, were surprisingly good. But what lets this film down is the completely run-of-the-mill paint-by-numbers script. The individuals behind it had all the tools they needed to make a somewhat interesting film, but just didn't bother with an imaginative/solid story.Worse still, the outcome is actually generally dull as well as unimaginative... So what we end up with is not a mediocre, poorly written film, but a boring and dull, mediocre, poorly written film.It's frustrating to think that a chance was lost here to make a watchable film because of the lack of some decent forethought at the scripting stage. One has to wonder if the producers were too busy calculating projected cash-in revenue (in making a film on the coat-tail of 'I Am Legend') instead of actually thinking what it should be about.</fullReview>

The rest of the cast is pretty lousy, and the direction is a joke. Try to picture Michael Bay without funds for CGI explosions and car chases. There are some poorly choreographed fights, and lots of blood and guts to go round, but little story. There's a plague that--oh never mind, anyone who has seen any "plague wipes out all but a few people" stories will know the lines before the actors do. Zombies or mutants or ghouls, whatever they are, keep on coming (even out of trash dumpsters lol). The film even has the nerve to use 360 degree rotating shots and lots of close-ups of people sweating. If that's the best this director can do, he should fill out an application at a fast-food joint.Still, when viewed as cinematic bubble-gum, this flick can amuse.

The zombie pushing a dumpster was unusual, which made me think 'Why?',and paid off after a forced viewing because I paid to rent this movie! The cover shows A Man standing on a Truck amidst a city full of zombies, I never saw that in the movie! Zombies were terrible, acting was fair, plot was followable. And the ending when the bombs blew up the city, now that was a 4th of July, backyard firecracker scene if I ever saw one! Some movies are so bad they're good, but this is so bad its useless. Please save your money for a better movie if you know of one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The planet's sole surviver.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Futuristic yarn about a lethal plague killing or mutating every living and breathing human on Earth. Renchard(Mark Dacascos)believes he's the only person left to battle with horrific mutants taking control of the planet. He receives a plea for help from a young woman named Brianna(Jennifer Wiggins), who reminds him of his dead wife. Two ex-marines arrive at Renchaard's home and forcefully has him help them find the same Brianna, because they believe she may be the key to an anti-virus. A hell of a lot of martial arts; Dacascos has only appeared in several dozen martial arts movies. And yes, since 2005, you may have noticed him on the Food Network playing the part of the Chairman on the series Iron Chef America. Also in the cast: Ryan Lloyd, Gregory P. Smith and Geoff Mead, the movie's writer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am Awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a low budget look &amp; a no name cast, I'll be honest that I didn't expect much from this film. It's a rip-off of The Omega Man and thats MUCH better.An odd start where a boy sees his mother killed, its hard to know if the guy rescues him or he becomes the guy we see later. Either way that guy (Richard) is haunted by ghosts of the dead and some monsters (the infected) seem to roam the Earth. There's no back story there, it just happened. Richard seems to go about his day filled with paranoia waiting for something to jump out at him &amp; attack. His experience with the infected after the rabbit was a bad idea, Never show your monsters in broad daylight unless it's a killer make-up job. Which this wasn't.Why he was planting explosives on a natural gas line also goes unexplained until much later, he's going to blow up the local city to wipe out a nest of the infected. (you think he'd want to keep infrastructure working for when civilisation restarts?). I'm guessing the makers were aiming at the Survival Horror genre here (like Resident Evil) and missed by a mile, mainly due to the low budget look and poor fight sequences/gore effects.Richard is clearly a man bothered by hallucinations (the clock, the computer emails) and doesn't have much to do to fill his time but we get to watch him doing nothing. Quite a lot of nothing in fact. Which is very dull.Finally getting a message over his computer from someone who appears to not be infected (Rihanna) he decides not to help (she tells him about Antioch and sees he's not infected). He goes to set another bomb on the pipeline and is attacked, getting blood on him and ends up chasing another hallucination (btw, continuity goof with the blood on his hair). The following day 2 dudes turn up from Antioch asking if he wants to help them rescue the girl. They tell him she's got the anti-virus in her blood to interest him. He turns them down so they blow up his house with a rocket launcher (that's supposed to be an incentive?).Anyway Vincent (the lead Antioch guy) gets attacked (and possibly bitten/infected?) and they head off to find Rihanna after a brief and very crap fight sequence that was over done and not required. We get an insight into the sewers and why their free of infected but guns can't be used there and they set off to &amp; through the sewer.Obviously their attacked and use guns (so the infected clearly don't have problems in the sewers like we were told or they forgot that info really quickly?) and Micheal (the other Antioch guy) is killed.After a brief overland dash on his own (he left Vincent in the sewer) Richard reaches Rihanna's position (she's not sat waiting for him? What gives?). After the rescue they both run across the city (Oxnard, it said so on the dumpster!) and we have their attempt to find a stick shift (manual gearbox to the non Americans) car which they don't do anyway. We also get some background history on Rihanna.Of course the car stalls as they reverse, allowing some infected to get close and for Richard to go Postal on them. She takes off without him leaving him in what seems like certain death until she saves him. Oh, and clearly there was no budget for a stuntman to be run over, the dummy was a very weak effect there.Even though she's been told to drive fast they seem to cruise at about 2 miles an hour so we can ride along as they converse, but they still manage to crash over a very small earth ramp leaving them 4 hours to escape the city on foot to get away from the gas explosion. He ends up fireman carrying her (and she's obviously injured from the way she's crying and moaning over his shoulder).Fortunately Vincent arrives to ferry them away and she's put in the back of the van with Micheals dead body. The unarmed fight sequence here was pointless and unnecessary as they were supposed to be very short on time. Vincent shoots Richard 3 or 4 times in the legs &amp; chest then reveals he &amp; Micheal weren't from Antioch (no surprise) and has his little diatribe about how he doesn't want a cure because it'll mean going back to a bad old life because he's an Alpha Dog in this one.Vincent leaves with Rihanna and lets Richard live because of his soldiers code. When I saw Richard pushing a car (twice!) I had to laugh (he's been shot and could barely walk hours ago!). I also couldn't decide if from his colour we were supposed to infer he was dying or was in the early stages of infection? Now I started to find myself questioning Vincent's motives.If he wanted Rihanna dead, why bother going to get Richard to help rescue her? They knew about the bombs, she'd have died without their help or assistance. That was answered when he decides to rape her before killing her. Richard's fight with Vincent has got to be one of THE most pointless things in the film. He's supposed to have been shot several times, almost mortally wounded! He'd be in no state to fight.A fight which he of course wins and kills Vincent (no soldiers code from Richard then?). Of course they escape the huge (and very crap) explosion and apart from an awful and pointless attempt at a scare we're left with a very weak ending to a generally weak and awful film.Never trust anything where the screen writer casts themselves in the 2nd biggest role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I AM OMEGA Theasylum.cc Starring Mark Dacascos Written by Geoff Meed Directed by Griff Furst Its GREAT to have Mark D. in a Theasylum pic.This rendition has a new edge and Yet pays tribute to Charleton Heston and his version from the '70's.Mark's character has been by himself since the zombies took over the open areas of Metro. Humans re-emerge in the shape of vigilantes and a girl with the cure.Mark has a plan to sanitize Metro with multiple bombs,Gives film a urgency. This film doesn't seem like most from Griff Furst,It's a major step in a good way. Geoff Meed who also wrote the script has some great moments on screen, Duh ! Jennifer Lee Wiggins is the only female in cast and doesn't get to kick much zombie butt, But has emotions run gamut?that the boys struggle on screen for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The supermarket "value" version of I Am Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes folks, with Will smith's big actioner due out soon, it was perhaps inevitable that some pokey little production house would throw up (in the vomitous sense) a feeble version of it in order to try to rake in some easy bucks.I am Omega wears its title without any apparent shame at the implied plagiarism. Charlton Heston's The Omega Man and the aforementioned I Am Legend are mercilessly hacked together to form the title of this movie. No doubt the target audience was deemed too dim to realise what the film was about unless such blatant cut-and-shut naming was employed.So is the movie, despite its awful title, any good? In a word.....no.It suffers from a deplorable excess of taking itself too seriously which, by turns, frustrates and annoys the viewer. There is altogether too much time spent "exploring" the lead character's neuroses. Nothing is explained adequately and to say the first half hour drags would be like saying molten lead might hurt if you drank it.Key plot points, such as Renchard's desire to destroy the city, are followed, but no reason is given as to why he wants to do this. Likewise, the "bad guys" want ultimately to dispose of the woman who is immune to the zombie virus (tm). To do this the best way they come up with is to get her out of the city then kill her. The city which they know is going to be blown up by Renchard. So why not just leave her there to die in the fireball? The level of acting is about what you'd expect from this level of production, which is to say, bearable for the most part. The script, as mentioned, is full of holes you could drive an earth-mover through. Special effects are rather lacking though the zombie make-up isn't too badly done.Overall, this is , as I mentioned in the summary, the cheap "own brand" version of the better product. The Omega Man is far more interesting than this effort and I'm sure I Am Legend won't disappoint either. In fact, I'd rather watch the I Am Legend trailer repeatedly for an hour and a half than be forced to watch I am Omega again.In short then, don't bother with this one, it really isn't worth the effort.</fullReview>
