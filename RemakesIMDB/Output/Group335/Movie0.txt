		<shortDescription>Vincent Price is Legend!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why this film is as underrated as it is. This is an amazing, depressing and in many ways brilliant film based on the Richard Matheson classic novel "I Am Legend". Vincent Price effectively conveys the terror and despair of being the last living man on an Earth that is now overrun with vampires and/or zombies. The depiction of Price's day to day bleak existence is a moving and powerful thing to behold and the continual menace of the hordes of zombies is creepy in the same way as was later depicted in "Night of the Living Dead". In fact, as noted by others here, one can not watch the scenes where the zombies lay siege to Price's boarded up house and attack his car without recognizing how close these scenes would later be copied by George Romero in his classic zombie films. If you are a fan of horror film history or just looking for a classic and unique film with an interesting story, track down this lost gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under-appreciated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one seems to be less well known than others in Vincent Price's filmography -- possibly because the title makes it sound more like a romantic comedy.In this first filmed version of Richard Matheson's superb short novel "I Am Legend", though, Price really shines in one of the best performances of his career. Far superior to its 1971 remake "The Omega Man" -- as if we needed yet another "Charlton Heston vs. the subhuman hordes" outing after "Khartoum" and "55 Days In Peking" -- the script follows Matheson's book almost scene-for-scene, but then, I think the author always wrote with one eye on the movie or TV rights.Morgan (Vincent Price) is the only survivor of a worldwide plague that kills its victims, only to resurrect them as zombie vampires. (His own immunity was conferred by the bite of a vampire bat infected with a weaker version of the virus, when he was doing research in South America.) By day, he systematically searches out the plague victims and destroys them in the traditional Van Helsing manner, retreating to his fortified house when darkness falls and the vampires come out to play. Worst of all, his best friend Ben -- now a vampire -- is part of the crowd that nightly besieges his house, thirsting for his blood.Unlike "The Omega Man", very little of this film is devoted to Morgan's one-man war against the vampires, who as others have noted have a kind of "Night Of The Living Dead" ambiance, minus the gore. Instead it focuses on his utter isolation, both physical and spiritual, his mission as an exterminating angel the only purpose now left to his life.A large part of the movie is taken up by a flashback to three years previous, to the beginning of the plague, as his friend Ben arrives at a birthday party for Morgan's daughter bearing an armful of presents. Against the background of the children's shouts and laughter the adults worriedly discuss the appearance of a new virus. The world then proceeds to fall apart in a quietly terrifying re-enactment of the Black Death, complete with National Guard "bring out your dead" units and a 24/7 immolation pit for the anonymous, canvas-wrapped corpses. Morgan's wife and daughter succumb to the virus in a sequence that is quite stunning in its low-key, almost clinical lack of the standard histrionics. The black-and-white cinematography is as stark and minimalistic as the story (and, admittedly, the budget). The exterior scenes set in a deserted Los Angeles -- well, actually Rome, shot in the early morning -- are often quite effective in mirroring his internal desolation. Cast and crew alike do an excellent job with the material, despite the monetary constraints. Unlike so many in our current "bash you over the head" school of film-making, the real horror of the situation is allowed to speak eloquently for itself.If you're expecting the high camp of one of Price's Roger Corman flicks, you'll probably be bored stiff by this movie. If instead you're looking for a surprisingly good adaptation of a great story, you can't do much better than "Last Man On Earth".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I am the last...man."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Man on Earth is a great film to watch alone. Horror veteran Vincent Price plays Dr. Robert Morgan, a desperate and lonely man who's left alone in an apocalyptic world; A world ruled by zombie-like vampires as a result of a widespread plague. These vampire zombies are highly reminiscent of George Romero's walking dead in Night of the Living Dead. Price does a remarkable job interacting with practically nothing. He's alone throughout the majority of the film. His performance largely carries this low budgeter. When you watch the movie alone, you really feel where his character is coming from and a sense of hopelessness is established. The Last Man on Earth is really a thought-provoking, creepy classic. I recommend it be watched with Charlton Heston's The Omega Man to see another take on the same story (both were based on Richard Matheson's "I Am Legend").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film! The apocalypse rarely felt this real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never read Richard Matheson's novel 'I am Legend' but I'm particularly intrigued by (science fiction) movies with an apocalyptic theme. And this adaptation simply is one of the most fascinating stories of an already brilliant decade for this type of films. Much more than a grim horror film, this is a gripping drama with an excellent (as always) Vincent Price as the sole and devastated survivor of a deadly plague that exterminated the entire human race, including his own wife and daughter. Price is Dr. Robert Morgan and due to his immunity to the lethal germs, he's the only one to fight victims who return in the shape of vampire/zombie-like creatures. Even though it has already been 3 years, Morgan desperately continues his search for other survivors?This is one of the most impressive performances Price ever gave away, and a lot more difficult than his usual roles of villains and madmen. Judging by today's standards, I guess the film looks very dated and you can't really refer to the tame 'vamp-zombies' as threatening anymore. But the empty streets and depressing cities, shot in unsettling black and white, still are the ultimate in eeriness! I love it when a film makes you feel miserable and worried?and the lower the budget is, the more efficient this effect is reached! Like several of my fellow-reviewers already pointed out, this also was an immensely influential film. You can't watch 'Last man on Earth' without being reminded of George A. Romero's milestone genre film 'Night of the Living Dead'. If you then realize this movie was made 4 years before Romero's classic, you can't but reckon the underrated brilliance of this film. The same hopelessness-aspect that made Romero's film so tense features HERE first, in 'Last Man on Earth'! This production offers an ideal proportion of frights and sentiments, luckily without too many tedious scientific speeches or faked drama. 'Last Man on Earth' has to be seen by every SF/horror fan on this planet. For some reason this is one of the most underrated genre efforts ever, and that urgently has to change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Matheson's seminal sci-fi horror novel, "I Am Legend", published in 1954, is first and foremost, a character study, and any film producer must come to terms with that, if there is to be a successful adaptation from print to screen. The novel was adapted to screen in 1964 as "The Last Man On Earth"; producer Sidney Salkow, hampered by a tiny budget, intuitively did the best he could and came close to pulling it off! What Salkow did was convey the novel's mood, tone, atmosphere and plot in primitive fashion, crudely capturing the gist of the novel - that of one man, Robert Neville's confrontation with a horrendous existential dilemma - to be, himself, that is; or not to be, a plague- induced vampiric shell. While "TLMOE" was not entirely successful in translation, especially in the ending - co-scripter Matheson ultimately distanced himself from the final product - it nevertheless, clearly outshines a later, technically superior 1971 remake, "The Omega Man" in the aforementioned aspects. "The Omega Man", taken on it's own, is an interesting, entertaining film; but when referenced against the novel, falls flat on it's face. (Matheson himself stated that that film and his novel are two completely different animals.) In contrast, "TLMOE" fares much better when referenced: it shows that Morgan's (Neville's) battle is more with reactions within himself than with the vampires as a physical threat per se, as it becomes obvious that the vampires are slow-moving, dull-minded individually, and disorganized as a group, each instinctively and savagely interested only in HIS blood. Besides the perpetually nightmarish nuisance of the vampires, who have a collectively demoralizing effect on him, Morgan (Neville) must fight against the horror generated by the desolation and doom of a post-apocalyptic world, against the loneliness of being the last human on earth and against the agony of tragically losing his wife and daughter to the plague. In the final analysis, "The Last Man On Earth" could be likened to a series of crude, but brilliant brush-strokes of feeling-tones. As such it fully deserves cult-classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price gets apocalyptic in this extraordinary zombie flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made four years before Night of the Living Dead, The Last Man on Earth tells a very similar story. Based on Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend", the film tells the tale of a terrible plague that has wiped out all of mankind and replaced them with vampire-zombie like creatures. Well, it's almost wiped mankind out - one man, Vincent Price, still remains. Now that he has inherited the Earth, the last surviving human has to hunt these creatures by day and then hole up in his house during the night. Vincent Price says most of dialogue in voice over, which gives this apocalyptic horror film a great element of pessimism, which is essential in order for the film to work. The way that Price reads his lines is done in such a way that it seems he has simply given up all hope, and this helps the tragic element of the movie, which is this film's main backbone. The dreary black and white cinematography helps this element of the film also, as it adds the degree of hopelessness and pessimism, which this story thrives on.Quite how this film has reached the ripe old age of forty and still not garnered the praise and respect it deserves is beyond me. While Night of the Living Dead deserves the praise for 'really' creating the zombie movie that we all now know and love, this film got the theme first, and thus deserves it's place in the annals of film history. The story, even without the horror of the zombie creatures, still makes for fascinating food for thought. The idea of being left all alone on the Earth is simultaneously fascinating and horrifying, and by showing us the things that the protagonist has do every day to ward off the vampires (mirrors and garlic on the doors, hunting them by day), along with such quotes as "another day to live through" show the true horror of the idea behind the film. Of course, Vincent Price is one of the greatest actors of all time and his presence in the movie is easily one of the highlights. Price's great screen presence helps to offset the obvious low budget of the film and even during the slower moments, The Last Man on Earth still ensures that we are interested in what's going on, just by the fact that Price is there. On the whole, this is an extraordinarily brilliant film and one that deserves your viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening and Dark View of the Fate of Mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a plague devastates life on Earth, the population dies or becomes a sort of zombie living in the dark. Dr. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) is the unique healthy survivor on the planet, having a routine life for his own survival: he kills the night creatures along the day and maintains the safety of his house, to be protected along the night. He misses his beloved wife and daughter, consumed by the outbreak, and he fights against his loneliness to maintain mentally sane. When Dr. Morgan finds the contaminated Ruth Collins (Franca Bettoia), he learns that there are other survivors. He uses his blood to heal Ruth and he becomes the last hope on Earth to help the other contaminated survivors. But the order of this new society is scary."The Last Man on Earth" is a frightening and dark view of the fate of mankind. In those years, the preoccupation with radiation and biological weapons due to the cold war leaded people to this type of fear and preoccupation; later with AIDS; and presently with the disease in chickens. Fortunately science has developed means to cure or at least avoid epidemic situation, but we do not know how far we might be from such sad end of mankind. Vincent Price has a great performance in this movie, particularly in the beginning of the insanity of his character showed when he sees a photo of his family. The screenplay is very well developed, but the violent conclusion is weird. I always thought that George A. Romero was the creator of the "zombies", because of his excellent 1968 "Night of Living Dead". But now I can see that the origin of these creatures was in "The Last Man on Earth".When I was a teenager, the remake "The Omega Man" was a very successful film in the movie theaters. I had not had the chance to see the original movie, since "The Last Man on Earth" (and "The Omega Man") had not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil. Fortunately a minor Brazilian distributor has just released "The Last Man on Earth" on DVD, giving me the chance to see this great unknown movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Mortos Que Matam" (Dead That Kill")Obs: On 25 May 2008, I watched this great classic movie again.On 15 March 2014, I saw this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent early post-apocalyptic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Man on Earth" is an early example of how fantastic, even on a minimal budget, a movie set in a post-apocalyptic world can be. This movie starts with Morgan (Vincent Price) waking up to another day of being the lone survivor of a vicious worldwide plague...disposing of bodies, stocking up on mirrors and garlic, crying over his lost loved ones, and battling the undead. There are lots of silly parts in this movie...but there are also lots of really cool innovative aspects. And talking zombie-vampires?! "The Last Man on Earth" is a nifty precursor to the Romero trilogy. The movie tends to drag after the first 15 minutes or so, but it really picks up from the middle on. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys apocalypse movies and zombie movies. My Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems like a great film ...but for all the wrong reasons?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film, and definitely associate it with my childhood, via the inside cover of an old issue of Famous Monsters that pictured a vampire arm groping around the door for Vincent Price. I gazed at that photo as the magazine wore out, for years before I actually got to see the film.Vincent Price is always good to see. But as he is not a terribly physical actor, he looks awkward doing some of the things he is called on to do here, like dragging a body to the edge of a pit and heaving it in, pounding a stake into a vampire heart, or hurling a mirror across the room in disgust and despair. Not standing about with cocktail in hand, dressed to the nines and oozing wicked sophistication, he looks about as out of place as Cary Grant would setting a trash can out at the curb.I ask, in the title of this review, if we like this film "for all the wrong reasons" because, inescapably, I find it pitched at a sort of self-pity, tapping into the allure of images of yourself alone at the center of the human universe, of satisfied contemplation of the stupid folly of Man the Scientist, the Politician, the Warrior, that will bring the end of his own species. --In a word, it seems to inhabit a place that is the near-exclusive province of the truly isolated, disaffected and fantasy-prone adolescent. Being aware of this demographic skew doesn't invalidate the real and strong emotional place the film creates and enables anybody else to inhabit. But I do wonder about the effusive, near-idolatrous over-analysis this film has been known to elicit. I think it would be a pity if, through the growing cult of this film, we come to be less moved by horror --the whole precept on which Matheson's novel and the film are based-- than seduced by the film's image of post-apocalyptic solitude, which can lapse into full-blown gloating misanthropy with just a slight nudge.I find Last Man oppressively tragic and sobering and depressing-- and always, always utterly absorbing. Even tenth time watched, it feels like you are watching your own funeral, listening to nothing less than taps being sounded for your own species. This is, not to be too glib, the films greatest strength AND weakness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why haven't I heard about this film. Matheson's "I am legend" comes to life in this truly scary film. I have never wanted such small bits of happiness to occur in my life. I found myself cheering for a wormy poodle for damn's sake, that is how much this movie has gotten to me. Price once again shows he belongs with the masters. Everybody is comparing this to NOTLD and Omega man. This movie is in a separate league, even if based of the same story. The latter 2 go for the 30 second attention span of todays movie watchers, while Last Man gets you really thinking about how to go on if you were the last man, looking for simple joys such as watching home movies, and finding frustration to the point where you can't help but laugh to keep from crying.Not that this movie is not without faults. Apparently once you become infected you lose all body mass and a person can tuck a full grown man under his arm and throw him into a station wagon. Also the infected citizens could have been a little more convincing. I realize this is a spaghetti horror film but come on, it is easy to see how Price can sleep at nights. Finally as with most movies like this they apparently were running out of film so somebody hollered " wrap it up" and plop - there is the ending - ruining an expertly filmed first 2/3 of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Film Version of "I Am Legend"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) is the last man on earth. After everyone else dies off from a weird vampire virus (or becomes a weird vampire), he is left as the only human to try and stop the vampire menace. Little does he know there might be other survivors.Based on the story "I Am Legend" by Richard Matheson ("What Dreams May Come", "Stir of Echoes"), this film really nails the story. Some liberties are taken (as is true with any film), and for some reason the main character is Robert Morgan rather than Robert Neville, but that is a trifle.Vincent Price has always been consistently a great actor, particularly in horror and science fiction. This role is no exception. Although half of the film relies on voice-overs rather than dialog (because who is Robert going to talk to?), his chilling tone fills the air with a mood that only Vincent Price can master. (Ask yourself: who else has such a voice that its very tone can carry a picture? I mean, look at the "Thriller" music video.)I first watched this on the very cheap Treeline copy of the DVD, but despite the inferior picture and sound (the MGM "Special Edition" copies are crisp and a must-own), you just know this is a solid film. The plot is good, the order the story is told -- non-linear -- works very well for exposing the situation and background, even pulling off a flashback of nearly a half hour. All questions are answered, or at least attempted -- food, gasoline, the source of the vampire plague. It all seems to have a good and reasonable explanation.It seems natural to want to compare this to "Omega Man", the 1970s remake with Charlton Heston. And one can make that comparison, but they are almost two entirely different films. The basic premise is the same -- one lone man who can cure the vampire plague -- but that is about it. The entire feel is different, and the cult/vampire situation is similar but notably different at the same time (with the 1960s cult coming across more like zombies than vampires, really).This is a film you have to see. All horror fans must see this, especially if they plan to see the 2007 remake with Will Smith (which I was not looking forward to but was actually alright). And especially if you love George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead", which is directly influenced by this. But even film fans in general might enjoy this, as I think the story here is quite pleasing, even if you do not care for horror. Vincent Price and Giacomo Rossi-Stuart can do no wrong (especially when they are working with Richard Matheson's material -- the Poe adaptations are all pure gold). Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Price's best performance helps ensure that this "Legend" is still tops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never read I Am Legend, the Richard Matheson novel on which this handsome black and white 'scope production is based, but I did see Omega Man, the 1971 Charlton Heston vehicle, quite a few years back and it left an impression on me. With the new Will Smith film showing up theatrically soon and this Vincent Price-starring version newly available at my local store, what better time than now? Watching this as I did out of some odd sense of "duty" then, I was quite pleasantly surprised. Price almost never lets me down, and he doesn't here, but what is really neat about the film is the great sense of bleakness and desolation that it conveys; few low-budget SF films from any era I that I can think of look handsomer in their depictions of a post-apocalyptic world. I also really like the way the film opens in mid-story, with Price alone guarding his house from night-preying zombies, leading a tedious life of continuously preparing for the next day, and hoping against hope to contact someone on his radio. As the story unfolds, we find out that a worldwide plague erupted in Europe just three years ago, and despite the best efforts of many scientists (Price included) the world died. Except for Price, and apparently a few others as the plot heats up in the last act.Great location photography in some suburban Italian location that really does double quite well for a faceless LA in most cases, nice music and an ending that is nearly perfect, excepting perhaps the last lines of the woman who had tricked Price to his death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie Displaying A Lost Art in Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's copyright has expired and it can be downloaded from several places around the internet legally, so I recently picked it up. I am a fan of post-apocalyptic movies, but I believe anyone who has a decent attention span will appreciate this flick, as my girlfriend did who is not necessarily into these types of films.The plot is just as the title states, Vincent Price is the last man left on Earth (as far as he knows). A plague wiped out the planet and he is left to make a life out of what is left behind. The first half of this movie is entirely spent building up the character Price plays while the second half is spent moving through the main plot of the film. This is what I refer to in my summary..the cinematography..the fact that five minutes can go by without a piece of dialog and still captivate you is something lost in todays films. Whereas today's movies do more hand holding of the viewer, this film leaves your mind to wander and fantasize. That is what does it for me and probably many people. It is a soulful movie filled with thought. Price's character finds a place of piety in the viewer's heart and you pull for him throughout.I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something in the genre of just interested in seeing a different style of film making from a bygone era. Time well spent with this one folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They are coming to get you Morgan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Price stars as Dr. Robert Morgan, the apparent sole survivor on Earth after a lethal virus has wiped out mankind. His only company is a plague of vampire like zombies thirsting for his blood each and every night. Tiring of the constant fights and desperate in his loneliness, Morgan is at the end of his tether, until...The source story from which this film is adapted, "I Am Legend" written by Richard Matheson, is rightly or wrongly considered to be something of a sci-fi classic. This explains why in three different decades the film has been adapted to the big screen. Following on from this first attempt we have been offered up The Omega Man in 1971 and I Am Legend in 2007, all three big screen outings are of differing quality and separated by their respective approaches to the subject.The Last Man On Earth is to me the best of the three films to date. Having horror legend Vincent Price play the main character automatically lends people to think that this picture is primarily a horror film. Something that may explain why it's been largely ignored outside of those who have a penchant for Matheson and Price's respective work. Tho proudly containing (justly) horror elements (George Romero was clearly watching with interest) Ubaldo Ragona's film perfectly portrays the agony of Morgan's solitude, it's not merely about his battle with virally challenged zombies. Morgan's battle is chiefly with himself (wonderfully realised by an undervalued Price performance) he may have inherited the Earth, but his function has been reduced to being nothing more than an assassin of the night creatures. His existence is growing grim by the year, until he makes an amazing discovery, and it's one that swerves the film into its final quarter. Where to me at least, the film achieves what the other adaptations failed to do, namely no swagger involved, no cop outs and pandering to the norm, it's a highly fitting finale that is in keeping with the story's heart.Tho based as if in an American city, it's actually shot on location in Rome, Italy. With the whole cast other than Price himself, being Italian. Low on budget, The Last Man On Earth is unable to break free of its B movie sheen, yet this aids the structure of the picture. Grainy black and white shots of derelict streets are boosting the apocalyptic essence, this is a depressing time, not only for Morgan, but for us the viewers as well. We are not meant to jump out of our seats with fright, or to whoop and holler as Morgan lays waste to another creature of the night. We are asked to imagine what it would be like to be the last human on Earth, and if indeed we could quite simply cope with the isolation and dreams of a life long since past.Fine and intelligent picture 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>really an outstanding picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was hardly known to movie-addicts in my home-country until released on DVD in 2008. Of course many "cineasts" liked Price's performances in the Gothic Roger-Corman-films of the early 1960s. So this title was really a surprise: First of all comes Price's superb performance as the tragic hero who tries to survive in a sad, hopeless world. This was far away from his (great) overacting in the Poe-vehicles of the time, giving the audience a portrayal of a human being under the influence of threatening and traumatic experiences. Second comes this movie's artificial influence. It might be interesting to know if George Romero had seen "Last man on earth" before starting his work on "Night of the living dead". The wonderful black-and-white-cinematography reminds one of Romero's picture as well as the whole atmosphere of the Price-film, presenting us the idea that nothing is safe, that the safety we mostly seem to live in is nothing more than an easily-destroyed illusion. Altogether: a really outstanding movie of the early 1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult Film Of "Legend"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE LAST MAN ON EARTH is one of those end-of-the-world sagas that posits the notion of what it would be like to live in a largely dead world after some ghastly war or plague with nobody else left. The twist here, taking its basis from Richard Matheson's classic 1954 novel "I Am Legend" (the first of three adaptations of that book, in fact), is that you do have one human protagonist left alive, and a world full of things that want to kill him.Vincent Price stars as Robert Morgan (though he is Robert Neville in both the book and the latter film THE OMEGA MAN, and the 2007 version with Will Smith, under the author's original title), the only survivor of a terrible plague that decimated Earth, and turned everyone into vampires. By day, Price goes out into the city to stake and burn as many vampires as he can. And at night, he must barricade himself against the hordes that prowl around his isolated fortress each night, including his ex-friend Ben Cortman (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart), wanting to get at him. Price tries to find a logical and scientific explanation for the vampire plague (explained in flashbacks to when the plague began); and in due time, he happens upon another survivor, a woman (Franca Bettoia) who seems to be normal. But there is a fairly diabolical twist that Bettoia turns out to have in store, for both Price and the vampires.Often seen as a precursor to George Romero's 1968 horror classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and Danny Boyle's more recent 28 DAYS LATER, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, though very flawed in many aspects due to its rather low budget and its being filmed in Rome (Matheson's original novel is set in post-plague Los Angeles, as is THE OMEGA MAN), does have an extremely high creepiness factor that is very difficult for a lot of horror/sci-fi hybrids to come by, especially today. Price may not have necessarily been the ideal one to play Robert Morgan (one of the many reasons Matheson disavowed the film and used his pen name Logan Swanson for the screenplay credits), but he does a fairly good job all the same. The direction of Sidney Salkow and Ubaldo Ragona is fairly perfunctory for the most part, but certain scenes do stand out, including Price being caught outdoors at dusk after visiting his wife's grave; and Price having to see his wife come back from the dead as a vampire.Matheson's novel remains one of the high points of both horror and science fiction literature, not only in its consistently interesting scientific explanation for vampirism (making it without much doubt the greatest vampire story since "Dracula"), but also because of its basic psychological and scientific horror; and it has proved to be quite impossible to film properly per the author's intentions and still fit Hollywood's insatiable box office need (THE OMEGA MAN differed wildly from the letter of the novel but retained the basic spirit of it, while the Will Smith version is its own creation, still using elements of the novel). But if one ignores the inherent flaws of this near-Poverty Row production, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH can easily be seen as a fairly good cult film of "legend"--and, in many ways, a disturbing and thought-provoking one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Last Man On Earth" remains the most faithful adaptation of Richard Matheson's "I Am Legend" to date, not as ambitious as "The Omega Man" and much creepier. This movie's hero, Robert Morgan, seems to be the only living man to survive a plague. He spends his days stalking and staking plague victims that have been reanimated as vampires, and his nights are spent barricaded inside his house while they beat on the door and moan for his blood.Certain scenes in the film, such as when Morgan tries to drown out the cries of the vampires by playing records on his phonograph, are genuinely disturbing. The early portions of the film, where we see Morgan in his horrific daily routine of rising with the sun and clearing the city of vampires, are especially effective, among the best "end of the world" type films ever made. The most frightening sequence takes place during a flashback, when Morgan loses his wife to the plague and then insists on burying her instead of burning her body. Just as he has simultaneously denied and dreaded, she returns from her grave whispering "Let me in...let me in..." Other aspects of the film do not work as well, and have dated badly. After Morgan discovers that he may not be the last person alive after all, the film begins to unravel. It never quite makes the transition from Morgan's personal horror to the dread of the new "vampire society" emerging. The actress who plays Ruth (or rather the actress who vocalizes her, since the entire movie is dubbed and since the actors were mostly Italians, the English voices may have been performed by others) delivers her lines with a muddled voice that makes her hard to understand and seems a little silly. Likewise, the action sequence at the conclusion where the "new humans" chase Morgan through the streets is awkwardly realized and works in concept only.The movie does make an inventive departure from the novel by having Morgan "cure" Ruth of her vampirism, therefore proving that he could have saved the rest of the survivors from their own affliction, yet they kill him in cold blood because he has become a villain in their eyes."The Last Man On Earth" is significant for providing a number of aesthetic references for the horror genre, namely the shambling corpses and barricaded protagonists. George Romero effectively expanded on this a few years after the fact in "Night of the Living Dead", with a much greater impact. The sight of the ghouls hammering at Morgan's house, which has a few reinforcements that seem alarmingly inadequate, are still unnerving.If you can get past some of the dated hairstyles, attitudes, and the clumsy plot elements, "The Last Man On Earth" has a nostalgic creepiness that may work for you. Plus, Vincent Price is always worth a look!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalyptic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great Vincent Price has starred in many essential Horror films that qualify as masterpieces, and "The Last Man On Earth" of 1964 is doubtlessly one of his most memorable films. "The Last Man On Earth" is the only Horror film the World's greatest Horror actor (and my personal all-time favorite actor), Vincent Price, ever made in the greatest Horror-country, Italy (actually, it's an Italian/American co-production), and this is certainly not the only memorable fact about the film. Directed by the under-appreciated Ubaldo Ragona, who sadly directed only four other films, none of which became a success, "The Last Man On Earth" predates George A. Romero's Horror milestone "Night Of The Living Dead" by four years, and it can easily be cited as the famous Zombie flick's main inspiration. But not only is the film one of the most important origins of the modern Zombie film, out of all films I've seen, this one is probably THE film that has the most realistic atmosphere of the apocalypse. The horrifying idea of being the last person alive on Earth is brought to screen in a brilliantly menacing manner, and Vincent Price was the perfect man to play the role.A mysterious epidemic has exterminated mankind, leaving the immune Dr. Robert Morgan (Price) behind as the sole survivor. Morgan, whose wife and daughter were, as anybody else, killed by the plague, is in desperate search for another person alive. He is also desperate to defend himself, as the plague victims come back from the dead by night, longing for the blood of the living - his...The film is the first adaptation of Robert Matheson's novel "I Am Legend". The story was re-filmed as "The Omega Man" with Charleton Heston, which is decent, but way inferior to this one and, more recently as "I am Legend" starring Will Smith, which I haven't seen (and probably never will). This first, and incomparably brilliant film is a must-see for everyone interested in motion pictures. Maybe more than any other film, this proves what a brilliant actor Price was. His desperation, his monologues,... no other actor could have possibly played this role as ingeniously as Price does. There is a constant feeling of doom, the atmosphere is menacing and apocalyptic beyond comparison, yet "The Last Man On Earth" is a compelling Drama just as much as it is a stunning Horror/Sci-Fi flick. The exploration of Robert Morgan's psyche, and his longing for the company of a fellow being is maybe more significant an aspect of the film than the fact that he has to fight off the vampire-zombies that the victims have become. The living dead here are not yet the brainless flesh-eaters of later Zombie flicks, but basically thinking people who happen to crave for blood. The film's black and white cinematography is as amazing as the the story itself - Seeing Vincent Price drive his car through the empty streets is one of the most unforgettable pictures in 60s Horror cinema. This film is simply amazing in all aspects. I could go on praising it forever, but I will give an advice instead: See this film! "The Last Man On Earth" is arguably one of the most brilliant and unique films the great genre of Horror has ever brought forth, and not only a must-see for my fellow Vincent Price buffs, but a masterpiece that no lover of cinema can afford to miss! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few comments, then a comparison of this film with the novel it was based on (spoilers possible)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the music, by Paul Sawtell and Burt Shefter, reminiscent, in one passage, of their music for "It ! The Terror From Beyond Space !"(alternating woodwind chords) but disliked the clumsy, intrusive "ghostly chorus" vocalizing. Hearing it was like being elbowed in the ribs, and told, un-necessarily, "This is scary ! Now be scared !" similar to canned laughter on a TV sitcom.Good internal monologue at the beginning :"How long ? How many days, since I inherited the world ?""I can't live a heartbeat from hell, and be careless."Here are ways the film went "beyond" the novel ("I Am Legend") that it was based on : Morgan watches old home movies, providing a good segue into the flashback sequences. He goes from laughter to tears. In the novel, Neville watches Laurel and Hardy one-reelers, first laughing lightly, then explosively, when he notices the resemblance between hardy and Ben Cortman : "He couldn't stop laughing, because it was more than laughter, it was release." Good insight into how humor asserts itself, even in the most gruesome and heartbreaking situations, like Van Helsing's mention of "King Laugh" in the Bram Stoker novel, "Dracula"."Later, he cried."Morgan (Neville) and Cortman work together at research on the plague, rather than the unspecified "plant" of the novel. This enables some dialogue about the plague. Later, Cortman, in the film, barricades himself in his house, out of a superstitious fear of vampires. In the film, Morgan is attacked immediately after leaving the crypt where his wife lies. In the novel, Neville is attacked by his "neighbors" outside his home. In the film, Cortman breaks in, attacks Ruth, which gets Morgan outside to face the "Council Of Justice". In the novel, Cortman only gets in when Neville lets him in, to experiment on him.In the film, plague victims go blind right before they die, echoing 1962's "The Day Of The Triffids". Also, Morgan cures Ruth with a transfusion of his blood, making his death seem even more senseless than in the novel. (This also happens with Neville and Richie, the black teen, in "The Omega Man".) Morgan dies on a church altar, ironically staked, just like the vampires he hunted, like a modern-day Christ, whose blood can save mankind, if not from eternal damnation, then at least from the mobile living death of vampirism. This final scene in the church is like a funeral mass, with the "new people" (the infected living) dressed in black. The crying baby heard right before "The End" looms onto the screen suggests that the new people have already begun to reproduce themselves.Here are ways in which the film fell short of the novel :There are no scenes at the peephole, of Neville/Morgan sexually enticed by female vampires "striking lewd postures" to coax him into coming out. This could have been done even in 1964. Witness Hazel Court nearly popping out of the top of her dress in "The Raven". There is no portrayal of the wild revival meeting Robert Neville stumbles into, nor any interior monologue about why vampires fear the cross. More generally, the film portrays only sketchily and incompletely Neville's research, and the important "scientific detective story" element of the novel. Here is my rewrite of a key sentence in the novel :"Once they [plague victims] had been forced to accept vindication of a dread brought about by dire preaching, closely associated with an object [the cross] that had been a focal point of worship, their minds could have snapped. Dread of the cross sprang up."Also, the film does not show Morgan staking children, or experimenting on women, as Neville did in the novel. The former is the most unbearable part of Neville's daily routine ("Why do they all look like Kathy to me ? he asked himself, as he drew out the next stake, with shaking hands.") The latter gives Neville cause for some inner dialogue and soul-searching about his sexual desires, which he then pushes aside. Finally, I do not think the film has Morgan telling Ruth "in a terrible voice" how he had to put a stake through his own wife, after trying to keep her with him, and finding all she wanted to do was drink his blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enormously influential B-Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe how influential this film was for the horror genre, in fact, I doubt that directors Ubaldo Ragona and Sidney Salkow know how important their movie has been for many fans of science fiction and apocalyptic horror. However, credit must go to the men responsible for the big popularity of the film, this modest low-budget U.S.A./Italy co-production was blessed by the hand of two of the most important men of horror during the 60s: writer Richard Matheson and actor Vincent Price.Loosely based on Matheson's seminal novel "I Am Legend", the movie tells the story of Dr. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price), who is apparently, the last man on earth. Or at least the last rational man, as three years before a lethal virus spread over the world that turned people in zombie-like vampires who lived only to feed and feared the sunlight. The lonely existence Morgan has made Morgan a sad depressed man, whose only purpose in life is to kill the creatures as he loses hope of finding another normal human being.Writer of many successful Roger Corman's films, Richard Matheson wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of his novel "I Am Legend" keeping the depressing tone of his apocalyptic tale and the mix of science fiction and horror, complete with his modernization of the vampire myth. While he was unhappy after the many rewrites of his screenplay (he decided to disown the film), the movie keeps the depressing tone of the novel despite the alterations to the plot. Focused completely on Price's character, the story echoes in many of the modern horror films due to its grim representation of mankind and it could be said that the basis for what would be known as the zombie sub-genre were written here.The movie is technically an average and typical low-budget film, however, what makes it a different kind of monster is the powerful acting by Vincent Price and the terrific story that unfolds as we get to know the last man on earth. Sidney Salkow, who apparently was the man responsible of most of the artistic decisions in the movie, crafted the film as a simple sci-fi tale at its most minimalistic state. This approach (due mostly to budgetary reasons) works for the best of the movie and despite the lack of many locations one can truly feel the isolation and tragedy of Dr. Morgan.Vincent Price carries the film with power and this is probably one of his best performances ever. Often casted as the villain or the madman, it is a nice change of pace to watch him as the apparent victim of a world gone mad, and the powerful emotions he conveys make the movie even more frightening. His performance is definitely the main reason to watch this film. The rest of the small cast is very competent, and surprisingly the English dubbing (as most of the cast are Italians) is quite good."The Last Man on Earth" is by no means a perfect movie, it suffers a lot from its low-budget. The many rewrites the plot had also took its toll in the coherence of small aspects in the plot that could had been worked in better ways. Despite its many problems, it is safe to say that this movie was of huge influence for the filmmakers that followed, as traces of this can be found in films like "Night of the Living Dead" or "28 Days Later..." Salkow and Ragona, veterans of low-budget film-making of the 50s never had another hit, and probably even now their careers are pretty much unknown to the mainstream audience. However, and thanks to the talents of Matheson and Price, they crafted one of the most important horror films of history. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile adaptation of Richard Matheson's cult sci-fi/horror novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend was an innovative, genre-defining masterpiece ? a book which rejuvenated horror and science fiction writing of the time, and made popular and exciting the (then) relatively new idea of post-apocalyptic fiction. This Italian dramatisation of the book is a worthwhile film, with an enthralling performance by Vincent Price as the lone survivor of a worldwide pandemic. Price seems an improbable candidate for the role ? when reading the book, he's not at all the kind of actor you'd envisage if you had to cast for the character. And yet Price really holds this film together, delivering a subtle and intelligent interpretation in one of the high-points of his long and illustrious career. That's not to say The Last Man On Earth doesn't have its negatives; it isn't perfect by a long shot. But it is a commendable attempt to film Matheson's prescient futuristic story.Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) believes he is the last remaining human on Earth. A virulent plague has wiped out mankind, leaving millions dead. Some of the dead have been reanimated as vampires. They stalk the streets at night and sleep through the day. Morgan spends the daylight hours hunting and destroying them, taking their staked corpses to a nearby pit where he burns their remains. Morgan's life has become a long and tedious cycle ? by day he kills his sleeping enemies; scavenges for supplies of food, drink and garlic; and repairs his house. By night he barricades himself in while the vampires taunt him from outside and occasionally try to smash their way in. Then one day Morgan discovers a woman (Franca Bettoia) walking in broad daylight, apparently unaffected by the sunlight, apparently not a vampire, apparently a 'normal' human being like himself. But when he discovers that she is, in fact, one of a number of plague-sufferers who have managed to create a serum which controls the vampirism to a certain degree, he is devastated. He realises that the vampires are not the freaks any more ? they are the "norm". Morgan himself is the freak, the last remaining example of a bygone legend called "man".The Last Man On Earth is filmed in a subdued black-and-white hue which enhances its atmosphere of hopelessness and isolation. As mentioned, Price gives a strong performance as the lone vampire-killer who has somehow survived longer than nature intended him to. It's a little disappointing that the vampire characters are shown to be so slow and clumsy and, frankly, stupid-looking. In the book they were more nimble and physical and posed a greater threat to Morgan's safety. Here, he is able to single-handedly shove whole gangs of them away from his car or doorstep without much difficulty. They don't come across as formidable adversaries, and this loses the film some potential suspense. Also, Bettoia's character is sadly under-developed. Her appearance in the story has huge implications to the plot and to Morgan's eventual fate, yet she has barely any screen time and isn't built up properly at all. Nonetheless The Last Man On Earth stands as a worthwhile adaptation of a significant and thought-provoking sci-fi book. For its despairing atmosphere, not to mention Price's tour-de-force performance, it should be sought out and seen at least once.</fullReview>

As observed by many other posters, many films/directors are in debt to this movie. The list would begin but not end with "Night of the Living Dead", "Omega Man", "28 Days Later", and "Day of the Dead". There is also that very good Australian (?) movie, "This Silent Earth." That is to only mention the good movies. Countless crappy movies also owe their profits to this woefully unknown gem. Sure, as a Vincent Price fan I am biased. But the quality of this movie - from the script to the photography to Price's glorious intonations - is hard to deny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Last Man on Earth" opens with the desolation of city landscapes betraying not a hint of activity, and bodies lying in the streets. A community church billboard heralds: "The End Has Come". Against this desperation, one man survives and marks time on the walls of his home. For three years he has wearily resigned himself to his mission, to destroy every last vampire within the confines of the city, searching for their resting places in hopes of discovering a large colony he can destroy all at once instead of the one or two he may happen upon at random.Vincent Price portrays Dr. Robert Morgan, curiously immune from the vampire plague. We learn that his tolerance may have occurred years earlier when he was bitten by a bat in Panama, somehow acquiring antibodies in his system to combat the disease. Via flashback sequences, we come to learn that Morgan once had a wife and young daughter, and while working at a medical lab, the plague hit, first in Europe, and then carried wind borne to other parts of the world.The apocalyptic feel of the movie is both effective and discomfiting at the same time. The viewer shares in Morgan's hopelessness and despair, knowing that should he fulfill his mission, there is no relief from the loneliness and boredom of a solitary existence. Having lost his family, and even his dog to the ravages of disease, Morgan is driven not so much by revenge, but by a choice made to make things right in the world even to his last breath.All of your standard vampire lore is explored in the film; Morgan protects his home with ropes of garlic, and dots his rooms with mirrors. He makes his own stakes for subduing them, and his daily forays into the city show him carrying his equipment and a mallet in readiness for what he may find.Watch for a continuity error early in the film - the first time we see Morgan load his station wagon with dead vampire bodies, he puts them in head first, with feet coming out the back. When he arrives at the burning pit to dispose of them, the one he pulls out of the car is facing him head first."The Last Man on Earth" is not an easy film to watch. It's one of the few "B" grade films of the genre that actually make you think about what you might face if you suddenly found yourself in an apocalyptic nightmare. Particularly poignant is my timing to view this film, some eight days following Hurricane Katrina, with it's desolation of New Orleans. The contrast between the leveled landscape of Louisiana with the stark remains of the movie's locale bear an uncomfortable similarity. It's unsettling to realize that a work of fiction can come so close to capturing the mood and despair of an entire region faced with a tragedy beyond it's control. This is not a film to entertain, and there is no happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the book "I Am Legend", Vincent Price plays a doctor who's the last human survivor of a global plague that turned everyone else into vampires, or so he thinks. During the day he rides around killing the vampires while they sleep and at night he returns home and barricades himself inside while the zombie like vampires try to break his door down. Then he finds out that there are other human survivors - or are they? And what's his blood got to do with it? Remade in the 1970s as "The Omega Man", starring Charlton Heston, who worked with Price in the 1956 remake of "The Ten Commandments".Though made on a smaller budget, this is vastly superior to the "Omega Man" remake, which tried too hard to fulfill its ambitious vision. This film, made on a smaller budget, realizes it can't do everything so it does what it can with what it has and establishes an eerie atmosphere.Bit of a shame that Vincent Price, a tall, urbane, velvet voice actor, should be remembered for low budget horror films though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't go wrong with the great Vincent Price heading up a classic story about a civilization destroying plague. This is the first film adaptation of I Am Legend, and it's still got a lot over its later big budget remakes.Price plays most of the film against himself as the sole survivor of a deadly plague. The only other survivors are nocturnal vampire/zombies who spend every night trying to destroy the last representative of the old world.This film stacks up well against the other doomsday films of the cold war era like On the Beach, and none of the others boast a star like Price who could own that type of role. The Last Man on Earth must have been primary source material for George Romero. It's got the same stark and grainy black and white feel that Romero used so effectively in Night of the Living Dead. For my money, it's a cut above the swingin' 70s Omega Man and the recent I Am Legend, although both of those are worth watching as well.</fullReview>

It's a hobby at least.The entire weight of the film lies on Vincent's shoulders, near enough, and although it's not the most action packed film in the world (as Vincent goes around ruminating about his status as a vampire killer and lone human), it still had me fairly gripped, basically because I'm a sucker for a post apocalyptic film, especially one filmed in the EUR. I did get my kicks from watching Vincent walking around the Square Colluseum while vampire corpses lay strewn about.There's a fairly lengthy flashback in the middle of the film but you should get some enjoyment out of this.

		<shortDescription>In this B Movie, "B" Stands for Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warts and all, The Last Man on Earth is the best of the three film versions made of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend. In fact, right up until the end, it is hard to imagine the book done better. Director Ubaldo Ragona nails the feeling of a cityscape from which civilization has vanished. It could be rightfully argued that fiftyish Vincent Price was not the best choice for the role of an up-and-coming young biologist, husband and dad who finds himself the only human left after a plague that has turned all its other survivors into hungry vampires. However, Price was a fine actor who conveys Robert Morgan's discomfort with his role of reluctant executioner as his desperation sags into utter despair.If anything works against the film it is its mise en scene ? set in Los Angeles, it was filmed in Rome with except for Price, Italian actors whose American-accented English was presumably dubbed. This lends to the whole film a slight discomfort ? its scenario, already fantastic, is skewed by the insistent absurdity of this artifice. SPOILER ALERT: Richard Matheson was so unhappy with the changes made to his screenplay that he asked that his name be removed from the film, but being informed that this would void his right to any future residuals (as he explains in a short, illuminating featurette that accompanies the DVD), he adopted the nom de plume Logan Swanson. The film itself is solid and professional enough that one wonders about the source of Matheson's qualms ? until Last Man's action-filled ending. To give the movie credit, Ruth, the woman Morgan finds (Emma Danieli) casts his situation in a new light exactly as in the original novel: a new strain of intelligent, "human" vampire has arisen, they are building a new society, and by not distinguishing them from the regular plague victims, staking them during their diurnal sleep, Morgan has become regarded as a monster who must be eliminated. "You've become a legend," Ruth tells him. This is the message that the novel embodies so succinctly: by not opening their eyes to changing norms, the defender of good can become the destroyer of the innocent. But it is a message that is swept away in the crude action sequences of the conclusion, where to escape a virtual platoon of nouveau vampires chasing him with rifles and harpoons, Morgan swoops through a police station, collects weapons, and flees into a church, peppering his pursuers with pistol fire and casting some sort of festive smoke bomb in his wake (are these supposed to be grenades?) before his final showdown in a church.Still, it is a better film than the cartoonish Omega Man (1971) or the 2007 I Am Legend, which retained the title but between casting the vampires as superpowerful werewolf-thingies and having Will Smith rave on about Bob Marley, turned a great science-fiction novel into a bad summer blockbuster. The Last Man on Earth may be problematic, but is worth seeing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1st adaptation of Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend', starring Vincent Price as the last man on earth besieged by the undead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first adaptation of Matheson's 'I Am Legend' and still the best by far. I first thought this film was from the '50's as by the time the '60's came about, the black and white era had ended but for independent film and television. But the treatment only adds to the atmosphere, which is none other than bleak and might as well have been colourless, as was the life of Matheson's original character, Robert Neville.'Last Man' sticks closely by the book in its perspective of a slumbering post-apocalyptic world. It tells the tale of (if i am not completely correct, please forgive me for not being 100% arsed) Robert Morgan (changed from Neville), who has seen the world fall foul of a mysterious disease - including his own family - and turned them all into the bloodthirsty lumbering undead.From the beginning, the film charts his thoughts as after three years, he's had nobody to talk to, understandably suffers insomnia and mild madness, drinks his woes away and cleans up the city corpse by corpse. His thoughts are the narrative to the film as there is little talk and this provides a sense of insanity we find ourselves strangely sympathetic to. Vincent Price's face merely speaks for itself as a template for a thousand emotions as his grief for his family and past life are those most likely to force his guard down and get him killed.But whereas Price is one huge part of the drama and the horror, I think people will agree with me that 'Last Man' not only tells the story better than 'The Omega Man' or Will Smith's 'I Am Legend', it shows a greater extent of the damage caused to the world outside as every day, Price's character ventures out to dispose of dead bodies, both those he has slain and those cannibalised by their own kind out of desperate hunger...Bodies litter the streets and military outposts and their machines lay scattered here and there throughout the film, giving a sense of utter devastation. Even in Will Smith's film, the suburbs were clean and spotless. Here, the world is decayed as well as overgrown and untouched after what looks like a tornado has ripped the city to pieces... The scene with the permanently smouldering pit provides a large dose of futility! Not only this but the portrayal of the enemy as vampiric, zombified and feral - but still essentially human-minded - makes them so much more horrifying as armies of them set out at night to get at him in his boarded up house. They not only try to bludgeon their way into the ramshackle fortress, they smash at windows and verbally taunt him. They beat the jive-talking' ghosts in afros and unrealistic PIXAR-like mutants by miles for effectiveness, end of...Atmospherically, eventfully and probably 90% faithfully, the film covers the original story and tells the story in the truest possible way. My only problem is that like all adaptations of the same film, nobody has ever seemed daring enough to make the very controversial and insane ending of the novel a reality...Still as a film, 'The Last Man on Earth' does for the horror films of the 60's what '30 Days of Night' did for the '00's... The thought of such a thing happening in reality makes the heart beat a little too loud for comfort!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and captivating Price's gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tag-line read 'By night they leave their graves, crawling, shambling, through empty streets, whimpering, pleading, begging for his blood' if that doesn't grab you as a horror fan, nothing will. Remade many times since as The Omega Man (1971), I am Legend (2007) to name a few, Richard Matheson novel I am Legend has been a wealthy piece of source material. Despite Matheson feeling that Vincent Price was miscast in the lead role, Price gives a sterling performance as Dr. Robert Morgan who is the survivor of a devastating world-wide plague. Morgan is tortured by his dreams and his solitary existence trying to find another human still alive. Price's distinguished voice and acting really gets the viewer hooked and caring for his character who is harassed by vampire zombies seeking his blood every night.While not a faithful version of the novel it is well crafted by Ubaldo Ragona, who incidentally only directed a handful of films. Ragona's work clearly influenced Romero's set up of the horror classic Night of the living Dead (1968). Admittedly The Last Man on Earth is slow in places and the music by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter is bland and of it's time. Nevertheless, the locations are great featuring, bleak backdrops and curious architecture which leaves the viewer disconcerted. What this unsung black and white chiller gem demonstrates best is that The Last Man on Earth shows what a fascinating and captivating actor Vincent Price was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the 1st filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel entitled I am legend.the 2nd film version(which i have yet to see)is called The Omega men,starring Charlton Heston.the 3rd version is the recently released film starring Will Smith,also entitled I am Legend,which i pretty much hated.as for this 1st version,starring Vincent Price,i thought it was fantastic.there are some great moments of suspense and a real sense of emptiness and desolation.Vincent Price is great here in a non villain role.you can really see the hopelessness and despair he feels.i thought the ending was very good.the only complaint i have about this particular version is it has a few slow moments.otherwise,though,like i said,it's fantastic. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute must see film for Price, Romero and horror / sci-fi aficionados</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forty years after the shock of seeing George Romero's, Night of the Living Dead, comes another shock: Mr Ragona got there first! Missing from many film bibliographies for Vincent Price, this sensational film clearly influenced Romero and for some reason has remained little known (apart I now discover from IMDb participants). So thanks to a recent UK DVD release, I can share this powerful film featuring one of Price's most mature and restrained performances. I have to concede that one of the most worrying things for me when I first saw the Romero was the relentlessness of the undead, whereas here Price's character is resigned to them battering on his doors each night confident they are now tough or bright enough to get in. This may be realistic but does reduce the level of horror. Astonishing how similarly the zombies move about though and Price's forays into the outside world are a great bonus and do really convey the genuine horror of being alone amidst such death and destruction. An absolute must see film for Price, Romero and horror / sci-fi aficionados.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best telling of the book "I Am Legend" ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I can gather, the Will Smith "I Am Legend" is a steaming piece of crap."The Omega Man", with Charlton Heston (yes, Charlt, we WILL take it from your cold dead hand old chum), was OK for the time it was made but it seems very dated and pretentious now.And I gather there was one more version of the book made but I can't find any details about it.And then I discovered this film on a 5-for-1 $5 horror DVD - you know, one of those ones where it's hard to go wrong. I can't believe I picked up such a classic, such a good film, almost for free.As soon as I saw it I realised I'd read a children's version of the book when I was very young, and gradually I detective'd my way back to finding out that all these films were based on one novel from the 1950s.You can fault this film, certainly, by harping on its budget and time-constraints in the making of it. Who, the hell, cares. It's a brilliant story, told straight, told with passion.See it, it's a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lonely man deals with creatures of the night.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Low budget and shot in eerie black and white. Vincent Price isn't required to show much emotion; he goes about the role stoic yet vulnerable. Dr. Robert Morgan(Price)becomes the sole survivor of a plague that has left the known world night strolling vampires. Morgan, a scientist trying to find something to counteract the creeping death seems immune to the deadly germs; his wife and young daughter are not. His mundane life consists of hanging mirrors and garlic rings on his doors; making wooden spikes to kill any ghoulish creatures he finds on his daily searches for survivors or the walking dead. The whole atmosphere is dark and depressing and brings much realism to Morgan's loneliness. My favorite scene is Morgan resting on his couch listening to music as the night creatures pound at his boarded windows and doors. Just too good to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Alpha "Omega Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely well made film that builds tension and suspense superbly. Vincent Price gives a performance that demonstrates why his acting career was worthy of legend status. By the way, other than when he worked with Michael Jackson on the "Thriller" music video, I can not imagine that Mr. Price ever dealt with a more insipid character than zombie-"vampire" Ben Cortman ("Morgan...Morgan...Morgan"). This film arose from a good starting-point -- the fertile storytelling mind of Richard Matheson (based on his novel "I Am Legend"), but it is Vincent Price who contributes the most to this production (his narration is especially effective -- it is downright powerful). Some purists object to the manner in which vampires are depicted in this film. Personally, I feel no special affinity for vampire films, so I think it a plus that this film is NOT a vampire film. Also, face reality, if there had been hundreds of powerful vampires attacking Dr. Morgan, the film would have been over before the conclusion of the opening credits. It's reassuring to see that "The Last Man on Earth" has received a relatively high rating here at IMDB and that almost every review of the film posted here is a favorable review. It is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Post-Apocalyptic Vampire Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's good to see this film again - it's been a long while. This one is a must see for horror fans. In particular vampire and zombie lovers alike should be able to enjoy this wonderful film.Basically, everyone on planet Earth is dead or undead minus one man Dr. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price). Dr. Morgan is a scientist turned vampire hunter after the spread of a plague that wiped out almost most all of the population on the planet (death) or they became a vampire. Dr. Morgan faces his daily chores of keeping his home secure from the vampires, radioing for anyone that can hear him, burning any recently dead vamp &amp; putting a stake through the hearts of any vampires that are alive. By night, he stays secured at home resting and preparing for the next days monotonous routine.The movie is much more exciting than it sounds like it would be and quite different than most other vampire films out there.I don't know if I would like to be in Dr. Morgan place: the last human on Earth. Being the last human on the planet sounds like it would be fun on the surface but would in reality be nightmare. The film shows the torment of being alone quite well and Vincent Price's performance is outstanding! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Price survival?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of both Vincent Price and the dystopian/post-apocalyptic genre, but until now I never gave The Last Man On Earth the time of day, probably because I found it so hard to imagine the usually villainous Price playing against type. It was rather short-sighted of me, for the star puts in a wonderfully restrained and utterly convincing performance, brilliantly portraying the anguish and torment of a man robbed of his family, bereft of human company, and driven to the brink of madness by loneliness. Not only that, but The Last Man On Earth proves to be a major influence on one of my favourite horror classics of all time, George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), which clearly modelled its flesh-eating zombies on this film's reanimated corpses.Price plays scientist Robert Morgan, survivor of a disease that has ravaged mankind, turning people into undead creatures with vampiric traits that can only be destroyed by a stake in the heart or cremation. Leading a repetitive day-to-day existence, barricading himself inside his house at night, Morgan's situation looks hopeless until he bumps into another survivor, a woman named Ruth (Franca Bettoia) who is infected by the disease, but not yet a vampire thanks to a special serum that keeps her alive. Using his own blood for a transfusion, Morgan cures Ruth, only to discover that she is just one of a large group of infected people for whom he is a figure of fear and who intend to put an end to his life of indiscriminate staking.The first movie to be based on Richard Matheson's short story I Am Legend, this modest budgeted effort easily holds its own against later, more lavish adaptations (The Omega Man starring Charlton Heston, and the recent Will Smith blockbuster I Am Legend). Director Ubaldo Ragona loads his film with tension, atmosphere and pathos through the skillful use of flashbacks (to flesh out Price's character), effective location work (abandoned cityscapes that rival 28 Days Later's deserted London), grim scenes of harsh realism (masked soldiers unloading corpses into a burning pit), and carefully crafted moments of pure terror, the freakiest moment being Morgan's recently deceased wife Virginia at the door, pleading for her husband to 'let her in'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I stated if you want to watch a true film and the best adaption of the Matheson novel, then skip the Heston and Will Smith remakes. this movies does a great job of portraying the vampires/infected populace. Vincent Price gives one of if not his best performance as Robert Neville, the soul survivor of the plague. His isolation, the torment each night as the infected try to lure him out, he does his best to block their taunts, his mission of hunting them down. it's funny the modern versions of the film fail so horribly, by far this is the best film based on I am Legend, especially because back then they didn't cop out with feel good possible sequel endings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Price is one of my favorite actors, and this is one of his best movies. This, alongside "House on Haunted Hill," his minimal work in "Edward Scissorhands," and a few of his Edgar Allan Poe pictures, is by far his best work.The movie has a good premise, though by today's standards seems overdone. This is the first incarnation of the "I am Legend" tale, and I'm sure it's the best. In fact, I put in the latest version with Will Smith in afterward, and I turned it off after 10 minutes. The most modern remake couldn't hold a candle to Mr. Price.The movies has its share of camp and overused voice over, but he IS the last man on earth. Who does he have to talk to?Note: I have yet to see any other incarnations of this tale, but I don't intend to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gem of a movie is without a shadow of doubt the best of the three movies based on "I am Legend" the book by Richard Matheson from 1954. The other movies are: "The omega man" and the newest "I am Legend". They do no stay true to the book.. Not even a little. This first one though, does a decent job, especially considering the budget.It is just sad, they couldn't stick with the book 100%, as it is one of the best books ever written along with Ayn Rands books. But sadly, that is how the film industry is.The same thing happened with the birds. The movie is completely different from the book.All in all, I give this movie an 8 out of 10. The movie would have gotten a 10 if it wasn't based on the book, as it would have been a kick-ass stand-alone movie with no ties to the book. But, when we know it is based on a book... especially a book that is this great... The movie can't help but fade into the background, compared to the exceptional story the book offered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not my favorite vincent price film, but still pretty good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film adaptation of "I am Legend", starring Vincent Price as the title character, the last man on earth. Anyway, the movie itself was a bit anticlimactic for the first half hour, but I think that was intentionally supposed to convey Price's character's boredom and the degradation of one's psyche without the stimulation of normal human interaction. As a horror movie, it isn't remarkably gory or anything, so you may be disappointed. Price, however, does a great job as a man struggling to maintain his sanity under the intense pressures of a post-apocalyptic world. From a psychological standpoint, there is a lot to dissect here, and if you view it under that context, it is an intelligent statement on the tribulations of human loneliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I AM LEGEND -- Seriously!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first -- and by far the best -- of 3 movies based on the novel "I Am Legend." Made by Lippert Studios in 1964, it's the perfect example of how a good picture can be made, based on a good idea, with one good actor, and a few thousand dollars (not $100 million).I rate this one a 7 compared to the Will Smith version as a 1. In the 2007 remake, tens of millions were wasted by born-stupid filmmakers who thought shaking a hand held camera like a bowl of Jello was somehow smart. In fact the shaky camera work and dreadful lighting kept the "Legend" in the dark and ruined the movie. The ONLY better thing about the Will Smith remake was the dog. He was a handsome dog, not a mutt, and a charismatic canine actor."Last Man on Earth" is on DVD paired with another fine science fiction, "Panic in Year Zero" starring Ray Milland. Two for the price of one, and either is better than the mindless science fiction junk of 2007.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the author's well-known dislike of it, The Last Man On Earth is surprisingly good version of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, and makes a fascinating comparison with Chuck's insanely enjoyable version The Omega Man. It may have less action, a much lower budget, a score considerably less funky than Ron Grainer's, and what looks like the suburbs around Rome's Cinecitta Studios standing in for the USA, but it offers a much more disturbing account of civilisation gradually breaking down around its powerless hero (a restrained and very convincing Vincent Price). And for anyone familiar with the remake, the even bleaker ending here is a real surprise. Recommended - it's not an all-time great, but it's well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, sombre horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Man on Earth is a great film despite some setbacks. First and most apparent is Vincent Price's miscasting in the film, and it is this factor that encouraged Richard Matheson to take his name off the credits (allegedly). Price, always the great horror icon when asked to play slightly over the top characters seems incredibly out of place as ordinary scientist Robert Morgan. This is no reflection on his acting abilities - just that when you see him on the screen you subconsciously demand some cheese from his performance! His casting, however, is not nearly as disastrous as Charlton Heston in the films kind-a remake - The Omega Man - who tries to turn the character into a gun toting Jesus Christ figure. Secondly, and I'm not sure if this is a fault on the negative or just the DVD copy, but sound and picture jumps quite jarringly in two or three occasions, background music starts then stops suddenly, a real shame because it distracts somewhat from your enjoyment of the film. I say "enjoyment"... but this film is jet black. There's no hope for Morgan or humanity and it is this mood that makes the film. Corpses litter deserted streets. Morgan is allowed one laugh in the film and that turns into mania as he starts crying! And mankind gets the apocalypse it probably deserves, reduced to the instinctive animal-like creatures afraid of light we were in the stone age. And there's no place for Robert Morgan in a world like that......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Last Man On Earth is quite a good end of the world movie with Vincent Price.After plague has devastated the world, the only surviver is a scientist, Robert Morgan. There are plenty of vampire zombies though and it is Morgan's task to keep this lot at bay. He does this by staking them through the heart and putting them into a large pit to burn. At night, they try and get in his home but these are kept away by garlic and mirrors hung up on his front door. Later on, Morgan bumps into a woman who has found a cure. She used to be a vampire and there are more of these cured people who turn up after Morgan and kill him at the end, not realising he's normal.This is quite creepy in parts and gives you an idea on what could happen if this sort of thing does happen in real life. This was remade as The Omega Man in 1971 with Charlton Heston in the Price role.A must for all old sci-fi/horror fans. Brilliant.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for high quality special effects you will not like this film. The good news is that this movie does not need F/X to be effective it succeeds on a much higher level. The acting ( mainly price) is excellent and the movie creates a sense of loneliness and despair that few movies (if any) can match. The zombies/vampires are present but they are not the focal point of the movie, rather they exist in the aftermath of the apocalypse. This movie strikes all the right chords in telling its story. Unlike the ridiculous 2007 flick "I am legend" this movie's strength lies in its substance not over the top CGI. This is one of the few films I have seen starring VP and it made me appreciate him as a great actor. Watch this movie and its 2007 re make b2b (if you can get through the latter!) and you will see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film.Vincent Price was as good in this film as any film he ever did.It is based on Richard Matheson's great novel "I am Legend",perhaps the coolest name of any book ever.Price plays a scientist who is the sole survivor of a world wide plague.By day he goes about preparing himself for the coming night.The night is a non-ending attack by the dead who have came back to life.The walking dead hunt Price by night and he finds their hiding places during the day and stakes them so they will once again become dead.The dead were referred to as 'vampires' although they are slow and lumbering, reminding one much more Romero's walking dead than the fleet and strong vampires we are used to.Speaking of Romero,one can't help but think of "The Night of the Living Dead" when we see the dead milling around outside and pounding on Price's house trying to get inside.It would be interesting to find out if Romero ever stated that this film was an influence on him.Yeah it sounds cool because it was!The whole black and white picture looks like the end of the world from beginning to end.....Price roams the empty streets filled with abandoned cars and the walking dead who have been caught out in the sunlight.The sparse landscape and abandoned cities contrasted nicely to Price's living quarters which were piled up with supplies and generators and wooden stakes.Being a film from the mid 60's the special effects are pretty mild and the gore almost nonexistent but it doesn't matter.This film,unlike the recent "I am Legend" with Will Smith ,isn't a computer generated special effects driven movie....it is a tour de force of one man on the screen 90% of the time making you truly believe he was the last man on Earth.Without the smarmy macho bravado of Smith or Charlton Heston, in "The Omega Man",Price is sort of an every man,soft and unprepared for what lies ahead of him.He is living one day at a time and dreading every minute of his dull meaningless fight to live.Price always reminded me of Bela Lugosi.....they both made a few good films but also appeared in lots of bad films but even in the stinkers they both gave it everything they had all the time.Here Mr.Price gives it all he had and even a little more.Basic copies of this movie can be had for a buck or so and that is a heck of a PRICE for such a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneven Adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually got a hold of a copy of Richard Matheson's I am Legend today. It was an incredibly quick read, I finished all 171 pages in about 3 hours. (I compare that to Robert Heinlein's Friday, which took me days to read because the plot was just so plodding and pointless.) As noted before, there have been three movie versions of this film made. The recent film with Will Smith of the same title, The Omega Man with Charlton Heston, and The Last Man on Earth. Its bastard progeny is George Romero and every other idiot who ever did a Zombie movie.If you want to know which version is closest to the actual plot, it is the Price version, which Matheson tried his best to disown due to poor quality issues. (The difference is that Price's Morgan is a scientist, while Matheson's Neville is self taught.) Matheson wrote his vampires like Vampires, unlike Heston, whose vampires looked more like mutants (with Afros!), and Smith's looked like a cross between Romero Zombies and Peter Jackson Orcs. This movie gets that right, with the Vampires having all the classic aversion to mirrors, crosses and garlic.The book is primarily a character study. Would a man go insane if left alone with no other real human contact. I think where it falls short is that it gets the action about right, but misses the subtle character points, such as why the semi-dead vampires want to kill Morgan/Neville, or how Morgan has developed a bond with the lead vampire, Ben Cortman (who in life was his best friend.) It copies the protagonists actions, but not really his motivations.Still, I recommend this movie highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen dozens of Vincent Price films over the years, I was surprised to realize I had never seen this classic. A wild, eerie schlock-fest, this re-telling of Matheson's "I Am Legend" comes across as a truly nightmarish tale, albeit not without some faults.The title succinctly explains the entire plot of the film and the book upon which its based. What isn't explained in the title is that the last man on Earth now finds himself fending off legions of roving monsters - ex-humans who now thirst for blood.The film, which is set in small-town America but obviously filmed overseas, walks a thin line between creepy and silly. The "vampires" thud against Price's front door like mindless zombies, chanting "Come out" over and over. One viewer might find the image and accompanying, hollow voice quite horrifying, while another could easily see it as low-budget campiness. While I loved seeing Price bed down for the night with a cup of tea and loud jazz music while the monsters mindlessly attack the exterior of his house, the image is equally ridiculous if one tries to take it seriously in the context of the film.Surprisingly enough, I found this film to pale in comparison to 2007's I Am Legend, starring Will Smith. Not one to enjoy modern remakes, I found this superior feature captured the emptiness of Matheson's classic novel with much more tenacity. While the first film version of this book is still a fun ride, I am surprised to recommend the latest version of this story with a bit more enthusiasm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read I am legend a week ago and its still fresh in my mind. Neville was not a experienced scientist but this version has him one. The black and white worked well for the film. I thought the flashbacks were well done. I think for its time in 1964 it was a brave film to make. It is barren and harsh like the book and most of the dialog is true to the book as well. The key note in this film was the sentence "There is some kind of evolutionary process taking place here." If you read the book, you would find this one sentence a wonderful surprise because the book did NOT allude to that fact which really is essential. I know Romero copied his films from this film. There was someone who did it first and did it better and this is that film. There is another version of I am Legend coming out in 2007 with will smith. Heston was more Neville looking then of all the subsequent versions. I would like them to use his real name and stay absolutely true to the book so it can stand by itself. If you haven't read the book, do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Man on Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite entertaining little modestly budgeted post-apocalyptic horror flick starring Vincent Price as a lonely, beleaguered man fighting an everyday struggle with a world of vampires. Through moments of backstory(Richard Matheson, unhappy with the final product from a screenplay, used a different name in the title credits), we see that a plague had infected civilization carried by the wind which started the vampire virus. The film is quite haunting as we see a civilization in crumbling scary quiet with Price seeking out other possible living members of mankind eventually finding a woman who has found a way to reverse the vampire plague raging inside. Price was a scientist trying to find a cure. In a haunting side-note within the plot is Price's old colleague always trying to get inside the house to kill him.The film is actually surprisingly effective thanks to an always reliable Price in the lead. There have been other film based on Matheson's novel, "I Am Legend," but this is perhaps as close as we'll get to a quality version of the story. Potent scenes include Price's wife and child succumbing to the disease, Price having to flee a group of people who consider him a threat, and the final climax as Price tries to tell those who wish him dead that his blood is the real cure for the vampire curse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Morgan, a medical scientist who happens to survive an airborne virus that basically wipes out the world's population, leaving him to believe he's the last man on earth. But that's not entirely the case, as there are waves of vampires who crave for Morgan's blood, during night attacks on his house. So during the day, he hunts them down and gathers items that he needs to live on and to keep these creatures at bay. But this repetitive lifestyle is broken when he encounters another survivor of this plague.Watch as life goes by in the daily chores of existence. Well, for Price's character, this continuous loop is what has kept him sane and his mind busy from his grimly, vacant surroundings. Well, this was my first long awaited viewing and what an eerie tale it was. Like many have already mentioned, the influence this b-grade treat had on Romero's triumphantly iconic piece to the horror genre - "Night Of the Living Dead" comes speeding towards you, at full ball. Too bad the pacing didn't share the same fate, as its quite slothful, giving it one stretched out feel. But that didn't bother me too much, because the forlorn and lonely spell weaved into the atmosphere of doom-gloom made it one nightmarish post-apocalyptic experience. Plus having Vincent Price on board, made sure that you're always kept enchanted by his strong persona, even when not a lot was happening. He still manages to steel the show and handles the challenging material very well. His believable character is somewhat of an average Joe and I thought it works out for the better.The harrowing and certainly cerebral story is taken by Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend" and its grinding screenplay is quite close to its sources. The thing is, it does get more compelling within each reel with effective surprises that leads into a howler of a striking climax. Throughout much of the picture, we get the solitude Price's crackly, drained voice-over and that's been most the film's dialogue. It gives you piece by piece of what just happened and a flashback showing the fall of humanity by surprise. Black and white photography helps on the atmospheric strangle hold and tight camera-work gives the film a cramp appeal of torment and despair within its beautiful Rome-shot setting masquerading as America. The saucy score spins out the chills and adds to the suspenseful spurts and persistent images by director Sidney Salkon. The production was cheap looking, but it still looks very competently done.Not brilliant by any means and it was kind of lampooned by many when released, but still you know you're in for top class entertainment, when the flick features a post-apocalyptic setting, vampires, garlic, mirrors and Vincent Price.</fullReview>

I managed not to see the Price version until I was 38, at the Boston Science Fiction Film Festival. I must say it blows Omega Man out of the water.Where Omega Man comes across as camp (Look at Heston's swank bachelor pad) Price's tale is dark and shadowy. Compare the hovel that Price's character allowed his home to become. I can't think of a more affective scene in sci-fi than when price is staring into the gorge at his daughter's flaming corpse, restrained by the soldier's statement that his daughter is down there, too.When this film aired at Boston Sci-fi 31 (Last night, in fact) it boasted a title not mentioned anywhere else I've seen - "The Dead Walk at Midnight".</fullReview>

I am a major fan of the book, and, having seen both films, must say that "the Last Man on Earth" is closer to the book..."The Omega Man" is extremely, extremely loosely based on the book. Anyone that says "The Omega Man" is based on either this film, or on the book, should look much closer. My only real fault with the film was the ending, as it strayed too far from the book.

		<fullReview>Vincent Price has always been an acquired taste for me. I remember in the Seventies he had a goofy kids television show that relied heavily on his horror persona. It lasted for a few years and died. The movie "The Last Man on Earth" is alive and well and living in the public domain.The movie is bleak from the start. The shots of an unkept city, lifeless, and littered with corpses will knock your shoes off. So be careful where you walk. And don't go out after sunset. Never. Price is wonderful in playing a disheveled man on the brink of insanity. His haggard look and stooped posture goes miles in conveying his deep sense of loss. Richard Matheson's novel,the original source, was set in Los Angeles. But this film was lensed in Italy. I think the move across the pond was beneficial in creating its creepy atmosphere. The locations chosen reveal streets, cemeteries, and buildings of worship that all look a bit strange to the American eye. Even the trees and cars come across as being from another land. Not the United States. But a world where the dead could walk alongside the living. The undead shuffle along like patrons in an after-hours club, but they are still ghostly and menacing. They lust, like vampires, after the blood of Price. He in turn spends long hours and endless days wielding a mallet and stake like Barry Bonds. Only later will Price discover the secret behind the plague and his ultimate fate. He cheated science but in the end he payed the final price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading the storyline about the movie "Last Man on Earth" that was to be broadcast on TV the other night I couldn't help but notice the similarities between that film and the movie "Night of the Living Dead". I started to wonder just who copied off from whom between the two movies.Checking out the IMDb for "Last Man on Earth" I saw that the movie was released in 1964 and "Night of the Living Dead" was released in 1968 so that settled my curiosity about the two films. As I started to watch the movie in the very beginning of the film Vincent Price, the last man on earth, was in his house and right on the wall was a makeshift calendar. It's on that calender that Vincent Price kept up with what time of the year it was by marking off the days of the month. The calender showing that the events in the movie took in the future. Vincent Price's calendar had on it the time that the film took place as late September 1968! Some four years into the future from when the movie was made. This got me thinking again about "Night of the Living Dead" which was released in 1968 the same time that the story about "Last Man on Earth" was to take place. I again checked the IMDb to see the exact date that "Night of the Living Dead" was released and saw that it was released on October 1, 1968! Practically the same time that the movie "Last Man on Earth" was supposed to happen! Did the people who made "Last Man on Earth" know something? Sol</fullReview>

Known for his suave speaking voice, Price deftly handles a script that is nearly one long voice over. The story of a last human fighting legions of zombie/vampires is classic and timeless. It's fun to watch and adheres to the novel much more than big budget remake The Omega Man with good ol' Chuck Heston. I also prefer the B&amp;W imagery to the splashy colors of Omega's exploitation-y film. My only complaint is that no one has remastered this film for DVD in all of its widescreen glory. The only version available is on a Diamond Double Feature with House on Haunted Hill and is full screen. Widescreen re-master or not, as far as Price films go, it's a perfect 10!</fullReview>

The direction by Ubaldo Ragona and Sidney Salkow was also great. I loved every minute of this movie. That is, until the end. The way I first became interested in this movie was through the novel "I Am Legend." Even though the adaption is fair, Last Man On Earth is at least a closer screen adaption of "I Am Legend", than Omega Man. What were the screen writers thinking. In both movies the endings are the same. But they are so different from the book and so horrible, it almost ruins the whole movie. The movie was on the right track until the end. But if you overlook the end it is great.For those of you that like Vincent Price, check this out. For those of you who enjoyed the novel "I Am Legend", check this out.

		<fullReview>Operating off a budget that makes "The Blair Witch Project" look like a big budget studio release, "The Last Man On Earth" is a very lovely, though sometimes loose, adaptation of Richard Matheson's rightly regarded classic novel, "I Am Legend". Price's speciality was always in playing characters who were both menacing and menaced, so the role of Dr. Robert Morgan fits Price like a glove. While it is plain that the plague victims are monstrous, Price seems to be even more so, running around in the daylight, staking helpless victims while they sleep. He is both a tragic and pathetic figure...so distanced from his humanity that he can't seem to comprehend what his literary counterpart in "I Am Legend" understands by story's end: "Normalcy was a majority concept, the standard of many and not the standard of just one man." And yet, I can't but think of the novel's last lines as I watch the film's end: "Full circle, he thought while the final lethargy crept into his limbs. Full circle. A new terror born in death, a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever. I am legend." Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Matheson wrote a wonderful short novel called I Am Legend, about one man left in a world of abundance, desolation, lonliness, and crowds of slow-witted nocturnal vampire-like beings. This novel has been adapted for the screen twice to my knowledge, this film The Last Man On Earth and The Omega Man. Of the two, this film is much closer to the novel in terms of plot and mood. This film has been maligned by many. Criticisms notwithstanding, this film is a very good little film. It explores the lonliness and desolation of the Matheson novel in depth, and Price does a workmanlike job of playing the main character. The abundance of life for one person is better explored in The Omega Man, and this film had some budgetary concerns possibly making that line of exposition somewhat shortchanged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>having known Richard Matheson for a long time, and having heard him speak at endless science fiction conventions about this movie, Omega Man, and his novel I am Legend, I can say that he grudgingly accepts this film as the most faithful adaptation of his book. I believe it is the Only adaptation that could be made from his book, in the 1960's. Why? Because those were innocent, and more culturally conservative times in Europe--Italy. The movie hints at all of the things the book could say, as a book--but titillates them so we "get the gist" but are not explicitly shown them. For instance: Morgan/Neville instantly and quite realistically to me, it seems, falls "in love" with Ruth. Why shouldn't he? here is another living person--female, and gorgeous too! He's been alone sexually and romantically, and companionship wise, for 3 yrs of end of the world, and who knows how long before that, when Virginai his wife died. Also, the Dog--whatta brilliant form of direct translation from novel to screen! Ultimately, as a writer, I feel this film is perfect in spirit to the source novel, and perfect in terms of showing an "average Joe" surviving a monstrous situation. That Morgan/Neville is not a Heston like juggernaut with an arsenal at his command, and is not a former military officer, is wonderful. Price plays Morgan/Neville as simply a guy who freakishly got lucky and who now has to hold "the world" together, even though he's just a man. I love the comment he makes when -Spoiler Ahead- he needs to replace his car: "The convertible would be nice, but I can't think of luxury--A hearse is what I need-this station wagon will have to do!" Compare this to Heston in Omega Man-- he Only drives convertibles! Brilliant in it's delineation of the source novel, brilliant in it's characterizations, and in choice of star-Price is a perfect Morgan/ Neville. And the two women are gorgeous, and engaging, and Bettoia (who plays Ruth) is both sexy(in her ankle boots and tartan skirt) and tragically lonely, filled with longing and what becomes tragically futile--hope that she and "Robert"(Morgan-Price) will "fall in lov and live happily ever after" Awesome, and one of my all time favorite films!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best adaption of 'I Am Legend'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A plague has turned the population of Earth into vampire-like creatures of the night. Except for one man who is immune to the disease. He fights a daily battle for survival against these creatures, always with the hope of future companionship.The Last Man on Earth is the first cinematic adaption of Richard Matheson's novel 'I Am Legend'. It has subsequently been remade a couple of times since. The book was an interesting one in the way it combined a sci-fi premise with a traditional horror one, while also focusing strongly on themes of isolation and loneliness. It is a very early example of the sub-genre known as post-apocalypse or pandemic to be precise in this case. As a result it feels quite modern for its time and most probably served as something of an influence for the later genre-defining classic Night of the Living Dead (1968). It stars Vincent Price in the lead role. Despite this being a horror film, he is not necessarily the most obvious actor for this film as his over-the-top style seems at odds with the somewhat melancholic aspects this story demands of its lead character. Yet, despite these initial reservations, Price puts in one of the strongest performances of his career here and shows what a versatile actor he could be.It's not a perfect film though, as it never really generates much tension despite a set-up that has lots of potential for suspense. It's similar in this way to the later adaption The Omega Man (1971), in that the vampires make for somewhat surprisingly feeble monsters on the whole and never threaten as much as they really should. Unlike in that Charlton Heston film though, at least here they are not philosophical beings and do at least have one sole objective to kill our protagonist; it's just a pity that they usually attempt to do so in such clunky and easily-avoidable ways. That said this film is the only adaption that is brave enough to have a dark ending which serves this version very well and works better for the story as a whole. But despite the horror material, much of the focus here is on more easily relatable themes such as loneliness and isolation. Part of the success of the film is that the audience can put themselves in the shoes of the protagonist and imagine what they would do and how they would cope.Shot in crisp black and white, it looks great. There are many shots of deserted cityscapes which give off a very effective ambiance. There is an oddness to these, in that despite the film being set in America it was actually shot in Rome, meaning that we often see distinctive Italian architecture which always seems a bit off. It works quite well though, in that it merely adds a layer of almost dreamlike strangeness to proceedings. On the whole, this is a good, albeit flawed, movie which is quite original in approach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had fond memories of this iconic film from childhood, and it's stood the test of time.Vincent Price is perfectly cast as Morgan, seemingly the last man standing after a plague wafts across the ocean from Europe. Morgan leads a hellish existence three years into his plight."Another day to live through -- better get started," he says upon awakening to a routine of bludgeoning zombies in their sleep during daylight hours and fighting stick-wielding automatons at night.In rare moments of respite he'll watch home movies from the time when he had a wife and young daughter (both of whom succumbed to the deadly bacterium).The filmmaker does an excellent job of creating an eerie, nihilistic setting for this film -- people who died in their tracks on the steps of public buildings, a church sign reading "The End has Come," Morgan's hand-scrawled calendar in a squalid apartment.Morgan hopes for another sign of life, desperately speaking into a ham radio: "If anyone can hear me, for God's sake, answer!" On one level, the movie is dystopic science fiction, yet on another it speaks to the loneliness of the human condition. Morgan can be viewed as an Everyman going through the motions of life in a pitiless struggle to survive.There are poignant scenes, such as when he fruitlessly tries to save his blinded child, who nevertheless suffers and slips through his grasp.This film ends on a surprisingly dismal note. I hadn't remembered Morgan's fate from my earlier viewing.The Shakespeare who penned MacBeth would approve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hardest was to rate this movie. I thought 6 was too low and 7 seemed too high but given all the good points it has I think it is justified even if I don't think I will watch this movie anytime soon. So it is an apocalyptic movie with Vincent Price as protagonist, a scientist in a world full of infected people. When the infected people die they eventually come back as living dead. They are called vampires but resemble zombies more (because they are slow, weak and pretty dumb) and it looks Romero might have gotten his inspiration from this movie to make his Night of the Living Dead. But a lot of the vampire features are there: the vampires can't stand daylight, are allergic to garlic, have no reflection and can be killed by driving a stake through their heart. The whole story is told in a narrative way since Price's character has no one to talk to most of the movie. By means of flashbacks we get to know how he and the whole planet (well that's my guess) has gotten into this situation. I'm aware that I am Legend is some kind of remake or more recent adaptation from this story but where I thought I am Legend was rather stupid this "original" was much more effective to me. Tragic ending which might have been fitting after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Underrated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A deadly airborne plague is infecting all of humanity except for one person: scientist Robert Morgan (played by Vincent Price). Despite working desperately for a cure at the "Mercer Institute of Chemical Research" he and his colleagues are unable to find a vaccine. The contagion spreads and eventually he becomes (from his standpoint) "the last man on earth." Rather than reveal the most crucial parts of the story I will stop right here and give my impression of the film overall. From what I understand this was a low-budget movie that was filmed in Italy and went largely unnoticed by the public and critics alike. Personally, I thought it was a good movie but it definitely had some faults. First, other than Vincent Price and Emma Danieli (who played his beautiful wife "Virge") the actors were pretty much forgettable. Additionally, I didn't particularly care for the "flashback scene" where he thinks back to the events that happened once the plague reached his location. At least not at first. Only after further thought did I realize that it was probably the best way to include some of this much needed information. Likewise, even though it was satisfactory, I wish that there had been an "alternate ending". Since I haven't read the book the movie was based on ("I Am Legend" by Richard Matheson) I don't really know the exact reason the ending happened as it did. I just think it could have been a bit better. Also, while I don't mind movies filmed in black &amp; white I would have preferred that it not be as grainy as it was. But again this was a low-budget film and perhaps there wasn't much choice. These faults aside, this is a very underrated film which might pleasantly surprise some viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Last Man on Earth was a movie I watched while out looking for some good or decent vampire films. Based on a story called I Am Legend, The Last Man on Earth stars Vincent Price as a scientist and sole survivor of a disease that wiped out the world's population and turned many of the infected into zombie-like vampires. Price tries to protect himself by barricading his home at night and coming out in the day to slay a vampire or two.Admittedly some of the acting isn't what it should be, unfortunately including Price's. I didn't really buy him as a vampire slayer, particularly when with minor force he stakes a vampire who was awake and saw him coming. Sometimes when the actors spoke emotional lines their emotions weren't totally believable. And of course, it's a rather large coincidence that when an epidemic creates real vampires, the old legends that they're repelled by garlic turn out to be true. Nevertheless, the action and story eventually sucked me into the film. It is quite suspenseful and at the same time a very sad movie. Price plays a man who lost his wife and daughter to the disease. His wife came back as a vampire, and while I would have liked to see how that was resolved, the movie works without explaining how Price survived her attack.In one scene he laughs at fond memories and then breaks down crying. He sights a living dog and feels a need to capture it. It turns out this wasn't for scientific curiosity (how did it survive?) but just a desire for companionship. The dog is awfully frightened by the vampires while Price tries to comfort it, telling it everything will be all right and they'd have happy times. Sadly, this turns out not to be when Price discovers the dog is infected and has to stake it. This was a dismal, grim aspect of the story. And it's rather striking he'd say everything would be all right when so much bad has happened- I guess what he really meant was that things couldn't get any worse.Don't get me wrong, though, it's not just the death of the dog that broke my heart- when Price is told many of the vampires he's killed were in fact living people, it's a shocking moment. The Last Man on Earth may have problems, it may be a bit manipulative, but it's still a decent movie that probably served as an influence on the legendary Night of the Living Dead (1968).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price carries a fair movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For three years, "Robert Morgan" (Vincent Price) has been trying to survive against those infected with a plague which has turned them into vampire-like zombies. It appears that he is somehow immune to the strange affliction.During daylight, he goes out and kills those infected with hand-made stakes. Then, at night, he stays locked up in his house until the morning comes again as those infected try in vein to break into his home.Once a scientist trying to find a cure for the disease, "Morgan" is now just trying to survive.This is not the best movie I have seen recently. However, just to watch Price is worth it.Price carries this movie for most of the film by himself. He is the focus for most of the story, and handles it well. The audience can hear his thoughts as he goes through the day, and it's done really well. Price uses his voice wonderfully in the voice overs, and makes the movie pretty intriguing.The big problem with this movie is that the infected are characterized as vampires. Yes, they are repulsed by the scent of garlic, and can't be in the sunlight. However, they can't stand looking at their reflection. Vampires, on the other hand, can not be seen in mirrors. They are more like zombies in my opinion.The atmosphere is fairly creepy in this film. Many times, Price is the only person on camera. In many of these scenes they are enhanced by Price's voice overs. You can feel how lonely his character is by not only his dialog, but how he performs on screen. With his movements, he shows a man who is desperate to survive, but is exhausted.One problem in this film is the cast during flashback scenes. They are just not believable in these roles. A couple of the actors did not sound like they even tried to make their performances believable.Another problem was the audio. During many scenes, the voices were obviously dubbed over.The music and many camera angles really helped enhance the film. Sometimes the camera was limited to the space of the sets, but was used very well. The music really isn't memorable in this film, but helped enhance the scenes.This movie is not scary at all. Just a little creepy. The violence is very mild due to the time it was produced. I would not suggest this for real young children who get creeped out easily.It's not a perfect movie, but it is a pretty good time-waster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Film..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first adaptation (of three)of Richard Matheson's classic novel "I am Legend", and could arguably be called the best. This version, released in 1964, starred horror king Vincent Price, veteran of numerous horror classics. Price added a certain "macabre emotionalism" to the film that didn't exist in the next two ("The Omega Man" with Charlton Heston, and "I am Legend" with Will Smith). His voice overs reveal a lot about his state of mind, and sense of hopelessness. In one scene, Price's character (in this version his name is Dr. Robert Morgan) is watching some home movies when he starts to laugh, which quickly changes to sobbing. The way the camera captures this is both moving and kind of chilling. The fact that the film is in black and white (in this case) enhances the sense of hopelessness and dread that is weaved throughout this story. Normally I prefer color films, but this is one of the few black and white films where the lack of color actually helps the movie. I also liked the storyline where the "head zombie" was actually Morgan's best friend (and co-worker) before being infected with the virus. This was the only film of the three versions that featured this storyline. Of the three, this also has the best ending in my opinion (albeit similar in result). While watching this film, its obvious where George Romero got inspiration and some of his ideas for "Night Of The Living Dead", which was actually released some FOUR years later. Overall, this is a classic film that has sadly been ignored by most, and is definitely worth checking out. Of the three "LEGEND" films, this would be my second favorite (closely behind 1971's "The Omega Man"). I'll give this 9 zombies out of 10.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixture of horror and drama, see it at night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't really a straight horror film--not that there aren't some creepy moments, it's quite effective in that department. But there's more here than that, and there aren't enough of those moments to really put it in the horror category. It is also a character study, of a man who's desperately lonely, who's life seems to be utterly devoid of meaning--and being all alone in the world has become a chore, a bleak existence filled with a mind numbing routing. Part of this routine is depicted quite well--with Vincent Price doing his errands, which includes picking up various items at the store and, of course, killing a few vampires here and there and disposing of their bodies. The script, like Omega Man (the remake, as we all know) and its predecessor in spirit, Robinson Crusoe, runs into problems insofar as a man alone basically doesn't have much to do. SPOILERS follow: it takes a wrong turn when other folks are introduced as fellow survivors. Omega man makes the worse mistake since they become a significant part of the plot. Here, it's minor, but tends to ruin the ending. The middle part of the movie, told in flashback, tends to be a reminiscent of movies like "Outbreak" and the first part of "The Stand." But this one far preceded those movies--I'm sure I'm wrong, but it seems to be one of the first plague style movies there was, I'd be curious if there were others that came first which thought through a world wide disease apocalypse. Vincent Price puts in a decent performance--he was a good solid actor, and there are points here that are standouts: One scene is a killer: Vampire/Zombies are attempting to get into his home (Romero must have been taking notes for his living Dead movies--as many others have noted); and of course Price sits back with a drink and listens to some swinging Jazz (badly dated) to drown out the zombie noise. Another effective scene, a real chillder (again spoiler), is where his wife returns from the dead in zombie form, with her dead eyes--I thought it was quite well done. This is a good film--not gonna be your thing if you like straight horror, but very nice if you want some scares and a little thought as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deserves more credit for its place in horror cinema history. I remember the chills I got from watching this movie alone in the wee hours of the morning when I was younger.Some have commented on problems with the acting in the film. This is a valid criticism. What is amazing is that the film holds up despite this weekness. Let me put it to you this way, are you a fan of Vincent Price? Yes? Then let me just say, Vincent carries the movie on the merits of his own style and delivery alone. Add to that the fact that the director has in fact successfully created a very downbeat mood in the film, and you have a great movie!I believe it is unfair to disregard this film on the basis of isolated weaknesses in it. The budget was apparently very low and much of what should have been re-shot apparently could not be re-shot or cut for that reason. This movie should instead be taken as a whole, and as a whole it is a not-to-be-missed under-rated, gem.I consider myself somewhat of a B-movie afficiando of the '50s and '60s era, and TLMOE has ranked itself on a short list on my top shelf for a long, long time.BTW, this film was very recently removed from the "hard-to-find" column on anyone's search list.

		<fullReview>Robert Morgan is your typical family man with a beautiful wife and small child. So far his life has been for the most part pleasant and without any great stress. Things begin to change when one of his fellow colleagues (also his closest friend) shows him their local newspaper where he sees word of a deadly plague in Europe that is already claiming the lives of hundreds. He remains both sceptical and optimistic, even after people in his greater Los Angeles area begin to show symptoms of the disease. His optimism turns to alarm, especially once he begins to see bodies of once what were his neighbors taken away by the authorities for disposal. His dilemma is even made worse when his small daughter falls victim to the disease and is frustrated due to the inability to find a cure for her. He begins to believe what his close friend told him earlier: some of the "dead" are still somehow alive and have transformed some way into some sort of vampiric creatures who wander about at night and seek blood from weaker victims. Thinking he is the last man on earth not infected with the plague, he embarks on a pro-active campaign of seeking out and destroying these creatures by day and then retreating to his well boarded-up and stocked home by night. This is a true classic as Price gives a wonderful performance as the desperate, lonely and still hopeful and determined to survive and overcome what his world has become. This gem of a movie has earned a respectable place on my movie rack and should be added to yours as well!Just don't forget the pop corn and soft drinks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for reasons that are lost on me, this movie has been unfairly neglected for as long as i can remember. it may not be the most realistic looking film ever made, but it has a very chilling atmosphere and duplicates almost perfectly the tragic and bleak feel of matheson's superb novel. vincent price gives an above average performance as robert morgan, and you can tell that he does not think of this one as just another b movie he acted in because he needed money. some of it appears hokey and ridiculous, but the flaws are minor compared to the overall quality of the movie. this is undoubtedly one of price's best and most memorable films, and it far surpasses the 70's sci fi version of the novel, "The Omega Man". (But that movie is a cult classic in it's own way too.) the events in the movie are basically identical to what happens in the book, although some of price's co stars give horrendous and at times even laughable performances (the woman he discovers, for example). even the horror movie fan, however, will find this one a bit depressing. there is not much hope in it at all. nonetheless, this movie is a must have, especially for fans of price and admirers of matheson's monumental horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VINCENT PRICE'S BEST WORK! LAST MAN ON EARTH!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing how a production company with absolutly no budget can put together a film with the class that this little known 1964 feature has. The Omega Man was an interesting remake but, could not even come close to the emotional impact that this black and white motion picture put forth.Vincent Price is the element that brought this tale of a world of the un-dead to life. From the films earliest moments we are transported into a gloomy hopeless void. The key to this films greatness is the acting performance Vincent Price gave. From his voice overs to his reaction shots, Mr. Price was a statue of perfection.One of the films most powerful moments takes place at night, while ghouls are banging at Price's front door he plays home movies, with the aid of a power generator. Near the end of the reel a comedic circus scene plays out. Mr. Price begins to laugh, to the point of being out of control, then with a transformation like none you will ever again see,he bursts into tears.Last Man on Earth has all the element that make a classic film. It leaves you with a sad feeling in the pit of your stomach. How many of todays high budget films can you say do that. Most of them just make you sick. The Last Man on Earth---Thank You Vincent Price, we miss you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what "The Omega Man" didn't want to be: a good adaptation of "I Am Legend." Although I've heard Richard Matheson wasn't that pleased with the results, "The Last Man On Earth" suffers only from budgetary constraints. The ending is altered slightly, and, not quite as effective, but, isn't a disappointment. Also, the bizarre change of character name from Robert Neville to Robert Morgan is inexplicable, but, again only a minor cosmetic factor.The budget problem is a paradox, in a way. It forces the elimination of the lap of luxury Neville lives in in the novel, to underscore how he basically has everything in the world, and only wants to die. The low budget forces a cheaper set, which, if this story were to occur in real life, would probably be more in fitting with someone who was forced to hole themselves up as the last man on Earth.Thankfully, "The Last Man On Earth" keeps the main thematic element intact. There isn't that much difference between the hero and the enemy he fights. They want his blood, and he just wants some kind of escape, either final or temporary, something to distract him from his Hell on Earth. Both he and his antagonists are zombies, all roaming the world for something, anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was circulated widely in the early 70's among tv broadcasters who needed to satisfy some Saturday night programming needs for viewers with hefty appetites for horror. It came out in the era when other horror films such as, "Night of the Living Dead" were captivating audiences. Vincent Price plays a scientist who winds up as the only survivor of a plague that causes vampirism. He battles loneliness, and struggles to fend off capture from goons that have possessed the bodies of his family, neighbors, and friends. This movie is highly likeable for those who desire entertainment from the work of the cast as opposed to the special effects that dominate films today. This film is not appropriate for children under 12. One spoof on this work, is that Vincent Price commented on how the director desired the Los Angeles setting to keep with the novel's version of the story, but settled on Rome, Italy to keep production costs down. One can see the obvious differences between LA and Rome, but it wouldn't matter so someone who never read the novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the three films based on I Am Legend, The Last Man on Earth is my personal favourite. I also liked The Omega Man, though didn't care for the 2007 film I Am Legend. This futuristic horror is very engrossing stuff, slowly paced yet deliberately so with an ending that has always moved me. There may be lapses in logic in the script, however so much compensates. The sets and filming are minimalistic and stark, and this approach adds much to the apocalyptic feel of the story. The score is haunting, the creatures are appropriately creepy, the film is beautifully directed and the story is full of suspenseful yet beautiful atmosphere. Vincent Price here gives one of his more restrained performances, often interacting to little or nothing, very different from the arch yet sympathetic roles that show him at his very best. While also stoic and vulnerable, he shows terror and despair brilliantly.All in all, engrossing with a different but wonderful performance from Price and a real sense of atmosphere. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Story: 1968, three years after mankind was wiped out by a strange disease. Robert Morgan, a former scientist, is the sole survivor. He spends his nights barricaded in his house while the remnants of humanity, transformed into vampires by the disease, come howling at his door. During the day, Morgan combs the city in an effort to destroy the vampires.In 1954, budding writer Richard Matheson wrote a book called "I Am Legend", which became one of the best sci-fi / horror novels ever made. There have been three different films adapted from the book, this film being the first. Matheson wrote the script himself. The film was originally planned to have been made by the British Hammer studios but was canned when it ran into censorship problems. As a result, the Italians took the script &amp; filmed it on the cheap. Where, I hear you ask? In Italy, of course! While this film may have been made on the cheap, as a horror film it does succeed on it's own, limited terms. There is a certain effectiveness to have Vincent Price going about his daily routine, if you call what he does routine, going to a deserted supermarket to replenish his garlic supply, making stakes on a wood lathe, then searching the city, killing vampires as they sleep. The film does have the usual problems associated with many low-budget films, with sound drop-outs, poor continuity &amp; awkward pauses on the soundtrack. The film also preserves the book's ending intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some weaknesses amid strength</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be fair, honest, and to-the-point: I love this film. As many have imagined, it's a fantasy world, populated by one, surrounded by weak enemies, where you are king, at least in the sunlight. Not that your kingdom is so fine, but workable, fashioned primitively from the remains of the old order, a daily chore but more acceptable than the shambles of "civilized man." In a word, misanthropy. Oh, not morbidly so, but certainly in the mind. This is the strong core of the movie- what if? how? what now? The weaknesses are a-plenty, but reside in the story-telling, not the aim. Matheson, the conceptualizer, is a genius. Matheson, the artisan, is not as detail-oriented as, say, an Asimov. That's my opinion. One of the standout flaws is Morgan's "battle of wits" with the living dead. For a start, we can plainly see that he can take on up to 5 "vampires" at a time without too much trouble. This gives him an edge he doesn't use to any advantage, keeping his hunting to daytime and riding out the nighttime sequestered in his home. Certainly, it would be easy enough to rig up a crossbow to shoot stakes into the vampires from the comfort of your own living room (another teenage fantasy?). Why put up with the same vampires every night, or *any* for that matter? As we find out later in the film, iron works as well. With a police armory nearby, one would think that target practice is on the agenda nightly at the Morgan household. It just doesn't make sense that Morgan hasn't even tried to shoot a vampire, just for curiosity's sake. Another flaw is Morgan's daily run to the pit. If the vampires die, then presumably they don't live again, as we see when Morgan discovers the iron spears through some living dead he himself did not kill. So, why not leave them where they are? Or place them in a heap somewhere else? The main reason I question Morgan's motivation is that his daughter was thrown into the pit, so why replicate that experience daily? He's an educated man.. he should know that he's driving himself mad slowly. Of course, that *could* be part of Matheson's message, but I doubt it. In the same vein, I wonder why Morgan doesn't pick up stakes (pun intended) and move to different house, area, city, or country, just for variety's sake. I understand familiarity with surroundings, one's reluctance to give up one's home, etc, but it seems like Morgan is in a tomb of his own making, an atmosphere suited to Price (Premature Burial, et al) but not to the freedom afforded the last man on Earth. We might say that he's stubborn, or perhaps it hasn't occurred to him, but I have a hard time believing that Morgan hasn't even conceived the idea of moving. Even staying put could have variety. Again, just shoot or stake Ben and your nightly routine is different. Morgan states plainly in the film that he will kill Ben when he finds him in the daylight. Why wait?Other plot devices are forgivable: cleaning out the city square-by-square, using only station wagons, having fresh garlic at all times, having knowledge of blood transfusions (he's a chemist, not a hematologist). But, all these things won't stop me from enjoying this movie again! Just thought I'd point them out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very hard to judge a film from over 4 decades ago because as movie goers we are warped by the current standard for films. Plus I am only recently a fan of old Black and white films. On top of that this is my first Vincent Price film!! This, however, completes my I am Legend Trilogy following seeing Charlton Heston's Omega Man (see my review) and Will Smith's I am Legend (see my review.) All three films are based on the original novel by Richard Matheson. Supposedly this version is one that follows the story to a T. Definitely The Last Man On Earth gives a different spin to the story that the other two don't even touch. The film still tries to give us a feel for what Robert Morgan's daily life is with no one else around although it comes across as a little dragged and boring but then when you finally get to the story of how and when this plague started and what Morgan's life is like since then, you really get involved in the story. The unfortunate part is the story drags a lot and then the important stuff is rushed through so it feels like you're missing a lot of the pieces of what you need to know. It feels unbalanced between being bored and then being rushed and it's too intense of a story to do that with.Vincent Price is very good as Robert Morgan, a man inexplicably spared from this ravaging vampire disease (although he does give one explanation in the film.) Price is a little monotoned, and doesn't really fit the vision of who I'd imagine for Robert Morgan, but he still does decently and he commands a certain screen presence. He doesn't come across as creepy or scary as Price is often known so that's a plus. Much like the other versions of the novel Price more or less is alone in carrying the film although this version of the novel has far more supporting cast than the other ones (especially the most recent I Am Legend.) The supporting cast is good but no one really stands out as being terrific which is unfortunate because the idea behind the film is tremendous and almost shocking but no one gives a truly stunning performance.Directors Sidney Salkow, and Italian director Ubaldo Ragona seem a little fresh in their style like they don't really know where to go with it and that's unfortunate. Salkow comes from Television and the movie really does feel like more like a pilot than it does a feature length film without ever giving you enough details to just be one full film. The real gem in this movie is where it takes the main character and the twist at the end of the film which really is something completely different from any other version and really does come as a shock in the end. Basically if you're a Black and white film fan or a Vincent Price fan then maybe it might be worth checking out but it really isn't going to impress you a great deal. The films based on the novels got progressively better right up to the current one which released on DVD today!! 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GOOD Vincent Price flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The forerunner of Charlton Heston's "The Omega Man", this film is actually much better than Heston's remake. Its more brooding, the plot line is better, and the psychology more sound. Certain aspects of the thing were dropped in Omega Man that would have been better off kept. The "vampire cure" being the most prominent. Remakes and comparisons aside, this film is very good. Price shines in his role. He rightly conveys the despair involved. Being the last man would need to be a difficult position to fill. But fill it he does, with all the pathos you'd expect if the situation were real. The other players? Good. Emma Danieli as the wife, Christi Courtland as the daughter, Franca Bettoia as the girl caught latter in the film, and Giacomo Rossi-Stuart as Ben Cortman ( best friend turned worst enemy and vampire/zombie ) all do their part and do it well. Analaysis? Well worth the Price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a mysterious plague wipes out all the people on Earth, a surviving scientist (played by the late Vincent Price) does what he can to survive in apocalyptic America. His foes, which are humans transformed into bloodthirsty vampires by the mysterious plague, try to get to him every night.A creepy music score and imaginative direction are this film's major assets -- those and Price. The opening to the film is good and sets the mood for the remainder of the movie. It also gives you a sense about the main concept of the movie, which is a plague wiping out every human in the world. It's only the end that disappoints.Set in the U.S.A. but filmed in Italy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those who love old horror films this is a classic based on the book "I Am Legend"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film which unlike many other early black and white horror films that America produced does not contain a lot of ham acting. This story is obviously an adaptation of the 1954 novel (I Am Legend) written by Richard Matheson, who among other titles also wrote (What Dreams May Come) and (A Stir of Echoes) also both pretty good films. This film is much more faithful to the novel than (The Omega Man) was and I feel it's the better film for it, I'd recommend that anyone who enjoyed the book should watch this film. The story is based on the premise that a plague has swept around the globe, infecting and killing people who then rise from the grave as Vampires. For an unknown reason (disclosed later in the film) Vincent Price is immune and spends his days fortifying his home, gathering supplies and hunting down and killing Vampires. Definitely one to watch if you get the opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, one of eight in a boxed set, i was just plain flabbergasted.The whole movie was ( in my opinion ) the most entertaining film I've seen vincent price lead. He is good as a hero who was definitely not destined to be one, he's just a working class family man who ended up getting caught up in a situation too big for him to really handle. He was not prepared for this, &amp; it shows. He is starting to go stir-crazy since he has pretty much talked to no one in three years. This is definitely one of his more memorable performances , he definitely gave an inspiring one.Now, one might wonder what makes this film different from the 1973 Charlton Heston film "THE OMEGA MAN", they are most likely ones who have not seen one of them. In "THE LAST MAN ON EARTH", we see a working class scientist in a situation he has minuscule control over, in " THE OMEGA MAN ", he is quite accustomed to it, &amp; is very prepared if they should decide to attack. Although they were both based on the same book, "I AM LEGEND", they are actually very different. But differences aside, they are very similar, both films deal with a disease that mutates humans, &amp; supposedly does so to all but one, they are hunted by those infected with the disease, they are'nt as alone as they think. Both are excellent films, but I'd probably have to lean more towards "THE LAST MAN ON EARTH", it's just more believable. Definitely worth owning. Any self-respecting horror fan should.</fullReview>

The Italian independent cinema was great and Vincent Price in this is masters. i saw an old version of this movie and i think that George Romero before his Zombie's films saw this. i can say that my vote is 10 because i thin that all b-movie are immortal. In Italy in this period i saw only 3 good movie "Respiro" by Crialese, "L'uomo in pi?" e "Le Conseguenze dell'Amore" by Paolo Sorrentino but the b-movie for excellence is "Inseguito" by Luca Guardabascio with a imperturbable and charismatic Fabio Testi.</fullReview>

Too few people people know "last man...".If you've read the book,do not think twice.And if you've seen the movie,you've got to read the novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of this movie. Someone gave the DVD to me as a cheap Christmas gift. I was expecting a low budget version of the Omega Man, or something like the Adam and Eve episode of the Twilight Zone, or perhaps that old Harry Belafonte, Ingar Stevens movie, "The World, the Flesh and the Devil. This movie was a bitlike them, but also it quite surprised me. I really did not expect some of the existentialist plot twists, such as the extended flashback explaining how the hero became the Last Man on Earth or his relationship with the mutant girl.It really hangs together well over 40 years after its release. With a story this good, Will Smith, who is remaking it this year under the original book's title "I Am Legend," should have a smash on his hands next Summer.From "Invisible Man" to "The Fly," "from House on Haunted Hill" to "Edward Scissorhand," lead actor Vincent Price was always involved in low-key, low budget, off-beat but clever films. This is another great classic that is quite delightful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a really good horror movie about the last real man on the planet earth. By day he hunts them down killing them and feeding their bodies to a pit, but at night they come for him and his blood. They are a form of vampires, infected with a disease that makes them rise from their graves. It even makes them abhor their very own reflection and makes them allergic to garlic. In the middle of this one we get to see the beginnings of this plague that has swept across the entire world. Though this movie is very good, it is depressing and rather sad. Someone said the ending was a surprise, but if you have seen "The Omega Man" then the ending is not going to surprise you all that much. Suffice to say both endings suck. However, this movie is very good in spite of the ending as Vincent Price does a very good job as the final man on Earth, I felt badly for him. This one even does a better job of making the streets look deserted than the modern movie "28 Days Later", because at least here we have bodies littering the streets. Definitely worth a look if you can find it. I bought a horror gift back for real cheap that had it in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My history with and around Richard Matheson's seminal contemporary vampire novel, "I Am Legend," began with the renting of "The Omega Man" in my childhood (surprised to see boobs and gore in a PG-rated film, as well), the film that pitted Charlton Heston against a mob of sun-fearing, philosophical albinos, driven underground by a plague that's swept the earth. The film was decent, but curiosity led me to seek out the source novel (which was out of print at the time) and another film adaptation?"The Last Man on Earth" (also OOP on VHS during these pre-DVD years; of course I knew nothing about the underground bootleg circuit that may have been able to furnish me with a washed-out print).Only last year did I finally pick up Matheson's novel (an efficient, well-told tale, if a bit overrated) in preparation for yet another adaptation: "I Am Legend," the title-faithful megabucks Hollywood pic starring Will Smith. And while I was frequently left gaping in awe at the film, it played more like an inflated remake of "The Omega Man" than a rendering of Matheson's text (and given the cast, director, and screenwriters, this wasn't much of a surprise). And now, in the midst of this out-of-sequence chronology, I have finally gotten a chance to view "The Last Man on Earth," which is the most faithful (Matheson had his name removed from the credits, but the script follows "Legend" pretty closely)?if not most entertaining?of the three.Vincent Price once again steps into one of his "Everyman-with-shades-of-eccentricity" roles as Robert Morgan, a virologist researching the causes and effects of a mysterious plague sweeping the world, which transforms its victims into bloodthirsty, sun-dreading mutants. Within months, the population is at once eradicated and evolved, with Robert assuming the titular role. The opening 30 minutes are particularly effective (for some of the same reasons they worked so well in Francis Lawrence's film), simply chronicling Morgan's daily routine, interspersed with bits of voice-over dialog. Even though the film was shot on the cheap, the production values and cinematography is pristine?wide open shots of abandoned buildings, fields, and skylines, with corpses littering the landscape like roadkill?leading to an efficiently-established sense of desolation that's downright chilling.While Price's button-down, Oxford-professor attire establishes him as the closest embodiment of Matheson's literary equivalent (with a methodology that's centered on logic and practicality), his delivery is a mixed bag?his tone can shift erratically, and sound too upbeat in a dire situation (especially in the voice-over). Otherwise, his presence is sympathetic, complex, and anchors us to the story, even when an extended, pace-slackening flashback permeates "Earth"'s midsection.Director Sidney Salkow does a fine job making "Earth" an adaptation as contained and intimate as Matheson's novel, but is also prone to technical hiccups (the poor use of day-for-night) that pull us out of the film. Also problematic is the foreign supporting cast, whose dialog was clearly dubbed (and not all that well) in post-production, leading to line readings that run the gamut from awkward to laughable. That, and the sensibilities of the era keep "Earth" from including more hard-edged versions of the novel's violence and sexuality, thus never fully realizing some characterizations and themes.But despite this, "The Last Man on Earth" is well-made and works on its own merits. As it is the most faithful interpretation of Matheson's novel, it is also the most richly literary, which can be a mixed blessing at times (see: the extended flashback), but leaves behind an experience that carries an undeniable effect, with some food for thought thrown into the mix. (Oh, and it's also an opportunity to see where George Romero lifted an idea or two for "Night of the Living Dead.")</fullReview>

Vincent Price does a great job as Robert Morgon, he shows the loneliness of being The Last Man on Earth and how he's becoming depressed and angry over what's happening plus how much of a chore hunting and surviving from these Vampires has become.The film sees Dr. Robert Morgon being The Last Man on Earth, he's spent three years hunting Vampires so he can find their nest and eliminate them all. At day Robert goes out hunting, killing Vampires and burning them in a pit. He also goes to stores to buy garlic and mirrors since Vampires are allergic to garlic and hate the look of their reflections in mirrors. At night Robert stays in his house listening to music and getting drunk so he can forget what's happened to the world since his own wife and daughter were killed by the plague. One day Robert meets a dog and tries to help it but the plague has already taken it, when he's going to bury it he finds a young women and asks her to come with him. In his home he soon discovers she's a Vampire but not like the one's outside, she's a half human half Vampire and she's part of a society that wants to start over from the start with earth. She tells him that Robert has been killing her people as well as the other Vampires and he's classed as a legend to them, a Vampire hunter that must be killed and tonight they're coming to kill him. Robert creates a cure using his blood and heals her but they must try and reason with the other half Vampires and give it to them before they kill the legendary Vampire hunter Robert Morgan.The Last Man on Earth is a great sci-fi classic that should be seen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price carries low budget film well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an extremely low budget and rarely seen film and I think one of the reasons is since it's Italian the distribution wouldn't be as readily available. This is the first version of "The Omega Man" from Richard Matheson's story "I Am Legend". The low budget actually helps the film with its black and white cinematography to create a bleak and desolate landscape. Vincent Price is the sole survivor (or is he?) who during the day runs his errands of food and gas and dragging the bodies of the undead that he has destroyed to a giant firepit. But once the sun goes down he has to be barricaded in his home with his generator because the vampires come looking for him! In one creepy scene one of the vampires is his dead wife. Supposedly its in Los Angeles but it was filmed in Rome. Vincent Price shows again that he can carry a film with hardly anyone else around him. Not all actors were as adept at doing this but Price's theater experience enable him to do just about anything on film. The man was a great actor and even in low budget European productions like this, he shines!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 1960s most underrated S.F./horror movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up on 'The Omega Man', and as much as I love it, and still enjoy watching it to this day, even a fan of it will admit it is fairly silly stuff. 'The Last Man On Earth' was the earlier attempt to film Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend', and it is a much grimmer, nihilistic movie, with no albino bikers in sight! Matheson surprisingly enough wasn't pleased with this version, even though it is much more faithful to his book. Vincent Price gives a strong performance as scientist and family man Dr. Robert Morgan, the only survivor of a dreadful, devastating plague. The book's pseudo-scientific explanations for vampirism are largely ignored, but apart from that this is an excellent adaptation of the source material. Obviously filmed on a miniscule budget it still manages to be chilling, atmospheric and very, very bleak. Lovers of 'The Omega Man' may be shocked at just how dark this movie is. More than one person has pointed out the similarities to 'Night Of The Living Dead' in certain sequences. It seems almost certain that George Romero was familiar with this overlooked movie when he made his own horror classic. I won't argue that 'The Last Man On Earth' is as good, but it's a movie than deserves to be seen by all science fiction and horror fans. A seriously underrated movie that still packs a punch all these years later!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Has Moments of Interest..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE LAST MAN ON EARTH is a slow, lumbering film that is elevated by inventive photographic techniques and a strong performance by Vincent Price. As the film opens we are told that the world has basically ended, that a plague has swept all the lands. The bad news is that the quickly spreading germ cloud turns the exposed people into vampires. We meet, whom the film suggests, is the only survivor on earth, a Dr. Robert Morgan (Price). Now Morgan has taken it upon himself to rid the planet of as many vampires as he can. He goes out during the day to track and stake the long-toothed badies, discarding them into a large fire pit. Morgan also collects garlic, crosses, and mirrors for the defense of his decaying home. It is revealed, through a stylishly book ended flashback, that Robert was a scientist who lost his wife and daughter in the madness and even now, three years later, he is haunted by the fact that he was not able to save them. Morgan is immune to the disease, although he seems to combat morbid self-pity more than the forces of darkness. One day he is shocked when he finds a woman (Franca Bettoia) out alone in the daylight. I'll stop here only to say that the situation may not be what it seems and that Morgan may discover that he is not, in fact, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH! As I mentioned above, Price is (mostly) effective in the lead role. During the present day scenes, he is convincingly worn-down and harried. However, during the flashbacks, he struggles somewhat to paint a portrait of the normal family man; the writing here is not the best, and Price's persona as an unctuous villain counteract these scenes. I kept expecting the Morgan character to kill his wife and child, burn down the house and then flee to Mexico, where he would kill some Mexicans, then burn down some churches. Typecasting in movies was much worse during the first half of film's history and Price became known for his darker roles as time filtered out much of his other work. It would be into the "other work" category that THE LAST MAN ON EARTH would heavily fall. The story is a hybrid of science fiction and horror elements which, however, never really finds a workable balance on screen. The film is overlong and many of the sequences become static or pointless as the events slowly progress towards the increasingly surreal conclusion.THE LAST MAN ON EARTH is mostly overlooked in favor of Price's more straightforward genre work (THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, THE FLY, various adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories) and the story fails to be either good enough, or bad enough, to be memorable. It is worth viewing if one wants to glimpse the origins of films like THE OMEGA MAN, LIFEFORCE, or 28 DAYS LATER; although there are several screen versions of this same story that predate the 64' incarnation. It is also a fine example of that postwar "altered world" genre that film historians are always on about and which, they contend, reflect the fears of an impending nuclear threat that was prevalent at the time. THE LAST MAN ON EARTH will be useful as trivia (or as an erudite reference) at least. It should also prove mildly engaging if you happen to catch it on late-night television and are not expecting too much anyway. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my review of the recent remake of I AM LEGEND I made the point that Richard Matheson's source novel is probably unfilmable for several reasons . Having recently seen this 1964 adaptation which sticks to the story rather closely my fears were confirmed There's nothing more difficult than to make a solitary literary character cinematic andaudience friendly . Thought processes are turned in to expositional voice over and all screen writing gurus agree that you should never use voice over to tell a story and THE LAST MAN ON EARTH is full of expositional voice over . What makes it worse is that original author Richard Matheson ( Writing under pseudonym Logan Swanson ) co-wrote this screenplay . Couldn't the story have started with the plague sweeping across America thereby eliminating the need for any exposition ? We could have started the story from the beginning with the audience discovering the plot turns as Robert Morgan discovered them ? A much better way of narrative storytelling It's not just the storytelling that's the problem , it's the production values too . TLMOE was filmed in Italy and the director Ubaldo Ragona seems to have been influenced by Italian Neo-Realism . Can there be a more tedious cinematic movement than Italian Neo-Realism ? The directing doesn't make a fantastical story anymore credible it just makes the on screen events drag along at a snail's pace . Indeed there seems to be an abrasive clash of styles as we're shown slow burning visuals alongside cheap horror gimmicks such as intrusive melodramatic music . There's other niggling things too like a child who looks like she's at death's door and her mother wondering if she should be sent to school ! Things like this makes characterization ridiculous Since the film revolves around a major protagonist that the audience have to latch on to it's imperative that an actor of charisma is cast and I'm afraid that Vincent Price is not that man . He's not helped by the banal dialogue he's given " Everyday there's more of them as I take them to the pit . The pit . The pit " but he's not really the type of actor who can carry a film which explains why he's best remembered for appearing in cheap B movies like this one , but I guess he was fairly cheap to hire So in effect the best version of I AM LEGEND is the 1971 movie THE OMEGA MAN . I say " best version" because it is cinematic even though it dispenses with the essential subtext of Matheson's novel and goes its own way but that movie was very entertaining where as this movie and the recent Will Smith star vehicle prove that good books tend not to make great movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seasoned and well polished actor Vincent Price shows his range of emotions through this living nightmare of a movie. A strain of disease has spread throughout the world turning the masses into vampire like creatures who only come out when the sun sets. For some strange reason Dr Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) is the only survivor at the moment as he hunkers down nightly in his home filled with exposed wires playing jazz records and even watching home movie on his projector. Meanwhile outside his front door are the downtrodden Vampires with clubs banging and yelling his name to come out. During his days he gets on his HAM radio calling out "KOKW calling. Is anybody out there?" as the sound of static fills the air.The look of dismay on our Doctor's face as he faces another day alone among the living dead. Then off to his garage as he pours petrol into his generator to power up his workshop and makes wooden stakes from his lathe. Then off to the supermarket for fresh pungent garlic to keep away the nocturnal intruders.Then he checks his map for the hiding areas where our vampires for the most part are sleeping. Then our good Doctor pulls out one of the wooden stakes and with mallet in hand drives it hard through their hearts.With each hit Dr. Morgan keeps score of each strike.Unfortunately its like removing grains of sand from a an endless beach. There are so many yet to destroy. Then he carries a few bodies to his station wagon and drives to a flaming pit. Dumps the bodies into the hole for cremation. Then it's back home to prepare for the evening's festivities as the vampire neighbors commence their onslaught. This has been going on for three years as Dr. Morgan labels his makeshift calendar as he slashes the days gone by. Price narrates the beginning scenes as the Lone Doctor tries to make sense of the demise of the Human race. Morgan gets philosophical with deep thoughts, " I can't afford the luxury of anger. Anger can make me vulnerable. It can destroy my reason and reason's the only advantage I have over them." Wednesday night is movie night in the Morgan dwelling as our Doctor sits alone and watches on his projector. As the movie unfolds Morgan flashes back to a normal time before the strain hits of Birthday parties and family. The films bring instant joy and satisfaction as he starts to laugh and then as the reel ends the laughing turns to sobbing as we hear the bangs and yelling from the outside. The movie goes through the sequences of the disease as Morgan's who is employed as a chemist works diligently and feverishly for a cure with no results.His town or city which is not mentioned has the vinous including his daughter Kathy who is stricken as we see the poor child dis oriented, sickly and blind calling out for her Mommy and Daddy. Speaking about Mommy,Virg, (Emma Danieli) she is also afflicted and it's a matter of time before she screams and shouts,"I CAN'T SEE!" the final stage before the transformation. This horrible situation is bestowed upon our Doctor who tries to bury his spouse naturally only to have her come back to the front door covered in dirt looking at Morgan if he was a juicy piece of meat. That explains the flaming pit. It's Dr. Morgan against this Topsy turvy world of nocturnal carnivores. Is there anyone out there besides these creatures? This story was written by William Leicester and the screenplay was written by Richard Matheson who's name is associated with horror shows on Television. Twilight Zone, Outer limits and Thriller. Matheson has also written the novel for the color follow-up movie The Omega Man. The Last Man On Earth started the ball rolling for Zombie apocalypse genre which a few years later with the sleeper, low-budget classic by George Romero Night Of the Living Dead.

		<shortDescription>Depressing slice of post-apocalyptic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of three filmed versions of Richard Matheson's classic tale I Am Legend (the others being THE OMEGA MAN, starring Charlton Heston, and I AM LEGEND, with Will Smith), THE LAST MAN ON EARTH has strengths and weaknesses in equal measure. On the plus side, the film achieves a real sense of true horror. This is not the jump-in-your-seat kind of horror though, but a heartfelt feeling of isolation and despair felt at the situation Vincent Price's character is in. Unfortunately, the subject matter of the film is hardly one to make the viewer happy, so it leaves a general depressing tone to the proceedings, but then again that's the point, isn't it? Vincent Price is on top form as the stern and resolute survivor who is plagued (no pun intended) by responsibility and memory of what has happened, and his dulcet tones are perfect for the narration of the story. Filmed in Rome, the locations are all authentic too, and they add hugely to the feel of the film and the grand isolation of it all. There are some action scenes interspersed through the film, generally fights with vampires, but the camera tends to cut away at the deaths instead of concentrating on them. There is also a terrific finale where Price is being chased by the half-vampire squad intent on gunning him down, and a stomach-thump downbeat ending.The images of the vampires knocking at the windows and trying to break into the house is a very bleak, hostile one, and it has recurred since in the cinema, most notably in Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, where hordes of white-faced (or green-faced, if you watch the colourised version) zombies try to force their way into a deserted farmhouse to eat the survivors trapped inside. On the down side, the simple nature of the film means that it tends to get bogged down in character study in what is essentially a one-idea movie. Also, some scenes veer on boredom, especially the drawn out scene where Price remembers the events leading up to his situation, which seems to have simply been added in to fill out space. These flaws are not important however and they don't affect the film too much overall, leaving it a thought-provoking, if depressing, under-rated classic. Well worth getting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you forgive some bad makeup one of the best depictions of the end of the world ever committed to film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Price starred in this first adaptation of I Am Legend about the last survivor of a plague fighting the vampired that resulted. Cheap and creaky, I've seen this film a couple of time over the years. Its far from perfect (6.5ish out of 10) with bits of it being just plain silly, in particular some of the vampire makeup. Still the film has some real creepiness in it thanks to its moody photography that makes you believe that the world has ended.Very few end of the world films look this final and none of the remakes can even remotely match it. Putting it on last night as the movie to fall asleep to I quickly realized it was a bad idea.Definitely worth a visit for the atmosphere even if the story and make up wobble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morgan...can you hear, Morgan?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as people might like Vincent Price, I for one only liked him in this movie and this movie only. As for the movie itself... not so much as everyone else. True yes is the fact that it is the closest without going astray from the source material it is based on, which is good considering many adaptations will unceremoniously add random elements (i.e. anything by Uwe Boll) to deviate the story into something that looks overall silly and pretty lame. Mind you though I'm not a very big fan of the movie, however, for a few reasons.The vampires are slow, pretty dimwitted, and don't seem to prove themselves to be really scary. I'm almost for certain that Vincent Price had access to heavy powered artillery, George A. Romero-style, he'd plow through all of the vampires to be on his merry way. For every other actor besides Price, the dubbing (or is that their real voice?) is pretty comical besides the vampire chants.It's towards the movie's end that all flaws are now forgiven, and one can finally understand it as well as accept it. For everything else... I find myself leaving the movie on while I drive around town picking up groceries instead, coming back to see the movie when the action starts to pick up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an avid classic horror movie fan and I must say, this is the best horror movie I've ever seen. The plot is very solid and it's full of the cheesy horror movie music I've come to love. The main "enemies" i this movie are.....well, "zompires" as I like to call them. They are not intelligent, and they stumble, and have the hunger for human flesh like zombies, but must avoid garlic, sunlight, crosses, and their reflection like vampires. And, the only way Dr. Morgan (Vincent Price) can kill them is with a steak to the heart and then incinerate them in a huge fire pit. Enough with my rambling, if you have about 10 dollars, go buy this film, House On Haunted Hill will most likely be sold with it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of this film before until a few days ago. I love Vincent Price and almost all the films he was in (even the silly Roger Corman movies) but this movie I found to be a true gem. Based off of the novel "I Am Legend" this movie right away shows Price in a desolate world where a plague has wiped out almost all the population and in return leaving vampires. This movie is more of a character study than anything else. The mood of this film is rather depressing and can be frightening at times. Also, the film was remade in 1972 going under the name of "The Omega Man" starring Chuck Heston. But from other reviews I have read that version of the movie was not much like the book at all. I have not read the book but it's my understanding that "The Last Man on Earth" is much more like the book. I highly recommend this cult classic to just about anyone who loves the movies. 9 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romero claims "Carnival of Souls" was the influence on "Night of the Living Dead" (which came out 4 years later) but I'm betting THIS was the "real influence".There's too many references that match up to NOTLD....a guy trapped in a house, undead creatures trying to eat him, paranoia, the "virus that sweeps the world" angle.Price delivers a decent "Vincent Price" performance; not "Theatre of Blood", but good. The Italian actors are fair at best, but what sets it apart is both the "Omega Man" sense of loneliness of Price (the Heston film would come many years later and wasn't that good) and the eerie shots of the "vampire zombies" banging on the door AND SPEAKING (which wasn't done until 1985's "Return of the Living Dead"), calling for Price to "come out....come out, Robert!" The ending is rather lame, as it was in Richard Matheson's book. But it's all atmosphere, so no harsh criticisms.</fullReview>

But Romero's film pushed it to a whole new level.This is an average film. It doesn't move at a pace that has the viewer hanging onto the edge of the couch, but it is interesting enough to keep you in there waiting to see how this is going to turn out.

		<shortDescription>First Adaptation Of "I Am Legend".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Price stars as Dr. Richard Morgan, the apparent sole-survivor of a world-wide plague that has turned humans into vampire-like creatures that come out at night, trying to kill him. He has barricaded himself in his home at night, but ventures out in the day to gather supplies, and kill any of the "undead" he can find. He will come to discover that he isn't in fact the "last", but he may as well be...Based on the famous novel by Richard Matheson, film doesn't really succeed, despite a good performance by Vincent Price. Script is full of holes, and becomes dreary and ultimately unsatisfying, even unintentionally funny at times. Has really good source material that explores and attempts to explain vampire lore, and the reasons behind it(like garlic and mirrors) but this is barely covered. Has some atmosphere, but not enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The history behind this is pretty fascinating. Well practiced writer makes books with the intent of having them filmed. He invents the notion of a virus (sometimes called a germ) that kills people, but they revive as vampirelike, slowwitted killers. Many vampire qualities are preserved: aversion to mirrors, intolerance for sunlight, need for blood. This movie was more than five years before Romero started the zombie genre, clearly borrowing and de-sciencing.The film was made in Italy because of problems that Hammer was having with US censors! Yes, folks. True. The original author was so appalled by this adaptation, he removed his name.You will likely find the actual movie unsatisfying. It was remade more successfully twice. But there is some interesting narrative history. We have three movie versions now, each with superficially similar endings. In fact, on the "I Am Legend" DVD, we have a rather lovely alternative ending, so four.The narrative effect is radically different in each of the five cases (including the book). In this case, our survivor is a research physician, someone who had been working on a cure before the catastrophe. After the massive infection, he does not spend his time on further research. Rather he takes it on himself to kill the vampires and burn the bodies of the dead. This he does with wooden stakes and it is no accident that Vincent Price plays the doctor. "Doctor" in this narratives hearkens back to the conventional Frankenstein and Dracula narratives. Before the noir genre congealed around the detective, the doctor ? the man of science ? was a contender for our default on-screen surrogate.Apparently, in this movie, the undead kill each other for food. Unexplained is why these second-time victims need to be burned.All of the versions end up with humanity possibly being saved. The alternative ending for the later movie is the most satisfying, but this film has an interesting twist.The doctor is immune because on a tropical trip he was bitten by a presumably weakly infected bat, giving him antibodies. He only thinks that his blood could be valuable late in the game. The scientist in this version is not on a quest to save lives. There is no role for science in the story, only to set up the story, explaining things. The ending is ambiguous. Our hero is by some in-betweeners, infected people who have a temporary treatment. But we know a woman survives who now carries Price's antibodies. Will she be used, or will the in-betweeners prefer the state they have? We don't know. I will not give spoilers for the following versions, but will note that here there is no quest, no intent to understand, nor desire to help. So the sacrifice is wasted. We seem to need to know that body was spent for something desired.So, not a good movie, but interesting as the place where the zombie myth and genre started. The term was around in film since 1932, but would not be applied to this phenomenon for five years.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If "Night of the Living Dead" bored you to death...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely a low budget movie when it comes to image and sound quality. But apart from that, it's actually a quite good b/w horror movie. It has much, much more plot and not so terribly long boring scenes as the slightly younger cult classic "Night of the Living Dead" - and another thing that separates it from such movies is that it has a good actor for whom the leading role fits like a glove: Vincent Price, with his somewhat sad, spooky voice. He does his job very well. The story isn't told in a linear way, which is a good thing since the movie - being a genre movie and all - doesn't offer many surprises in that department. The viewer finds out more little by little. The low quality and the lack of colours actually make the movie experience stronger. Perfect quality is not often the right element for horror movies, many cineasts would affirm that. I was hoping for a somewhat more entangled ending, but as a whole, I liked the movie a lot. Not as a memorable film regardless of genre, but as a low budget horror one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fairly Restrained And Intelligent Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And you thought that YOUR daily routine was a monotonous drag? Just check out what poor Robert Morgan has to do every day, in the 1964 chiller "The Last Man on Earth": sharpen some stakes, go garlic and mirror shopping, burn the bodies on his front lawn at the local firepit, and hustle home by sundown, before the plague-transformed zombie-vampires start trying to break in. Talk about your daily grind! An American-Italian coproduction and obvious influence on George A. Romero's 1968 horror classic "Night of the Living Dead," this B&amp;W CinemaScope film has been made on the cheap and features some terrible dubbing. These drawbacks are not helped by the 16mm print on display on this DVD. Still, the picture has many fine things to commend it. Vincent Price is truly excellent in the lead role as the last man standing. The film's use of location shooting, featuring unusual, bleak backdrops and weird architecture, is unsettling (where WAS this thing filmed?); the lurching zombie-vampires are pretty darn creepy; and the flashback scenes with Uncle Vinny's wife (a woman who apparently did NOT say "I wouldn't marry you if you were the last..." well, you know) and daughter are nicely touching. Although the film is not nearly as science based as Richard Matheson's 1954 source novel "I Am Legend" (whose hero's name was Robert Neville...why the change?), it remains a fairly restrained and intelligent affair that nevertheless provides some chilling moments. For example, I defy you to not get goosebumpy when Virge returns to the house...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty typical, low-budget schlocky type 1960's thriller starring - who else - Vincent Price as "Morgan" - a scientist who seems to have been immune to a disease that killed everyone else on the planet, and who now has to struggle to survive against the mutants who come back to life as vampire-like creatures after dying from the disease. I've never been really sold on Price, but he did a pretty good job with this part.The story itself has a number of inconsistencies, the most significant of which revolved around "Ruth" (Franca Bettoia) - the woman he discovers still alive. Since she was infected like the rest of her group (which had found a means of controlling the disease but not curing it) I wondered why it was that she was able to be out and about during daylight hours. She suffered from all the rest of the symptoms except that one, and clearly the others who were like her weren't able to be out after sunrise, either - so why was that symptom strangely absent from her? That was never explained, which leads me to believe that it was just a deliberate plot oversight to get her character into the movie. I also found the whole "vampire" thing too weird. This disease - which Morgan calls "the vampire germ" - causes symptoms exactly like those of Hollywood vampires? They are repelled by garlic, can't look at themselves in a mirror, can't be out after sunrise, and Morgan kills them with a wooden stake through the heart! Too weird, in my opinion.Still, not a bad time-waster, and clearly a forerunner to "Night Of The Living Dead." 6/10 (As an aside, this movie came to me in a collection of what are otherwise Bela Lugosi movies - why was this included? - and it's wrongly identified on the package as the 1924 movie of the same name, but which is a totally different story. A bit confusing to say the least.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price is legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic I Am Legend, The Last Man on Earth is evidence of how a compelling actor can carry a movie all by himself: this time it's the unforgettable Vincent Price.What's funny is Price is oddly cast - some would even say miscast. With his aristocratic look and cold demeanor, he really has nothing of the "average guy faced with extraordinary circumstances". And yet he captures the viewers' attention with his trademark charisma.Price stars as Robert Morgan, last survivor of a plague which turned all other humans in vampire-like beings; each day Morgan follows a creepy "seek and destroy" routine to eliminate the creatures, but spends every night besieged in his house.The movie is an elder brother of Night of the Living Dead, a grandfather of modern zombie flicks such as 28 Days Later. Do not expect visceral, frantic action, though; this is horror of the disturbing, unsettling variety.The Last Man on Earth is not flawless: while I was never bored, I did not find it particularly scary, and the low budget shows. Still, Matheson's brilliant premise and Price's charisma save it from mediocrity.The source material was later adapted in the 2007 Will Smith movie, which was everything this one wasn't (high-budget, action-heavy, with a stupid ending unfaithful to the novel).6,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a good movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this movie in a 50 pack of movies, I had seen it once when I was little, but i wasn't old enough to appreciate it back then. So I took it out of the box and watched, and watched it, and watched it...First of all, this little movie is based upon the book "I AM LEGEND" by Richard Matheson, author of the book "Stir of Echoes." He also wrote the book "What Dreams May Come" later made into the Robin Williams movie...Anyway, the movie starts out with our hero, Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) waking up to another day in the life of being the last man on earth who is not infected by the killer vampire virus...He goes about narrating his daily chores, telling us how he's the last one left and how 'they' come by night. He lives in a barricaded house in what appears to be Los Angeles after a devastating war.I don't want to give anything away, so that's all I'll say about the story. But if you watch it, it's very similar to the movie "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD," made four years later.In fact, upon interview the director of NOTLD admitted that this film was the inspiration for his famous NOTLD, but instead of vampires, the director took a turn with a new creature: The Zombie.Also, it should be noted that this movie was remade in 1971, as "THE OMEGA MAN," starring Charlton Heston, I haven't seen it yet, but I've heard good things about it.And, as if that wasn't enough, the movie is being remade AGAIN, this time as "I AM LEGEND" starring Will Smith and Johnny Depp! That should be interesting to see, I'm excited. Coming out next year...Anyway, back to the subject of this movie, it's very good and it's fun to watch, I'll never grow bored of watching Vincent Price getting mad at the record player, that's really priceless.All in all, I give this little movie a 10/10 because it's a classic that shouldn't be forgotten. If you see this movie, I promise you, you'll never forget it, it makes quite an impact on your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An underrated gem that predates Night Of The Living Dead!. it's very atmospheric and quite creepy at times. This is all Vincent Price's show and he carries this film on his back, but the rest of the cast does good as well and the finale is great!. for the first few minutes it does not have any dialog but it's still very interesting and it's almost like Vincent was Narrating the story. The direction was excellent. Sidney Salkow&amp;Ubaldo Ragona do a splendid job here moving the film at a very good pace creating lots of dark atmosphere, with some very cool camera work even with it's low budget. There is a tiny bit of blood here and there. The Acting is GREAT!. Vincent Price delivers another Top Notch performance he is wonderful here and i rooted for him all the way! i felt his pain and felt sorry for him! and what happened to him in the end wasn't right!. Franca Bettoia did well with what she had to do and had okay chemistry with Price, wish she had more screen time though!.Emma Danieli did fine in the flashback scenes.Giacomo Rossi-Stuart annoyed me here and was very selfish!. Christi Courtland is okay as the daughter. Overall I suggest you watch this little gem! ***1/2 out of 5 highly recommended!</fullReview>

A friend of mine bought a DVD collection which happened to contain The Last Man on Earth and was all like "Let's watch it!" and of course, since it had Vincent Price, I jumped at the opportunity.This movie scared me. The first 10 minutes may have been the freakiest 10 minutes of my entire life. I don't scare easily, especially with older movies.Now, I do admit that Vincent Price's acting in this film was a bit sketchy, and everybody else was pretty much horrible, and the quality of the film decreased as it went along ... but who cares. This movie is worth it for the first 10 minutes alone. If you payed 20 bucks for this movie, you'd hardly be paying what it was worth.

		<fullReview>Wait one garlic-picking minute here! Who put Vincent Price in an Italian art film? How did South Central Los Angeles materialize in Downtown Rome? What, no Bloods or Crips? Where did he purchase that Chevrolet station wagon? Richard Matheson, the man of prose behind this exercise in international horror, should be rolling over in his grave--if only he were dead. Robert Morgan, his protagonist, however, is alive and well and staking his claim to turf overcrowded with unwelcome creatures of the night. The rest of humanity is not so fortunate. As for Morgan? He has one rule: no vampires allowed!I'm having somewhat of a good time poking fun at this dark, atmospheric tale sitting somewhere on the edge of the end-of-the-world genre. But I have crossed my heart and covered my eyes more than once in anticipation of my next cathartic viewing of this film. Vincent Price is wrapped tighter than a mummy on psych medications. He spends his days dispatching the poor, infected souls to limbo. He spends his nights listening to classical music, watching home movies of his family and friends, and drinking himself into a drunken stupor. His hangover the next morning doesn't hamper his chores: buy gas, stock up on groceries (garlic, mirrors), and clean the front lawn of corpses. Depressing work. Monotonous. But necessary for survival. The series of flashback scenes, peppered throughout the film, reveal a man's past filled with a loving family, good friends and a satisfying career. Life. And all this was erased by an infection carried on the solar winds. He was different from the others. And he knew it. They were a new breed--and they did not want to play with the last man on earth. Tragic.</fullReview>

Price is very good with a role that is better suited to the square jawed type but the sense of isolation and devastation is translated pretty well from the book all things considering. Despite any short comings that may be stated here the supreme test is repeatability and for me I've seen this film about twenty times. Word has it that they are now re-tooling it for Will Smith.

		<fullReview>This is something we have all thought about. What would it be like to be left alone on the planet. I recall the Twilight Zone episode with Burgess Meredith, he of the thick glasses and bibliophilia. This is a gut wrenching movie. Bob, played by Vincent Price, takes on the role of cleaning up a small city which is infested with the living dead, following the rules of vampire lore (stakes through the hearts, mirrors, garlic). He begins every day like one punching a clock and goes about the business of disposing of the bodies he finds in his front yard. His is an endless task, for, as he drives his Chevy station wagon through the streets, there are endless corpses to pick up. At night all these things come to life and pound on his doors, saying they are going to kill him. In some ways they are not that formidable. They seem to have little strength. Even with two by fours, they can't seem to make a dent in the house. He can also subdue them pretty easily, though they have strength in numbers. We get to see how this all happened in a flashback. He had a lovely wife and daughter, when an airborne plague wiped out the world. They succumbed to the disease. He is a freak because whatever is in his blood has made him immune. The awful thing is that after three years, nothing has changed. He makes his obligatory call on his radio and never gets anything but static. Of course, at some point we know that there will be others. They have formed a vigilante community to so the same work Bob has been doing. Very much like "Night of the Living Dead" he becomes a part of the mass of humanity (or non humanity)The movie suffers from a little bit of carelessness when it comes to the realities of such a life. On a low budget, all things can't be caught, but a bit more thinking could have gone into this film. Price's acting is pretty good. It's a tour de force for him and he pulls it off pretty well. Still, some of what he does could have been streamlined a bit. Just the fact that he holes up in that house when efforts could have been made at security is a bit hard. On the other hand, it's hard for him to let go of the past. The scene where the little girl goes blind is really heart wrenching. Overall, it's quite captivating and pretty good as far as it goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most faithful adaptation but not the best version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie was the most faithful to the novel I Am Legend, it isn't the best of the three adaptations but its not the worst either. Vincent Price doesn't do a bad job by any means and he gives us a creditable performance of someone who has been through hell and is showing signs that the sheer monotony and persistent danger of his daily routine is beginning to get to him, and the use of narration isn't badly done and it could be argued that it's needed as for the most part its just one character on his own and it lets us know what is going through his mind. The main aspect of the movie which undermines it and to a certain degree the creditably of the protagonist is the sheer slowness and clumsiness of the vampire's, that when Robert Neville, sorry excuse me, Robert Morgan is caught out after dark you don't feel he's in any real danger as all he has to do is just push them out of the way to escape. The differences from the book don't really help the story and if anything make it less compelling, making Robert Morgan a scientist I felt made him less relatable at least to me, from his book counterpart and changing the disease from an incurable plague to a curable illness took away one of the more frightening aspects of the story, and while I won't give the ending away but again changing this from the one in the book again I felt took something away from the story. That said though there were bits of this movie which were done well, the part of Ruth was well done as we got the perception of someone who was in fear of her life when she encounters Morgan, and when the chronic survivors come out in force and mercilessly slaughter the vampires and go after Morgan near the end was done rather well, as the ruthlessness of was very much in evident like it was in the novel, and the pursuit of Morgan added a dramatic feel to the climax to the movie. All in all this was a good attempt at an adaptation but I felt it was undermined by a number of poorly done elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rome's Gray Dawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rome's gray dawn stood in for your typical and unnamed American city in the filming of The Last Man On Earth. Robert Lippert who when he had his own studio in America produced some of the worst trash in cinema history came up with an interesting cult item that stars Vincent Price who certainly is no stranger to cult pictures.If this looks familiar it's because probably more Americans have seen the version of the same story that Charlton Heston did in The Omega Man. In his version Los Angeles is clearly Los Angeles and there's a bit more explanation as to why Heston is immune from the plague that's killed off most of the world and left him seemingly the only survivor.For myself I much prefer The Omega Man. The issues raised in the film deserved the A budget treatment that it was given in that production. But The Last Man On Earth certainly has its supporters. But when something is cheap, it's cheap and you can only cover up so much with little production values. Price however does give a good performance as a civilized man bewildered by the reduction to savagery shown by the survivors. His fans will certainly appreciate the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tad overrated, but still a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Man on Earth" is a tad on the overrated side, but there's still plenty to love about it.**SPOILERS**Several years after the fall of humanity due to a virus, lone human Robert Morgan, (Vincent Price) awakens and goes about his normal routine, clearing up the dead bodies littering the streets and changing the defenses on his home to make sure the vampires don't get him. Accidentally staying out too late one day and is barely able to make it back home in time. Troubled by memories of his family, Uncle Ben, (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) and wife, Virginia, (Emma Danieli) which only reminds him of the cause for the worldwide disaster the virus caused. Finding a source of life amongst the ruins, he hurries to clue them in on his discoveries while also surviving the onslaught of the creatures.The Good News: This isn't that bad of a film, and it does feature some good moments. There's an effectiveness to the silent ritual that Price goes through in the opening scenes, where he's replacing the garlic and mirrors around the house, sharpening stakes on a wood lathe, refurbishing his garlic supply out of a giant walk-in freezer in a department store, then staking various vampires throughout the city, that really spells out the society in that time very effectively. The fact that there's really no one else left is spelled out and never really becomes an issue, which makes the suspense and atmosphere present all the more effective. There's never really a time when the film has that quality again, and it makes the film that much stronger. The finale is a nice mini-series of action scenes, being the beating outside the house, the chase through the decaying rubble, the seclusion inside the museum and the final resolution playing out nearby. There's a lot to love about it, effectively ending the film with a great band that is nicely appreciated. The creatures, when on-screen, do have a rather eerie quality to them, with a mildly distorted face and a blank look to them that effectively makes them creepy without having to see them all that much. The few times an accurate look at them is offered is enough to get an idea and then it moves on, never allowing us to get familiar with them and that's the most effective attitude possible. All these add up into a nice little film.The Bad News: There's really not a lot wrong with this one, but what's there is pretty big. The film really ends up dying in the middle section, where it stops dead to feature this long, drawn-out flashback that simply drags on and on and really kills the film. There's really no need for it to feature as much family drama as it does, yet there's plenty of them in the sequence, as well as a large amount of back-story that goes into the making of the virus that started the film. Rather than use it to draw a series of conclusions about, there's a huge repetition of scenes that go on much longer than they needed to be. The scene doesn't need to be a half-hour long, as the film spends most of the time dealing with that issue. The pace of it is way off. The other real big issue with the film is that, for being called vampires, the creatures behave much more like zombies. There's no real neck-biting, they all move slowly with very basic movements and a lack of fangs. There's even a scene late in the movie where the creatures are shown to be able to be killed with other instruments not normally associated with vampires, and they work on the creatures as well. There's some other issues at work with the film, namely the narration, which don't really harm the film but are a personal pet peeve that won't sit well with them.The Final Verdict: It's not that bad, but there's still a few problems with it. While vampire and zombie fans will be arguing about what the creatures are forever, there's no doubt that the rest of the film is a classic, suspenseful tale that really needs to be seen and is really recommended.Today's Rating-PG: Violence</fullReview>

Seeing this movie again recently definitely took me back to that night 37 years ago when it first terrified me In many ways I Actually found it superior to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD which I saw sometime later.

		<shortDescription>Ready for Tom Servo...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie gets off to a good enough start, with Price's character waking for a "typical" day as the last man on earth: He marks off another day on his handwritten calendar, checks the generators which supply his hideout with light and power, drags away the vampire bodies which appeared overnight. But once the film drops into flashback mode all bets are off: The rest of the cast is God-awful, the script is deliriously bad, and the movie declines into a hoot-fest. This is the kind of picture that needs Tom Servo and Crow to serve up the zingers.While Price acquits himself well enough in this film, over all this is an extremely weak production. There are a few atmospheric moments worth seeing -- the pit where the vampire-zombie bodies are incinerated is creepy -- but mainly this is a poor script filmed for cheaply a few thousand lire in Italy. If you like lines like "the best brains are running through this thing with a fine tooth comb!" you might enjoy watching for the laugh value. Romero's "Dead" movies and "The Omega Man" are far better examples of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Bleak and Chilling, It's Hamstrung by the Occasional Eccentricity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An aging Vincent Price takes the lead in this early interpretation of Richard Matheson's dystopian source material, recently mined by Will Smith in I Am Legend. It's a dark, troubling picture that's far more bleak and unflinching than its contemporaries. I don't consider the '60s to be a terribly fertile period for such eerie, subdued science fiction / horror mash-ups, but despite a few off-putting slips this holds up admirably. Price is miscast in the lead, awkwardly overplaying the emotionless, hollow aspects of the central character, even in flashbacks where it's completely inappropriate. He feels out of place as a doting, caring father - often speaking around his daughter like she isn't even in the room - and that tears away some of the natural sympathy of his plight later in the picture. The creatures that constantly plague him are effectively spooky, so long as they keep their mouths closed. A certain ambiance is lost when the shuffling human monster outside the barricaded window knows your name and encourages you to "c'mon out" in the wee hours of the morning. This was a lesson well-learned by George A. Romero, who's admitted the monsters' portrayal in this film directly influenced his beasts in the seminal Night of the Living Dead a few years later. As an exercise in world-building, this is a broad success. It's tangible, vivid and realistic. The plot flails around absurdly at times, though, and the finale is a mish-mashed mess that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. A strong effort that falls puzzlingly short in a number of different ways, it's remarkable in several others.</fullReview>

Matheson wrote and directed 'Omega Man' with Chuckie H., and 'Omega' still remains the most, kick-ass awesome of all the versions. the Will Smith version was a Luke-warm, tepid, CGI fiasco in my opinion. the only thing the Will Smith version had going for it was a cute dog. not good enough.the Vincent Price movie is definitely worth a look and a must for Price fans and Tim Burton's minions. but if you really want to see the best one of all and a truly awesome horror/sci-fi flick, see Chuckie"from my cold dead hands"Heston in "Omega Kool".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If, like me, you read "I Am Legend" the book and enjoyed it a lot, and then learned that the producers of "I Am Legend" the movie didn't even read the book so you skipped it all together (Will Smith as Robert Neville?? Oh come on!), so you got curious about another movie based on the book called "The Last Man on Earth", well, at least that's what made me wanna watch this movie, than this review is for you.I will keep it short, as I started watching this movie I realized 15 minutes into the movie how silly it was, 25 minutes into the movie I started skipping, it became extremely ridiculous. The makers of this movie kept it very close to the book indeed while often using direct quotations from the book, but they skipped a lot of important parts while keeping other parts that make no sense without the parts that they actually skipped. There were also some ridiculous additions of details such as Robert adding gas and throwing a torch in the burning pit after throwing in the zombies..On many occasions scenes from the movie were so silly that they made me laugh out loud. If you never read the book do not bother with this movie, if you did and enjoyed it this movie will make you laugh for sure, but warning! it will also irritate you. I give it 5 stars for its entertainment value, but you would probably give it 2 stars if you never read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my favorite of the 4 versions, including the novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are now 3 film versions of this story, plus the original novel by Richard Matheson. All of them have a slightly different perspective on the idea of the end of the world by vampirism. But which one is more worthy of honor? For the most part it's a close call. The Smith version is slick, modern, and action-packed with fine special effects. The novel is a rather dark and psychologically complex vision of near-hopelessness. The Price version is well-acted, fittingly oppressive in atmosphere, and has the best story line. The Heston film is of far lower general quality, but has many enduring messages embedded in it. Well, even having read the original novel, I have to pick Last Man on Earth as my favorite of the 4, with the novel being my second choice, Will Smith's version being my third choice, and the Chuck Heston flick coming in with an honored last place finish.The novel is very similar to Last Man, but with a profound twist: In the movie, Morgan cures Ruth before he is killed by the former vampire vigilantes, but in the novel there is no cure. So Neville's death comprises an inevitable and necessary passing away of the old race of humanity. In the film, Morgan's cure is deliberately rejected by the new society through ignorance and brutality, and Ruth becomes the last woman on earth, with the potential for her blood still providing a cure and the rebirth of a rival human society over against the former vampires, who must rely on a daily vaccine to keep themselves alive. Very interesting fodder, worthy of a sequel (which was never made to my knowledge). The identifying of Morgan as a Christ figure at the end is also well-done.Omega Man, beyond its rather cheap '70s TV feel, bad makeup, silly special effects, and gratuitous female nudity, does retain some enduring points. Tony Zerb is a fine villain, as always. The over-all sympathetic view of the Heston character, as the final bastion of human art, literature, science, and over-all culture, and the Christ-identification at the end (which it shares with Last Man) are very moving to me. The vampires in this film are all basically Luddite fundamentalists who want to usher in a new dark age of oppression as their reaction to the evils that brought forth the plague. Heston's character stand's up for the enduring worth of human history and culture against them. This is the film's best feature, even if it's a bit over simplified and stereotyped.The will Smith version falls far short on both story and meaning for the sake of suspense, action, and special effects; most of which are well done and worthy of the film's focus. I liked the more up-beat ending, too; which gives a positive spin on the title. Matheson's Legend was a negative one, with the legend of Robert Neville taking the place of the boogie man within the new vampire society. Will Smith's Legend of sacrifice and cure becomes the starting point of rebirth for humanity. The Christ figure is never overtly revealed, as with Last Man and Omega Man, but it's there between the lines just the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>looks great on the surface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, "The Last Man on Earth" is a very great idea put into fairly effective effort that doesn't quite work. It started out very good, as a few moments, but toward the second-half of the film, it just starts to fall apart with plot points that pop up too suddenly, don't really have much purpose, and the film ends in too much of a hurry.For a long time, the only actor to appear on screen is Vincent Price, who pulled off a fairly good performance as the "last man on earth". However, Price's character, like the rest of the movie, begins to fall apart in the second half. Before then, his character does a good job in performance and his narration works out well saying lines that I did fine memorable. Such as "Three years. Is that how long it's been since I inherited the world? It seems like a hundred million." After a while, his narration ends, and the character begins to lose substance. He should have had narration throughout the film, or not at all.The other character in the film mostly appear to suddenly, don't get enough development, and overall, seem unnecessary. We do have a few good flashback sequences describing the unexpected spread of the plague that will kill off most of humanity, but the characters who are really involved in the story bore us. This secret society that appears in the last ten minutes was really unnecessary.I won't go on for too much about the film. I will just make it brief for my conclusion when I say that "The Last Man on Earth" is a disappointment. It looks good, has a few great moments, had potential, but unfortunately just falls short of being a good film. It was a great idea to bring the original story to the screen that worked out well for the first-half, and then fell flat on its face for the second.</fullReview>

Vincent Price plays a scientist who is working on a cure for a virus than is carried via the air and wind. It finally reaches plaque-like proportions. It kills his wife,child and best friend. Those who have died return as zombie-like vampires. Garlic, crosses and mirrors are attached to the outside of his house at night. By day, he hunts down the undead. He meets someone else who also has survived. There is a twist at the ending so I'll stop here. A well-produced Italian film with the right amount of drama,suspense and horror. A bit more action and it would be closer to a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This first film version of Richard Matheson's book (which I have not read) is a disappointment. The pacing is too languid, the "zombies" (or vampires) are never very threatening and there are long stretches without any dialogue, but also without enough mood to hold your attention. It's just another case of a film that had great potential, but missed it in the execution. It IS historically interesting, however, because, as many others have already observed, it has striking similarities to "Night of the Living Dead", which was made four years later! (**)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critic Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Price Plays "The Last Man on Earth" in a apocalyptic disaster due to a virus that causes everyone to turn into a zombie/vampire.Now I am a huge fan on old corny poorly made classic movies, but I'm strictly writing a critic review. The sound is way off from the characters speaking, you feel like your watching a "Godzilla" movie. Ubaldo Ragona and Sidney Salkow's plot on this movie was slow and boring. Dr Morgan's (Price) flashbacks were to long,you got lost and forgot the story line. Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter completely drowned out the emotions and sound with suspenseful acoustic orchestra in ordinary scenes. Dr. Morgan carries a teacup and occasionally sips out of it but throughout the movie carries it like there's no liquid then takes another FAKE drink. He loads the zombie/vampires in his car but when he unloads them they switched sides, also there's some wig slipping.The acting skills were typical for the era but not convince in anyway for their roles. Franca Bettoia (Ruth) exaggerated her emotions in every scene. The zombie/vampires made zero sense in their roles. In the scene where Price is running on cobble stone away from the vaccinated mutants(on his way to alter to die)could hardly hobble down the road but somehow staid far away from the group that was chasing him.*Note: if you noticed Ruth put on Virginia's old clothes (Dr. Morgans dead wife) she picks out a black sweater to later be in the church with the mutants that hunted him down... all in black sweaters.When Dr. Morgan is /sruggling at the alter and gasping for life (overdone)everyone changed into black sweaters except Ruth who put one on earlier. When they stabbed Morgan it cut scenes from throwing to being stabbed, then when Morgan fell, the pipe that he was stabbed with jiggled back and forth like it was glued to his shirt or placed inside of it.The whole movie was awful, put together terribly. There was no consistent plot and the props were inadequate with the movie. But if we didn't have movies like these we could have never made progress right? If your a fan of old cheesy classics it's a movie for you. If your looking for a good thriller then stay far away from this mess of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omega Man was a poor version of 'I am Legend' only with better set design. Shot in black &amp; white 'The Last Man on Earth' as the look and feel of a great Twilight Zone episode stretched to feature length.The flashback part seems like an easy device but it's a well timed sequence that does break with Dr Morgan monotonous life. In The Omega Man they thought they could be so good as to avoid a flashback and the film was a bore since confronting the zombies was so dull.Eventually The Last Man on Earth could have been much better only with a strong director. The photography is great but the visual rhythm is not on a par with it. But maybe it was to make us feel the beauty of the world had been plagued? On the other hand a movie like Carnival of Souls is almost entirely a director's movie with little substance. May we dream of a movie that would have been a combination of those two contemporaneous efforts? Forget it, the point in The Last Man on Earth is to set the trend of Zombie movies. Night of the Living Dead came only 4 years after and was much more tense and climactic. So much so that director George Romero never achieved the same feat again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mises the Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose that, of the three adaptations to date, The Omega Man is the best screen version of Richard Matheson's I am Legend. This ultra-cheap Italian production seems quite sincere, but it misses the point of Matheson's story and seems rather tame, even for the early 60s. Vincent Price is the solitary survivor untouched by a plague that has turned those who are afflicted into shambling zombie-like creatures with a taste for blood. Price is easily the best thing about the film ? although he's no action hero, as can be seen in the scenes where he's called upon to do anything physical ? which is just as well because he spends a good deal of the film on his own.The film opens with some nicely eerie shots of deserted city streets but, this being a low-budget effort, it obviously lacks the impact of the 70s version (nor the luxury of the CGI effects of Will Smith's effort, which is part of the reason why I believe Heston's version is superior). It must have been quite effective in its day though.Price kills ? vambies? Zompires? ? by day and makes stakes at night while he listens to jazz music to drown out the comedy calls of his former friend and colleague. Every night, this guy and his mates hang around Price's house, crying out 'Morgan, come out!' in a mournful voice. I bet Price's character found it funny too on the first night, but you can't help wondering why he didn't eventually pack up his lathe and move to some penthouse pad like Chuck did.The film seems a bit confused about its message, and clearly misses the point of Matheson's novel. It's almost as if TV writer Bill Leicester had only the scribbled notes of his Italian director to work from?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I'm not wrong, this movie is the first adaptation of I Am Legend, though they didn't name the movie by that title, I guess because it has a different conclusion from the recent Will Smith reincarnation. The base plot is the same: disease, zombies, "last" man, cure. Amazing how this movie is so easily summed up.Despite the lack of effects, the director still does a decent job of creating the ambiance of solitude that the movie needs, though, as with most horrors and thrillers of yesterday, the scares just don't stand the test of time.The main weakness of Last Man is Vincent Price. Not because he's a bad actor, but because he's such a distinctive one. He is prone to overacting but the problem here is that he has a constant voice-over narration to describe what happened and what's happening (since, y'know, people back then were slow and couldn't figure anything out) and even now, whenever I think of the movie, I hear his voice droning in my head. Not the best way to remember a movie that is otherwise a good slice of classic sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Price plays Morgan, the last normal man on Earth, who battles hordes of plague-induced vampires in this adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend." As a child this film never really captured my imagination. Although I loved vampire films, I never found the concept of a plague of vampires convincing. I preferred "Omega Man" -- although now that version is somewhat dated by black exploitative aspects. Now with the new "I Am Legend" about to hit the theaters, I decided to finally read the Matheson novel and give this film a second chance.Loved the Matheson novel. His explanation of the plague of vampires was placed in an interesting of context of trying to reconcile science and superstition. The novel is an existential journey through madness, depression, determination, arrogance, ignorance and ultimately acceptance that he himself has become a monster which would give birth to a new superstition. It builds to emotional climax, which the film fails to do since the script doesn't give the Neville/Morgan character the same depth or intelligence. The film, sadly, attempts to keep the plot but not ideas that infused the novel. It isn't a bad movie, and, it is influential inasmuch as you can definitely see the influence it had on George Romero. Still, it is all text and no subtext.Perhaps the next version of "I Am Legend" will be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Film that spawned 3 imitators. This is the 1st attempt to bring the novel "I Am Legend" to the screen as "Last Man On Earth". Warning bells should be ringing about this film for a few reasons.Reason 1 - Hammer Studios turned it down. Reason 2 - The writer asked for his name to be taken off the credits. Reason 3 - It's in Black &amp; White even though it is 1964.So we're on our guard but hopefully Horror legend Vincent Price playing the lead role of Dr Robert Morgan should allay our fears. He's a character filled with Pathos. From the opening of the film his narrative is filled with misery, loneliness and sadness.He describes the monsters that inhabit the Earth and the precautions he takes against them (Their thirst for blood, hatred of their reflection, fear of Garlic, they don't come out in daylight, he uses stakes to kill them) pretty much sets these monsters in the Vampire category.We see him leave home, taking corpses which he eventually burns. Collecting gasoline for his car &amp; generator, shopping for fresh garlic at a supermarket. We also see him replacing his mirrors, searching the city &amp; staking Vampires (the fact that he uses a hammer on his stake verifies the Vampire theme).As night falls we see a band of the infected attacking Morgan's house with planks of wood, smashing his windows and calling for him to come out. He falls asleep and survives to another day, visiting a church to mourn a grave (it turns out to be his dead wife) but falls asleep and is there when night falls.He is forced to fight his way through the graveyard back to his car (goof! tailgate is closed when it had been open when he left the car) and hurry home (he is clearly driving in daylight) where he manages to get into his home despite being attacked by many infected (lead by the same man who had attacked his house the previous night).He then spends that night watching home movies of his dead wife and child (who we are treated to a flashback memory of), we also discover the leader of the attack was "Uncle Ben" who introduces the idea that the disease was already active in Europe and ready to attack America as it was possibly airborne.We are told this disease is incurable. We then see Morgans daughter already ill and his wife hiding her symptoms from him. Also the theory that the infected are Vampires told by Ben.We watch his daughters condition worsen and life in general getting worse for everyone with bodies being taken from homes to be burnt. Eventually his own daughter is taken to be burnt and when his wife dies he takes her out into the country and buries her himself. Of course that night she returns to their home having risen from the grave. That is the nightmare he awakes from to return to the present day.After replacing his wrecked car (with an identical one) he sees an uninfected dog which he follows. He finds dead infected who had been staked. The dog returns to his home having been injured and he cares for it, raising his morale a little. Of course the dog dies but as he's burying it he encounters an uninfected woman who returns to his home.Her name is Ruth and she appears to be infected and eventually turns out to have a vaccine. We also find out how Morgan thought he got his immunity (from a Vampire bat bite). She warns him his house is to be attacked that night.She turns out to be a spy for a group of infected who are still in control and able to reason, he gives her a transfusion of his own blood that cures her partial illness completely. Morgans house is attacked and he is chased into the night, being shot and injured outside the church where he was mourning his wife.He is mortally wounded and dies in the arms of Ruth, telling her they were afraid of him. She says they didn't know (I assume she meant that he could cure them) and walks out of the church leaving her group behind.It's a pretty weak ending but like all the films based on this book the hero is dead and has cured one person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only for old-school sci-fi and Vincent Price fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While being easily comparable to Monster-A-Go-Go, Last Man On Earth is not without it's charm. The story itself is solid and can be counted as one of the better science fiction stories ever told. The execution of the story is so terrible, though, that you no longer focus on the miserable loneliness and despair, that the movie should have focused more on, of the main character so much as tire of his narrative. The only thing worse than the pacing is the editing, especially in the beginning "death" scenes while Dr. Morgan is hunting the vampires that bare stronger resemblances to zombies than anything. If the director had taken more time and care with the scenes, this could easily have become a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By "dreadful" I certainly don't mean "full of dread". I mean dreadful acting, dreadful dubbing, dreadful pacing, and a complete lack of cinematic flow and continuity. (I'm still trying to figure out why you can see Vincent Price's wife's breath during one of the indoor scenes.) The dinner scene between Price and Bettioa borders on sitcom-like comedy with his "let's just ignore those zombie vampires outside trying to break in" attitude.Price stares intently at the camera and corrugates his forehead now and then. Then he goes shopping for garlic. He tells the audience that he has been alone for 3 years, yet walks into a freezer at the local grocery story full of 3-year old meat without gagging once. And guess what? The garlic is fresh! Yeesh!I mistakenly thought that this would be one of the sci-fi classics of the 1960's. This movie is so bad that you could mistake it for an Ed Wood flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what the big deal is about this movie and why it has such a high rating. I hope that people are not giving it a pass just because it is low budget and super old. The acting was not the problem, the story and character motivation was the problem. What Morgan, the last man on Earth does day to day all through the years would never ever happen in real life if his situation were real. Nobody would stay in one place nor would he/she do anything that would give away his/her location to the vampire zombies. It's just laughable.It was painful to watch all the logic go down the toilet. This lack of logic is unforgivable, even in old naive movie plots. I am flabbergasted...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this flick is a classic. A classical example of what an overrated movie on IMDb is. But you do get to see Vincent Price languishingly walk around a deserted town for an hour and a half, and half-heartedly bury some people. A real must for action movie lovers.Now don't get me wrong. I usually enjoy old black and white films. And by that I mean that even silent films can be fun to view when they're good. But "fun" is the last word I'd use to describe this plot less boring excuse of a movie. There's just absolutely nothing remarkable about The Last Man on Bleh. Watch 'White Zombie' instead, that's an old horror classic too, and a good one at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never read Richard Matthieson's novel, I Am Legend, but know some of his short stories and his work on The Twilight Zone has been consistently admirable. This thing eludes me. The pace is slow, the exposition clotted, the acting below par, and the story depressing.It wasn't until the climax that I realized I'd seen it when it was first released. Not that it made enough of an impression for the film as a whole to be registered in my long-term memory, but I recognized it at once when Vincent Price is trying to escape the mutants and is pelting them with grenades. And I remembered thinking in the theater, "Santa Maria, he's not throwing them like baseballs, he's throwing them like DARTS!" It's not so much that Vincent Price was effete. I mean, the man had fine taste in art and wrote a splendid book of recipes, even though his editor got the ingredients for eggplant parmigiana all fouled up. (Take a second look at the amount of breadcrumbs called for.) It's that Price's range as an actor was limited. I know. Everybody's range is limited. (Woody Allen as Julius Caesar?) But this weak story calls for a dramatic actor of some magnitude as its central figure if the film is to be lifted out of the dismal. It doesn't have much else going for it.Or maybe it's that the story itself, despite its authorship, just doesn't translate well to the screen. The end of the world is one thing. Nice possibilities there, though most of them have already been explored. But must the dead turn into flesh-eating zombies too? That's George Romero territory. And they are afraid of garlic, can't look into mirrors, will die only with a wooden stake through the heart, and only come out at night? Clichés -- every single trait -- after Bram Stoker. Why didn't somebody throw in the crucifix business or a Mogen David? Set the movie in Teheran and have Price spend the whole time searching for some object to turn into a Crescent.Who are these walking dead anyway? They don't rot. They feel sensations because when Price slams a door on one of their arms they howl with pain. And why the wooden stake when thousands of them have just been tossed safely into a fire and meet their personal end? And the mutants machine gun a few who seem to die in proper cinematic fashion. And what do they all have against Vincent Price anyway? Did they run up against the typos in his cookbook? I don't know. Many other viewers seem to think this is a cult film. I've never understood exactly what a "cult film" was. "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" certainly qualified because attending a showing dressed in outrageous gear was a rite of intensification -- at least it was at the Chestnut Theater in San Francisco when I saw it. And I suppose others might be "cult films" if they were minor and unrecognized masterpieces of the genre. "The Last Man on Earth," though, seems to me to be only minor and unrecognized -- period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Remakes Are Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Man on Earth, The (1964) ** (out of 4) Rather bland adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel would be made a lot better in future remakes THE OMEGA MAN and I AM LEGEND. A mysterious plague leaves a scientist (Vincent Price) as the last man on Earth. During the day he goes around looking for supplies while at night he must keeps the ghouls out of his home. He hopes at some point he'll be able to locate other survivors when he thinks he finally has. This movie really isn't bad but there's really no need in watching it as it has certainly been surpassed by the two future movies as well as countless others that borrowed the same storyline and did a lot more with it. From what I've read the film had a rather questionable production history, which ended the film in Italy where it had to suffer with some rather poor dubbing as well as some rather bland sets. The entire reason to watch the movie would be for the performance of Price but he doesn't get to do as much as one would hope. The narration really leaves Price, the actor, sitting on the bench way too many times when it would have been a lot better having him speaking out his thoughts and feelings. He manages to be very effective in various scenes, including those dealing with his families deaths but in the end I think he's a little bit too good for the material here. Another problem is the lack of an atmosphere and I must admit that I was never really worried about the ghouls/vampires as they too come off rather weak here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those few movies that I found almost impossible to sit through. You get the point in the first five minutes -- he's all alone on a vampire-ridden earth where he has to fight for his life every day. I don't understand why he didn't just off himself and let the credits roll? It was badly dubbed and its existence for me only served to prove that Price may have been an excellent actor and writer, but he would do a picture for anyone anywhere as long as there was enough green in it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but why not just watch OMEGA MAN?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Price is just about the whole show in this Italian horror film set in the near future. Apparently, everyone on Earth but him has either died or become zombie-like vampires. And through much of the film, Price does a lot of mundane maintenance-type work--shopping, getting gas, burning the corpses of the dead and killing the occasional odd vampire--then returning home to his ordinary suburban bungalow.If you watch this film, it's very likely you'll think to yourself that you've seen this before. That's because a decade later it was remade with Charlton Heston as OMEGA MAN, though there are a few differences in the plot and overall appeal of the two films. While OMEGA MAN was very high on the "cool factor", had neat special effects and some dandy overacting by Heston that actually made the film campy fun. In THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, Vincent Price is involved in an Italian production and most of the cars, homes and actors look Italian--a very strange thing indeed. Plus, it's obvious that the production company had a very, very, very low budget and the script had some serious logical errors that were worked out in OMEGA MAN. Some of the problems are that there is no explanation for why the virus occurs and why Price in immune, Price's home was easy for anyone to invade and kill him yet they didn't, the vampires seemed brain damaged and too easy to defeat and the ending just fell apart and delivered a whimper instead of a bang. As a result, OMEGA MAN manages to do the unthinkable--it's a remake that is significantly better than the original--more fun, more well thought-out and just better in every respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason why I'm saying this is, because this is more like Dawn of the Dead, than it is like any vampire film I've seen. They'd better called this 'The last man on earth versus slowly moving and retarded bloodsucking nocturnal creatures'.I must say that I was aware of the film's story and that I thought the beginning to be quite interesting, but from there on it became worse. Vincent Price just didn't act good. He was great as a narrator in the film, but when it actually came to speaking on screen, he was almost terrible. The other actors were not better though and the flashback scene was just too long. I must say that after all the excitement that I'd built up since i could finally see this film had gone and the interesting first 10 minutes were over, the film didn't do much for me anymore and I decided to end the experiment after 53 minutes. I just couldn't stomach to finish another stupid zombie film like the original Dawn of the Dead or Night of the Living dead, despite it being slightly better than the previously mentioned films.4,5 out of 10 (with a 4 cast as vote)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dissatisfied with the washed-out version I'd nabbed for a dollar at the local Sprawl Mart (you can't beat the price- unless you get it fer free), I was contemplating plunking down the exorbitant asking price (about five bucks, U.S.) at my usual supplier when Fate stepped in (and Turner Classic Movies) and it turned up on cable. The pristine print was even shown in all its widescreen glory. Well, maybe "glory" isn't the right word... After all, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH just happens to be one of the worst movies ever made- in a laugh-out-loud it's so bad kind of way. (And, just in case you were wondering: I was looking for a decent copy to reassure myself that the film was, indeed, as bad as I thought it was and that my dissatisfaction had nothing whatsoever to do with the pathetic quality of the disc I'd bought.) The superior print aired on TCM did nothing to change my mind. I can't begrudge another viewer his/her opinion. Speaking only for myself: I wouldn't run this one in a post-apocalyptic theater if I were the last man on Earth...To say that it's an odd little film is an understatement. It's so downright amateurish in its execution that it's little wonder that Matheson chose to slap his "Logan Swanson" monicker on it. (In fact, I'm surprised he allowed even that- but it was his book they ravaged, after all, and, I'm sure, he needed a pseudonym to protect his royalties, et al.) Vincent Price (the villain you love to hate) was badly miscast: when he tosses a carton of orange juice aside, he does so with more than just a hint of a limp wrist. A far cry, indeed, from the two-fisted survivor of the book- who, when driven to the edge by the nightly depredations of the living dead, throws open his front door and comes out blasting. When his guns prove ineffectual, he resorts to some down-and-dirty hand-to-hand combat. (Read the book and see.) I must confess that I wept when I heard the news of Vincent Price's death, but I cringe when I watch his performance in THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. That one rests on the shoulders of the folks who turned the scariest novel of all time into a cornballer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very weak movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing about how similar this film is to the awesome Night of the Living Dead, I was sorely disappointed by the large shortcomings of this film. It is at no moment frightening, poignant, or impressive. It is a bit depressing, but only because of the situation Dr. Morgan is in, a situation which is not effectively portrayed at all in the movie. The story is developed well enough, albeit with an unrelated stretch of an ending / climax. Visually, there is a definite similarity to movement and siege tactics of the zombie vampires in this movie and the zombies in N.O.T.L.D., but that is all. The only aspect of the zombie vampires that differs them from normal vampires is that they move and talk slowly and very stupidly. Their obvious difference from standard zombies is their ability to think, plan, and talk, which creates a rather large fault in the movie. The zombie vampires' lines and their delivery bear an uncanny similarity to Sloth, from the movie Goonies, an effect which unfortunately does not tend to inspire fear. As for the film's overall cinematic value, the characters, dialogue, visual style, atmosphere, and attempts at being moving all fall very, very far below par. At least the movie is fairly short.</fullReview>

The use of Zombie-pires just...Well, let's suffice it to say these are neither vampires of legend, nor zombies. They are some mixed up criss-cross of the two. At least, you can see where "28 Days" originated. This is supposed to be a thought-provoking remake of the 1924 film of the same title. While Vincent Price's performance is nothing less than his usual brilliance, this movie just didn't make the cut. Night of the Living Dead, an obvious rip off of this movie, while much better done, had the obvious advantage of having this work from which to spring board itself.If it did nothing more than spawn the Romero run of Zombie flicks, it did its part in the field of horror. But it also had loads of heavy atmosphere and some really decent (if a bit contrived) devices.Morgan, a research scientist loses his wife and child to a deadly virus which is spreading across the planet like a hideous tsunami. Soon, he seems to be the only survivor of this plague. He fills his days with needful tasks, and his nights in a terror-drenched melancholy. If he'd had a flame thrower, he may have had a better time of it.It rates a 3.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is amateurish rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the original novel (RIchard Matheson's 'I am Legend') several times, and the Charlton Heston remake (The Omega Man) is one of my all time favourite films. But this film is awful - the acting is outrageously bad, with Vincent Price as the only native English speaker, and overacting severely since he really has no-one to act against. The 'creepy'scenes of empty streets look like they were filmed at 5 am on a Sunday morning in Ibiza. The direction and dialogue are, needless to say, cheap and terrible, and to compare (as one person did) 'Night of the Living Dead' to this is ridiculous. Several very good and intelligent (and cheap) b&amp;w horrors were made in sixties ('Village of the Damned', 'Children of the Damned' etc) - this is NOT one of them and it's only worth a look if you want to see how bad Italian cheapo's were prior to 'A Fistful of Dollars'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Huge Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been watching horror films since I was a kid in the late 60's. I have never seen this particular version of Richard Matheson's novel though I read countless reviews on it and heard so many good things about it. Finally I purchased a copy last week from Movies Unlimited and sat down this past Saturday night to watch it. All I can say is that I was very, very disappointed in the film and that is being too kind! I found the movie to be boring, dull and extremely slow moving. The acting was incredibly bad and believe me I am being nice about it. The dubbing was so off, the actors mouths were moving and then the words came out. I understand that the film was produced on a miniscule budget, but so were classics like "Carnival Of Souls", "Night Of The Living Dead" and "Strangler Of The Swamp". These three films blow the doors off of "Last Man On Earth". There were some eerie scenes and the grainy black and white photography added to the effect. All in all, a film that was not very terrifying, not well done and terribly slow paced. And let's be honest, who likes their living dead, be it vampires or zombies, to be able to talk? And now the worst for last. What was Vincent Price thinking about when he signed on for this one? I love the actor but I must tell you that his performance was a combination of dull, hammy and over the top. This is a great actor who put in his worse performance in this one. Please, pass it up at the rental counter and whatever you do, don't waste 12.99 to buy it like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many others note, the plot and several scenes are eerily similar to the superior "Night of the Living Dead". The fact that this film came first, and probably inspired the latter film, does not mean this film should be elevated; it is not good. It isn't even original, being another adaptation of "I Am Legend".I found myself wondering how Mr. Price's character is able to hold up in that house for a number of years -- Who keeps the electricity running? How are food and water supplied? Why don't these obviously very intelligent (despite their appearance) ghouls figure out a way to get into Price's house? Well, those are only the beginning questions? Price could have been helped by a bigger film budget. I thought the dog turned in the finest acting performance. The worst performance was that of the crying baby; I guess the baby's Italian cry had to be dubbed into an English cry? **** The Last Man on Earth (1964) Ubaldo Ragona, Sidney Salkow ~ Vincent Price, Franca Bettoia</fullReview>
