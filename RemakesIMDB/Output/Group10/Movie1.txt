		<fullReview>50 minutes into the movie I stopped watching because I wasn't able to handle another second of the characters' stupidity. The actors did an OK job with what was given to them. It's the story and the characters that were poorly written. There are a gazillion movies where dumb idiots go backpacking in the middle of nowhere, but many of them are bearable. However the characters here are unrealistically stupid, which is what makes the movie utterly unbelievable and annoying.here are a few unrealistic moments:- the chicks went AWOL in backwoods Argentina without telling anyone- got drunk in the local pub provoking every horny kidnapper there - got separated in backwoods Argentina because of a chick fight - when the blond tried to rescue the brunette, they had 10 chances to neutralize the Argentinian idiot and didn't (and yes he is also an idiot in the movie, I'm not just throwing names around)- when the American guy was pointing the gun at the two amigos, he just decided to turn his back on them, only to get a bullet in the back. At least he was looking somewhat smart, up until that moment...And to top that, we're supposed to believe that an entire town is conspiring to kidnap tourist girls (which is often the case in this kind of movies.) This aspect is not entirely ridiculous but it's a stretch.I liked the beginning of the movie with all the scenery, but unfortunately that remained its strongest point.The actors had nothing to do here. They were stuck with shallow roles with no room for real acting. This was a big step down for Karl Urban and the two females. This type of movies can work, as long as the story and script are believable enough, without having to reduce the characters to imbeciles, which is just frustrating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And Soon the Darkness is a serviceable "vacation gone bad" thriller. The two lead actresses are VERY pleasant to look at. They bike and sunbathe and run very prettily. But the story is so predictable that it's almost comical, the bad guys and plot twists are apparent from the very beginning, and the protagonists make decisions so stupid that they almost seem to ask for the situation that they get involved in.You should be very familiar with this kind of plot by now. A pair of attractive young American tourists (Odette Yustman and Amber Heard) get separated from their bike tour group in Argentina, meet some suspicious people, get separated from each other, and then one of them goes missing. They're not the smartest of tourists, that's for sure.&nbsp;Even if you can stand the by-the-numbers plot (for Odette Yustman, I can accept a LOT of clichés and obvious plot twists), And Soon the Darkness isn't a very thrilling thriller. There's not a lot of creativity or imagination to it, it's just the same movie we've seen before with some new faces. Watch it if you're a fan of Yustman or Heard, but don't expect a lot.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only good thing about this movie is the editing, the camera work and the sound. The acting is okay, but the plot is shallow. The promise of twists is totally unfulfilled. It is predictable and rather pointless. What a shame. It is one of those movies that seems to have something, but you wait and watch and nothing happens. There is very little to say about the movie. I had to add this filler just so that the review could be accepted for having 10 lines of text. The characterisation is shallow. I suppose the scenery in some of the scenes is rather interesting. But other than that, this is a complete waste of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good things first, some very nice cinematography of the landscapes. Cool looking deserted town that looks like something from a nuclear holocaust. Now that's out of the the way, on to the bad...Clichéd characters. The Ellie character is just plain annoying and whilst I'm not a prude her behaviour just invited trouble - she's in an unknown country surrounded by strangers and acts like a complete whore. The good guy character hints at some promise but is taken out of the equation too easily. No inventiveness applied here, nothing you haven't seen a million times. Plus the female leads look like famine victims, especially Ellie - neither of them would have had the strength to fight off any kind of attack. I don't know if this is what Hollywood considers sexy nowadays but if so you can keep it.Only rent if there is absolutely nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better avoid this one !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am not going to compare this to the original 70's movie as I have not seen it. So, will judge this movie on it's own merit.Who thinks up this stuff ? Two sexy girls traveling all alone through small towns in Argentina ? Really ? While in town they (one of them) decide to sexually frustrate and provoke strange Argentinian men for their amusement ? Really ? Throw in some of the most incompetent human traffickers you have ever seen, a town that completely ignores this and a moody /mysterious American who is creepier than the traffickers and you have a movie ? Really ?The only thing dumber than the characters in this movie is the fact that I actually watched the whole thing.No plot, poor acting, unbelievable story. Need I say more. Did Karl Urban even read the script before he decided to do this waste of time? I guess a paycheck is more important than doing a good, or even half decent movie with at lest some redeeming qualities, which this movie had none of.A big disappointment of a movie where I wish I could get my time back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two young attractive girls are biking through Argentina. They miss their bus to leave and stay a bit longer, when they get into a fight one of them leaves the other by herself. Big mistake, the girl gets herself kidnapped. Now her friend must try to find her.The film never tries to elevate the genre that it is in, nor make it interesting. And Soon The Darkness manages to follow the footpath of every film before it, thus making it boring and predictable. First we have our two female characters. One is obviously a trouble maker and the rebel, while the other is more conservative. Guess which one gets herself kidnapped and which one has to rise to the occasion to get her friend back? The two female characters are played by Odette Yustman and Amber Heard, they fit their roles of attractive young females. The roles don't call for anything beyond that really.The biggest letdown, had to be Karl Urban. His character is somewhat pointless. He doesn't advance the plot, his story line is left unfinished and Urban himself seems to be bored with the material. I like the guy, but he needs to pick better projects than this. Now that I have my biggest letdown out of the way, let me tell you where else this film went wrong.The main reason for the girl getting kidnapped is due to the character's stupidity. The two girls get into a verbal argument, one storms off leaving the other. Who would leave their best friend in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country? On top of that, they state earlier that they were part of a bike tour group, but got lost from the pack? These point in the film had me scratching my head. The film doesn't really know what it wants to be either, it reminded me a lot of Turistas. These characters are in a beautiful location, the film knows this and it is shot fairly well. There are bits of torture, yet the film never steers into that Hostel, or Saw territory. It comes off as very tame, I'm surprised it is even restricted. The film can easily be a PG-13 flick. There are no surprises, you know from the moment you see the characters, who is responsible for what. The film tries to be clever to throw a curveball, but as I mentioned before, we have seen this type of film before and it's obvious where it was going. The film even lacks suspense. The kidnapping scene is poorly done, the climax is also a third rate cat and mouse game. The film fails to create any tension and that was a key element missing from here. Too many things were left unanswered for me. The two people who ran the hotel, do they know anything? Are they in on it? Does the wife try to warn them, but the husband put her in her place? Who knows. And Soon The Darkness peaked my interest, but is failed to excite me. If Karl Urban was not in it, I would never have bothered with it. You should do yourself a favour too and skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Admirable Remake of a Forgotten British Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two young American women (Amber Heard and Odette Yustman) are biking around Argentina. It is a fun adventure, at least until one of them gets kidnapped. Can the other track down the kidnapper and save her friend? Who can she trust? This film is a remake of a 1970 British thriller. For all intents and purposes, the connection could be overlooked and the film would be just fine. While some things were kept the same -- the bicycling, lack of subtitles and a shot of a plane overhead -- much of it was changed. The setting has moved from France to Argentina, the girls' names were changed, and there is a whole new dynamic. This film could have stood on its own.Writer-director Marcos Efron truly does make it his own film, and it helps to have two of today's finest young stars in the lead roles. Amber Heard, at the time of this film's release, was already known and about to be more well-known alongside Johnny Depp and Nic Cage. Odette Yustman, perhaps less well-known, is still a star in her own right.The film is tense, suspenseful, better-paced than the original, with beautiful color and scenery. There is a sexy element, but no outright sex. There is a violent element, but no outright gore. The film is R, but could get by with what I would call a "hard PG-13". Even the torture aspects never enter into the "torture porn" realm of "Saw" or "Hostel", or even "Turistas", and I give this film credit for that, staying firmly in "thriller" rather than "horror" territory.While I would not give it a must-see, mandatory recommendation, it is a great thriller and one of the better films I have seen in a while. I never get sick of seeing Heard or Yustman, especially when they are in their swimsuits. This film earns a B, maybe a B-plus. The Anchor Bay DVD is also loaded with special features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We need to find her before it gets dark".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Workably well-made, but unremarkable pot-boiler remake of the 1970 British version. This time it takes place in Argentina with two American girls on a cycling trip, compared with the original having two British girls cycling in the French countryside. One of the girls goes missing, leaving the other friend on a desperate search to find her. The simplistic narrative is routine as can be, dealing with alienation and paranoia of being a fish-out-of-water. Still rather under-written. While it might start off lousy and not surprise with its lack of twists (as the mystery does eventually loose some steam), it remains effectively sustainable in making you uncomfortable in its foreign surroundings? where it's hard to know just who to trust, as no one wants to get involved even though the suspicions are there that the locals (you know those long stares) might just know what is going on. Desperation and danger fills every inch of space as details become clear for the protagonists. The direction is intrusively slick and pacing slow-going, but this only adds to the unsettling atmosphere and breath-taking mountainous scenery. Other than Amber Heard's commendable performance, the scenic photography also is a true scene stealer. The lush sights are a marvel and only compliment the underlining threat of this idyllically forlorn retreat. After such a sturdy progression and falling into contrived developments, it breaks away in the final acts with some intense cat and mouse moments but never fully tapping in to the suspense of the predicament. The cast give well rounded performances, even though their thin characters are descriptively black and white. Heard is impressive in the lead role, while Odette Annable provides plenty of energy. A disconnected Karl Urban shows up as a mysterious stranger (though foreseeable to where his character's ends up in the plot) and Cesar Vianco (with that icy stare) plays the town's officer. Underdone, but modest travel thriller."He looks? responsible."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Soon The Dullness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing horror movies have taught us over the years, it's "Never leave home to a foreign country or island." The Italian cannibal movies taught is this, Lucio Fulci's "Zombi 2" taught us this, the "Hostel" movies taught us this-the list goes on really. If you go to places your unfamiliar with in horror, you will end up in danger. Well, you can add the new remake of the Robert Fuest film "And Soon the Darkness" to that list.The film deals with two best friends, Shy, virginal Stephanie (Amber Heard) and wild party girl Ellie (Odette Yustman), who are on vacation in Argentina. Well, they miss their bus, and after lazing around in bikinis (not a bad sight I must say), Ellie ends up being kidnapped. So, can Stephanie find her friend? What's with that nosy American man Michael (Karl Urban)? Are the local policeman Calvo (César Vianco) and a guy Ellie hooked up with the night before (Michel Noher) somehow behind this? As you can guess, there isn't that much mystery behind what will happen. Hell, it pretty much shows you one of the villains from the get go. Yep, this is yet another movie with sketchy law enforcement figures involved with shady dealings, the "good girl" becoming the requisite "final girl", and so many other genre trappings that tell you exactly what happens. And that's what's wrong with the movie. Well, that and it's mostly kinda dull, because you know what's going to happen, so it's hard to really invest any interest in anything that occurs. Sure, there's at least two things that are effective (the town of crumbling buildings and dead trees has an eerie ambiance) but the whole thing is written and directed to the point that it feels more like a direct to television movie than it does a serious genre entry.It also doesn't help that none of the actors are really given much to do with their roles. To be fair, they all do fine work (except for Yustman, who I just found irritating), but they're all just characters we've seen before. Plus, we aren't really given much of these people as characters. We know that Michael is a stranger whose looking for his wife, but that's it. There's no other reason to care about him or anyone here.If I could compare "And Soon the Darkness" to another movie, it would be to "Turistas", only without the sadistic edge, and just as uneventful to boot. This movie should have just been called "And Soon the Dullness."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of this crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot as many has mentioned is so stupidly predictable from the very beginning. What really annoyed me though was how it stereotypes American going to developing countries and acting...well like ignorant American tourists just asking to be robbed, ridiculed, and/or raped. I mean, who in their right mind, male or female, would dress up and go to a local bar in a small, little town out in the middle of nowhere.What gets to me most though is this very Hollywood, developed world perspective that all developing countries from Asia to South America to East Europe are dangerous places where deviants and criminals are constantly roaming around hunting and kidnapping innocent, naive American tourists. This is as far from reality as it gets. Well that's Hollywood for you and the 5.2/10 is well-deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty much every horror title these days is getting a low score almost on every critic sites , To me it is very sad because most of us don't even read the critic review ,we just watch the score the movie got and decide whether to watch it or not. I think this movie is one of those movies that no one really got to see because it has low score . If you look closely it has pretty nice cast in it , Yes Amber Heard and Odette Annable are beautiful actresses but hey also got nice acting skills . The plot is pretty unique , i mean i personally haven't seen movie with this story before and i found this story interesting. This movie has clichés in it but still it is very fun to watch and it doesn't get boring all along... I think its underrated and i would recommend it to every one since its mostly Mystery title , i wouldn't call it a solid horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the most original storyline (and yes, I know it's a remake!), but makes for an OK movie.The main characters are as sexy as hell (!!!!!) and are enjoying a bike riding holiday when one of them is kidnapped, leaving the other to figure out what's happened, with little to no help form the townspeople or law enforcement.Unlike others with this sort of storyline, there really is little to no gore or violence right up until the end scenes, but even then, it's not as full on as it could have been.There's probably unanswered questions as to why all the townspeople don't or won't get involved- is it because of fear or other reasons? It's not really explained. Is it plausible? I guess so, but don't know.Overall an OK movie, but not great.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning is about as gruesome as it gets. It's not a horror movie just a thriller. The story isn't that strong but what can one expect for this kind of movie. There are a few mild surprises along the way like a weak hero and an ending that isn't too bad actually. The leads are attractive of course, Maybe unrealistically so. The lovely Amber Heard looks very sweet throughout and Odette Annable is pretty. Some aspects of the story are silly like why would such a pretty girl act so silly in a strange place. Has a good on location feel. Overall see it if you are a fan of the leads otherwise it's just about average for this kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much right, but too much wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st off, I am a HUGE Amber heard and Odette Yustman fan and when I heard they were in a film together, I was very happy and eager to see it. AND SOON THE DARKNESS has a lot of good things going for it, but ultimately it fails to deliver or (which is probably why it didn't get any theatrical love) be memorable in any way.I thought the setup, acting and locations were all great. The problem squarely lies in the direction and script.There was a completely useless "teaser" showing a young woman being tortured (like so many torture porn films before). When you actually learn why these girls are taken, this opening is revealed to make no sense. Strike one.I thought the 1st act did a great job of creating a realistic scenario (albeit 2 girls that looked like Odette and Amber riding alone in S.A. is unbelievable, but that aside, the set up works). The bar scene was particularly effective (although not one South American man hits on Amber?)Odette burst onto the scene with CLOVERFIELD (a film I despised) and then THE UNBORN (which was terrible). She's stunning and displayed moments of great potential in both, I just didn't like those films. This is the best performance I've seen her give. She OWNS the 1st act of this film. Amber's great too, but I've seen more of Amber's work so it didn't need mentioning.Where the film falters is the abduction and subsequent events that follow. It's completely unbelievable. I click spoiler alert, so I will spoil some things. Odette's kidnapped and taken to a burnt out town. This is way too easy for Amber to finally find her. And the girl in the opening teaser was chained, but here Odette's ductaped. The scenes with Amber searching for Odette were unconvincing. She looked in 3 spots (where she disappeared the hotel &amp; then where she was being kept). How Karl Urban didn't know exactly where she was and he'd been there 6 months looking for his missing girl is unbelievable. Why did the Cop pretend to help Amber? He had her alone in his car, at the station? He could have taken her captive several times. She was all alone. She was ripe for the taking. Also, the director should not have included shots of Odette being held captive. We as the audience should think the worst. We knew she was alive.Again, major spoiler...Now, one thing that worked was Odette's death. I didn't see it coming. And Amber being trapped in the cop's car by her own doing was great.BUT... that points out the above note. If the cop was going to take her, why didn't he do it several hours before?It was also WAY TOO EASY for Amber to escape and eventually kill her captors.Overall, I wanted to love this film. But I didn't. I think Odette and Amber are stars and if you like them, you'll want to watch this film. The director, while not having any nudity in the film, does give us some amazing shots of the girls (including several very good close ups of Odette's bottom).I gave the film 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Not Believe the Negative Reviews... because.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well made suspense drama, with exceptional story, very good acting, fine cinematography, noteworthy direction. The 95 minute running time -- unusual in 2011 -- doesn't allow time to be wasted.The movie is set and filmed in rural Argentina, a place few of us have seen, and the problems these two girls face are as unusual to Americans as is the strange setting of the story.Many reviewers have blasted the movie as being hostile and/or discriminatory; supposedly giving a false negative view. Let me tell you our experience in this part of the world.....We rented a car in Iguetzu Argentine to drive to Ascuncion, Paraguay. At the main square in Asuncion, we had car trouble and about a dozen men tried to help. Nice guys seeking a tip, they eventually pushed the car into the garage of the modern hotel right on the square. We got a room and the hotel Reception helped us with the car, we thought. In fact, the car was stolen overnight and the hotel Reception orchestrated the theft. (Sounds like a movie script!)Two days later, in Manaus, Brazil, I was shaken down for $850 by 8 large guys in the manager's office of the Tripical Hotel. I would not have been able to leave that room without paying.Back on my own turf in America, I used my position as a federal official in Washington to bring about a return of the $850. Had I not had this clout I would have just been another robbed tourist.IMDb reviewers can use their Political Correctness bull in their reviews, freedom of speech and all that, but more level headed people ought set the record straight.Aside from my personal experiences, "And Soon the Darkness" is well above the usual tripe we get in 2011 movies; downright good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hopeless remake of an excellent thriller from 1970. The original has an air of mystery and tension throughout and is positively drenched in atmosphere. This remake has no tension and is spoiled by removing 90% of the mystery from the start. The British girls in the original are believable, sensible and even likable so that you do actually care what happens to them. The girls in this remake are obnoxious, rude and arrogant in the way that only American tourists can be when they are in someone else's country. The girl who's looking for her friend does so many stupid and unrealistic things it's unbelievable, all in all it's a stupid film. This pointless remake should not use the same title as the original film as it brings shame upon the name of what is an excellent 1970 mystery thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the actual Hell was this? The 1970's Original had an innocence to it that this pile of c**p was lacking in shovels(never mind spades). What is it with the US film industry that they take what was a decent Film and turn it into a steaming pile of Dog s***e? How can they do it with such amazing regularity almost effortlessly? Instead of Rural France and two English Girls on a holiday, we have Rural Argentina( for some reason?? Why not Canada for example) and two dumb Yank Birds and a sex trafficking syndicate!! What?? Then we have the entire community seemingly in on this kidnapping scheme - again, What?? Some of the acting was passable but sadly the vast majority was abysmal. Amber Heard may look good, but for the love of all our sanity, please Hen, give up the acting. You're clearly no good at it!! The whole thing was awful, with the only similarity with the original ( which is far superior by the way) being 2 girls, holiday, one goes missing. Other than that, nope! Terrible Film, truly awful. They've taken a decent wee story and tried to tart it up and only succeeded in killing it completely.</fullReview>

Has a reasonable degree of character development, the build-up to the kidnapping-and-search is interesting. However, after that it is pretty much standard thriller fare - plot holes, mostly forgettable action scenes, contrived sequences.Amber Heard and Odette Yustman are OK in the lead roles. Almost as importantly, they look more than OK!Certainly nowhere near being a must-see, but not all bad either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Human trafficking is one of the most scary and abhorrent realities of our society. While it happens in many places, for many reasons, and in many different ways, filmmakers only seem to see the obvious. Once again we have a film about two girls traveling abroad, when one is abducted for the purposes of being sold as a sex slave. And Soon The Darkness is simply the same story as Taken and Hostle, with several small difference. In this film, only one girl goes missing, while the other teams up with a good samaritan, to try and find her. As always American girls are at a premium and the trail leads her to a vile underground of deceit and deception in a third world country. As far as abduction films go, this one was pretty unrealistic. How many young American girls, travel alone, to remote locations in third world countries, rather than staying at the resort or with some tour group. Second, there are a ton of American's in this supposedly secluded area, that doesn't have anything close to what could be considered a tourist attraction.

		<shortDescription>This movie does nothing to promote a holiday in the Argentine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserves high marks because of the outstanding performances by the female leads.Two young woman from the States have broken away from a bicycle tour in the Argentine and find themselves in a remote village. There are some horrible people there.....so....Some magnificent footage of the local countryside forms the backdrop to a nasty tale of what could happen to people finding themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. I thought the whole story was convincing as was the parts portrayed by the leads: they played the roles of young females abroad having fun on holiday to be very realistic.The way the local people came across, well lets just say this picture is not much of an advertisement for a trip to Argentina and I cannot recall more than one local coming across as half decent.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been an amazing thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why it didn't be one? Basically nothing happens until the 40th minute, that's why. This is a slow-burn thriller, even though it was advertised as the type that has thrills since the first minutes, well it doesn't.It sort of played out like Hostel; The first half hour is pretty much character development with some sexual references here and there, and then suspense begins. Come on, this is a 85 minute film, we should've gotten on really. After the 40th minute, the suspense begins. I liked the tension and tautness the film had afterwards. The acting by the two female leads was natural, but not that great. Sometimes Odette's character seemed annoying, with her being showing off in front of men a lot and trying to sleep with one. Come on. Karl Urban was great in this, loved his performance and his presence.Another thing I liked about this film is that there was someone else involved with Odette's abduction, and that character was in the film, who is even trusted by Odette's friend. The setting, thanks to the good cinematography was amazing, great location for sure. The music by the average composers Tomandandy was not bad, but it sounded too trailer-ish and something you'd hear in student films on Youtube, but at least it was orchestral and suspenseful.This was an OK thriller, which was saved by it suspenseful second half and magnificent setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great advert for Argentina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again Hollywood reminds us that if we act 'naughty' (you know what I mean, right?) and don't *ahem* play safe with strangers, we deserve a grisly end.Straight-laced Stephanie (Amber Heard) and her best friend, drunken harlot Ellie (Odette Annable) are holidaying in Agentina in a small town where the locals frequently give each other random glances of morbid knowingness. There they meet a couple of creepy guys and Karl Urban (who, for some reason, seems to act like he's embarrassed to be in this film). Sadly, Ellie is a wild-child and plays the price when she disappears mysteriously.The cops are no help (when are they ever in these filmic cases?!) so Amber has to go it alone to find her.And that's about it. You've probably seen it before. It's average and there are not too many surprises, only plenty of moments where you shout, "Hit him again!" at the screen when one of the girls smacks the bad guy over the head with a blunt object ONCE then just runs away, leaving him to get straight back up and come after her.Oh, and for the guys - Amber Heard strips down to a bikini (as she seems to in most her movies - is she contractually obliged, or something?) at about the half hour mark. You may want to turn it off after that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always,the girl who likes to arouse boys and is not repressed by the actual morals, is abducted and dies. The good girl, pure and brave not only saves her life, also kills the bad kidnappers. But,the scenario is really surrealistic: this film explicit the fact that all happens in Argentina. But, what region of Argentina? First we see scenes filmed in Salta (north), then Cafayate (south of Salta).Near we contemplate a ghost town near a river (there is a sign over the route that says: "Paraná")This river is located hundred of miles of Salta. And the ghost town with a building thas claims: "Matadero" is really on south of Buenos Aires. In the movie,all the places seems to be near each other. Well, the plot is obvious: police is corrupt.People in town does not help the American girls.Natives are bad or indifferent. The good girl, skinny and without experience in fighting,manage to save her life and uses firearms to kill a policeman and other villains. A really spoof.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic Missing American Tourists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They're just two of your average American tourists bicycling through the hinterlands of Argentina, one reckless dark-haired beauty and one sensible blond stunner, both of them looking and acting exactly like the ex models they were in real life. They miss their bus and must cycle on alone, although they take a rest at a local waterfall, where the camera lingers on their tan and succulent nubility.But this is a strange land. People speak this barbaric tongue called Spanish. The two lost lambs have no command over the language, just a kind of influence over it. And in the little village where they are stranded, everyone seems a little sullen except for one greasy looking guy who pursues the provocative dark babe and must be forcefully discouraged.The dark one -- I'm not bothering with names because they should both be back to modeling soon -- the dark one disappears under mysterious circumstances. The rest of the film has the blond trying to rescue the other from her kidnappers, who plan to take her to nearby Paraguay and sell her for vile purposes in return for two thousand dollars.The police are no help. There's only one cop around and he may be corrupt, but in any case he's inept and advises the blond to just wait around, everything will be alright. Then there's the American stud. His girl friend disappeared six months ago, just like the dark looker, and he's been all over the place trying to find her.The first half hour or so is really rather interesting. For one thing, you get a genuine feel for the eidos of a small Latin American village of perhaps a dozen scattered houses, a cantina, and one or two offices. For another, the sense of overhanging dread is omnipresent and some of the actors, particularly the concierge at the local motel, are very good at projecting ambiguity. You never know quite whether to believe them or not. And finally the scenery and location shooting are unimpeachable. The rocky hills are burnt orange and extremely impressive, and there is an extended sequence set in an abandoned tourist lodge that could hardly be improved on, with its dilapidated buildings and blasted trees and powdery streets.It's too bad the movie itself is so stupid. It casts aside that ominous spell at the beginning and degenerates into an idiotic slasher movie. If the good guys can make a mistake that leads them into worse trouble -- they make it.Examples: At the scene of the dark beauty's disappearance, the American stud and the local cop are examining the ground. The cop is dismissive as usual. The American guy finds some blood on the ground. Does he tell the cop? In the village, the blond spots the greasy guy who was hot for the dark girl. She shouts to him. He runs away into the woods. She runs after him. Why? Later, she steals a truck, which can only mean more difficulty for her, but no matter. Still looking for Darkbloom, she enters the grounds of the Villa Lago, long abandoned, with its closed gates festooned with warning signs -- CERRADO and IMPEDIR EL PASO A GRINGAS and PELLIGROSO and MUY MORTIFERO and ACHTUNG MINEN whatnot. So what does she do? Opens the gate and enters The Killing Fields.On the grounds of the Villa Lago she runs into the American stud and realizes they are both searching for missing companions. And what is the big guy's suggestion in the middle of this wasteland? "I know you won't like this but we have to split up. We can cover more ground that way." Haven't they ever seen a run-of-the-mill horror movie before? But why go on? If you insist on seeing it, do so for the scenery, both the mountains and the succulent flesh of two erstwhile models and aspiring actresses.</fullReview>

Two very cute ladies decide to take a bike trip through Argentina and then proceed to make every typical movie mistake possible in the span of 15 minutes. One girl struts her stuff and makes herself noticed by every good/bad guy in town, makes out with a stranger, they miss the bus, then they decide to go sunbathing in the middle of nowhere, get in a fight so they separate, etc, etc.This is chock full of every cliché in the book, there really is no story, no character build up, no suspense. Everything you would expect to happen happens right on cue.Really bad,avoid at all cost.If you want to see a great movie with this theme then check out the original Dutch version of The Vanishing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two America girls miss a bus during a trip to a remote area of Argentina and find themselves potential next victims in a town where young women have gone missing or are being trafficked.A remake of the 1970 Robert Fuest film of the same name with the setting relocated to Argentina. In the vein of Paradise Lost/ Turistas (2006), Hostel 2 (2007), A Perfect Getaway (2009)to name a few director Marcos Efron delivers as wonderful looking film with interesting locations and scenery, authentic looking run down bars, eerie off the beaten track sights, dilapidated buildings, old towns and the great outdoors.However, as the film unfolds much of the logic of the script and timing during the reveal scenes mar the films suspense and potential. Not even usually solid actor Karl Urban nor Amber Heard (who is excellent in The Ward 2010) can save themselves from the lack reasoning in this production. This also robs César Vianco and Michel Noher of their prospective performances leaving And Soon the Darkness coming across as an adult Scooby-Doo show. Only Odette (Annable) Yustman comes off unscathed as she does not feature in the majority of the offbeat moments.A gritty and attention-grabbing looking film that sadly misses the mark, not so much due to its logic but in its execution of its pivotal moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relatively relaxing movie, if you let it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two hot girls in a remote part of Argentina on their holiday, what could go wrong? Well, if you still can't think of anything And Soon the Darkness will answer this question. It is a remake of a British movie from 1970 with the same name but a different setting. I tend to agree with their choice of Argentina as the country in which these girls get lost. This is not a great movie, it is not original and this story has been heard a thousand times, lately more then ever. Still, it is watchable, perhaps as a warm up movie. There is enough tension and cute girls doing wrong things to keep things interesting, at least till the end. Mysterious hot stranger, uncooperative police and unknown country are the key ingredients of vacation-gone-wrong horror and this movie has it all. It is all so predictable and comfortable that this movie doesn't require much attention, so if you wanna relax you might wanna check it out.Stephanie is a shy pretty girl who decided to go to Argentina with her wild party-maniac of a friend Ellie. It is all so nice and pretty when they are having fun and partying, not knowing what might happen. They meet a mysterious American called Michael, and a local guy before one of them goes missing. Police seem to doesn't care, and American is too friendly and helpful... What will happen in the end, and what will become of the kidnapped girl is up to you to find out....Check out my review site Rabbit-Reviews for movies that are worth watching, Rabbit out...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I typically look forward to watching thriller flicks in anticipation of the suspense and an unexpected turn in the plot. I got non of the above with this movie. The acting by each character basically foretold the future events in the movie, especially the crooked cop. The only sense of suspense and mystery was created when Amber Heard (Stephanie) found a yellow bracelet in Karl Urban's (Michael) bag which then made him the main suspect in Odette Annable's (Ellie) mysterious disappearance. Every male in the movie seemed creepy and were somehow connected to Ellie's abduction. The only bright spot I can find is Amber Heard's acting and heroin performance in the face of danger and tribulation. She more than held her own, showing great emotion and relentlessness in the pursuit of her rather foolish American counterpart. At the end she's basically the only one of the main characters left alive and deservingly so!</fullReview>

It is indeed rare that someone makes a "thriller" which relies on BOTH the Idiot Plot and the Coincidence Plot, but this one is one of them.That is, the ONLY reason the plot advances, is because EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY person involved is a complete and total idiot.AND the only reason the plot advances, is because of one or more RIDICULOUSLY "Convenient" COINCIDENCES (Notably, the usual "vehicle won't start at EXACTLY the wrong moment, when it's shown no signs of issues prior to this point).So this movie manages to get a "3" ranking out of me, which is near impossible for a reasonably "major" film -- that is, something that didn't get made out of someone's garage in Poughkeepsie.This movie has only two things going for it, and that depends on your liking slender girls, both of the females in this one are model-thin -- I grant some guys don't like that.Oh, and the focus. The guy(s) running the cameras did know how to pull focus. So they had at least one competent person working on this. That certainly can't be said for the writers and the director.</fullReview>

The blond girl knows who the kidnapper is and follows him, but will she bring at least a knife? no The American tourist instead of shooting the policeman's leg and forcing him to tell the true story, rather agrees on a deal in which he has to give the blond American girl to get his girlfriend back. and this agreement happens in a situation where he has the gun pointing at the bad guys! Who would ever agree on such a deal having complete control over the enemy? After that like a true idiot he turns around putting his gun down and gets shot. The American tourist finds blood on the ground where the brunette might have been kidnapped. Instead of following the blood. He does nothing just looks and doesn t even say anything about it. He knows about girls being kidnapped in this town but doesn t warn the girls nor does he say anything after the brunette has been kidnapped. Funny that within 6 month he isn t able to find the building where the bad guys put the girls as buffer even though he seems to already been running around that district for quite a while.the American blond girl finds the place right away. and the list about ridiculous things goes on and on. How come nobody of the crew said: this is ridiculous! One last thing.

		<fullReview>This is the typical "vacation turns into nightmare" story. Two girlfriends, Ellie (Odette Annabale) and Stephanie (Amber Heard) are in Argentina on a bike tour. They intentionally separate from the group to travel unimpeded through the scarier non-friendlier areas of the country side. Ellie disappears after an argument separates them, the search is on, and once again, like all these films a sinister plot is revealed. Apparently it is a remake of a 1970 movie of the same name, but locations were changed.The Good: The 2 main characters played by Odette Annabale and Amber Heard, are just the eye candy that these stereotypical movies need in order to keep the viewer interested. Amber Heard has become a sort of B movie queen lately and she is definitely attractive enough, but Odette Annabale, personally, is much more to look at, and this movie would have been better if roles were reversed. The scenes of the Argentinian country side are pretty spectacular as well. Something I didn't really expect given the actors involved, and the perceived budget that they infer.The Bad: This is about as cliché as they get. This movie is one of those that attempts to capitalize on the appeal of the first, " Hostel" (2005) movie. The plot line has been around forever but every time a studio makes one it seems to get worse, like "Turistas" (2006) and "The Ruins" (2008). This is probably slightly better than those two movies and I actually think the acting and the overall cinematography is much better even though the others had a higher profile cast. That being said, the two characters just don't seem believable for bike touring co-eds. These girls are more like the train tour through expensive European city types, not the hippy pedal across Argentina ones. The plot lines are also completely transparent which would be fine if this was a film-noire movie, or a comedy, but it's not . At least 15-20 years ago when a movie would come out like this they would at least put the hot girls in a few sex scenes...I watched this movie even though it is a cliché storyline because sometimes you can be surprised by movies like this and overlook them. Like I said it was much better than "Touristas," or "The Ruins" ( unless pure squeamish blood and guts are your thing, then The Ruins is the way to go), but not great.I give it a 5 out of 10, not because it is bad, but it wasn't good, or original. These movies are only made for a few reasons. Director's do them to prove they can make an unoriginal, predictable movie remake which adds no value to the original. Actor's make them to pad their resume, and Studio's put them out so they can save money by not hiring talented, creative writers, making a dollar or two in the process.Like my review? Hate em?

		<fullReview>My mother-in-law highly recommended this film so the other night my old lady and I unfortunately decided to watch it.This is a movie that is a paint by numbers type of thing. After the first ten minutes this seemed headed to Touristas-land. Overall it is like Touristas but without the organ harvesting (for Touristas with organ harvesting but on a train, please watch The Train).The first ridiculous thing is that you have these two beautiful chicks that are on a bicycle tour through South America. These chicks aren't even on full laden touring bikes with panniers. Just mountain bikes with a small trunk bag that carries all their hot clubbing clothes and high heels. Second, these chicks are so skinny. It looks like they couldn't ride more than 5 miles with their toothpick legs and flip-flop shoes. Totally unconvincing as bicycle tourists.Next, they decide to get all tarted and liquored up and tease the deranged locals at some bar and maybe get in some action with a few men even though they know that the only bus out of town is leaving at 8am. Of course they act severely disrespectful and stupid almost provoking a kidnapping, beat down and Amtrak.I have to say that the movie is watchable because the scenery is nice and the locations and buildings are interesting and the chicks have pretty faces, but the whole time you're just screaming how stupid can these chicks be. Bicycling around in hot-pants and a sports-bra in some Argentinian red-neck holler with the degenerates leering and rubbing there mitts together in anticipation for tonight's party favor...I should probably see the original but didn't even know about it until I came here to spew my review for the lame remake.Bottom line: Don't waste your time on this one. It is flat-out predictable, stupid, and lame. Even The Train is better than this one.</fullReview>

The possibly sleazy Argentine fellows at the beginning are, not surprisingly, actually sleazy bad guys. The policeman, not surprisingly, is the primary nemesis. The handsome American is not the white knight he appears to be. The only good thing about the bad guys is they are easily overpowered, tricked, and killed when convenient.

		<fullReview>Our story begins in a dark and creepy room with a torture of a young girl... Well an exciting beginning can thrill me BUT, then we can see two girls (presumably tourists, and "possibly" American) cycling towards a little village, as it turns out in Argentina. And our story finishes here, after five OR six minutes. I mean, the exciting part. Because the rest of the film is little bit familiar from the other, let's see one thousand thrillers. In this equation only the place and the actors are changed. Kidnapping for the usual reason (sick and rich individual is hungry for young chicks), as we saw it in "Taken" as an example. Same boring and predictable bad guys. But there is new formula: a total waste of a character: Karl Urban's shattered American. As an expectancy, he should get the "Deus ex machina" role, but instead he's more like an observer. Literally he is NOT doing anything, but looking seriously, and chatting a little about his lost girlfriend and then in the key moment he flees, with a PROMISE from the bad guy, that he will get his girlfriend back. But people it's OK, the bad guy gave his word, didn't he? If you find logic in here, I'm begging you, let me know! So this character is a total waste, why bother with it? And by the way what about the acting? I'm awfully sorry but there isn't one. Actors do their screaming and looking dummy part, but nothing more, it's rather more less I think. To sum up with, if anybody asks me, whether he/she will watch this film, I would say a definite no! Make no mistake, this film is completely awful. Not just the plot, which is full of the "hundred times saw" American clichés, but the acting as well. I only give 4 out of 10 because of the beautiful girls and nice places, but I still find this rating humiliating. It's a pity...</fullReview>

After a long night of bar- hopping, the girls get into an argument, and Stephanie heads out alone in the morning to cool off. But when she returns, Ellie has disappeared. Finding signs of a struggle, Stephanie fears the worst, and turns to the police for help. But the local authorities have their hands full already - with a string of unsolved kidnappings targeting young female tourists. Skeptical of the sheriff's competency, she enlists help from Michael (Karl Urban), an American ex-pat staying at their hotel. Together they go on a frantic search for Ellie, but Stephanie soon realizes that trusting his seemingly good intentions may drag her farther from the truth. With danger mounting, and time running out, Stephanie must find her friend before darkness falls.well not much to say about this movie, i will keep my review short. this movie went on DVD soon after it was released. it is a low budget movie. i saw it for the actors. this movie was seriously very bad. direction, screenplay, story, plot everything was cliché and bad. some thrills towards the end but on the whole it is a boring, dull and awful cliché so called road trip thriller. awful.</fullReview>

There were some elements you could see coming but other things that were quite unexpected. I didn't see the original of which it's a remake, but I thought this thriller had a nice claustrophobic feeling about it with the protagonist increasingly hemmed in as you wonder how she will cope. On the other hand, I totally agree with the reviewers who complained about the stupidity of the characters. Not just the leads, but each and every character in the movie appears to have an IQ of about 60.

I have no idea why he did this but his talents are utterly wasted. Predictable, pointless crap. The main characters are annoying, stereotypical, and just plain dumb. By the end you're rooting for them all to die just for being so stupid.The only good thing I can say about this movie is it doesn't descend to the level of slash and gore so common in the genre. If that seems like faint praise, well, it is. Rising above the lowest possible level still doesn't make for a watchable or interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephanie and Ellie are two girls who travel abroad with their bikes, which doesn't mean it's going to be a bad movie. It reveals it's gonna fail once they start talking in the bar with unknown guys; their acting is terrible and I had to laugh or I would have to cry. That scene is very amateurish and probably copied from "Hostel" or "Turistas"-- which aren't bad movies. Once one of the girls start fighting with the bad guy, this film becomes a boring cat and mouse game, which tires the spectator. In the end, they are safe. Don't waste your time with this saturated kind of movie, even thought it promises to give you a few entertaining scenes. Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not such a bad movie if you haven't seen too many of these types of stories. But if you have, then this one will probably just bore you to death. Another reviewer used the word 'banality'. Well chosen. This film is just so banal and uninteresting. It's quite well shot, the acting is OK, and the lead actresses are attractive, of course, but this isn't enough to stave off the tedium. I've given it a generous 4/10 though I barely managed to pay it even a modicum of my attention. Having said that, having it on did give me an opportunity to check my e-mail, do the dishes, tidy up, make the beds, vacuum, watch the potted plants on the veranda growing, and do all the other chores that were more interesting than paying attention to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Soon You Will Loose Interest.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought I'd made a mistake in watching the original 1970 version of this film before seeing this, remade version. I was wrong. The mistake was in watching this film full stop. Even if I hadn't seen the original...which, for those who haven't seen it, is extremely subtle, mysterious, and nail bitingly suspenseful...I'd still have thought this movie was awful. First, there is no mystery. Not long after the girl disappears, you see a flash of her being carried off. You can even tell who the man is! It's so predictable! The original has you wondering who can be trusted, if anyone, up until the very last scene of the film. This version makes the characters too one dimensional and answers most of the questions before you even have the time to ask them. No subtlety here at all! It's just boring and bad...actually, that's a bit harsh. It's not completely horrible, as the acting is pretty good and some of the shots are quite beautiful. For that, I'll give it a 3/10. Don't waste your time on this one. Find the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They went through all the trouble for this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the intro we see a girl bound, screaming, and zapped with electricity when she complains. A couple of months later, Stephanie (Heard) and Ellie (Yustman) are biking in Argentina. They end up in some tiny town for the night and plan to take a bus next morning. That night they go to the bar. In a surprising casting, Yustman plays the overly slutty girl, while Heard wants nothing to do with fun, she's saving herself for her cheating ex. At the bar they run into an American who seems like trouble, but he rejects Ellie's advances. Ellie meets a local who gets very aggressive with her but she's saved by the American.They miss their bus that only passes by once a day and decide to bike around the area. The find a nice waterfall to sunbathe. They fight and Steph leaves. They make up via sms and agree to meet at a restaurant, but Ellie never shows and is nowhere to be found. The American, who happens to be the partner of the girl we saw in the intro, wants to help but Steph seems to be distrustful of all men. She asks around town but everyone runs home and slams their doors in her face. She goes to the local cop who is less than helpful. So she starts searching on her own and finds Ellie bound. They manage to escape and run into the cop and the American. That's when things get complicated. There's a shootout and deaths. Now it's Steph who finds herself in trouble.I haven't seen the original but And Soon The Darkness is rather plain and simple. It was actually filmed in Argentina for some reason and there are some nice landscapes, even though they could have found similar closer by. Except for one spectacular scenery, some devastated flooded town that looks more like a nuclear bomb hit. I have to say that "And Soon The Darkness" is a fantastic title for a horror movie, even though it has no relation to movie. It would have been better suited for a vampire movie.Heard and Yustman look great and playing American tourists they are just supercute. But they can't save this movie. There's nothing particularly bad about it. It just completely lacks excitement. There are few characters and it's not hard to guess who the villains are. There is no attempt to build tension. While Ellie is captured, she's not mistreated or tortured all that much. It's the director's first major directorial work and it shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best bit was when the credits rolled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Sunday afternoon, and I'm sitting with my girlfriend watching And Soon The Darkness.Well, it's one of these movies where you get increasingly irritated by both the naivety of the two protagonists and the film's director who ultimately must bear responsibility for the film.I'll spare you the plot but will sum up with a brief description of one all-too-familiar scene :The two girls are fleeing the kidnapper and manage to knock him to the ground by striking him in the head with a large piece of timber. While he lies there, reeling from the blow, they fail to finish him off and merely give him a few more half-hearted whacks with the piece of wood. They then turn and continue to flee in tears while he gets himself together and then continues the chase.The actors themselves turn out a pretty good performance, but i would imagine that most people who watch this movie will have zero sympathy for the main characters. It's not always necessary to empathise, but viewers really need a good reason to keep watching, and there isn't one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Been there, done that! A monument to the word CLICHÉ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are thinking of seeing it at the theater, I strongly advise you not to. It doesn't worth your time or your money unless you really like the kind of movies that brings nothing new to what was already done. The "suspense" scenes are way to classic, full of movie "clichés" like a sudden car breakdown to the trips and falls when running from the bad guy passing through the drops of the car keys and somehow she can always escape by some divine intervention or simply because of the fact that those guys don't now how to tie a knot which it's very embarrassing. If you give it the time I'll bet you could come up with 10 movies where the same things happened. The acting was decent but the very limited cast quickly reveals to you who is behind all of bad doing way ahead of time. Despite everything the film shows some really good places if you are thinking of taking a trip to Argentina, quite good backgrounds that helps the impact of the whole scene. Bottom of line if you're into this type of movie I suggest that you watch "I spit on your grave", is much better. If really are dying to see this movie do it, the choice is ultimately yours but you have been warned to lower your expectations, if I only lowered mine maybe it could have been a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the point???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching 30 minutes of this film i was asking myself what was the point of making this movie? Where is the creativity? The will to make something good? When i saw the actor from Star Trek on the cover i thought that it would be good. Boy was i wrong!! Seriously i would recommend to watch this film if you believe that there is nothing else to get you more depressed!What can i say. Its not nice to give movies bad reviews. But if you are going to make a movie about the girls lost thing at least try to do it as best as possible. The acting is so terrible i felt embarrassed for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and meaningless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie was fairly good entertainment for awhile. Two young women, best friends, holidaying in a foreign place. Staying in a seedy hotel, going to a bar, having too much to drink, meeting local men etc.. All this is something that most western women can relate to. The atmosphere and the feeling of actually being at the location in Argentina, were also just right.But then, when the thriller element started, it became predictable and boring. I just knew from the start, who was the good guy and who were the bad guys. Although I thought this solution was too simple, so I kept hoping for some twist at the end. But there was none. Which made this movie pretty useless, to be a remake in a time when one expects something more from a movie than just moving pictures shot at the "exciting" location abroad, and beautiful bodies and faces. I simply cannot see the meaning of shooting this movie at all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1)none of the actors in this movie are from Argentina. 2)We don't have Indians in Argentina. 3)I think it's the worst movie filmed in Argentina.And Soon the Darkness is a 1970 British thriller film. Starring Pamela Franklin, Michele Dotrice and Sandor El?s, it tells the story of two young English women on a cycling holiday in France, who run into difficulties.Why Argentina?. WHY???????????. The old version is better........ Jane(Pamela Franklin) and Cathy (Michele Dotrice) are two young nurses from London, taking a cycling holiday in rural France. When they stop at a busy café, Jane wants to plan their route, but Cathy is more interested in a handsome man (Sandor El?s), whom she spies drinking alone at the next table. Later, as Jane and Cathy make their way along a quiet country road, the man, who rides a Lambretta TV series III, overtakes them, and they pass him a few minutes later, as he rests by a cemetery gate. Cathy becomes intrigued by him. Stopping for a rest, Cathy decides she wants to sunbathe for a while, but Jane wants to push on. Eventually they argue, and Jane decides to carry on alone. A short while later, at a lonely café, the owner tries to tell Jane, in poor English, that the area has a bad reputation. She begins to reconsider her decision, and heads back to the spot where she left Cathy earlier, unaware that something has already happened. Unable to find her friend, and increasingly concerned about the presence of the moped rider, Jane decides to look for the local police officer (John Nettleton). Jane becomes convinced that the moped driver, who is called Paul, and who says he is a plain-clothes detective, is in fact Cathy's attacker. She escapes from him and re-encounters the policeman, who is then revealed as Cathy's actual murderer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Which also could be translated into: We'll make sure, you'll be going to sleep in no time. But it would be unfair to judge the movie like that. It does have two of the prettiest leading ladies one can imagine. And Amber Heard has proved she can also act (see Rum Diary and other movies she's done). Even if you don't agree with that statement, you have to agree with Karl Urban bringing some weight into this.But the main interest are our ladies. While it does have some more than decent prospects and it might have actually made sense and worked, it does fall short of the promise it kind of gives. It's a shame, but there is/was a much better movie here, than the one we get. It still is decent, but it could've been better (I guess the script sounded very good).It might be either too complex or too easy, depending on how you look at it. Which almost sounds like an achievement ... it isn't</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ANOTHER pointless remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two American girls (Amber Heard, Odette Annable) travel to Argentina. They get drunk and provoke guys in a bar. Then they have a fight, separate...and one is kidnapped. Her friend looks for her and is helped by a mysterious stranger (hunky Karl Urban).The original was no classic but this is TERRIBLE! The basic plot is OK but it moves at a snails pace. There are countless stalking sequences (one through a crumbling deserted town went on forever) or people walking around, no surprise twists or turns (I saw every one coming) and frankly gets very dull and boring. This made it to cable in record time...if it ever played in cinemas. It gets two stars because Heard and Annable are very good, Urban is attractive and hunky, the songs are good (but a thriller shouldn't depend on a soundtrack!) and there's some gorgeous scenery (I believe it was shot on location). But, all in all, this is a dull and thoroughly predictable thriller with no suspense or surprises. Skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull Remake That Becomes Silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was intrigued about seeing this American remake of an overlooked British thriller from 1970 . The original isn't considered a classic although what it does it does very well . One worries that it'd be a simple case of taking a story featuring two young British females in France and transplanting two American airheads in to the remote Argentine wilderness Guess what this film does for the first two thirds ? And it does so in a lacklustre way leaving you thinking is the original so good at what it did or is the remake so bad ? Considering the plot revolves a young woman going missing I thought perhaps the setting might bring a political subtext to the film . Argentina in the 1970s and early 80s was of course the country where suspected troublemakers would disappear never to be seen again but there's no political commentary to this film which is just a straight forward thriller based on a superior film It does go its own way in the final third and again it's not entirely successful as the plot then turns in to a backwoods brutality type of movie similar to the Aussie thriller WOLF CREEK without the torture porn aspect and instead sees the female protagonist turn in to a Lara Croft clone . It's mildly entertaining to a very mild degree but no more than that and is disappointing compared to the British original that was both tension filled and credible</fullReview>
