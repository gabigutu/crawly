		<shortDescription>superb English suspense film set in rural France</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly good suspenseful mystery here! I watched a used copy of the full frame HBO Video VHS, and I'm tempted to upgrade to the widescreen DVD which also has a commentary track.Two pretty young English women are bicycling across the French countryside using scenic backroads (shot on location). The blonde spots a young Frenchman with sunglasses at a café that she thinks is "dishy," and they keep encountering him on the road, since he speeds by on his scooter and they continually pass him when he stops somewhere (a cemetery, a café).They rest off the side of the road on the edge of some woods, and have a spat. The brunette wants to stick to their schedule, while the blonde wants to sunbathe and perhaps even turn back around to find and talk to the young man. The brunette goes on ahead, while the blonde stays put.The brunette feels guilty, though, and stops at a café and waits. Her friend doesn't show up. The proprietress tries to tell her something, but the English girl speaks very little French. The French that is spoken is appropriately not subtitled, putting those of us who also don't know French into her shoes. The café owner knows a tiny bit of English: "bad road." The girl decides to go back for her friend, and finds her missing, though her camera is still there.There are a lot of suspicious people in the movie. The young man with the sunglasses is the first obvious suspect, but there's also a farmer in a field, the café owner and a man in overalls at her café, an older British lady, a gendarme, the gendarme's father.... The poor English girl doesn't know who she can trust.I really enjoyed this movie a lot, and I didn't find it to be slow at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A WELL CRAFTED LITTLE GEM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this on late night television years ago, and had very fond memories of it. Recently i caught up with it on dvd, and found that my memory had not let me down. Every aspect of this film demonstrates film making talent of the very highest order. The script is superb, keeping you guessing right up to the end. The acting of the leads is faultless, but the icing on the cake is the amazing direction by Fuest. He manages to turn the open, sunny, French countryside into a nightmare landscape. Gradually cranking up the tension, alienation, and paranoia with the skill of a master. He really should have been a massively successful director. Pure craftsmanship, with a very creepy edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you won't be disappointed. The set-up is very slow and plodding, but the last hour is one of the most atmospheric and tense I've ever seen. I really felt for Jane after she loses her friend while on a biking holiday in France. I was annoyed at first, but then glad, that there are no sub-titles for the French speaking people. Jane doesn't speak French well either, so her helplessness and frustration translated to me extremely well. I felt her situation was very real. The story keeps you guessing about who to trust and who not to trust. Also, the whole movie takes place in one day during the daytime, so the title takes on extra meaning as Jane tries to find the truth. As darkness approaches, she loses more and more hope her friend is alive. Its really cool. I give it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film. Although the twist ending was not exactly unexpected, the story kept me guessing. Beautifully shot with lots of very effective scenery adding to the overall feel. Director Robert Fuest's work is evocative of Hitchcock. The use of French actors and the absence of subtitles is a smart move, giving the viewer a sense of the young girl's confusion and mounting fear. The location filming in France pays off beautifully as the movie had an otherworldly feel to it. Pamela Franklin stars and it quit good. She is asked to tell a lot of story with only her expressions and she does so splendidly. Fuest trusted her performance and it paid off. Solid story, good acting and a firm, polished hand at the directorial helm make this an underrated thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pamela Franklin and Michele Dotrice are British nurses on a cycling holiday in France. The two women have a disagreement and Franklin splits, while Dotrice stays behind. When Franklin returns a few minutes later to the spot where she left her friend, she discovers that the woman has mysteriously vanished. As if that weren't distressing enough, she learns from the local people that the site where her friend disappeared from is the same place where a lady tourist was found murdered a few years before. Moody, suspenseful British thriller with good performances, particularly by Franklin as the worried heroine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"And Soon the Darkness" ? which takes entirely place during the daytime ? is a fairly creepy but sadly neglected 70's Brit-chiller directed by Robert Fuest, who would later focus on horror movies that have slightly more extravagant story lines, like "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" and "The Devil's Rain". This movie exclusively revolves on moody atmosphere and eerie setting, as there are no nasty bits or gratuitous sleaze. The film starts out rather slow but gradually gets tenser, and particularly the last half hour is terrific and nail-biting. Two young British nurses spend their holiday bicycling through rural France, unaware that another tourist girl was brutally slain in the same region two years earlier and unaware that they're being targeted by the same fiendish rape-killer who's still at large in the area. Following a banal quarrel, Jane becomes separated from her friend Cathy. The latter then mysteriously vanishes and during the search for her friend, Jane only encounters suspiciously behaving locals. Robert Fuest maintains a continuously high tension-level using only very basic tricks, most notably the inability to communicate. Jane doesn't speak French and therefore she cannot understand the warnings of people or explain what happened to her friend. There aren't any subtitles for the French dialogs, so even the viewers are unaware of what's going on most of the time in case they don't speak the language. Pamela Franklin's acting performance is very convincing and the music as well as the photography is extremely uncanny. Definitely on of the most efficient women-in-peril horror/thrillers of the early 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie leaves a deep impression.It is a suspense thriller with a deceptively simple plot. There are only four or five characters. Two young English nurses are cycling in France, and become separated at the roadside after an argument. Nurse Pamela Franklin returns to find her friend - but she has unaccountably vanished...The film is set against an eerily quiet backdrop of French countryside. As the worried girl moves (from village to police station to cafe to farmlands) in search of her lost friend, the tension mounts. Any of the few strangers she meets might help her - but is one of them the killer?Little by little,her hope and certainty fade. An uncaring and hostile environment closes in almost palpably around her.The suspense only breaks at the very end, when all is known. Finally, the upbeat, flippant closing theme music brings us back to reality.This is one of the most 'atmospheric' films I have ever seen.I give it a 'ten.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than average thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haven't seen this film for years,its probably one of the most underrated British thrillers of all time given the date it was made 1970,it was of a new kind,it was tense,atmospheric and had lots of suspense,and towards the end the jumpy bit where Michelle Dotrice falls out of the cupboard was shocking.And the story is very believable,this was the era when hitchhiking and travelling alone was becoming more dangerous and not such a good option.When you think this was made in the height of the Hammer Horror era,when nowadays Hammer films would come across as silly,this film is much better,it just uses suspense and atmosphere,and there's hardly any script involved because the story is so basic and simple,you can see what Pamela Franklin is going through. Pamela Franklin and Sandor Eles starred in a few British horror films in the 1970s,both had worked for Hammer,and at one time they were well known faces in Britsh horror films.I have never seen this film on DVD,but i have heard you can buy it on region 1,luckily i have a multi region player.This is a great film if you ever get the chance to see it,sadly its almost forgotten now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting little British thriller. The story is rather slow and its development a bit on the routine side. That said, however, a very pleasurable suspense is built up, thanks in part, I think, to the action's taking place mainly along a short stretch of lonely road. A number of effective shock moments (one made me shout!) and good acting don't do any harm either. Recommended - this one requires a bit of patience, but it's worth the trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective suspense flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writers Brian Clemens &amp; Terry Nation and director Robert Fuest prove that this kind of movie need not take place at night in order to be scary. This is about as good as a daytime suspense flick could be. Pamela Franklin and Michele Dotrice play young nurses on vacation in France who are riding their bicycles through the country. Things go very bad when, after a fight, Franklin pedals off and leaves Dotrice on her own, after which Dotrice disappears from sight. A stranger (Sandor Eles) offers to help Franklin, but she'll have her doubts about him, just as she will about most other characters. It's a bold move for the filmmakers to have no subtitles for the French dialogue, and it works in important ways: it stresses Franklin's vulnerability and frustration, and ensures that we in the audience are *not* two steps ahead of her the entire time. The desolate rural locations, while beautiful in their way, also help to create that sense of helplessness. There are long distances between towns, and the fields seem to go on forever. Laurie Johnson's music is used sparingly, and other than a bouncy main title theme that doesn't seem appropriate for a film of this type, it helps to set the mood. That said, Fuest, Clemens, and company know when the movie is in no need for music, as a key suspense sequence takes place largely in silence. The tension here is palpable; in fact, after something of a slow start, things just get creepier and creepier and poor Franklin, who's absolutely winning in the role of the desperate young protagonist, comes to feel that she may not be able to trust anyone. One particularly great moment has Franklin conversing with a roadside café proprietress (Hana Maria Pravda), who manages to find the two correct English words for what she means to say, "bad road", and when she utters these words it sends chills up the spine; we then know that this area is fraught with danger. We find out that there'd already been a murder some years ago. Good supporting performances by John Nettleton as the Gendarme, Clare Kelly as the schoolmistress, and Pravda greatly aid in the telling of this story, which delivers a nail biting climax and which in the end has a cyclical quality. It's good stuff, and worthy of discovery or rediscovery. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent British thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tightly scripted and engaging British thriller, AND SOON THE DARKNESS is the precursor to films such as THE HITCHER (1986), SPOORLOS (aka THE VANISHING; 1988) and, to a lesser extent, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1971). The film capitalizes on the universal fear of something horrible happening to oneself while on vacation. This is not the Friday THE 13th variety but the far more realistic type of horror.Director Robert Fuest cleverly keeps the audience uninformed by having Jane encounter several characters who speak to her only in quick French. Obviously if you speak French then you are one step ahead of the game, but it is a great device that supports the film's every growing feeling of alienation. You only get information when Jane gets it and, oftentimes, it is completely wrong. Another interesting concept Fuest utilizes is that the entire film takes place during the daylight in supposed real time. That is the antithesis of the horror genre, but it works wonderfully and definitely adds to the film's realism. Fuest, who cut his teeth on THE AVENGERS TV series and later went on to make the DR. PHIBES series, starts the film off slowly but keeps the pace moving along quickly after the first half hour. Of course he receives lots of help from his technical people, especially cinematographer Ian Wilson, who also filmed the similar FRIGHT (1971) and the Hammer classic CAPTAIN KRONOS among many others. The roads of southern France have never looked so beautiful and threatening.The acting is good all around, especially from the two leads, Franklin and Eles. Both are very good in their respective roles. Franklin conveys the right emotions as the confused and scared vacationer while Peter Coyote look-a-like Eles brilliantly blurs the line between suspect no. 1 and hero. Also of note is John Nettleton, who reminded me of Jean Reno, as a police officer who helps out Jane. If the film does have one problem, it may be that Eles' character is portrayed too ominously; making it all the more obvious that he isn't the killer by the film's end. However, screenwriters Brian Clemens and Terry Nation throw a few more red herrings out there so that the revelation of the killer is still a bit of a surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two young English women go on holiday bicycling through the French countryside. It becomes apparent that sensible Jane (Franklin) is better suited to the vagaries of the excursion than her free-spirited and flirtatious friend Cathy (Dotrice). After a series of disagreements over pace and schedule they have a nasty row by the roadside miles in between villages.Jane rides off leaving Cathy alone. The disagreement is not enough to be a complete impasse but it is sufficient to get them to want to be away from each other for a while. Cathy said some very rude things and Jane took offense knowing she meant them. Shortly after parting they soon wish they hadn't. Cathy disappears and Jane struggles to find her. The language barrier prevents Cathy from getting the whole picture in questioning locals though the odd words in French she can pick out are sinister ones. She discovers that a Dutch girl who looked much like Cathy was found murdered in the area three years earlier. "It was more than murder...If you know what I mean" one of the characters says. Bludgeoned and mutilated her death haunts the residents some of whom appear sketchy apart even from the circumstances.A mysterious young man on a motorbike is hanging around too. Cathy doesn't trust him even though he identifies himself as benevolent and suggests he can be precisely the kind of help she has been looking for. Given his recent past and enigmatic demeanour he may very well be exactly whom she needs to avoid to survive and his inability to avoid actions which make him appear suspicious complicate things further.For those who understand French a lot of the confusion dissipates pretty early on. Because the heroine does not several unexpected things happen to her. The words in French she does understand also get misconstrued in identifying the one she really has to be worried about. The audience itself has its own guessing game sorting the words and actions of the people Jane meets. what they are saying, why they are saying it and even how they are saying it could be misinterpreted. What happened in the past in the area still effect the characters that live there and the way they interact with each other. It makes all the difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb slow burning horror/suspenser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of its continental setting and feel, And Soon The Darkness is a superior British horror chiller that gradually builds tension and suspense, cleverly pointing the finger of suspicion at most of the cast in a subtle and stylish way, one of whom may be a serial murderer. That is if it can be proved that someone has actually died...The story concerns two female holidaymakers cycling through the French countryside, one of whom disappears after her companion leaves her following an argument. Three years earlier a tourist was murdered in the exact spot where she vanished, and her companion begins a desperate search while growing increasingly wary of a scooter-riding police inspector who offers his help.Pamela Franklin and Michelle Dotrice give realistic and believable performances as the two travellers, and Sandor Eles (who ended up for many years in the British tea-time soap Crossroads!) is the darkly mysterious stranger who takes up with Franklin and may have something to hide. Along the way she meets various inhabitants of the surrounding landscape, both bizarre and matter of fact. And the viewer is fully pulled in to the character's sense of weird displacement, as if she has stepped into a nightmare at noontime.Director Robert Fuest captures the eeriness of the French countryside brilliantly, and an ordinary stretch of road takes on a haunting and menacing aspect - even though the film takes place in broad daylight and bright sunshine. Brian Clemens' story keeps you guessing to the very end,when all is revealed in a wonderful shock moment. A bunch of decrepit caravans play a part in the climax, and Fuest makes astonishing use of them, cranking the sense of dread up to the fabled eleven.This is not a film of blood and gore, but very much in the style of Hitchcock or Val Lewton. Perhaps a shade too long, it nevertheless tells its simple story with verve and imagination. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good atmospheric thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been waiting for this to be released on DVD and ordered as it soon as it became available. I had already seen it a few times a very long time ago and was keen to watch it again. This isn't a film that grabs you by the throat and smashes the plot into your face. It builds slowly developing atmosphere and mounting tension. When I watch films in general from this era it becomes apparent that people must have had more patience and longer attention spans in those days than they do now. Contemporary Film and TV is dominated by clever short cut editing and fast pace to keep the audience entertained and attentive. Older films invited the audience to do a bit of work for themselves and allowed them to enjoy longer camera shots. It has been noted by others that the plot doesn't entirely make sense but I don't see why that's a problem. Since when did a good film have to make sense? The crux of this film is atmosphere and it does this fantastically. This is a very simple story with minimal character development. It is about two young pretty English nurses on a cycling trip in rural France. They have a row over how they should spend their time on the Holiday. Cathy wants to have fun and flirt with a handsome but strange man whose been following them whilst the more prim Jane wants to stick to their agreed schedule. Jane cycles off leaving Cathy sunbathing next to a secluded wooded area. Cathy disappears and Jane spends the rest of the film trying to enlist help from the locals in order to find out what happened. Cleverly in my opinion the director didn't include subtitles for the French dialogue so we feel just as much in the dark about what's going on as Jane does. However Jane learns from a older possibly lesbian English woman that three years previously another young female tourist was raped and murdered and it seems likely that Cathy has suffered the same fate. We then have to guess which of the odd ball creepy locals that Jane runs into is the murderer. Needless to say the most obvious suspect turns out to be a red heron but the true culprit is genuinely unexpected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And Soon the Darkness" stays with you for a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pamela Franklin made a career out of playing the frightened ingenue when she was a young actress. In "And Soon the Darkness" she gets to play one for the ages. Not a hit when released in 1970, the movie has a slow menacing quality (thanks to director Robert Fuest) and the quiet tension eventually builds to the breaking point. The plot is simple enough. Two young English nurses, Jane (played by Franklin) and Cathy (Michele Dotrice) are seemingly on a pleasant holiday together and taking a leisurely bicycle ride through the back-roads of the French countryside. After a petty argument, the two women decide to temporarily take separate paths. When Jane returns to meet up with her friend, Cathy is nowhere to be found. There's a murderer on the loose, of course, and Jane soon realizes that she's the next intended victim.What gives this film its eeriness are the long camera shots of the never ending stretches of road. Despite the sunny summer weather, there's a sense of pure evil lurking behind the trees and around every corner. Since there's no discernible "bad guy" for nearly the entire film, the audience is left in the same dire predicament as poor Pamela. Who is after her, and more importantly, why? With a sure hand for the macabre, Director Fuest masterfully ratchets up the suspense right up until the final confrontation between Ms. Franklin and her unknown assailant. The fact that there's no rhyme or reason for the killer's actions adds even more unforced suspense to this atmospheric film. Take my word for it, "And Soon the Darkness" is one of those rare horror movies that will stay with you long after the final reel is played out. Despite the lack of attention it received upon its release, it's now considered a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two young English girls Jane and Cathy enjoy a cycling trip across France . Stopping at a secluded spot the two girls get in to an argument leading Jane to leave Cathy alone . After hearing from the manageress of a nearby café that the road is dangerous Jane returns only to find Cathy has disappeared This is one of these movies that you remember seeing years ago for the very first time thinking it's a great movie only to be disappointed after seeing it again . The obvious reason for this is because it builds up an air of mystery as to what's happened to Cathy then when it is revealed you're left thinking who the bad guy behind it is . Co-written by Brian Clemens who turned THE AVENGERS from straight laced thriller in to psychedelic insanity and Terry Nation who gave the Universe Daleks , Davros and BLAKES 7 you might expect the story to have a bit more flourish or excitement but this isn't the thinking behind it and does work very well because of thisLet me explain this by stating there's no monsters in the Universe apart from the very human ones that inhabit this planet . It would be all too easy for the production team to put a lot of action and excitement in to but everything plays out in a very realistic manner . Cathy finding herself alone in a lonely secluded spot and knowing there is an unseen and mortal menace a few feet away in the bushes is more chilling than most films featuring werewolves or alien spaceships and it's this melding of menace and the mundane that makes this movie stick in the memoryAnother interesting point is that Jane can speak some French but it's the kind of phrasebook French that is required for ordering a drink in the café but not enough to hold abstract conversations such as " Excuse miss but this stretch of road is full of dangers and it's a very bad idea if your friend is sunbathing and she's drying her underwear on a bush " and it makes a nice change that people suddenly don't speak English because of plot contrivances . Interesting too that you can't accuse the film of Little Englander xenophobia since apart from Jane and Cathy the only other English character is a schoolmistress who comes across as a blatant lesbian who is every bit as creepy as the French male characters One rather distasteful point about the film that might make it rather dated is that the two English girls are very skimply dressed . Of course this might not mean anything at all but one wonders how many men would misinterpreted this as meaning " they're up for it " and it's not a film you would recommend to feminists , not unless you're reinforcing the opinion that all men are rapists and there doesn't seem to be any irony to the sexually provocative - unconscious or otherwise - mannerism of the two young women Despite this flaw AND SOON THE DARKNESS is a tense and exciting mystery thriller made on the cheap but made so well it's very compelling first time you see it . The downside to all this is that it's a film that's only produced to be seen once by the audience . But how many expensive Hollywood blockbusters have you seen that don't even deserve to be seen once ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary, suspenseful and altogether superior early 70's British women-in-jeopardy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Petite, adorable, doe-eyed early 70's brunette scream queen Pamela ("The Legend of Hell House," "The Food of the Gods") Franklin and buxom, voluptuous blonde Michele ("Blood on Satan's Claw") Dotrice make for highly charming and appealing fair damsels in distress as a pair of spunky young nurses enjoying a merry bicycling jaunt across the lush, peaceful, ripely verdant French countryside who wind up being stalked and terrorized by a murderous sexual psychopath.Directed in unusually plain, spare, stripped-down fashion by the often quite stylish and baroque Robert Fuest (who also helmed the wickedly enjoyable "Dr. Phibes" films and the gloriously ghastly all-star abortion "The Devil's Rain"), written in a briskly efficacious manner by esteemed "The Avengers" scribe Brian Clemens, and potently brooding with a clammy, spine-shivering, ultimately quite stifling and suffocatingly claustrophobic mood, "And Soon the Darkness" most certainly does the trick as an effectively creepy and gripping women-in-jeopardy thriller. The beauteous rustic setting, sparsely populated by gruff, unfriendly, intimidating local yokels and vaguely sinister cops, comes across as a very eerie and unsettling remote rural region, due largely to Fuest's cunning marked emphasis on tight close-ups, the ingenious decision to have the whole movie occur in bright daylight, and the notable absence of wide angle panoramic shots. In fact, said hinterland area evokes an unnervingly palpable sense of dread, isolation, vulnerability and, most frighteningly, utter helplessness throughout. The twist ending in particular is a real gut-ripping corker. Overall, this top-drawer chiller diller is scary and upsetting enough to turn even the hardiest fright film fan into a stay firmly locked behind closed doors paranoid agoraphobic shut-in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Made Horror-Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This really is a good, well made, thrilling horror-mystery. This has all the makings for a worth-while horror film: We have two women touring on their bicycles in France (which they know little about the area they are in), a weird police officer, a strange detective, secluded wooded area, chases and a mystery of a dead friend - whodunit or is she still alive? Well worth you time to watch this movie if what I have described to you sounds appealing, intriguing and you like the older suspenseful horror-thrillers as well as a mystery to solve. There is a twist ending that may not come as a big shock to you but the way it happens might surprise you just a bit.English is the main language of the film but some French is spoken - that's not a problem for the English-only speaking crowd - you'll know what is going on without subtitles.If you can find a copy of this film... I highly recommend it for viewing.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An uneven but enjoyable movie. Cathy and Jane are 2 English girls on a cycling trip in France. Early on in the piece the girls argue, Cathy stops to lap up the sun, Jane proceeds. Whoops, This is the first half hour which was referenced in another review. A difficult introduction made all the more difficult by the camera work which featured close ups and lingering shots which were meaningless. Or were they? The rest of the film finds Jane turning back and searching for her friend. Drawing the obvious conclusions (we already have a good idea) she meets a number of characters and one of the strengths of the film is the ability to subtly accuse everyone. There is no blatant, ham fisted laying of clues but all characters are given just enough to get you thinking.There is one moment in the film which had me jumping out of my chair and that doesn't happen often. I could have done with some subtitles for the French dialogue but maybe we are expected to hear what Jane would hear. I had very little idea of what the characters are saying (schoolboy French) and therefore may miss out on important details. As may Jane. We have to remember that Jane has not seen what we have seen so she can only assume the worst.The conclusion is a little lame and not unexpected. And a few of the markers laid down by the directors are left hanging which is frustrating and leads to an uneven film. Oh yeah, and the music at the end is completely inappropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent old-school UK thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I have not seen 'And Soon the Darkness' before, it still brings on a sentimental feeling to me. It's not at all a sentimental movie but it is the slow pace, the suspense ánd the music composed by Laurie Johnson (The Avengers) that give me sort of a déj?-vu feeling.The story is not a complex one. It's about two women going for a cycling holiday in France. They get an argument and decide to split up for the moment. One of them then disappears, and the other goes looking for her.Though AStD reminds me of (the original Dutch) 'The Vanishing', unfortunately the plot doesn't have that strength. Still, it's a decent thriller and a mystery until the very end. It is slow, but has enough moments to keep it going. The French spoken bits are not translated which makes us much relate to Jane. Pretty much all characters have their weirdness, but always within limits. This makes sure that it is all a believable scenario. The story is one that could easily happen, it is never outside of the feeling of reality. And that is what gives it it's fairly creepy atmosphere. What would you do in Jane's place?AStD is a movie which you could easily find boring. There is not much real action, but in a way, that is a good thing. It's a movie you should place and value within it's time. I've read that there was a remake made in 2010, and though I haven't watched it, what I read about it is that it is made more towards this age, with scenes of torture. There is nothing of such kind in the original one, and though I can appreciate and deal with highly violent movies, it is just not what AStD needs. Instead; it is the lack of it which is a good thing, as it all comes down to good fashioned strong suspense. It leaves more to your imagination. Suspense is something the British were very good at in the 70's, and though there are better UK suspense movies, AStD is certainly not the worst.They just don't make 'm like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forgotten gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not know this film. I found the remake, set in Argentina, but the genuine item, I just discovered it two days ago. It could have been a Jean Rollin film, that takes place in the deep France, in the middle of the french countryside, where two gals on journey encounter some problems with the natives. And what natives...The characters are almost all weird, as (the late) Jean Rollin did so well. But it is not Jean Rollin who made it. No, it was the AVENGERS (TV show, the most British known of all time) who gave us this gem. See for yourself: Brian Clemens as screenwriter, and Robert Fuest as director. And when you watch closely this movie, and also when you are a AVENGERS fan as I am, you agree that the way of filming, the music score, the atmosphere, everything reminds us the famous TV series. Everything. It takes place in rural deep France, but in the British way...Very strange, but interesting too.A real gem.And look out for Jean Carmet !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Long, Lonesome Highway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An effective thriller, "And Soon The Darkness" keeps viewers in the dark, so to speak, until the end, as one of two young, attractive English girls goes missing during their bicycle tour of the French countryside. The story is told from the POV of the second young woman, Jane (Pamela Franklin) who, at first, does not suspect foul play but later changes her mind.What makes the film suspenseful is the conspicuous absence of people and cars, even in the small villages on the back-country route. The wide-open spaces and boarded-up windows create an ominous and foreboding sense that something is not quite right.The locals mostly speak French. The film's lack of subtitles, which does not adversely affect the plot at all, puts viewers in Jane's position, as she tries to communicate her fears in English. Indeed, not having subtitles makes the film more realistic.I counted five people who "may" have harmed the missing girl. And all five seem normal on the surface. The plot tends to lag in the second half, and the ending is a little weak.Color cinematography is competent. Casting and acting are acceptable. Background music is intermittent. The atmosphere is thick with suspense in those scenes that lack music.With a simple, easy to follow plot, "And Soon The Darkness" provides plenty of mystery and suspense. And the message is clear: if you must bicycle down that long, lonesome highway, don't do it alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a Feature-length "Thriller" Episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The participation of writer/producer Brian Clemens and Composer Laurie Johnson (who would soon collaborate on the memorable British anthology series "Thriller," are but two of the many reasons to seek out this atmospheric and simple tale set in a sparsely populated rural area of France. The director Robert Fuest is very adept at slowly ratcheting up the tension, utilising the lonely, monotonous landscape to underscore the vulnerability and isolation of the leading character. Lovely Pamela Franklin, as always, contributes a natural and understated performance. The only criticism I have of the film is that the denouement, while not entirely predictable, is certainly reminiscent of many another thriller, not least half the episodes of the previously mentioned television series. Still, a very satisfying and gripping viewing experience (for those who appreciate a slow build-up, that is) and the many red herrings skillfully interjected throughout the film adds to the uncertainty and suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly atmospheric French-set thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This minimalist thriller is a one-of-a-kind film with an excellent pedigree; not only is it directed by Robert Fuest, who gave us a minor horror classic in THE ABOMINABLE DR PHIBES, it is also written by two top television writers of the time, Brian Clemens (THE AVENGERS) and Terry Nation (DR WHO). However unlike the various work of the contributors this isn't an effects-driven exercise in flashiness and action; instead barely anything happens in the movie.The pacing is deliberately slow, and the film as a whole is largely an atmosphere-building exercise with the only action appearing at the very end of the film. The visceral horror aspects are mainly non-existent and instead the film strives hard to create and maintain high levels of suspense and foreboding. The forbidding setting of a rural French landscape is a clever touch and through static camera angles and creepy music we are led to believe that the landscape we see is both alien and dangerous.Beautifully filmed and with a strong script - with little dialogue Clemens and Nation make sure that every word counts - AND SOON THE DARKNESS is an exercise in realism. As there are no special effects involved the film hasn't dated at all and could be taken for the present day if it wasn't for the minor trappings, i.e. the old fashioned vehicles and hairstyles. Again the realism is strengthened through the matter-of-fact storyline, with large periods of inaction adding to the experience.The main emphasis is on the murder mystery aspect of the plot, most of the film acting as a whodunit and asking the viewer to guess firstly what happened and secondly who is responsible. The task isn't easy at first, with loads of red herrings and plot twists being thrown in our way, but gradually light will begin to dawn on those who have prior knowledge of these kinds of movies.The cast is an extremely small one, consisting of only four or five major characters. This adds to the isolated nature of the movie, especially with the language barrier deeply affecting the situation of our leads. Pamela Franklin proves she has grown up a lot since THE INNOCENTS with her mature yet fragile nurse character and her subdued turn is generally spot on. In comparison, Michele Dotrice (SOME MOTHERS DO 'AVE 'EM) is flirty and attractive as her outgoing companion and also makes a favourable impression. Sandor Eles (COUNTESS Dracula) is given a chance to shine as the shifty Frenchman who gets caught up in the events and becomes a prime suspect.Shots of unkempt farmers staring at Franklin over lonely open landscapes and cars soaring into the distance go a long way in adding to the increasing atmosphere. Despite the lack of violence, murder and bloodshed, horror fans should enjoy this movie through the sheer amount of suspense and atmosphere that it offers. Definitely a thought-provoking and at times gripping movie. A similar offering - but even rarer - followed three years later with DEADLY STRANGERS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sun drenched nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an eerie little 70's movie, where 2 nurses go on a cycling holiday in France, then cross paths with a strange man, then one of the girls disappear and it's up to the other one to try and find her and finding herself alone and isolated.The scenario is quite frightening where the young girl is all alone in a strange country, and that carefully builds up the atmosphere and where she learns about the local disappearances. All this takes place in the daytime which is rather different as many movies uses the nighttime to create scares and chills. Even the wooded area is very chilling when one of the girls is all alone, you straight away have the feeling that she's being watched and the fact that it doesn't show a glimpse of anyone is in fact like being trapped in a nightmare.But the pacing is rather slow and very talky and the fact that you don't know what any of the villagers are saying does get annoying. I do understand why they did it, too put the viewer in the girl's shoes, but even when she's not in the scene and just them, you still don't know what's going on. But the mystery aspect of this movie is very well crafted with several red herrings and suspects are well handled. and the scenes when she has a run in with the stranger does keep you guessing and guessing until the final climax, which wasn't entirely that satisfying and I kinda guessed the outcome of the friend.The performances were very brilliantly cast, both the young female leads Michele Dotrice and Pamela Franklin were both spot on and Sandor Eles was perfectly convincing as the mysterious stranger.All in all a very good mystery thriller, but don't go expecting anything that thrilling though as it's rather slowly paced, but had great atmoshere and tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daylight Dread.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jane (Pamela Franklin) and Cathy (Michele Dotrice) are a couple of British nurses taking a bicycle vacation through rural France. When they have an argument, Jane storms off ahead leaving Cathy sunbathing on the grass. Later on Jane returns but can find no trace of Cathy, stuck in a foreign land and unable to speak the language, Jane soon finds herself in grave danger as she searches frantically for her lost friend.The title is about the protagonist trying to resolve a mystery/terror situation before the darkness falls. Film is completely set in daylight time, with a very limited amount of characters, and no extended bouts of dialogue. Looking at it from the outside, you would not be thought of as ignorant for expecting this to not be frightening or thrilling, yet it is both. The isolation of the countryside is a foreboding presence here, which coupled with Jane's isolation as a foreigner, makes for edgy atmospherics.Director Robert Fuest is in no hurry what so ever to start turning the screws, so the first half of pic is very slow, but patience is rewarded once the girls argue and split up. Then Fuest starts introducing peripheral characters, and writers Brian Clemens and Terry Nation dangle bits of dark information into the plot, about the area and its history. The mystery element is amped up high, the perpetrator could quite easily be anyone who Jane meets, and then we lurch into paranoia and peril when all will be revealed in a wave of daylight dreadfulness.Critics were (are) very much divided about the picture, complaints ranging from it being nasty and distasteful, to it being too laborious for its own good. But it has a very good fan base, and it certainly does what it sets out to do by putting those wiling to invest fully in it on to the edge of their seats. Recommended on proviso you are prepared to bare with it for the first 45 minutes. 7/10</fullReview>

Then, in the evening, we saw this movie in a village movie theatre with only a couple of viewers. It was frightening, and after the movie we had to cycle home on the country road.Other: nice to see Sándor Éles ( this is the original spelling ), the Hungarian born actor in the movie.The hole film has a special atmosphere with a sharp contrast between the sunny countryside and the dark events. Interesting scene when the old man ( the policeman's father ) says that it's going to rain. In the final scene it really starts raining.One of the best suspense movies. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 girls go on a cycling holiday to France. When one of them goes missing, it's up to the other one to try to find out what is going on and try to save her friend.The set up of this was pretty slow but it built up the atmosphere and tension really well. It is set in the French countryside and the sunshine is relentless, which was a nice change from horror movies being shot in a lot of darkness. A lot of the time people are speaking French and the protagonist doesn't understand the language, as there are no subtitles the audience doesn't either, which I thought was clever. While the ending was not unexpected, the amount of suspects did keep me guessing for a while and the film kept the tension building the whole way through. Pamela Franklin did a good job carrying the film mostly on her shoulders, and overall I think it was a very good, tense little thriller. It wasn't particularly scary, so don't see it if you're wanting a good fright, but as a thriller it was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool title. Good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've spent some time this summer trying to track down obscure horror movies from the 1970s, and this is one of the best I've encountered. I am just sick to death of modern movies which this time of year fall into one of three categories. Remakes, sequels, and comic book (or excuse me.... "graphic novels"). After scanning some old titles, this one just jumped out at me. And Soon the Darkness sounds evil and foreboding, and the film basically delivers. And of course I see it has been remade! UGGGHHHHH. No doubt that is an inferior film.Anyway, And Soon the Darkness is the story of two young English women who are bicycling through rural France, and run into some trouble. After an argument, one of them leaves the other to sun herself by the side of a county highway while she pedals to the nearest town. The more flirty of the two stays behind, hoping the handsome young man she has been flirting with that day will drive by on his little European scooter and sweep her off her feet. Well, somebody does just that, but the encounter apparently does not go well. The girl who headed for town waits and waits, but her friend never shows up to meet her. Something bad has likely happened to the other girl, but what? And which of the creepy locals had something to do with it? Maybe they all did.This is one of those films that doesn't let its lack of budget be a hindrance. It uses the wide open countryside very effectively, and it really helps the viewer understand just how vulnerable these girls are. They are easy targets that could be seem from miles away. Some of the shots show creepy-looking farmers just watching them pedal by from a distance. Much of the dialog is French, and no subtitles are provided. I couldn't even get them from my DVD player. Unless you speak French you will be just as bewildered as the girl trying to figure out if the locals know what happened to her friend. The movie is extremely well-filmed, but the ghastly soundtrack is horribly dated and seems inappropriate. Almost as bad as the soundtrack from The Legacy. The conclusion is a little too drawn-out, but the ending should be satisfying enough for anyone who can enjoy the build-up. Definitely a diamond in the rough, this film is worth 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Little Ride In Sunny France . . . . . . "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of classic horror (including that of the 70s part of the genre) as well as a fan of Pamela Franklin, I had been wanting to see this film for several years and finally got a DVD copy. Robert Fuest, who directed another favorite of mine, "Wuthering Heights" (1970), did a masterful job at conveying the quiet menace and isolated feeling of dread. Two young British nurses, Jane (Franklin), and Cathy (Michele Dotrice, daughter of Roy, sister of Karen), are on a bicycling holiday in rural France, where, unbeknownst to them, a murder of young woman tourist took place a few years before. The assailant was never caught. They are blissfully ignorant of this fact, and a mysterious young man, Paul (Hungarian actor Sandor Eles) catches Cathy's eye when the girls make a stop at a small cafe. Of course, it becomes apparent to the viewers that Paul knows more about the murder than he lets on. He shadows the girls for a while, even visits the cemetery where the unfortunate victim is buried. As to whether or not this is a deliberate red herring or not is revealed as the story progresses.Jane and Cathy make another stop on the side of the road several miles down from the cafe and rest for a while on the edge of some pretty thick woods. They get into an argument and Jane leaves in a huff, while Cathy finds herself vulnerable to possibly the perpetrator of the aforementioned crime, in a frightening scene that lets one imagine the terror. After a little time has passed, Jane begins to grow concerned for her friend and regrets leaving Cathy alone. However, she is nowhere to be found. The locals seem to know something but as they don't seem to speak English and Jane knows very little French, her confusion and apprehension becomes that of the audience as well. The local British schoolteacher (Clare Kelly) believes that the killer was also a tourist. Paul claims to have worked on the case and offers to help Jane, but her suspicions and his sketchy behavior cause our young heroine to flee from him and try to get assistance elsewhere. The title of the movie is actually very appropriate, despite the fact that the story takes place in broad daylight. The fact that the later the day grows, the darker it will eventually get, signalling doom and possible death. There is also no violence or blood until the climax. Who is the murderer? Paul? One of the townspeople? The local police officer (John Nettleton)? Or has Cathy simply decided to play a joke on her friend? This movie will keep you guessing. Very nice cinematography as well, and the music is quite good, with the exception of the opening and ending credit tune, a bit bizarre considering the tone of the film.Pamela Franklin never really got the credit she deserved as an actress: she was so convincing in everything I saw her in. Here she is believable as a young nurse caught in a terrifying trap in an unfamiliar country. Dressed simply but nicely throughout, she has a doe-like quality here which makes her seem all the more vulnerable. Michele Dotrice is lovely as well (wish she could have been seen more in films). The late Sandor Eles was unknown to me at the time, but quite good. While not overly menacing or devastatingly handsome, he did possess an interesting charisma. All of the actors cast helped add to the aura of atmospheric suspense."And Soon The Darkness" was recently remade, and no doubt, the Hollywood version will most likely make everything more graphic and obvious. It seems they are running out of ideas. I probably don't have to tell you that I don't think much of remakes in general.The DVD: The film's theatrical trailer, radio spots and talent bios are included, as well as commentary by director Fuest, screenwriter Brian Clemens and Christopher Lee biographer Jonathan Sothcott. I rate the commentary as okay but I don't know why they bemoan the fact that they did not cast a different actor to play Paul. Did they have someone else in mind? I would like to have heard more about Pamela Franklin as well. Some commentaries I like to listen to more than once; this isn't one of them. It could have been better, but it's not the worst commentary I've ever heard.In conclusion, this is one suspense film you can watch during the day and still get a good scare. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best suspense thrillers ever made. Shame about the score. It's good in its quieter moments, but those god awful scare chords nearly ruin what were already scary enough moments by themselves.*huge spoiler here*One thing I didn't like was how the movie attempted to convince you that the detective was the killer. It worked at first, but once you see him discover the victim's bicycle it is way too obvious that he's innocent. This deflated a lot of suspense for me later in the film.*alright, you can start reading again*Still, despite all that it's an excellent movie. I love the poetic shot of the rain falling on the window at the end, and I can't help but feel it should have stopped there instead of cutting to the police car on the road (along with the reprise of the annoying main theme). I also liked how the movie never really answered all the questions it presented. In a way it's frustrating, but it helps put the viewer in the same state of confusion that the protagonist is in. The use of silence is also commendable, especially during the scene where the killer toys with Cathy (arguably one of the best scenes of its kind). Personally I think this is essential viewing for anyone aspiring to make their own horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two nurses, Jane and Cathy, go on a cycling holiday through rural France. After they have been cycling for a while Cathy wants to stop and relax, but Jane wants to press on. Jane thinks that Cathy only wants to linger in the hope of meeting a man on a scooter who she had seen at various points along their journey so far. They argue, and Jane cycles on to the next village, leaving Cathy to sunbathe at a small clearing in some woods.Cathy wakes from a sleep, but becomes scared after she hears a sound in the bushes and discovers her bicycle has been vandalised. Meanwhile, Jane is disturbed by a squabbling couple at the café where she is resting, and cycles back to the woods to find her friend only to find she is no longer there. As time goes by we become convinced that Cathy is genuinely missing and we encounter various other individuals, all of whom seem suspicious to some degree: an ex-pat middle-aged Englishwoman, a gendarme, and the gendarme's deaf father.Although the pacing is fairly slow the tension is ratcheted up quite efficiently. Ultimately, however, I found the ending a bit disappointing. For much of the film the man on the scooter, who claims to be a member of the Surité, is supposedly helping Jane find Cathy, but he behaves so strangely that she becomes afraid of him and runs away. Towards the end of the film Jane finds Cathy's dead body, but the man on the scooter turns out not to be the killer and comes to her rescue at a crucial moment. However, we never get any explanation for his odd behaviour earlier on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two attractive, young English nurses, Jane and Cathy (Pamela Franklin and Michele Dotrice), ignore common sense and ill-advisedly pop on their tightest pairs of shorts for a cycling holiday through France, taking only the most rural roads available. When the girls quarrel, Cathy preferring to sunbathe than to cycle, Jane goes off alone, leaving her friend to soak up the sun. Eventually, Jane returns to the spot where she left Cathy, but finds that her friend has completely disappeared. Worried for Cathy's safety, she tries to find help, but can she trust any of the people that she meets?The pairing of lovely Michele Dotrice (Betty from Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em) and gorgeous Pamela Franklin make this film a treat as it is, but with a superb script from top TV scribes Brian Clemens (The Avengers) and Terry Nation (Dr. Who), and taut direction from Robert Fuest, who employs an effective slow-burn approach to gradually ramp up the tension, And Soon The Darkness proves to be a very stylish, atmospheric and chilling women-in-peril movie.Despite its relaxed pace and lack of exploitative elements (there's no nudity or gore) the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience, gripping and suspenseful throughout: red herrings abound and there are multiple suspects, all of whom act suspiciously. The remote French countryside is used to great effect, cinematographer Ian Wilson capturing a palpable sense of foreboding and menace in the lonely landscape, despite the whole film taking place in bright sunlight. The language barrier adds another level of tension, Jane's inability to fully grasp what is being said to her creating several extremely uncomfortable moments (and with no subtitles, we the viewer are left equally unsure as to precisely what is happening).Fuest does, perhaps, leave it a tad too long before concluding matters, but with a lead as appealing as Franklin, its not too much of a chore to hang on in there till the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective, creepy British thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time in nearly forty years recently and was surprised at how well it stood up. When I saw it as a teenager I had thought the ending a bit corny but that the first 90 minutes up to the revelation as to identity of the killer were as tense as almost any film I had seen up to that point of my life that was not called Psycho. I have seen several tenser films since that night long ago but the ending was better than I gave it credit for too.The plot is simple enough. Two young English girls are on a biking holiday round France and they have different agenda for their trip. One, Kathy, is blonde and there for a party and to meet blokes whilst the other, Jane, is more sensible and apparently intent on doing a mileage similar to that of a rider in the Tour De France. Kathy takes a fancy to a suave young man, Paul, in a café and when Paul follows the girls on his Lambretta and the girls stop for a sunbathe Kathy falls out with Jane at least partly we suspect because she hopes Paul will double back to meet her. Jane goes on for a while then returns to her friend and discovers that she has disappeared. Paul arrives on the scene, conveniently, and tells her that he is a detective. Gradually Jane comes to disbelieve him and flees to the office of the local gendarme. Paul tracks her down and she escapes his desperate, threatening attempts to speak to her. She finds Cathy's dead body, bashes Paul on the head and rushes into the arms of the gendarme and then realises that he, not Paul, is the killer. The film ends with two more girls on bikes cycling through a rain storm whilst a police car heads towards the crime scene.The film looks great, the scenes of these two attractive young women cycling through the sunlit corn fields are idyllic and the growing menace is very well done. We know something has happened but not quite what. The locals seem an increasingly bizarre lot partly because the lack of subtitles makes us identify with an increasingly anxious Jane as we have no idea if they are hostile or not. And that damn Paul keeps turning up when he shouldn't.As I watched the film again I was reminded of the later Franco-Dutch classic Spoorloos ( The Vanishing) whilst the discovery of Cathy's body is like Jamie Lee Curtis in the wardrobe near the end of the original Halloween. And Soon The Darkness lacks the psychological insights of The Vanishing and is not as genuinely scary as Carpenter's slasher masterpiece but it is well done. Paul is played by Sandor Eles who was for many of us best remembered as Mr Paul the Maitre'D in the chronically bad soap Crossroads but he is fine here and John Nettleton as the gendarme is convincing and a million miles from his affable gossipy mate of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. The two girls are good too. Michelle Dotrice as Kathy is best remembered as Frank Spencer's wife Betty but she looks good and is credible as the slightly sillier girl whilst Pamela Franklin is terrific as she gets more and more scared.You never stop wanting her to find her friend and when she is saved at the end I breathed a sigh of relief. And Soon The Darkness is not a great film though it certainly deserves a better reputation with critics for the 'guides' who seem to have based their sniffy reviews on the synopsis and the knowledge that the director, Robert Fuest, and writers, Brian Clemens and Terry Nation, had extensive backgrounds in pot boiler British television of the sixties and seventies. Not great but worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High on tension, low on logic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And Soon the Darkness turns on a now common premise. Two young girls go out on back roads to seek the real France, only to find true danger on an isolated landscape.The film is somewhat unique in its ability to capture terror in broad daylight in a not wholly vacant surrounding. The two girls seemingly have nothing to worry about as they bike along the open roads to their next destination. The set up, though somewhat overdone in present day (and therefore mildly less powerful then it would have been in its time), creates a fairly solid foundation for a truly suspenseful ride. However, once one of the girls goes missing, the realism of the story gets thrown to the wind and some of its primary fear elements turn to frustrations hurled at the television set.While the acting is generally good, there are moments when it seems that Jane (Pamela Franklin) has completely forgotten that her friend has gone missing in the same area where another girl had been murdered not so long ago...that she is in a different country where she doesn't speak the language or know anyone...that the one man she had been confiding in now appears to be a killer. Not only that, but Jane is a reflection of an earlier model of horror victim. On the cusp of "girl power" films, Jane's only defense for the majority of the picture is to run and hide. Most notably, when Jane is in the house where Paul is breaking in, she doesn't search for a weapon. She knows where he is coming in. She has the advantage, but instead she runs on. It's an image that is somewhat hard to accept when seeing it for the first time in modern day.The true faults of the film, though, are in the actions of Paul (Sandor Eles) which never go explained. Why is her always hiding? Why does he constantly leave Jane in the dark? While I'm a fan of filling in the blanks with films, this one seems more like lackluster writing efforts than intentional mystery. For one thing, Paul must be the worst detective of all time. He destroys evidence that may have aided in bringing a killer to justice. He withholds information that could have protected Jane. He is terrible at searching trailers...how many hiding places could there really be (come on, you checked there in the last one). He doesn't see a pair of white panties on a dark ground during the day, but thinks to check under cars for missing bicycles...I find it very hard to find a film scary when the characters seems so utterly incompetent. The film does a good job of building suspense, but then you start to really not care if anyone makes it out alive. There are many others that do the same job while creating logical plot leaps, character development, and fulfilling endings. This film is not the full package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pamela Franklin searches for her friend, Michele Dotrice, in an isolated French countryside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This British thriller, listed as a noir by John Grant, is about two young women (about 20) bicycling in rural France along a sparsely-populated road road on which the unsolved murder of a 21-year old blonde lass was committed 3 years prior. One girl, the blonde of the pair, goes missing and the other searches for her. Her knowledge of French is rudimentary. When French is spoken, there is no translation and we are in the same situation she is, if we do not know French.The movie is influenced by Hitchcock without being too imitative. It lacks the sure touches of the master, which pervade all elements of his films right down to the small details.I would not classify this film as a noir.I rate it about 6/10, maybe a little higher, like 6.5. The IMDb rating of 6.7 accurately suggests that this one is quite well-done. It's not bad. It's more subtle than many thrillers.The screenplay by Brian Clemens makes just about every person encountered a suspect or ambiguous. They do not all cause peril, but there is suspicion that they might. Logic can reduce the number to about 4. What I heard in French cast strong suspicion on one person midway through the story. Our knowledge aside, the presence of a murderer is a strong peril-inducing element.Pamela Franklin is extremely isolated as she attempts to find her friend, Michele Dotrice. The language barrier does this. She doesn't know what others know and she doesn't know whom to trust. The countryside is lonely and isolated too, adding to her problem. At times she's separated from her bicycle. Overt physical violence is present but modest in scope. There is intense emotional violence toward the end. There is also the isolation and intimidation of Franklin and earlier, of Dotrice.The visual elements of this film are a strong point, emphasizing entrapment and danger. The storyline is convoluted nicely. The confusion of Franklin is mirrored by the story's movements that take her back and forth over certain ground, while encountering a handful of people in non-linear ways.There is an effective scene near and in a cemetery in which one character looks at the grave of the earlier victim. The climactic sequence is also very effective.There is one scene of attempted rape. We learn that the first victim was raped. Both young women wear shorts, and the camera makes sure we see plenty of leg. Dotrice has a bare midriff and lays in the sun fetchingly. In these ways, the sexual element is brought out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fun watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a lot better than I thought! The first 50 minutes are very suspenseful. Well paced and well acted. The acting is a lot better in the 70s compared to the 60s. All through the movie you get to see the beautiful country side of France. If you watch this make sure to not see the black and white version. Not seeing this in color really takes away from the movie. You won't get the same experience.Through out the whole movie I kept going back and forth on who was the killer. There were too may potential suspects. At first I thought it was the ''detective'', then I thought it was the guy who worked at the café, then I even thought the old woman had something to do with the girl's disappearance. It had me in circles! It wasn't until the near end that I found out who it was. Complete surprise which is what a lot of horror movies today don't have. Only downfall about this movie was about one hour into it, it got a little boring since nothing much was happening. But quickly picked up again when the chase scene began.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>kept guessing to the very end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some irony here in that despite the title's reference to 'darkness', this is a rare horror film shot completely in the bright sun, except for the excellent rainy ending. Everything about this well photographed film is good. There are no plot holes, the cast work well and the two girls, Pamela Franklin and Michele Dotrice give particularly convincingly natural performances. It's just that, just a little more should be happening early on. There are just too many occasions when Franklin's character is told to 'Wait here', whilst off someone goes to explore the wood again. Still, the finale at the area with all the old scrap vehicles is very well done and we are kept guessing to the very end. The main baddie puts in a vigorous performance at the end too in a most convincing scene of sexual violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it starts very slow, but then picks up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sort of thriller that reminds us much of "Charade". Charade came first, so it gets the bragging rights.And I don't think it is a spoiler to say that, except to those who saw "Charade", and like me, they will pretty well know what is going on all the time. A\ It starts very very slow. The first 20 minutes is absolutely nothing, but at least the scenery is good. We get to see leggy women and nice country side. Had this been made in a city, and the women wore slacks, you would have fallen asleep long before the twenty minute mark.We begin in an outdoor cafe, and one woman is taking a picture. We know the camera and film will be an important cog, but it could also be a red herring.From there, the suspense is very well done. In 1970, this was not as easy to predict as today. Being easy to predict doesn't make it bad, though, not when the story line follows logic. Any other sort of outcome would have been "illogical" considering the clues. I am already risking the spoiler here, so I won't elaborate. Suffice to say, it is well thought out, well written, well done all around. I would have liked to seen a bit more energy in the first twenty minutes. The country side wasn't that pretty. Good film, and actually very believable for this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AND SOON THE DARKNESS (Robert Fuest, 1970) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two British girls vacationing in rural France find themselves at the mercy of a sex maniac. This somewhat arty and slow-burning suspenser on THE LADY VANISHES lines was production designer-turned-director Fuest's third directorial effort and his entrée into the genre in which he specialized for the rest of his relatively short but stylish film career. Co-written by Brian Clemens (the creator of TV's THE AVENGERS ? on which series Fuest served in both capacities) and Terry Nation (the creator of TV's DOCTOR WHO), the film hardly proves as fanciful as such credentials would suggest; in fact, it is agreeably streamlined and reasonably well sustained by an eerie atmosphere, glossy visuals and Laurie Johnson's evocative score. Although somewhat undercast as befits its low-key setting, the film is peopled by vivid characters: from increasingly distressed star Pamela Franklin to ambiguous helper/stalker Sandor Eles and from stranded British schoolmistress Clare Kelly to wide-eyed gendarme John Nettleton. Disappointingly, when the climactic confrontation eventually comes about towards the very end, the surprising villain is disposed of very quickly with just one blow to the head! The film was unnecessarily and inauspiciously remade in 2010 ? which version is available to view in its entirety on "You Tube" ? but I have not bothered with it myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Be Better, Maybe I Need a Second Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jane (Pamela Franklin) and Cathy (Michele Dotrice) are English girls on a cycling holiday in France terrorized by a sex maniac.Written by Brian Clemens and Terry Nation and directed by Robert Fuest. Fuest does an adequate job, but his work is much better with his next two projects: the Dr. Phibes films with Vincent Price.Howard Maxford says the film has "a couple of good thrills", but is "overstretched" (the film is 99 minutes). Maxford is typically harsh on horror, but his assessment here is fairly accurate: the first would maintain a better pace if it were five minutes shorter, and the "good thrills" are few, as essentially a single English-speaking character had to carry the entire film.The film is typical of the era for Britain. Its light-hearted at times, though it does tend to get dark briefly. No outright gore, and even the "Sex maniac" aspects are pretty tame, though somewhat terrifying for the time, most likely.The film did not hold my interest as well as I had hoped, so I cannot give it a ringing endorsement. But with the release of the remake, it certainly never hurts to be aware of the source material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry I cannot understand rave reviews of this film. On the surface it is a good thriller but has serious flaws1. Every character acts suspiciously like an Agatha Christie novel, even the British ex-pat teacher that never appears again2. -Spoiler- why did the Paul character ruin the film from the camera if he was not the killer. It just does not make sense3. -Spoiler- there are no clues during the film of the eventual Perpetrator. A mystery/crime plot should at least leave some clues rather just presenting the killer at the last moment.Overall not really good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy daylight horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two young British girls are hiking in the countryside in France with their bicycles, but their idea of how to spend a holiday is quite different. After a quarrel in a grove close to the road, they split up. The brunette continues to nearest village by her own. After calming down she decides to wait for her friend at a café. But the blond never shows. After returning to the grove the blond girl is gone and nobody has seen her pass by the villages before and after the grove...This film had very tense atmosphere. When a slow-paced film is done well, it is often more suspenseful than any high-paced action film. I found myself sitting on the edge most of the film. The last five minutes before the blond girl disappears is some of the creepiest daylight horror I've seen. You could criticize the ending, there was some inconsistencies, but the atmosphere was simply so great that I can tolerate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two English girls on a biking holiday ride through a rural portion of France, populated exclusively by sinister people. Somewhat too cleverly plotted film, with a huge red herring: one of the main characters acts in a completely irrational way simply to create confusion for the audience and lead into a kind of trick ending. Perhaps Cathy's extreme reticence is meant to be typical British reserve, but she eventually seems too self-possessed to be credible. And why bother to move the victim, when the entire location is so remote? Granted, it's well-directed and suspenseful throughout, but once it's over, the irrationalities undercut the accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some priceless footage of life in rural France from a bygone era, but boy-oh-boy this film is desperately slow: and I've a feeling many watching this will simply give-up on it too early. The inspired idea by the film-makers to refrain from subtitling the spoken French allows the viewer to empathise with the plight (and confusion) of a young girl desperately trying to seek help for her friend; and I suppose the quirky characters they introduce do a decent job of keeping the viewer guessing.Provided they're still awake, of course: as my abiding memory of this film will sadly be its plodding nature, which left me feeling frustrated, rather than in suspense.</fullReview>

Starts off promisingly enough, but then it takes AGES for anything important to happen. The last 30 minutes are essentially a looooong, silent chase, and we are about 90% sure that the supposed villain is not really the villain. The remaining 10% is not enough to make the chase suspenseful. (*1/2)</fullReview>
