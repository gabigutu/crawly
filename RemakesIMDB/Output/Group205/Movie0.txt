		<shortDescription>Irma La Douce (Billy Wilder)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irma la Douce is a gem, one of Billy Wilders best films. Banned from TV for many years by network censors, it began as a Broadway play and ran from Sep 29, 1960 to Dec 31, 1961 playing at both the Plymouth Theatre and the Alvin Theatre in New York. It quickly won the attention of Hollywood and in 1963 debuted as a film starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. It is a love story, the story of a policeman turned reformer who falls madly in love with a beautiful young prostitute. The IBDB captures its essence best: "Irma La Douce" is not only French; it is intensely Parisian French. Set in an area tourists seek, but so seldom find, its musical idiom, its moral atmosphere, its plot and its argot are part of Paris not even all Parisians know; a part of Paris where the underworld is known as the "milieu." A tart is a "poule," a pimp is a "mec" and money is "grisbi." If you remember Sam Seborn's affair with a prostitute in the first season of West Wing, you have the advantage. Mix with this belief in the underlying goodness of a person with the enchanting music and backdrop of Paris and you will find yourself pulling for Nester (Lemmon) in his quest to win Irma's hand. Marilyn Monroe was originally scheduled to play Irma but died before the film work began. As a credit to Wilder's casting, Shirley MacLaine's performance earned her an Oscar nomination for best actress. The film's cinematography received its own Oscar nomination and the music took Hollywood by storm. It's stunning Parisian melody, written by Marguerite Monnot and arranged for film by Andre Previn, won the Oscar for best music and remains one of the finest musical scores ever.And within the cheerful comedy of the plot, the story's philosopher shines bright as the mentor for Lester who struggles to overcome the muk of daily life. Being none other than the bar tender and owner of the Chez Moustache, the bar and stage center for much of the film, Moustache lends his shoulder to Lester and instructs him in the realities of life: life accepts no conscientious objector and must be approached as if it were a war where only the strong survive. In other words, face the world as it is, not as you were told it was.Watch this film on DVD and get the wide screen version if you can. If you find yourself critical of the film, remember that this is late 50's, early 60's America. It came out during the cold war, in a period where TV was still in its 'Andy of Mayberry' days. Movies were heavily censored and even the media was under intense scrutiny for what topics matters it discussed. Irma La Douce was buried from play and only lately rediscovered by VHS &amp; DVD fans. Transport yourself back to the "Milieu" and enjoy, you may just learn something about life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's Irma la Douce is an absolute gem. Coming after 'Some Like it Hot' and 'One, Two, Three' and before the similarly undervalued 'Kiss Me, Stupid' it is part of Wilder's most creative period. Shirley Maclaine is perfect as the hooker with the heart of gold and Lemmon is hilarious as the protective lover.Largely shot in studio, Wilder makes hay with the control that this gives him, with a fabulous market where Lemmon works to keep Irma off the streets.It is such a joy to see Lou Jacobi in the pivotal role of Moustache. His line delivery cannot be faulted and he is given many of the film's funniest moments.It is also a joy to watch a great wit like Wilder show us that prostitution is a way of earning a living, not a social problem. May you smile in Heaven, Billy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Wilder's most divisive film's amongst his fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from Alexandre Breffort's stage musical, Irma la Douce in film form turns into something of a roller-coaster ride. Even allowing for the absence of the songs {a major gripe with purists}, the film is far too bloated to really achieve the heights of being a great comedy classic. If it had been condensed to perhaps a 100 minute film then I think it could of achieved the splendour that some sequences hint at. As it is tho there is still much to enjoy, and nobody should be under the allusion that this film isn't funny, because it is, but just how long can you stretch the joke Mr Wilder?.I think the chief thing that sticks out is just how did Wilder get such an overtly sexual farce past the censors? He pushes the boundary more than usual with this one, and I honestly would be surprised if he himself wasn't surprised to get away with so much cheeky sexual shenanigans. The sets are fabulous from Alexandre Trauner, and Andre Previn's score is perfect and in tune with the Parisian heart of the film, but the lead actors here are oddly not firing on all cylinders.Jack Lemmon's hopeless romantic Nestor is the core humour character. A character who becomes jealous of himself! His transformation into an English fop is hilarious at first, but on, and on, and on it goes till the joke becomes a heavy weight on the film's shoulders. Lemmon is fine, he's just the victim of over ambition from Wilder. Shirley MacLaine is the title character and it doesn't quite come off, sure she gives it gusto and she looks fabulous {as always}, but the role cried out for a more cosmopolitan actress, and this again comes down to Wilder losing site of things with this particular project.It's a safe recommend for Lemmon fans, but for Wilder worshippers such as me the problems are evident in spite the film being his highest grossing film of the decade. A cautionary 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten Wilder treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder is remembered for "Some Like It Hot" but not this great Jack Lemmon/Shirley MacLaine comedy of a Paris cop falling in love with a prostitute. In many ways, it's funnier, and certainly risque. But tasteful and delightful overall.Until recently, I had never seen this film in widescreen. But I loved this movie since I was 11 years old. It celebrates love and jealousy in ways that tickle. Moustache is the best reason to watch the film for his witty dialogue and comedic timing.Fans of cameos should spot Bill Bixby and Grace Lee Whitney (Yeoman Janice Rand of Star Trek: TOS). I remember a time when I could tell you other things about this film, but that's another story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"But That's Another Story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Irma La Douce as much as I liked it, I was puzzled by the fact that Billy Wilder had chosen to do this hit musical without any songs in it. Very much like Fanny from a few years ago which also had a French setting and came to the screen without its score. The Broadway cast album was a staple in my house and I certainly enjoyed the songs that Keith Mitchell and Elizabeth Seal and the rest of the cast did on Broadway.What made it more puzzling was the presence of Bruce Yarnell in the movie cast, the possessor of a really nice baritone voice, he played opposite Ethel Merman in the Lincoln Center revival of Annie Get Your Gun. That together with the fact Shirley MacLaine first made her mark in musical roles, in fact she had starred in the screen version of Can-Can the two years before.Well, according to the recent biography of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov in fact this film started out as a musical. Somewhere there is some footage of MacLaine, Yarnell, possibly even Jack Lemmon and Lou Jacobi doing some musical numbers lying in a vault somewhere. Wilder said he thought the numbers slowed the pace of the story and midpoint in the film he just scrapped what he had shot and didn't bother with the rest.Personally I wish he had kept the numbers in, maybe it would have made Irma La Douce run too long. Who knows maybe we'll get to see them some day.Shirley MacLaine got an Oscar nomination for her performance in the title role. She's a good natured working girl who has the misfortune to get busted by the one cop in Paris who is not winking at prostitution on his first day on his new beat. That would be Jack Lemmon who for his honest law enforcement gets himself fired.That far from ends it as Lemmon falls for MacLaine and like he did in The Apartment sees himself as her savior. The rest of the film is the ridiculous lengths Lemmon goes to save MacLaine from her life of sin and debauchery. His one confidante is Lou Jacobi who plays Moustache the owner of a local bistro where the girls and their mecs(that's French for pimp) hang out. His role was originally intended for Charles Laughton.Billy Wilder has a well deserved reputation as a cynical observer of humankind and had some run ins with several Hollywood greats. But he became an unabashed admirer of Charles Laughton after working with him on Witness for the Prosecution. The tenderest part of that Wilder biography tells about how Wilder kept visiting Laughton up to the end discussing the part with both of them knowing it was never to be. Yet I wish Laughton had lived to do the part. It would really have been special.Bruce Yarnell's part is that of MacLaine's mec. His career too was tragically cut short by a plane crash that he was killed in later in the decade. Terrific voice, nice screen and stage presence, what a terrible thing to happen.Though I would have liked to have seen the musical, I can't fault Billy Wilder's production of Irma La Douce. The fact that this came to the screen at all was further demonstration of the Code finally being lifted from the backs of the creative. Maybe we will see a full blown musical adaptation of Irma La Douce some day. But that's another story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Paris, after six months working with children, the decorated rookie policeman Nestor Patou (Jack Lemmon) is assigned to work in the red light district on the Casanova Street, a place crowded of streetwalkers, pimps and corrupt police officers. The honest Nestor, who is naive and strictly by the book, notes the movement of couples in the Casanova Hotel and befriends the prostitute Irma La Douce (Shirley MacLaine) believing that she is a lady. When he discovers that she is also a streetwalker, he calls the central station for a raid in the hotel. However, among the arrested costumers is the corrupt Chief of Police Lefevre (Herschel Bernardi) that has a scheme with the pimps union. Nestor is fired with a dirty record and has difficulties to find a new job; he goes to the bistro of the versatile and experienced Moustache (Lou Jacobi) to drink, and he starts a conversation with Irma La Douce. However, her bully pimp Hippolyte (Bruce Yarnell) fights against Nestor, but he beats him up. Irma brings Nestor home and he becomes Irma's pimp. However he falls in love for her and he is jealous when she meets a client. He decides to create the wealthy British Lord X to be the only regular client of Irma. But things go wrong when Nestor is jealous of Lord X and decides to end his character."Irma la Douce" is a delightful fairytale of the fantastic Billy Wilder, certainly one of the five top-directors of Hollywood ever. Based on a play, this delicious romantic comedy has witty and cynical screenplay and dialogs, supported by the chemistry of the charming and gorgeous Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon, who had worked together three years ago in the masterpiece "The Apartment". Lou Jacobi plays a skilled man in hilarious situations. The lines of Jack Lemmon playing a British lord are very funny. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Irma la Douce"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So it's not the greatest Billy Wilder/Jack Lemmon comedy ever, but it's definitely a very amusing film with witty performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirly McLaine who prove here once again what a believable, great screen couple they make. The scene stealer in this one, though, is Lou Jacobi as Moustache, the hilarious and "wise" bartender across the street. The film loses some of its humor at somes places, but it really takes off the moment Jack becomes Lord X. The music is a great asset, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to Wilder's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lou Jacobi's performance is by far the best thing about this movie - but that's another story.The fact that this movie is based on a musical is fascinating. For some reason Wilder jettisoned the music but retained the "flavor" of the musical. The sets and the supporting characters seem exactly like they are in a musical - especially the brute who is MacLaine's first pimp, supplanted by Lemmon. He seems like a baritone about to break into song at any moment - especially when he bellows to Irma from the street. The scenes in the bar all seem like out-takes from Guys and Dolls! The ambiance of the film is very peculiar.For a Billy Wilder film, it seems very slow. Plenty of lines are thrown away and fail to hit their mark (such as MacLaine's line, "Oh you won't get cold," when she takes Lemmon into her apartment for the first time, which is delivered flatly without any saucy double entendre.) At other times the dialog seems to kind of drag - very un-Wilder-like. To me the scene when Lemmon removes his clothes while MacLaine smokes in bed doesn't strike either a sexy or a poignant tone. MacLaine's hunched-over posture is NOT a sexy pose. And Lemmon's covering the windows with newspaper demonstrates his naiveté and bashfulness, but his preoccupation with it kind of robs the scene of poignancy. It just kind of plods, and there is very little dialog to help it move along. Wilder also seems to rely on much more slapstick (as opposed to just plain "sight" gags) in this movie.MacLaine is acting in a kind of light drama, while Lemmon is acting in a farce. To me the two never really mesh, so the movie never hits its intended mark. It is a pity that Marilyn Monroe, Wilder's first choice for Irma, was not available. She would have been a far better comic foil than MacLaine - just check out Some Like It Hot to bear me out.MacLaine has moments when she seems rather wistful. Otherwise, she seems pretty much like a weary (and world-weary) "working girl." She doesn't deliver enough wistfulness to be charming, nor enough weariness to inspire pathos. I was left feeling pretty ambivalent about her character: she's neither comical nor sympathetic. Based on such an ambivalent central character the film, itself, never jells for me. It can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a light, poignant drama. It doesn't balance the comic and the poignant elements very well.As an actor, Jack Lemmon is very hit-or-miss with me. He often seems more manic than comic. That is how he strikes me in Irma la Douce. His one note caricature of the British Lord wears pretty thin. In fact that is also the big plot hole in this film. He takes to pimping because he cannot find work. Once he starts working like a slave, there is no need for the Lord X ruse anymore. Of course that artifice is really the entire movie. So the whole contrivance seems like the emperor's new clothes to me.The "assumed" life Lemmon's Lord X constructs out of classic British literature is all good fun, but by maintaining the focus on Lemmon's delivery rather than have MacLaine react in some appreciable way for the camera, all of that shtick is pretty wasted to me. All the while Lemmon is rambling on about Gunga Din or whatever, MacLaine responds verbally but just keeps on playing solitaire. Wasted opportunity for some good comic reactions in both dialog and facial expressions! Because this film moves slowly and lacks snappy dialog delivery, it seems more contrived than comical. For a contrivance that works, watch "Some Like It Hot" or a great little gem like "One, Two, Three."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "Irma la Douce" can't quite compare to Wilder's greatest works, it's nonetheless an entertaining lightweight piece with ravishing photography, delightful performances, gorgeous set design, and a top-notch musical score. As a whole the film just isn't remarkable enough to reach the level of "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment", and it suffers from being needlessly drawn out. Lou Jacobi almost steals the show from Lemmon and MacLaine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Wilder than Breffort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is Billy Wilder's rewriting of Alexandre Breffort's French musical farce. In 1960, David Merrick brought an English version of the piece to the United States. This Brechtian play concerned penniless law student Nestor le Fripe and his jealous love for his prostitute girl friend, Irma. He disguises himself as Monsieur Oscar and becomes her only client. When he becomes jealous of Oscar, he pretends to murder the fake client. He is assisted in this scheme by Bob, a bartender who also serves as a narrator of sorts.Wilder keeps the basic idea of the play, but turns le Fripe, now Nestor Patou, into a policeman who falls for Irma. Bob becomes known as Moustache and Monnot's songs are used only for background music. In the leading roles, Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Lou Jacobi, Hershel Bernardi and Bruce Yarnell are as French as French fries. Wilder injects the farce with his usual cynical romanticism. The shame is that all of the leading players had musical comedy backgrounds and could have put across the musical numbers with style. Wilder did not have to use all 14 musical numbers, but 2 or 3 would have made the point. There is no reason why Jacobi could not have opened the film with "Valse Milieu". The "Dis-donc" number is almost performed by Shirley MacLaine in the film; why wasn't it done? Jack Lemmon could have crooned "Our Language of Love" to Shirley in the early bedroom scene. Maybe Wilder felt that the music would take the bite out the his film. It would have, but it would have made the film warmer. Thank goodness Wilder decided to include some silly slapstick to lighten the piece a bit.When I first saw this film, I was disappointed in it, but after a few more viewings, it stands up well against Wilder's other cynical-romantic comedies of this era. And it is the only one in color!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the sweet side of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess that whenever Billy Wilder cast Jack Lemmon in a movie, the result was always good. In this case, Lemmon plays gendarme Nestor Patou, who has his eye on prostitute Irma la Douce (Shirley MacLaine). He's not sure whether to arrest her or come on to her, but he'll have to make up his mind soon, or it will all come crashing down on him.Maybe "Irma la Douce" wasn't a masterpiece like "Some Like It Hot" or "The Apartment", but it does leave you with a good feeling. Certainly, it dignifies prostitutes; the more the outsiders berate prostitution, the more you identify with the prostitutes. Not a movie that you're likely to forget anytime soon. Lovely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>«What are you going to do now, Billy ?» someone asked Wilder after he received the Academy Award for his perfect film, The Apartment. The answer was One, Two, Three, then Irma La Douce with a re teaming of Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine : both films were rather bullied by critics although the latter would score a box-office hit. But to compare The Apartment with Irma is in itself absurd : inevitably, it's less gripping, biting and moving. Yet, as it tells such a different story, which develops in a rather unexpected light, it did work out for me -at least more than this disastrous other mixture of pepper and sugar, The Emperor's Waltz.Set in Paris' hot spot of Les Halles in the 60's (but it does look much older at times), narrated by uncredited Louis Jourdan (who else could muse «don't you believe it» with such smooth ? ), here's the love story of a sexy, independent-minded prostitute and a naive happy-go-lucky cop. Fired from the corrupt police force because of his honesty, Nestor becomes Irma's pimp and lover. But his jealousy drives him to dress up as a British Lord to secure all of his business partner's attentions. What follows is a bunch of misunderstandings and ultimately a lavish church wedding, with prostitutes as bridesmaids and a very pregnant bride. Well, believe it or not.Yet, the fantasy is saved by its own dizzy charm- and there's plenty of it : a good combination of screwball comedy, light drama and witty dialogs only Wilder and Diamond could write- so good the characters say them several times. The real problem is the length. No Parisian farce should exceed two hours and this one would have deserved a quicker start. Irma's tear-jerking, phony stories, while the main credits still roll, could have been cut with no harm , and the same goes for the general slowness in the development, with too many too long sequences. One of these musicals without music, Irma still get an Oscar for Andre Previn's beautiful score. Its atmospheric themes, composed by Marguerite Monnot for the original operetta, make for a very pleasant listening, specially the intimate «Language of Love» and the only dance number, done with disarming skill and energy by the two leads. Settings too have that singling out quality: from the poetic Casanova street, designed by Alexander Trauner, complete with old shop signs, to Irma's homey studio and the real things : sunny Parisian bridges where poor Jack Lemmon had to swim out. Honestly, the whole thing looks better than Midnight in Paris.An other determinate point is the humanity depicted by behind the kookiness of characters and situations. They are crazy and unbelievable for sure, but in a lovable way. I could not care a bit for the boheme bunch of Can-Can, a film much similar to this one (at least, it has MacLaine as a light dancer), but this one won me over. Comic does drag a bit, but there are moments genuinely hilarious : the jail escape, Lemmon's British imitation: «The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain...I've seen every English movie in town», and about every time mysterious bartender Moustache is around, a character not so unlike «le maître de jeu» from La Ronde. And indeed, the lightness in the folly brings back the spirits of Max Ophuls or Luigi Pirandello, as well as some good old' slapstick.Apart from the pleasure of having Jack and Shirley together again, it's actually quite nice to see them as «a real couple», up to strange adventures but also conventional banter, kisses and fights. Both of the characters are eccentrics and first very puzzled at each other, but they're willing to get along and one can easily buy their quirky romance. Lemmon gives a wonderful spontaneity to Nestor, that constantly saves him from caricature. Honest to a fault, madly jealous and overenthusiastic, you actually care for the guy when he gets punched by Irma's pimp or cries with exhaustion after the girl mistakes his moonlighting for infidelity. And his flamboyance as middle-aged Lord X, chuckling and impotent, lets his natural versatility shine. He'll get another great double part in The Great Race. As for MacLaine, in a part previously meant for Marilyn Monroe, she's pleasantly at ease and injects her own touch to the cliché of the sweet prostitute with green stockings. Stoic and casual, Irma wants security, stability and respect : she's a serious businesswoman of the underworld, that never seems over-concerned about anything. But like every Wilder heroin, she has also a good deal of cute innocence: «You don't anything about men, because you've been with too many», Nestor tells her near the end of the story. A lot has been said about the filthy, racy mood - sure there are plenty not so subtle double entendres and some very plain lines, but with a general feeling of live and let live behind. Irma's stimulation of Lord X's blocked imagination are a wink to Some Like It Hot. And there's a graceful little scene, when Nestor and Irma are about to make love for the first time. While she's willing and practical, he gets shy and asks her to put her night mask while he undresses. After a fade, you find the mask on a sleeping, peaceful Nestor. The ending does not make much sense - nor does the reappearance of Lord X with all the clothes found months before by the cops, but who cares ? Like Moustache, masterfully played by Lou Jacobi, claims: that's another story. A story of hate, love, passion and death. All those things that make life worth living.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irma La Douce- Some Like It Hot It Isn't ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny 1963 film re-teaming the great Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine once again.As he was in "Hot," Lemmon is another good-natured jerk, who falls for hooker MacLaine and accepts another identity so as to keep her going financially and off the street.While Lou Jacobi is appealing in the role of the bar-keeper, his main presence is a major reason for the downfall of this film. When Lemmon is blamed for killing off the character he has been portraying, Jacobi knew all this and could have gotten Lemmon off. Instead, he continues the charade which lands Lemmon in jail unnecessarily. Some may call this comedy, I call it stupidity.Lemmon is wonderful as always as the cop and as the street-walker, Mac Laine delivers another Oscar nominated performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good if you don't know the musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been disappointed with this movie only because I was a huge fan of the very under-rated musical upon which it is based. Hollywood has often significantly altered stage musicals (ie. Cabaret) and written new scores for the movie versions, but I've seldom known them to do what they did with this film. They completely scrapped the songs and re-wrote the book. (Some on the music from the original stage musical remains as incidental music in the film score.)While Lemmon and McClain deliver strong comic performances, I wish Wilder had tried to retain more of the original musical and those wonderful melodic songs when making the film version. (Imagine "Sweet Charity" with all the songs removed and the book re-written and that's what you have here.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, a lot tamer than we thought back in 1963.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A numerical rating for "Irma la Douce" (Earrrma, the sweet) has little meaning, since that would require comparison with the best modern films. I was a senior in high school when this film came out, and I recall little about it other than its "risque" nature. Viewing it today, it comes off very tame, the only thing "objectionable" is its depiction of working prostitutes as a way of life in France. However everything is suggested. There is no nudity, and no foul language. The film is classic for its time, a simple little romantic comedy story, beautifully filmed with great actors. Set in Paris, none of the characters even try to sound "French." It sounds mostly like any other American movie.For an old film, the DVD transfer is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's shark-jumping screwball romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's shark-jumping screwball romp set in le quartier rouge of Paris, couples for the second time the riveting pair from THE APARTMENT (1960), Lemmon plays a goofball cop Nestor Patou, only soon to be discharged from his duty by dint of his impetuous intervention of the local sex industry, and becomes a pimp of the numero uno streetwalker, our titular Irma la douce (MacLaine).Poules and their mecs, this is the basic bundle of the oldest profession, Nestor's foolhardiness and knight errantry conquers Irma right on the spot, not to mention that he also physically defeats her abusive (now ex-)pimp Hippolyte the Ox (Yarnell), a set piece reminiscent of the early silent comedy sketches, rough-hewn, clumsy but laboriously funny. So now Nestor is the red-hot new mec, even been elected as the chairman of the MPPA (Mec's Paris Protective Association), but like any man who has his manhood to protect, as much as he loves Irma, and vice versa, he cannot get over the fact that many a customer can share his darling love's company and body for sexual pleasure, and he in fact lives off her for all the income.A highly specious plan has been hatched with the aid of Moustache (Jacobi), the genial proprietor of the bar around the corner, whose past experiences enlivens the story with its running joke "and that's another story" until a pretty nonsensical but zany finish to leave audience in utter astonishment and amusement. What is the plan? Nester disguises himself as an ageing British gentleman Lord X, who will patronize Irma twice a week, each time offers her 500 francs (the money he would borrow from Moustache), so that, Irma doesn't need to see any other customers thanks to the munificent gestures from Lord X, when Irma gives the money to Nestor, he will return the money back to Moustache.Of course, the plan only sounds plausible on paper, the very first time, almost all the 500 has been squandered on champagnes for celebration. In order to earn extra money to pay back to Moustache, Nestor has to sneak out of their flat in the middle of night every day to work in the local food market, dealing with fish, pork, vegetables and fruits, which exhausts him and he must sneak back in the morning before Irma wakes up. That's where the story goes berserk like a folly propelled by absurd incidents and drollness, up to a point, rationality will be completely thrown out of the window.Marvellously, the viewer will not feel too much of being cheated or exasperated by the outright cop-out into a spuriousness-prone farce, mostly owing to two leading stars' comic aptitude, Lemmon engages in with unswerving gusto, from strictly choreographed slapstick to onerous physical labor, to invite audience to stand by him and pat him on the back no matter how ridiculous the story-line unwinds; MacLaine, on the other hand, oozes deadly sexiness in the common working-girl-with-a-golden-heart formula, it is strange that she receives an Oscar nomination while Lemmon misses, the competition in these two categories are usually not on the same level, especially after Hollywood's Golden Age, the quality of female roles has been drastically dwindled ever since. Moreover, Lou Jacobi should have walked away with at least an Oscar nomination for his firmly supportive but equally opportune scene-stealing act.Among Wilder's tremendous body of work, IRMA LA DOUCE doesn't have any single chance to claim best, but instead, it preserves itself in a niche as an odd experiment whose sole objective is to give audience a buzz, and it has accomplished its goal with admirable dash, no one can deny, that's something only can be manufactured with the help of a master-hand and intelligent-mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old-fashioned fun with Wilder, Lemmon and Mac Laine ... and a scene-stealing Lou Jacobi ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might recognize her from her black dress, her green stockings matching a blouse of the same color, and a little poodle named 'Coquette'. She uses to hang out in a bar across Rue Casanova in Les Halles, Paris, owned by the jovial and friendly Moustache. And one last detail, not the least, she's the most popular prostitute out there. She's Irma La Douce or the Sweet in Shakespeare's language.And sweet is an understatement, for there is something irresistible in Shirley Mac Laine's performance as Irma, making her profession harder to understand for her customers, as for us ? well, not quite so: as movie viewers, we know prostitutes always hide a softer and sweeter soul behind their sordid occupation, but the film doesn't treat the subject with unnecessary gravity anyway. Instead, it helps to set the character's personality through a funny running gag where she explains how she ended up in that racket, and I have to admit I almost believed her first version during the opening credits, before the following scene reminded me that it was still a Billy Wilder comedy I was watching, and not every word was to be taken at face value."Irma la Douce" treatment of prostitution is still quite innocent for its time despite the many sexual innuendo that fill the screenplay written by Wilder and his all-time partner L.A.L Diamond. All the hookers, including Irma, are closer to Benny Hill's pin-ups than any hooker from the 70's ghettos. There is one decade between "Irma la Douce" and "Klute" or "Taxi Driver", but on the scale of cinematic evolution, it's an eternity. But the tone is perfect for the screwball comedy, adapted from a French musical based on the play from Alexandre Breffort. No room for cynicism when you have the so adorable face of Shirley Mac Laine, much more, with Jack Lemmon, her co-star in Wilder's previous success: "The Apartment". The 1960 Best Picture is still superior, but acting-wise and chemistry-wise, Lemmon and Mac Laine still got it in "Irma".And besides the performances, which were delicious slices of Mac Laine's "innocent baby-faced girl-next-door" Lemmon's "clumsy-struggling-everyman" periods, what I loved the most about the film, was its remarkable recreation of the post-War postcard-like Paris, where prostitution is only part of that entertaining soul dedicated to tourists, tired workers and businessmen, the sleepless Paris and its 'petites femmes'. As depicted in a film, it's a whole holistic system ensuring a profit for everyone: the girls, their "macs" (the word "pimp" is never used), the customers, and even cops are taken care of. Everything works until, a disaster happens: a honest cop. This is officer Nestor Patou, Jack Lemmon as a newly promoted cop in Les Halles, noticing on his first day strange going-on between Rue Casanova and the namesake hotel.He then questions Moustache, whose real name is Constacescu, Moustache was the former owner's name, but it was more convenient to grow one than buy a new sign (logical and priceless). And Jacobi delivers a magnificent performance as a man who seemed to have embraced any possible career in his lifetime: being between many others, a lawyer, a teacher, a businessman? but as he says "that's another story". Yet from these stories, he learned many lessons, making him the film's voice of reason. And before Patou calls his colleagues, Moustache warns him: "to be overly honest in a dishonest world is like plucking a chicken against the wind... you'll only wind up with a mouth full of feathers." Patou gets the whole chicken in his mouth. Now, if there was one way to summarize the whole misadventures that drive the love story between Patou and Irma, I'd rather copy-paste that quote from the film, delivered when Patou was accused of killing his main rival, who was his girl's most valuable client, the British Lord X. Are you ready? Here it is: "You couldn't have killed Lord X because you were Lord X only you weren't Lord X, you were a mac. Only you weren't a mac, you worked in the market to pay for making love to your own girl from making the money to give to Lord X to give to Irma to give to you to pay for making love to your own girl, whom you could have made love to for free, except you were too tired from making the money to give to Lord X to give to Irma to give to you. That's the truth. If you tell that mishmash to a jury, you're a cinch to get 15 years." That is the plot in a nutshell and I wonder how I could have followed every bit of this spaghetti of a plot, with the same enthusiastic mood. I guess this is a credit to the performances -Mac Laine got an Oscar nomination, but I could have figured one for Lemmon and Jacobi- and the fantastic Technicolor recreation of Paris. However, I must admit, not without guilt, that sometimes I watched my watch. 147 minutes is still too much demanding in terms of patience, much more for a comedy, and maybe the film could have cut a few bits: one scene is Les Halles' market was redundant and since the film didn't intend to be a musical, it could have done without the musical number, no matter how terrific Mac Laine's dancing was."Irma" had the wit, the zaz, but not that straightforwardness that made Wilder's previous works such unbeatable classics. But to call it "minor" would be unfair. Well, I felt the film dragged too long and at the end, I was eager to see 'the end' but that impatient feeling was rewarded by the ending. I must say I didn't see the last minute coming, and it reminded me that if there was a cinematic God for mind-blowing finales and great concluding lines, that man was Billy Wilder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sweet street soliciting girl of the Red Light District in Paris (the delightful Shirley MacLaine) meets a young and naive police officer (Jack Lemmon) who becomes her new pimp after a big turmoil in which he arrested all the "girls" thus spoiling the understanding in force between the police and the pimps union. Because of that he is expelled from the police on a false accusation of bribery, returns to the Red Light District, has a comic fight with Irma's current pimp, defeats him with much luck and replaces him. But since he has fallen in love with Irma he's not happy seeing her going with other men all the time while practicing her "profession". Therefore he concocts a plan with the help of a friendly bar owner (Lou Jacobi) to take her off the street and disguises himself as an English lord who as a "client" keeps Irma busy for hours playing cards with him under a generous payment with money he earns by hard work in a market at night while her is asleep to prevent her of becoming aware of the whole situation. But from then on the story gets complicated and unfolds itself in a series of funny episodes and varied gags to which we cannot demand logic or likelihood since we are in the presence of a comedy. The performance of both main protagonists is brilliant and the movie is quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among the street people of Paris, there is a saying, 'it costs nothing to hate, but if you wish to make love, it will cost you thirty franks.' The movie "Irma La Douce" meaning, 'Irma the sweet' stems from an original play by Alex Breflort and is adroitly directed by the great Billy Wilder. It tells the story of Nestor Patou (Jack Lemmon) a young idealistic French Policeman, who gets transferred to the 'Red Light' district of Paris France. Unaware of the established economic system between the police and the street prostitutes, he naively orders a raid and among the many surprised clients arrested, Nestor discovers his own boss. Fired from his job, he becomes a pimp for his girlfriend called Irma (Shirley MacLaine). Learning her work involves prostitution, he arranges to become her only client. This creates the Topsy-turvy world which includes the mysterious Lord X. Lou Jacobi is 'Moustache' who explains to the audience how silly a situation can become when plucking chickens. A superior film and one which has become a definite Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lighthearted comedy about the red light district</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IRMA LA DOUCE is a movie about the red light district in Paris, France. Shirley MacLaine plays Irma, one of the more in-demand women working the street. New to the neighborhood, Jack Lemmon's character (Nestor) falls for Irma and disapproves of the life she leads. He soon becomes her new business manager and hatches a scheme to make her give up life as a prostitute: he'll impersonate a man who'll pay Irma's weekly intake just for her company, thereby keeping her from her normal business. But Nestor's plan has unforeseen complications. (Where will he get the money? How can he be two people at the same time?)One interesting aspect is that Irma doesn't want Nestor to get a "real" job. She's proud of her profession and she wants to provide for him. It's kind of a different take on the prostitute story.Billy Wilder's film is a comedy based on a musical play. The songs have not been included in the movie, and I can't give any insight into how well the film measures up to the musical. The script is well-written and the film is entertaining. Lemmon and MacLaine put in quality performances. In a supporting role Lou Jacobi is memorable as Moustache, the bartender who's seemingly done it all. ("But that's another story.")I've seen that some people are offended by the "obscene" material in the film, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. The story centers around the sex industry, but that really exists, for better or worse. Sex is strongly implied, but never shown or mentioned outright. The prostitutes are content with their lives (hey, it's a business), but I see nothing wrong with that. It *is* a comedy, after all. It doesn't *have* to show the "dark side" of prostitution. Plus, the story is about getting Irma out of that racket.Wilder's film is more indifferent to prostitution, never quite taking a stance on the issue. It is what it is and the Parisians in the film don't seem to mind it. The story's not about issues, though. It's just meant to be fun. That's my two cents, though your opinion may be different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's a hard way to earn an easy living."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think there's any other way to say it: Billy Wilder just keeps getting better! Just four months ago, I'd seen a grand total of two films from the respected Hollywood filmmaker, and now, as my count clicks over to fourteen, I find him climbing yet another notch on my list of all-time favourite directors. What is the secret to Billy Wilder's success, and why, judging from the selection of films that I've seen, has his output remained so remarkably consistent over a thirty year period? Perhaps the answer lies in the level of artistic control that he was afforded, as he frequently took the role of director, writer and, after 1951, producer; it's a telling sign that Wilder's weakest film thus far, 'The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970),' was wrenched from his grasp and unsympathetically butchered by the studio. Another possible explanation for the director's success may lie in his repeated collaborations with crew members, particularly writers Charles Brackett and I.A.L. Diamond, and actors, most notably leading men Jack Lemmon and William Holden.In 1960, 'The Apartment (1960)' proved one of Wilder's most successful films to date, a scathing and witty satire of America's crumbling workplace morals. 'Irma la Douce (1963),' perhaps in an attempt to capitalise on this popularity, reunited stars Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in the more exotic backdrop of Paris, France. Of course, Wilder was never one to abide by traditional conventions, and so our setting is hardly the picturesque, blissful Paris of so many poets' imaginations. The City of Love is represented by the decrepit back-streets of the working-class district, where butchered animal carcasses line the food markets, and grimy prostitutes line the street-corners. One honest policeman, Nester Patou (Lemmon), attempts to arrest these feisty businesswomen for lewd conduct, but soon finds himself fired by his corrupt police chief. Alone and homeless, Nester falls for Irma (MacLaine), a pretty-faced prostitute with a heart of gold, and soon decides to act as her manager; the only setback is that he can't stand the thought of anybody else sleeping with his girl.Just as he exposed marital infidelity in 'The Apartment,' Wilder here boldly constructs amusing comedic situations around the prostitution industry. By portraying the women's hard work as a means of "making a living," rather than as a social problem, he approached the subject in a manner that had rarely been seen before, and his insertion of such stern themes into a romantic comedy, of all things, was certainly an audacious move by the director. The two leads are assuredly wonderful in their respective roles; Lemmon retains the "honest nice-guy" persona that Wilder often exploited so brilliantly, and MacLaine effectively abandons the sheer innocence that surrounded Fran Kubelik, allowing for a stronger and more self-assured character. Also worth mentioning is Lou Jacobi, who is frequently hilarious as Moustache, the bartender with a ridiculously rich personal history into which he doesn't like going into any detail. Time has left 'Irma La Douce' relatively forgotten among Billy Wilder's distinguished repertoire, but it really is one of his finest achievements. Why has this film been forgotten by today's audiences? The answer is, indeed, a complex and interesting one, but, well, that's another story?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Some films aren't cinematic and are actually plays. Character-driven comedy is particularly vulnerable to this, which is just fine. But Billy Wilder is an intelligent man. so builds in some self-reference to the film-as-play.The only real cinematic move here is when we (twice) slowly zoom in on Shirley's face when she starts to spin a fantasy. Since the effect is so rare in the film, it carries some power -- there is something special about you watching a story which tells another story. And of course, the main attraction is Lord X.Lord X is every comic actor's dream: an actor playing a character who acts as another character. This device establishes yet another layer. Comedy cannot exist without abstraction, and here we have several levels:--the clear self awareness that this is a play with the deliberate handling of the camera, small sets, and introductory narrative.--the setting in an ammoral France, which in 63 was something of a pretend land for most moviegoing Americans--the creation of Lord X within the action, as noted above.Just so that we make sure to get the joke, Lord X creates his imaginary life from films. Here are the ones from the current IMDB list: The Lives of a Bengal Lancer, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Gunga Din, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Hound of the Baskervilles, Sink the Bismarck, Guns of Navarone, Lawrence of Arabia, Mutiny on the Bounty.This is all annotated by mentor `Moustache,' who has also played many roles, but in the past.The bit at the end where X takes on an independent existence is exquisite film humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Wilder is better than no Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming on the heels of the multi-Oscar winning THE APARTMENT and the hyperactive cold war comedy ONE, TWO, THREE, IRMA LA DOUCE, with its story of a Parisian prostitute &amp; the gendarme bent on rehabilitating her, would appear to be the ideal project for director Billy Wilder. It's spicy, walks a fine line between good &amp; bad taste and stars Jack Lemmon &amp; Shirley MacLaine. It's not a great movie, but it is very good. It's chief virtue is the audacious performance of MacLaine. She's a hooker with anything but a heart of gold. As with THE APARTMENT, she's well matched with Lemmon, essentially playing two roles and playing them very well. Wilder and co-writer I.A.L. Diamond populate the film with quite a number of memorable sex jokes. The high gloss cinematography by Joseph LaShelle is great as is the very stylized art direction by Alexandre Trauner. The supporting cast features Lou Jacobi, Herschel Bernardi, Wilder regular Joan Shawlee and, somewhere in there, the great French actor Moustache.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than I expected but still very watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This odd morality play about an honest cop who is fired for doing his job, and who then gets involved with a streetwalker and gets a lesson in ethics from the other side of the law, was a surprise flop for the usually reliable Billy Wilder, but viewed now there is still quite a lot for his fans to enjoy. The subject matter is given a highly sanitized treatment, as one would expect for 1963, and some of the scenes seem studio-bound (although the early montage showing Paris at five in the morning is a real cinematic treat.) I liked the look of the movie, however, with its big MGM soundstage sets and some great tracking shots, especially along Rue Casanova, where the girls work their trade. Plus, the dialogue has some very sharp moments with wryly worded sexy jokes that nonetheless passed the production code, and there are a few bits of well-staged physical comedy, as one would expect with Jack Lemmon. Nonetheless, there is a contrived air to everything that makes it impossible to suspend disbelief and immerse oneself in the drama. Part of the problem lies with Shirley MacLaine, who, as the woman with the flipped over sense of morality, gives a likable but not entirely natural performance. There are some false moments in her portrayal. You get the feeling that she was less than 100% convinced of the character's world view and thus fails to completely convince the audience. A different actress, Jane Fonda maybe, or a few different choices by La MacLaine might have gone further to sell the picture's odd moral message. Not all of the false notes in the picture are her doing, of course. Everything is a little too Big Hollywood, plus the high farce second half of the movie is too far-fetched to create a truly compelling entertainment, and for every well-staged bit of physical comedy there is another bit that that comes of as forced.I would recommend this movie to fans of Billy Wilder, to fans of old school MGM movie-making and to Jack Lemmon fans, but anybody looking for a movie to really submerge oneself in will likely be disappointed.</fullReview>

Shirley plays the title role of a Parisian street walker with a poodle named Coquette who has kidney stones and drinks a little. Anyway, Lemmon's played Nestor, an honest policeman who raids the Hotel Casanova. While he thinks he will get a medal, his boss fires him for the raid. Anyway, the film is about prostitution in a light-hearted manner even in the 1960s. Irma invites Nestor to come and stay with her since he's jobless and homeless in her apartment. Anyway, Irma likes the color green and even wears green stockings. There is a lot of humor in this film if you watch all of it.

		<shortDescription>A Fool For Love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder had an effective way of insinuating pathos into a comedy. It's always a temptation, I suppose, for writers and directors to do something "serious." Comedies are supposed to be all froth and no substance, while drama is to be paid attention to and applauded. But it's hard to blend the two. Woody Allan did it once or twice, as in "Annie Hall." Shakespeare's "dark comedies" weren't as successful as either his comedies or his tragedies -- that's in my opinion anyway, and I happen to be the world's leading expert on Walter Shakespeare.In Wilder's case he made some straight dramas ("Double Indemnity") and some exceptional straight comedies ("Some Like It Hot"). After 1960 he began to produce comedies with touches of sadness and they more or less worked. "The Apartment" was an example of this trend and so is "Irma La Douce." Jack Lemon is the ex cop who inadvertently becomes the pimp of Shirley MacLaine, the eponymous Irma, in Paris. They fall in love of course. She insists on supporting him in the finest fashion but he grows jealous because, after all, every passerby is banging the woman he loves. MacLaine, possessed of greater savoir-faire, is puzzled by Lemon's discomfort.So Lemon borrows 500 francs from his friend Mustache, dresses up as an English nobleman, and in this disguise arranges to meet his girl twice a week and pay her enough money, just for playing solitaire, that she can dispense with all her other clients. Lemon, dumb as an ox, beams with pride as he pulls this stunt off, until Mustache reminds him that although money is now changing hands, none will be coming in. He borrows from Mustache, the phony Englishman gives it to MacLaine, she gives it to Lemon, and Lemon gives it back to Mustache. So in order to keep this system an open one, Lemon begins to sneak out of the flat and work all night in the market, an unsustainable effort. Then it gets complicated. Lemon is arrested for his own murder.It all comes together and works, in a stage-bound and slightly old-fashioned way, rather like Wilder's later "The Front Page." The performances are very good indeed. MacLaine is matter-of-fact about her profession, very pretty, and sexy too, pale and slender. Lou Jacobi is Mustache and does fine with the role of the grandiose friend who teaches Lemon how to be "British." But Lemon is superb as the nervous and exhausted lover. Andre Previn's score is lively or wistful, as the circumstances demand, though it may depend on Borodin.It's pretty funny and you'll probably enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in 60's Paris, 'Irma la Douce' captures the essence of the city quite accurately. Wilder gives it a poetic touch but at the same time it looks and feels authentic. The culture and rawness is well displayed (even though I can imagine that much of it is restricted due to censorship). The sets look very Parisian. The characters are very Parisian. The soundtrack brings out a romantic side to the wild streets of Paris.'Irma La Douce' may not be my favourite Wilder film as I find the story too absurd for my liking. However, what makes it work if Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine. They form a great on screen pair of opposites and share a warm chemistry. Maclaine takes over a role that was previously intended for Marilyn Monroe and she does full justice to it. Lemmon easily infuses charm, gullibility, sincerity, passion and determination in his character and is nothing short of brilliant.'Irma La Douce' may not have worked had it been cast with lesser actors because Maclaine and Lemmon are the driving forces behind it. As mentioned earlier, it's not the best Wilder movie but entertaining nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IRMA LA DOUCE (Billy Wilder, 1963) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of only four Wilder titles I hadn't caught up with yet ? I'm now left with MAUVAISE GRAINE (1934), THE EMPEROR WALTZ (1948) and FEDORA (1978; which I own on VHS). Like those films, this one's hardly top-flight material though certainly popular (in view of its reteaming the director with the stars of that which has come to be acknowledged as his masterpiece i.e. THE APARTMENT [1960]). The latter are, of course, Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine and, while neither achieved the quality of their previous performances for Wilder (Lemmon's included his cross-dressing turn in SOME LIKE IT HOT [1959]) in this case, they both still gave it their all. Despite MacLaine's titular figure being little more than the proverbial tart-with-a-heart (though Wilder being Wilder he also made her socially ambitious), she got the better deal with an Oscar nod to her name. Lemmon, however, had perhaps the tougher role ? going from naive and over-eager beat-cop to determined partner (and having to be reluctant pimp, restless meat-market worker, impostor and, worst of all, his own jealous lover in the interim); incidentally, it seems that some of the mannerisms inherent in the actor's caricatured impression of an English lord here would rub off on his almost cartoonish Professor Fate character from Blake Edwards' epic comedy THE GREAT RACE (1965). Having mentioned the two leads, one should not forget the valued contribution of Lou Jacobi as a sympathetic bartender who also prides himself on being a jack-of-all-trades. At almost 2? hours, this is Wilder's longest released effort (THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES [1970] was whittled down from 200 minutes to 125!) which it need not have been and, clearly, the film peaks during its first third. Interestingly, IRMA LA DOUCE was inspired by a musical but the score was eventually dropped for its screen treatment?so it was ironic that Andre' Previn's original accompaniment would garner the film its solitary Academy Award! The adult nature of the central theme (prostitution) was possible thanks to a certain slackening in censorship ? which allowed for a couple of semi-revealing shots of MacLaine, but also made the film's deliberately artificial look (of Paris) all the more curious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough but has a few issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irma la Douce was likely a very touchy and controversial film at the time. A former police officer, Nester, gets tangled with a whore. He ends up being in love with her (Lemmon and MacLaine were also duos in "The Apartment"). There are some laughs here and there and the film has some very interesting twists and turns at the end. The sets, backdrops, color coordinations, and the look &amp; feel of the film is first rate.However, as others have mentioned, the relationship really lacks chemistry and there is a lack of development leading to the marriage. It just happens abruptly and without much merit. Irma reacting happily to Lord X's murder just didn't seem right.Also the film just drags. A lot of scenes could have been edited out without hurting affecting the storyline. Irma la Douce doesn't really start to get going until the last 40 minutes. And there is also quite a bit of uneven and unnatural overacting which hurt the flow of the film. One question I have. If the film was supposed to take place in Paris, why does everyone sound so American?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Billy Wilder, but boy is Irma la Douce a mess...The biggest issues are the length and the confused tone. This film should have been an hour and forty-five minutes tops; two and a half hours with few laughs or charm to offer the audience is just torture. And then there is the issue of the tone. The film does not know what it is: a sexual farce? A romantic comedy? A romantic dramedy? I don't know, and I don't believe the movie knows either! The first hour is full of good things: MacLaine and Lemmon have chemistry and while none of the comedy is particularly hilarious, it is witty and fun for what it is. But the moment we get to the second hour, Lemmon's characterization changes in a most improbable manner and the "funny" parts all fall flat. And did I mention the unnecessarily long run time? The one saving grace of the picture is MacLaine's performance as the titular prostitute, whose lust for life equals her sense of world weariness and soulful poignancy.It's worth one viewing, but it's hard to recommend it to anyone outside of the Wilder, Lemmon, or MacLaine fan base.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This extremely long and drawn-out film has some wonderful sets and a few cute scenes but it's terribly bloated and tiring to sit through.Shirley MacClaine makes for a sexy, world-weary prostitute and Jack Lemmon does what he can with the zany part of Nestor, an ex-cop who falls for Irma and tries to save her from smoking and her profession. I admit I found refreshing her utter openness for how she earned a sou. For once, a woman discussing her sexuality without apology!I particularly enjoyed this movie's sets, meant to conjure the Parisian Le Marais district, but the antics of a surly band of "mecs" grew old fast and I tired of Moustache's (Lou Jacobi) maunderings.This film, which has a background score but no songs or dance, is based on a stage musical and really lacks that certain "je ne sais quoi." Ms. MacClaine was far superior as a call girl in the sublime "Sweet Charity." This film suffers greatly by comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irma la Douce (1963)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wilder reunites Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, perhaps an attempt to bring back the magic of THE APARTMENT. A failed attempt. The film is an unfunny, tedious drag. Most of Wilder's comedies run relatively long, but it's a lot more painful when the gags don't hit their mark. Compare this to SOME LIKE IT HOT: both center around an elaborate and rather unbelievable deception, but SLIH works because it's actually funny. Here, the lame slapstick and repetition of the same dumb jokes (if you didn't know the movie was going to end with "but that's another story" then you weren't paying attention the first dozen times it was said) wears thin and gives the viewer time to think about how flimsy the whole setup is. Lemmon's character is a clueless knucklehead, and MacLaine (although adorable as always) just looks bored. Interestingly, the film is adapted from a stage musical, but Wilder chose to cut all the songs. Perhaps they might have lent the project some much-needed charm, or perhaps they would have just made it feel even longer. And perhaps I'm taking it too seriously, but the quaint portrayal of prostitution is a bit objectionable (and besides, MacLaine would do the "hooker with a heart of gold" thing a lot better in SWEET CHARITY). Now don't get me wrong: there are some good moments. I'm already struggling to remember them, but there were definitely a few things that brought a smile to my face (some of the references are pretty clever). The overall experience, however, is a slog -- the worst I've seen from Wilder so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1960's version of "tawdry".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Irma la Douce" is a charming "comedy" that has few laughs, but a lot of charisma going for it. There aren't any real knee slappers in this thing, no pre-teen 21st century body function jokes, no super brilliant every-lines-a-quip modern era monologues and banter, nor does it even harken back to Howard Hawkes' era where dialogue was given machine gun deliver. So, what does this film have? Jack Lemon and Shirely McClaine, and a well rounded supporting troupe of highly talented thespians. The film is more about having a fun attitude than actually delivering any jokes (of which there are few to none). The film doesn't have any of the traditional "this is funny" cues for the audience. It's all about creating a fun world in which a romantic fantasy can be created.The straight laced policeman whose beat is usually playgrounds and pedestrian routes with domestic foibles. Enter the girl with loose morals who trades in on her body for social and financial security. Their worlds are diametrically opposed. They meet. Clash. And fall in love. Or, rather, the male finds the untamed female too desirable to let her go. So her pursues her. How does it end? You need to see the film to find out.It's a story about romance, jealousy, unpredictable circumstances, and, a little sex. Read that last phrase as VERY LITTLE, thank goodness. We're talking late 50s / early 60s, when sex was just making a comeback into the fringes of mainstream society. It was still taboo, but, if it was flavored right, then people who had their interest perked, could feel better or alright about accepting a g-rated sex-comedy because they wouldn't be embarrassed because everyone else was doing it, and no one else was being embarrassed by it either.So it is with "Irma La Douce". All the sex is implied. A welcome relief from today's very sex-charged media circus that dominates net and airwaves. Even though Imra and her peers are women of negotiable virtue, they have hearts, and are willing to give them to the man who meets their standards. Again, to find out what they are, you have to see the film.I used to see the thing on weekend afternoons, or occasionally on some local indy station's 8 O'Clock evening movie (remember those?), and have fond memories of a film that has no real social thorns in spite of the fact that it exhibits (or discusses in an off beat way) the Parisian sex industry, corruption of Le Gendarme (French cops), and what overcomes all social ills if the two hearts in question are willing enough.That's kind of what "Irma la Douce" is all about. Give it a try.It's a bit of a slow film with no real laughs, but it should raise a smile here and there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was enchanted by the stage musical comedy on which the film is based. I saw the stage production with fabulous long-legged dancer Juliette Prouse in the role of Irma. As I recall, it was done as a fantasy, with sets that were deliberately non-realistic, sort of cartoonish. In other words, nothing was meant to be taken too seriously, which was just the right tone for the story. Miss Prouse and the production were marvelous.When I saw the film version, I was very disappointed. Not only was it n longer a musical, it had lost all the lightheartedness of the original. Shirley MacLaine once was also a great dancer, making her mark in the stage production of Pajama Game in which she performed the dance for "Steam Heat" (choreographed by Bob Fosse) as the stand-in for Carol Haney who was injured. But there is no dance in the film version.If I hadn't seen the stage production first, perhaps I might have enjoyed the film version better.</fullReview>

I also like Jack Lemmon very very much and have never been disappointed by him (I especially love the apartment, the odd couple and the great race). The titular character of this film was even played by the leading lady from The Apartment! Every fact I gathered on this film made me think I was going to love it. Unfortunately I was wrong. This film.... just wasn't really funny. The only thing I really liked about it was Jack Lemmon's charm and occasionally, the writing. Neither of these aspects were great but I don't know- something was missing. It's characters really weren't interesting. The plot was contrived and the predicaments that the main character got into were just stupid and easily fixable. Also at the very end there's a kind of a half-twist half-joke thing that when you think about it really means that the whole film doesn't really make sense any more. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shirley MacLaine is Irma "The Sweet". She's a prostitute who wears green stockings, totes a frequently drunk little dog and sees her work as any profession. She has the best spot in the street. She's more of a pixie than a sex-bomb. And Jack Lemmon is head-over-heels in love with her. But can her keep Irma off the streets and provide for them both? Well, that's where "Lord X" comes in! Wilder's romantic comedy is a delicious ride. Having read a number of bad reviews for it, I went in with mixed feelings. The Apartment is one of my all-time favourite films, and I wasn't expecting another slice of perfection. In fact, I thought the film was going to be utterly terrible. To my delight, it was a wonderful experience. I may be in the minority on this one, but I thought it was great.

		<shortDescription>In The Market For Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irma La Douce began life as a French musical - a species fairly thin on the ground compared to Broadway and Shaftesbury Avenue - with a great score by Marguerite Monet, who composed several 'signature' songs for Edith Piaf. In the fullness of time it transferred to London and Broadway and then Billy Wilder got hold of it and adapted it as a comedy dropping all the songs. You can do this if you're a genius and Wilder was one of the best in the business. Sometimes when you're a genius you gravitate to the similarly gifted and that happened here when Wilder signed Jack Lemon to play the lead. Actually it required little genius to make that move since the duo had already hit one out of the park with The Apartment a couple of years earlier. Even Shirley MacLaine can't louse this one up though God knows she tries hard enough with that 'Gee, look at me, aren't I the most lovable kook that ever came down the pike' schtick on overdrive. Lou Jacobi is the perfect narrator who has a hammerlock on droll that just can't be broken. There's probably an academic somewhere even as I write who's writing a dissertation on how the apple that Nestor (Lemon) insists on paying for in his establishing scene is redolent of the Eve he will soon meet and who will subsequently lead him into temptation. Don't you just love these pseuds with nothing better to do than sacrifice pleasure on the altar of scholarship. Ah well, the rest of us can just sit back and pig out on a great comic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parisian prostitute Shirley MacLaine (as Irma La Douce) does a brisk business. She acts demure, wears sexy green outfits and carries a little pooch named "Coquette". After her clients pay, Ms. MacLaine specializes in sob stories that elicit a tip. Handy hotels, a friendly barroom and "on the take" police make it a happy situation for the streetwalkers and their partners. Suddenly, the successful sex trade is dealt an arresting blow. Honest policeman Jack Lemmon (as Nestor "Tiger" Patou) is put on patrol. Initially unaware of the sex action, Mr. Lemmon informs MacLaine her dress in unbuttoned. When he sees all the women in provocatively slit dresses and low-cut tops, Lemmon realizes they are hookers...Attracted to MacLaine, Lemmon gets into a fight with her pimp, brawny Bruce Yarnell (as Hippolyte), and gets lucky. Lemmon surprisingly inheriting Mr. Yarnell's position. Since he really loves MacLaine, Lemmon invents the British secret identity "Lord X" and proceeds to buy up all MacLaine's bedtime. The madcap situation leads to fun and tragedy...From director-writer-producer Billy Wilder, this story is derived from a French musical, with the songs dropped. It's obviously not as good as Mr. Wilder's other works, being too slow and lacking in laughs. Lemmon undressing for MacLaine and later donning her ex's jacket and brown derby are comic highlights. The original idea to cast Marilyn Monroe might have produced something more interesting, had the recently deceased actress overcome her addictions (the songs would have been included for Ms. Monroe, of course). MacLaine is sexy, smart and chain-smokes. The photography by Joseph La Shelle and art direction by Alexander Trauner are strengths. Casual sex is celebrated and paid for, but never shown.***** Irma la Douce (6/5/63) Billy Wilder ~ Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Bruce Yarnell, Lou Jacobi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy classic: lightweight, a bit silly, but delightful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irma la Douce was one of the biggest commercial successes in Wilder's long career, being one of the top-grossing films of 1963. Now, for some reason, it's nearly forgotten, at least in the USA, and that's a shame, 'cause "Irma" is a delightful film. Yes, it's overlong (nearly 150 mins). It's true, it lacks some of the best features of Wilder's masterpieces - the sharp social criticism of The Apartment, the genius laugh-out-loud script of Some like it hot, the dark atmosphere of Wilder's noirs. Still, it's a classic. The plot itself it's absolutely far-fetched and yes, kind of silly, but the script is on the usual Wilder/ Diamond standard, which means great. It deals with matters which at the time were pretty risqu? in a light, innocent way. The cast is spot perfect. Lemmon plays a role which fits him perfectly, the sweet, clueless a bit neurotic "flic" Nestor Patou. Shirley MacLaine is at her best. She looks better than ever and she's wonderfully ironic -and more, her chemistry with Lemmon is amazing. It's funny to think she was just Wilder's third choice, the first two being Marilyn and Liz Taylor. Another one who wasn't the director's first choice is Lou Jacobi as Moustache. His role was meant for Charles Laughton, who sadly at the time was dying from cancer, so Jacobi got the role - and did great! his performance is highly enjoyable and he utters some of the funniest lines in the film. Other high points are the incredible set - a 48-buildings bit of Paris built in the Goldwyn Studios - and the score by Andr? Previn, which won Oscar. I have just one regret: that Wilder didn't attempt to film Irma as it was originally conceived, which means as a musical. It would be extremely interesting to see how the great director would have coped with a genre which was so unusual for him. Wilder, Lemmon and MacLaine were a wonderful team and Irma is a classic. Sure, it has its shortcomings and it's not a milestone in film-making like "the Apartment"... but that, as Moustache himself would have said, is another story. Don't miss Irma, you will love it. 8/10 in my book.</fullReview>

Seeing this movie for the first time really is a charm.Previous comments tell a lot about the movie itself. I'll comment about the acting, which really makes the movie.Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine really have that film magic together. Lemmon shows traits of insecure hilarity that he would later show more strongly "The Odd Couple." But he gets to add to it when he portrays the alter-ego Lord X. As Lord X, Lemmon tries -- hilariously -- to become more English than David Niven, Alec Guinness and the queen herself.MacLaine is the anchor of the show. As Irma, she is both sexy and hilarious at the same time. She offers lines that makes you think, "They let them say that in a 1964 movie?"But the show-stealer is Lou Jacobi as Moustache, the bartender who isn't just all knowing, but seems to have done everything in his life. Sort of a previous-day Wilson from the TV show "Home Improvement" except much funnier. How he wasn't up for an Academy Award for best supporting actor, I have no idea.The rest of the acting is also fantastic, and all that put together leads to a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder is an absolute genius. It is through his satirical humor that the world must learn redemption through the sordid alleys of prostitution and pimps. True love is displayed by prostitutes like Irma La Douce who demand that their men are the best dressed and live from the revenue of her profession. Patou, the most honorable of all policemen in the city of Paris, is dishonorably discharged from the force, and must join the dishonorable world not only to survive, but to gain respect. Rationalization and freedom must derive from the lie that Patou murdered Lord X. This movie is best described from a quote from Mustache to Patou upon their first meeting.

		<fullReview>I really tried to like Billy Wilder's "Irma la Douce", I really did, but I was disappointed. Once again Shirley Maclaine and Jack Lemmon are teamed up romantically - she playing the title character, a Parisian prostitute, and he a policeman. In this particular section of Paris, the prostitutes, pimps, and policemen are all in league with each other - the girls work the streets, the pimps get the money from the girls, and the policemen get paid by the pimps. Everyone looks the other way - until Lemmon comes along.Unfortunately after Lemmon raids the Parisian neighborhood, he loses his job. He falls in love with Irma and becomes her protector, or "pimp". Once again we see Lemmon playing a "nice guy" who puts up a front of dishonesty so he can protect the woman he loves. He has to resort to working in the meat market during the day while Irma sleeps and pretending to be a wealthy Englishman, Lord X, in order for other men not to have sex with her. Sounds muddled? You bet it is!However, the story did have its moments. Jack was funny as always playing the policeman-turned-pimp Nestor Patou and the dual role as Lord X. He did some fantastic physical comedy, such as the scene where he beats up Irma's pimp in the bistro. Maclaine was sweet, cute, and sexy as Irma. Notice how she predominantly wears green in the movie ("green with envy").There were a couple of sexy scenes, like the one where Patou first goes to Irma's apartment and she's watching him undress while she smokes a cigarette in bed, or when Irma's telling Lord X a fantasy about a harem in Baghdad. Other than that, it was an okay movie, average. I was surprised to see an unwed pregnant character in a movie that was made in 1963, when it was still unheard of. I'm sure this movie must have been quite racy and provocative in its day. This movie was a bit overlong as well.Want to see a far better Maclaine/Lemmon/Wilder comedy? Watch the classic movie "The Apartment". "Irma" is only worth watching only if you are fan of Lemmon, Maclaine, Billy Wilder movies, or old movies in general. I rate it 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naive and cynical 40 years later...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both Lemmon and MacLaine are quite good in this rather cute Billy Wilder comedy. But I still had problems enjoying it, because of the way prostitution and especially pimping (making a living out of another person's misery) is portrayed as something glamorous and okay. A poor and cynical basis of a comedy, I think.Well, the 60's were probably more cruel and naive than the 00's, so it might very well be that I'm being unfair to this 40-year-old by being overly Politically Correct, but still... This film has not aged well in every aspect. But if that's okay with you, I'm sure you will enjoy "Irma la Douce".My vote: 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Billy Wilder could get it wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So let's try and put things right,shall we? Billy Wilder had intended to film "Irma La Douce" as a musical.He even went so far as to have MacLaine and Lemmon record vocal tracks(which still,presumably,lie is some Hollywood vault?) However,when it came to actually start the filming Wilder found that (strangely) the songs slowed down the action.So what did he do?Tighten up the script,drop an odd song or two? NO! He ditched ALL the songs,thereby negating the movie as a musical. He just used the music(tinkered with by Andre Previn) as a background track. To add insult to injury Previn got the Oscar for best score,when the greatest majority of the music was by Marguerite Monnot,who wrote ALL the original music of the stage musical. It may be a great comedy as it is,but it is a travesty of the musical, and it's a great shame that we will never now see a movie with the songs included. Billy Wilder,hang your head in shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irma la Dud!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder made brilliant films like Sunset Boulevard(1950) and Double Indemnity(44)and memorable films like Ace in the Hole(51)and Stalag 17(53) as well as the classic comedy Some Like It Hot(59)but, the films he made in the 60s: Kiss Me, Stupid(64), One, Two, Three(61), The Fortune Cookie(66)and The Apartment(60) don't compare with his best, and Irma la Douce(63) is one of his worst. A single idea spread out over a charm free 147 minutes minus the songs from the Broadway musical it's based on. It's a pace-less, pointless, plot less, plodding...but why go on and on like the movie. It was an enormous BO hit in its day and MacLaine received an Oscar nomination, but for the life of me I can't imagine why, and Lemon is one-note in a role Peter Sellars would have been all to perfect for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Cute' Back In '63, But Not Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people, I thought this was kinda "cute" when I saw it in the theater in 1963. It certainly starts out that way. But on further review some 40 years later, the movie only looked like more sophomoric Liberal baloney and the "cuteness" was gone except for the first 20 minutes.This was just one of the seeds that was planted in 1960s films with a subliminal message that being a strict moral person was "petty bourgeois," as it is described in this movie. In other words, "old-fashioned" and "not with it," etc. Better to have the motto, "If it feels good, do it," is one of the messages here. Well, it was the '60s, the decade of "do your own thing."Shirley MacLaine, as "Irma La Douce," smokes non-stop but plays one of the film world's favorite people: a nice hooker that we can all root for. Only in Hollywood are the hookers so attractive. She's okay but Jack Lemmon is the undisputed star of the film and is funny. Lou Jacobi also does well as 'Moustache.'However, this film goes on way too long. It's almost two and a half hours. They could have chopped a good half-hour out of this. In the end, this is yet another movie I thought was daring and cool in the early '60s but just stupid now.</fullReview>
