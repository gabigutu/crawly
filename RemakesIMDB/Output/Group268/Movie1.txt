		<shortDescription>Worked for Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has met with some very negative reviews but in my view, 'Mixed Nuts' is an entertaining comedy following the "adventures" of a team of "lifesavers" who work at a suicide hotline. This film follows their adventures on Christmas Eve with characters like a homicidal pregnant woman, a transvestite, a murderer and a Santa Clause with a gun. It's much darker than you would expect from a Steve Martin film, especially since it's directed by the same woman who directed 'Sleepless in Seattle' and 'You've Got Mail'. The cast has some familiar faces including Adam Sandler and a very young Haley Joel Osment pre-The Sixth Sense. I bought this film at a very cheap price at a clothes store (don't ask me why) that had a few films that featured major stars in unkown and probably bad films. I was in the mood for a comedy and this was the only one on the shelf and it seemed black, strange and comic and I'm a big fan of Steve Martin so I rushed to buy it and didn't get watching it for two days. When I finally took the opportunity to stick it in the player, I found a black yet sweet comedy with some of the biggest laughs that have came from my mouth all year. Of course, this film seems to have a lot of negative reviews but everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I can see why many people might not like this movie. So, if you're interested in seeing it: Rent it then, if you like it, go out and buy it because you'll be watching it a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm so upset no one else loves this movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I might cry. I feel so hopelessly misunderstood. This movie is brilliant.... I feel as though the epitome of my sense of humor has been rated "two stars"... this is depressing...It's just... brilliant. It's completely nonsensicle and pointless and brilliant, much like a dream I might have when on too much cold medicine. Much like the dreams that I find most delightful...It's one of those movies I find myself quoting all the time just to hear the lines again. Everyone thinks I'm nuts when I quote it because of course no one has ever heard of it. I've taken to making the little "plop" noise that Steve Martin does when he gets too flustered... when I get too flustered. Madeline Kahn is my hero. I relate too well to Mrs. Munchnik, sanity surrounded by chaos only to find that deep down, she too is a nut. If I were stuck on an elevator, I would have acted just as she had, making up little raps... It's the simple stuff... simple stupid stuff. That's what makes this film so brilliantly refreshing. It's so dumb! Take Adam Sandler, for instance. There was no reason for this character whatsoever. It was entirely random and uncalled for. It was almost as if he happened to be walking by and they called him over and said "Hey, Adam! Wanna be in a movie?"... the only thing he did was show off his mad ukulele skills. And he made me laugh... he was there for the sole purpose of being funny, no strings attached. It was so refreshing. As was this whole movie. Like a good dream! To me it is proof that when you have fun making it (which it appears impossible that they did not), you have fun watching it. At least I do... I'm gonna watch it tonight and appreciate it's wonderfulness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a film for everyone. One must appreciate black humor. If you do, this is a delight. I found it hilarious. True, it's blasphemous and screwy and not at all politically correct. That's a good start. What follows is, at times, breathtaking. Three cheers for Madeline Kahn. And for the courageous director and writer; a woman after my own heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly silly comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe how many people don't like this film! This is a must-see (many times!) each year before Christmas for my son and me. The beginning is a little slow but once the comedy really gets going it's hysterical! And in my opinion, the acting was priceless and each actor's comic timing brilliant. It would be very difficult for me to pick a favorite performance in this film, but if I had to, I would say Madeline Kahn as Mrs. Munchnick. Her facial expressions are adorable and I would say that her best scene was when she finally made it to the bathroom (won't give too much away!). Rita Wilson also gave a top-notch performance as the pathetically adorably Kathryn. Oh, and the soundtrack is great, too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those "slice of life" stories, "Mixed Nuts" portrays several hours on Christmas Eve in a crisis hot-line center where Phil (Steve Martin) works. Over the day, a most unusual series of events happens, and no one's life will ever be the same again. Some of the scenes are real shockers (you'll know them when you see them).Steve Martin has a great time with the role, as does Rita Wilson as Catherine O'Shaughnessy, Phil's co-worker. You'll really like the elevator scene. Great support from Madeline Kahn, Robert Klein, Juliette Lewis, Anthony LaPaglia, Rob Reiner, Adam Sandler, and Liev Schreiber make this movie truly one Christmas treat. Jon Stewart and Parker Posey also appear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it, Take a Deep Breath and Watch it Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie during its original theatrical release. I didn't care for it at the time. Years later I rented it and suddenly I understood. This movie is a FARCE. By definition it is supposed to be over the top and at times illogical. Anyone who has acted in a community theater production of a broad comedy will understand. The setting is limited. The characters are odd. There is a repetitive joke with a prop. The hero is flawed, but rises to overcome his weakness. As for this particular cast--watch the physical as well as the verbal humor. Steve Martin is an A list actor for "I don't know where I went wrong with my life" characters. Adam Sandler wasn't a big audience draw yet, but showed he could be an ensemble player. Madeline Kahn's response to the profane called is hilarious. I am not a Juliette Lewis fan, but what she does in this movie she does well. The dialogue is snappy and true. The action is fast. And the resolution is acceptable. Afterall, it's about Christmas. "This is the Miracle."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a classic in my book. I watch it at least once every Christmas, along with a few times during the rest of the year. My best friend and I always watch it together and laugh and laugh. My favorite character in the film is "Arnold, Arnold, Arnold!" I just love "her." The "dog hater" and the re gifted fruit cake add to the joy of the movie. And I must add that I absolutely love the song that Adam Sandler wrote in the movie - "I love grape jelly." Cracks me up. Juliette Lewis does a great job in this film. Her statement, "I should have married a business man," while eating the Peanut Butter out of the jar with her fingers is just too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title sums it up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy sports a delightful cast with...well, mixed nuts! Actually the title comes from the fact that the Steve Martin character's father was hit and killed by a truck loaded with mixed nuts, but we all really know what it's really about. Martin, Madeline Kahn (we miss you!), and Rob Reiner are very funny here, and some of the younger folks are very funny. I really thought Adam Sandler more or less made this thing...Basically a story of a crisis-phone answering service manned by folks with neuroses and other generalized problems. Interwoven are stories of other problem folks. It all seems to work out in a mad-cap way, and although this isn't the funniest movie, it is still very enjoyable, and worth the rent. Lonely people at Christmas...and the ones they intend to help...all mixed in like cashews, peanuts, filberts...you get it! Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top screwball comedy just doesn't quite make it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tries really really hard to be crazy, wacky, screwball-y, but just doesn't quite make it. It has some funny scenes, but does not hold together well. The scenes with Liev Schreiber as the drag queen are quite funny. Madeline Kahn does as much with her character as possible and succeeds just because she is so good. Adam Sandler is pretty weak just doing his old Saturday Night Live shtick, over and over. Steve Martin and Anthony LaPaglia are just wasted. Still it is not an entire waste of time. It wasn't one of those movies that you watch and immediately experience buyer remorse: another 2 hours of my life wasted! Also the film betrays a stage play adapted to screen. It is pretty much limited to the crisis center, with a few street scenes thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Afterthoughts on 'Mixed Nuts'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a few times when it first came out on video. I enjoyed that it was not all 'cheery and light' as much of the films (not all - thank goodness) with the name 'Ephron' attached to them.People have commented on what a horrible movie this was. OK, fine this was not the standard cookie cutter romantic comedy and was rather flip about sensitive topics. It was even beyond borderline over the top. Thus, why I enjoyed it.So why comment now? I was reminded of this movie as a watched the remake of the Manchurian Candidate. I knew as the drag queen titter, clad in his lovely black shawl, that he had that something to make it. Liev Schreiber has done just that with grace and an interesting body of work. It is always exciting to see that happen. I had that same feeling when I saw a performance in the Australian film called "Romper Stomper." Although Russell Crowe's fists have got almost as many headlines as his brilliant performances have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Nuts: Great Christmas Fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a comedy and as a comedy it has THE problem from which all comedies suffer: namely they don't appeal to everyone. Humour is a very personal matter. That said I have to come clean and say that in my opinion this is a funny film that grows on you with repeated viewings. I first saw it shortly after it came out about ten years ago, and thought it sweet, and a little black in parts, but little more. However just recently I purchased this film and watched it again, then again. It's great!!! All the characters are totally loony including those manning the suicide help line (Madeline Kahn, Steve Martin and Rita Wilson). But the whole cast is wonderful from Adam Sandler and his useless songs and lousy ukulele playing to Juliette Lewis "safely" emptying a gun by firing it!!!to Rob Reiner the Vet complaining that all women are obsessed with frilly pillows, to Steve Martin insisting that there is hope in every pothole, to Madeline Kahn as the uptight Blanche Munchnik rattling on about her dead husband's sister who she must visit for Christmas, to Liev Schreiber the transvestite with the Louise Brooks hairstyle, to last and by no means least Anthony LaPaglia playing the slapstick role of a suicidal Santa Claus who wants a wall to paint a mural on, gets hit over the head with a fruit cake, falls down steps, crashes into Christmas trees, overdoses on animal tranquillisers, seems to spend most of the film in hot pursuit of the heavily pregnant Gracie (Juliette Lewis)and gets mistaken for a cat. (His name is Felix after all!!!) Now, after all that, if you don't want to catch this film then that's your funeral (or should that read fun-for-all!!!???!) This film is worth watching. It's great Christmas fare that leaves you feeling all happy and smiley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was forced to watch this movie over Christmas break and it was so boring and not funny that I fell asleep half way through (which turned out to be a great move). People keep saying things like "Black Comedy" or "Subtle humor," but it has neither. If you want a black comedy than rent a good movie like Raising Arizona or The Big Lebowski. Simply because it's about a suicide hot line at Christmas doesn't make it black, just stupid and drawn out. The jokes are lame and the plot is as exciting as a PBS documentary on the evolution of sand. A movie made for a paycheck in my opinion. If you want a funny Christmas movie that's actually funny than rent Christmas Vacation or A Christmas Story, avoid this one at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Mixed Nuts", or the impossible remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unbearable to watch when you know the French original version, "Le p?re Noël est une ordure", a cult movie ten times better (if you can get a copy with very good subtitles, please check it out). Another example of a fine European film turned into crap by unwise American producers. It is a shame to see so many talents wasted. So where really lies the problem? To adapt for English-speaking audiences a movie which is anything but easy to adapt, or to soften all the (very) dark humor contained in the original work? Very hard to tell, and not something worth thinking about anyway. The result is there, and it is quite awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a most entertaining film! How can you not enjoy Madeline Kahn, Steve Martin, Adam Sandler, and the transvestite! He was fantastic. Everyone played their part so well. It's a feel-good movie and I just plain enjoyed it. The ending was a little corny -- but it fit the concept of a feel-good movie. Anyone who watches this is in for a treat. It's a perfect Christmas movie the whole family can watch, which is why we bring it out every Christmas and pop it in the VCR. There did not seem to be too much darkness to it. Well -- a little, but it was all so funny it makes one take life a little less seriously. I give it two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Nuts is an Hilarious show you will want to watch again and again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mixed Nuts is an the hilarious 1994 movie starring Steve Martin which will keep you laughing all the way. The movie is about A man who works at a self help clinic who has troubles with just about everything from money to women. The movie is pretty funny and stars an awesome cameo from Adam Sandler who comes in for about 10 minutes. This movie is definitely a must watch as it is Steve Martin at his certain best. Overall this movie is very enjoyable and just goes to show a movie does not have to be that clever to be a classic one. Overall this movie is funny and fans of Steve Martin will go wild at his performance in this hilarious film. I rate this movie a fair 63%. That is my 2 cents from LacTheBod.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I don't even like nuts, especially mixed ones, but I did love this movie. It reminded me of a really good play, kind of like how Noises Off was. Every actor was in their element and played their parts well. Madeline Kahn (sorry if the spelling is incorrect) was hilarious as Mrs. Munchnik, waiting for her dead husband's sister to call for Christmas holidays. The elevator scene with her character and the toy drum machine has had me laughing since '94. I also still have Adam Sandler's song , "Oh so many things to wonder..." in my head. I liked all the characters, well except maybe Felix. This film is underrated as it doesn't really fit into the norm, def not a Christmas themed movie and not quite a formula comedy. "Click it, go ahead...just click it." I recommend giving it a watch at any time of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This quirky movie has become a family favorite of ours since it was released. Obviously not Oscar material, but definitely not to be panned as badly as some have done. Norah Ephrom has created a very clever and funny script from the original French play. Dark humor, sure, but time has toned it down in relation to the Bad Santa, Scrooged, etc. that have entered the Christmas move genre. I was always amazed that this movie was NEVER in the Christmas Holiday bins at Best Buy until this past year. Perhaps now it will enter the sub-culture consciousness, almost like a Christmas Story (but without the 24-hour marathon). If you haven't seen this movie, give it a chance. Adam Sandler's "Chris" song should at least bring a smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I saw this movie several years ago and remembered it well, but I didn't remember enjoying it so well as I did tonight watching it with friends while fringing a muffler for a Christmas gift. All the actors were outstanding and the plot free-floating and quirky, but my favorite character was the transvestite as played by Liev Schreiber. He was fantastically graceful and engaging! It was like watching old home movies with so many talented actors playing with each other -- almost like a whole film of improv. For people who did not find it funny at all, I would be curious what they do find funny. It must be the years of working in cancer research that has made my sense of humor somewhat dark and quirky yet essentially optimistic. I intend to buy my own copy of this movie to watch regularly along with Groundhog Day, one of my other favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing Madelaine Kahn in a scene where she talks through the door to someone she imagines in a serial killer made me laugh my head off and cry at the same time. How could someone that funny die so young? Watching Steve Martin dance with a transvestite, so reluctantly at first then really getting into it, is one of those classic scenes like Jack Lemmon and Joe E. Brown's tango in Some Like It Hot. It reminded be of the extreme awkwardness of my dance classes in grade 7 physical education.Other scenes had too many people running and shouting. Some people seem to find that funny. I don't. Perhaps it reminds me too much of childhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For several years, since accidentally discovering this movie, my family has made it a tradition to watch it at least once every holiday season. It's bizarre and hilarious. The end may be a bit contrived, but it is a comedy and it makes no apologies for being too crazy. Nothing else in the movie is conventional. Even Steve Martin, the most normal of the bunch, has his own quirks and odd moments throughout the film.Overall, a great comedy that will amuse you with its unusual approach to the holiday season!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful Romp (ha)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to Christmas movies, there are the old classics (It's A Wonderful Life), The new traditions (Home Alone), and then, somewhere outside of that suckhole there's an irreverent little comedy called Mixed Nuts. This film is brilliantly plotted and plays out like an episode of Seinfeld with an even quirkier ensemble (a very young Leiv Schrieber dressed in drag? Madeline Kahn as an insensitive suicide counselor? BRING IT ON!). This movie has been a Christmas tradition for me since my father first rented it for me at a gas station in the mid-nineties. It's an excellent mix of wit, slapstick, and social commentary that never gets old (I still chuckle at the "Now sAving" counter on the office wall).This movie does require the viewer to pay attention: it's not mind-numbingly stupid or easy to follow. It lulls in places, but overall it makes for a great movie-watching experience. Give it a chance. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater with 7 members of my extended family and we all walked out. I can't describe how dreadful this movie was. Can you think of a less appealing concept than a bunch of people manning a suicide helpline on Christmas and a scene set up so that the labor of one of the main character's looks like an immaculate conception? Not to mention the fact that Steve Martin has to be playing one of the most annoying characters in cinema history. Honestly, this movie still haunts me 12 years after seeing it. How anyone can say otherwise is a mystery. See it if you want to, but know how bad it is going in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! It's about as muddled and messed up as life gets.Most of us can identify with at least some aspect of this film, sit back and just enjoy the chaos.This is my second favorite Christmas-time movie, the first being the Vacation Christmas with Chevy Chase; another messy movie dealing with the holidays.Steve Martin is rather serious in this one, though he is still classic Steve, Madeline Kahn is excellent as the curmudgeonly Mrs. Munchnick, Rita Wilson is totally believable as Martin's love interest, and Liev Schreiber is hilarious as the cross-dressing "Arnie." But it's Juliette Lewis as Gracie, who steals the show. She is an absolute schizophrenic joy. Most everyone has at least one of her in their family, and the kids always hope they show up for the celebration.This is definitely the movie for those of you who are not wholly filled with the Spirit of Christmas as it's a rather dark comedy with a lovely, darkling, idiosyncratic wit.This movie rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

The cast and there performances are not the problem - this movie is just not funny or even interesting.

		<shortDescription>a dark comedy, worth it for the cameos alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand the negative reviews by those who compare it to the original film (which I haven't seen), but some of the other reviews are just ridiculous.This is a truly charming film with some singularly quirky and entertaining performances, as well as more cameos than you can shake a stick at. And yeah, it's a dark film set during the holidays - a time when suicides go up, so what's more appropriate than a comedy featuring a suicide hotline? Yeah, the movie is a bit slow and even a bit of a downer at times, but that's non profit work for you. It does eventually arrives at a happy ending, but it earns it.This is EASILY Adam Sandler's best film - he's funny, goofy and charming - and Madeline Kahn is hilarious in this as well.I love grape jelly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't nix Mixed Nuts! Although it occasionally misfires, it is fun, fun,fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philip (Steve Martin) runs a grant-driven crisis call center for people with mental problems. Called Lifesavers, it also employs a caring, single woman named Catherine (Rita Wilson) and an overbearing widow (Madeline Kahn). It's near Christmas and Philip learns, in short order, that his girlfriend is dumping him and that the scummy landlord (Gary Shandling) plans to evict them very soon. Philip is on edge, to say the least. Crossing paths with these folks are a pregnant young shop owner (Juliette Lewis), her broke, wall artist boyfriend (Anthony LaPaglia), a cross-dresser (Liev Schrieber), a t-shirt writer (Adam Sandler), a rollerblading power couple (Parker Posey and Jon Stewart), a dog-loving older man (Robert Klein), and a mysterious serial killer known as the Seaside Strangler. With so many problems, is it likely that anyone of them will have a happy holiday? This movie has been dismissed by so many critics but don't you believe them! It is sharp, witty fun, even though it occasionally misfires. The cast is a dream, with Martin doing a great job, although he never strays from being just one of the overall talented ensemble. Kahn, in a word, is to die for, in one of her last roles. She steals every one of her scenes and has the audience in stitches each time she opens her mouth. The rest of the players are also very fine, with the possible exception of Lewis, who does go a bit over the top. The script is lively and memorable, with a bevy of quotable lines. Then, too, the Venice setting is lovely while the costumes and production values are excellent. If you want to watch something different this holiday, but still want to get into the proper spirit, this film would make an excellent choice. It is irreverent, yes, but even so, it would provide a great number of giggles between glasses of eggnog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Christmas Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a remake of a 1982 French film, "Le Pere Noel est une ordure." I am unfamiliar with the original, so I cannot compare the two. On its own, "Mixed Nuts" probably averages three or four laughs per minute. How could it not? The dialog is snappy, and some of the funniest people in America at the time appear in this film such as Steve Martin, Madeline Kahn (who can sometimes make me laugh without saying a word), Adam Sandler, Parker Posey and Liev Schreiber before they had any noteworthy films. There are cameos by funnymen Steven Wright, Jon Stewart, Garry Shandling. Even a barely post-toddler Haley Joel Osment makes an appearance.The movie has its flaws, but even those are amusing. For instance, every time there is shouting among the characters (which happens frequently) the music score actually competes for attention with some peppy arrangement of a Christmas carol. While this is unnecessary and potentially annoying, it adds one more element for laughter. The setting is original, a soon-to-be-closed apartment used for a suicide hot-line headquarters. The conflict is predictable and maybe a bit shallow (money miracle needed to avoid shutting down), and the payoff is the most unbelievable use of et deux machina that is conceivable. In spite of this, the movie's strengths (dialog and comedy performances) far outweigh these flaws. Take off your serious film face and enjoy this entertaining flick, one which definitely needs a better DVD release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 people running a life savers organization get mixed up with a dodgy set of characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title matches the characters in the film - they truly are a bunch of nuts mixed together to provide a couple hours worth of entertainment. Steve Martin plays the head of a financially-unstable life savers organization and employs two others, one of whom is a snobbish middle-aged lady, and the other a damsel of a nervous disposition, taken a shine to by a neighbor - a young man, Louie, who loves his banjo and tries ever so hard to sing songs which he seems to have made up on the spot. They spend their time answering calls from depressed individuals about to run over the edge. One particular caller is quite distraught and so he/she/it manages to arrange to come down and talk to them personally. They are based in a flat but due to failure in paying the rent, Steve is given notice of eviction but doesn't tell the others - they eventually find out for themselves. The film also concentrates on a cliche' couple who run a fancy-dress shop - the pregnant lady with an attitude and her lazy, drunken boyfriend. Also running from the outset is news of a serial killer on the loose. The story line is fairly original, although the film may seem tedious at one point or two. However, the range of characters and the situations they get themselves into makes up for this. One to watch.... if the video shop has run out of the smash hit you went in for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mixed Nuts" is the wackiest Christmas movie of all time. The superb cast take viewer through a silly, absurd romp through a definitely nutty Christmas. If you can't identify with any of the characters, you certainly know somebody who can. A holiday must-see.The plot twists are ingenious. I'd be surprised if anyone can predict the ending. The cast is superb. Their ensemble work is some of the best comedy you'll see anywhere. Every character has his moment to be the straight man and his moment to be the clown.If you don't laugh hysterically at Madeline Kahn, then nothing could make you laugh.To top it all off, there is a beautiful allusion to the birth of Christ at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one more proof that remakes don't compete with originals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was maybe hoping too much from an American remake of a French movie: I was wrong once more: "Mixed Nuts" is nothing else but a total waste of time and money, compared to the original "Le p?re Noël est une ordure" (litterally "Santa Claus is a ba..rd")an eternal hilarious classic, but maybe unadaptable after all. I don't say that because I am French (some US remakes of French movies -though not numerous- are excellent and well adapted, such as "True lies" with Schwarzy and Jamie Lee Curtis, "Sommersby" with Richard Gere and Jodie Foster,etc.), but because I definitely think it's no use to "americanize" what is typically French (or from another country), or one looses the main spirit. It's always better-than-nothing to dub the original dialog (I know American audience don't like to read subtitles, too bad as original actors are always "betrayed"); another perfect bad example of adaptation is the 1996's "The Bird Cage" with the-not-funny-at-all-even grotesque-Nathan Lane, vs the wonderful, sensitive and incredibly hilarious Michel Serrault in the original French/Italian "La cage aux Folles", (actually same story/dialog almost to the line in the US version, so why bother?)Finally, I appreciate very much US movies (in original version s'il vous plait!)for what I mostly expect from them: action, special effects, extraordinary CGIs, glamor,etc. We French are different, accept that and enjoy our movies too (1% of the US market only)!

		<shortDescription>Gets better with each viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I could well understand why I'd never heard of it before. It seemed to be no more than a mildly amusing comedy about a bunch of misfits who had a genius for making a mess of everything they turned their hands to. Then I found myself watching it again one Christmas and it left a much bigger smile on my face, so I watched it yet again. Now I have a DVD copy (imported from the States 'cause you can't get it here in liddle ol' England) and watch it every time I feel in need of a little light relief.I won't go over the plot as there are plenty of reviews that have already done that; suffice to say that "Mixed Nuts" is probably the most under-rated of Steve Martin's comedies. There are some brilliant set pieces that conform beautifully to the rules of slapstick comedy without resorting to out-and-out stupidity or toilet humour (even the bit involving one of the character's taking a pee is tastefully done). What's more, there's a support cast to die for, with not only Madeline Kahn in superb comedic form, but hugely entertaining and perhaps unexpected comedy performances from the often "serious" actors Liev Schreiber and Juliette Lewis.This is a beautfully scripted, well directed and cleverly edited film but the main reason to watch it is for the excellent ensemble playing. And if you feel, upon first viewing, that it's not quite your cup of tea, give it another chance and you just might find yourself falling in love with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes movies come along, like the 'Princess's Bride', that are so well done, thought out, have such wonderful production values that it makes the movie irresistible to adore. I realize that this isn't one of those films. Not at all in fact. Mixed is about as offensive and sometimes more scatological than 'There's Something About Mary' (the tollbooth 'click it' scene and all), there is really no thread of a plot in sight, and some of the characters are not even likeable (Felix and Gracie), but this film, with no plot, and its aimlessness (which it has been criticized a zillion times for) that keeps one entertained from the opening titles to the ending titles (watch it, you'll see what I mean)!The film stars Steve Martin, Rita Wilson, the late Madeline Kahn, Anthony LaPaglia ('So I Married An Axe Murderer', 'He Said, She Said'), Juliet Lewis ('The Other Sister', 'From Dusk 'Till Dawn'), Adam Sandler and Liev Schreiber ('Scream 3', 'Jakob The Liar'). And many others, including Gary Shandling, Rob Reiner, Joley Fisher, John Stewart, Parker Posey and Steven Wright. Steve Martin gives his usual wacky performance, Madeline Kahn is magnificent as the bitter Mrs. Munchnik, Adam Sandler is quite annoying, but his 'Grape Jelly' song makes up for the rest of his movie, even though it comes too late. Gary Shandling is also a plus, even though his role did not let him reach his potential, and Steven Wright is funny as usual as a person well.I hate to ruin the joke.The plot, well like I said there is no plot. But the trace of a plot I could find was three people on New Years Eve working in a suicide hotline office about to be evicted trying to desperately to help other people when they are the ones in need of help. The rest of the cast is really just a bunch of Mixed Nuts. There are a few smaller plots (1) about a serial killer named the Seaside strangler (2) one involving Steve Martin's girlfriend (3) one involving Mrs. Munchnik and her just as bitter dog owner enemy (or lover) (4) a cross-dressing Liev Shreiber (don't ask) (5) and Rita Wilson loves Steve Martin. Did I miss any??This is either going to be a funny movie to you or you will hate it. To save you the trouble of watching the movie and hating the movie and then telling the rest of us here just how many ways the movie sucks, here is a little test. Did you find 'There's Something About Mary' appealing for its romance or its slapstick??Mixed Nuts *** , B+ , 9/10 Rated PG-13 (a tiny bit of language, and a whole ton of scatological humor)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, this is a film destined to become a cult classic. My mother rented it near Christmas in 1994, and ever since it has become a Christmas classic for us. The cast is excellant, not a dull star among them and I don't see how you could find anything bad about, besides the black comedy that takes place when Steven Wright shoots himself and when Garry Shandling gets shot, but we could look past that. And we thought it to be very funny. And why it didn't get play in enough theaters is beyond me, it was a well-made film, with an excellant cast and great cameos and it should have made more at the box-office. In a world where trash like Pokemon dominates the box-office, the true gems are overlooked, Election is a good example. Steve Martin, Rita Wilson, and Madeline Kahn run a suicide-clinic from their apartment and don't make any profit from it, for they do it from the bottom of their hearts. Garry Shandling the landlord confronts Martin and evicts him with extreme-heartlessness as only he can display. Meanwhile, Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPagila are a poor couple ready to have a baby. Juliette gets mad and makes her way to Steve Martin's apartment to stay with Rita Wilson. And Anthony follows. Meanwhile, Madeline Kahn gets stuck in the elevator and decides to call for help using a toy-karoake machine. Meanwhile,once again. Steve gets a call from a transvestite played by Liev Schrieber, and is pressured to letting him/her come over to the apartment.All of these plot points tie in together, along with a few cool twists. This film could be a lighter, Christmas version of Pulp Fiction. And with Madeline Kahn's sudden death of cancer, this makes an excellant reason to check this film out this Christmas.R.I.P.

Steve Martin is near the top of his form. Madeline Kahn, Juliette Lewis, and Rita Wilson deliver good support. The Opening Credits scenes are a kick: particularly the snowman made out of sand---the rollerblader, dressed up as a snowman, tooling along by the palm trees next to the beach---the two rollerbladers skating home carrying their Xmas tree. The Christmas song selections are great and were appropriately applied. A clever plot development involved the landlord, Stanley Tannenbaum (Tannenbaum means Christmas Tree in German).</fullReview>

There's nothing wrong with remakes ('True lies' is s fine example) but squeezing the juice out of a screenplay in order to get a broader audience is just plain wrong.Go check out the French version.</fullReview>

It would have to be brutal because this "comedy" was anything but humorous.It was disappointing to me because I am a fan of Martin's comedic talents and I usually enjoy the acting talents of Madeline Kahn and Juliette Lewis, as well as a few other supporting actors in here However, this script is pure garbage. In retrospect, now that I see that it is a Nora Ephron film, I'm not shocked how horrible this turned out. At least I have a lot of company in my opinion of how bad this film stinks.</fullReview>

How can they call this a comedy? Nobody in the theater laughed throughout the whole movie, and about a third of the audience left before the ending. The movie is dull, boring, and pointless. Even Steve Martin's desperate pratfalls don't get any laughs, because the movie is so stultifying that it kills any attempt at humor. This is yet another unfunny movie that people will attempt to convince you is "dark humor", or "subtle", or "new-age comedy". The fact is it's just not funny, much like "Very Bad Things", or anything Andy Kaufman has ever done. Skip it and you'll be a much happier person.</fullReview>

Normally Steve Martin is quite funny and even has taste in scripts. Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson was also in this- which begged the question of why our generation's Jimmy Stewart would let his wife near such inane tripe.Please, I beg anyone considering Mixed Nuts as even a .49 cent rental to instead spend that money on rock salt or q-tips or pet rocks or something more useful than this.I PRAY whomever was responsible for this fiasco is so shamed that they propose its use in film schools as explicitly what never to do with a movie.

Besides the "father of the bride" movies this is the only Steve Martin movie I can even tolerate. Wish we had more movies like this with a great ensemble cast. Everybody does their character so well and portrays them with such a natural grace it doesn't seem contrived. Yes the plot is unlikely but not so far-fetched that it doesn't make a great holiday story. I wish we had more happy ever after holiday stories that began as something wacky. Madeline Kahn does her character so well. It is so fun to see the young Adam Sandler as a odd character (for him). The cameo by John Stewart, long before he was known as anybody, that is so out of character with his present image, is hysterical. &amp; the cameo by Rob Reiner is just a little icing on the cake.</fullReview>

Gracie can be a bit loud and over the top, but that's the character she plays, so maybe it needs to be that way. Steve Martin is one of our favorite actors, so that is what drew us to this movie in the first place. His timing, facial expressions and delivery are amazing as usual.

		<fullReview>This movie has many great actors from their younger days. A lot of different characters. Some of it is overt humor, some is subtle. It is a good mix. I wish they would not have covertly referenced the Holy family in the end, but because the movie is so funny, I kept it in perspective. It is worth a watch. It does not have nudity, foul language, or explosions. Just simple humor. Funny! You cannot go wrong with a movie who has both Steve Martin and Madeline Kahn. It is not a deep thinking movie. It is a light-hearted comedy centered around Christmas. It is worth the 1.5 hour watch! The characters are The title is appropriate since there are many different personalities in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ehrm...I do not know if I have anything worth adding about this film, but I thought I might give it a try. Mixed Nuts is not the kind of movie that almost everyone loves straight away, not like the latest go for Titanic or some other shallow, yet utterly enjoyable motion picture. I myself didn't like Mixed Nuts very much when I first saw it and I guess that was because my expectations were too high, consider it being a Steve Martin movie and all. However, it was on TV some time ago and I thought I'd give it another try - and then I actually got it! The characters got to me, no matter how unrealistic they may be - I feel pity for those who must have totally serious characters to enjoy a movie. If the actors aren't serious it's one thing, that can really ruin any movie, but Mixed Nuts offers a great cast! Steve Martin, Rita Wilson, Juliette Lewis...and of course Madeline Kahn, a real gem. They actually make it work, even if they can be somewhat weak at a few times. There's a lot of black comedy in it, and some screwball comedy, and even if it isn't totally hilarious at all times - when I first watched it I don't think I got any joke at all - there is a good sense of irony underneath. And that is why I like it. For those of you who didn't really like it much at first, but think that you'll might enjoy it a little, give it another shot after a year or so. If you consider it worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the Christmas season in LA. Philip (Steve Martin) runs a crisis hotline LifeSavers with Catherine (Rita Wilson) and Mrs Munchnik (Madeline Kahn). Stanley Tennenbaum (Garry Shandling) is evicting them for being 3 months behind on the rent. There is a serial killer on the loose called the Seaside Strangler. Felix (Anthony LaPaglia) is the loser father of pregnant Gracie (Juliette Lewis)'s unborn baby. Susan (Joely Fisher) breaks up with Philip. Chris (Liev Schreiber) is a transvestite. Louie (Adam Sandler) lives in the building. Mr. Lobel (Robert Klein) hates Munchnik. Dr. Kinsky (Rob Reiner) is an animal vet. Parker Posey and Jon Stewart are a couple of rollerbladers who keeps trying to bring a Christmas tree home. Who knew either were rollerbladers.I don't understand what the Ephron sisters think is funny in this movie. It's a chaotic mess. It's a great cast of terrific comedic actors doing slightly weird and quirky things without actually being funny. There are some sad attempts at slapsticks. Everybody in the movie is trying so hard to be quirky that they stumble over each other. The central premise of the suicide hotline is like a dare from a comedian to laugh. This movie mostly left me scratching my head at all the slightly annoying people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was, well, a little nutty. It was fairly funny and erratic but overall good. It was mostly a hodgepodge of nutty characters (a transvestite, a psychotic santa, a suicide hotline staff, a very pregnant lady, your typical Adam Sandler character, etc.) and a bunch of strange situations. (a lady gets trapped in an elevator, they are about to shut down the hotline and evict them, the santa keeps tripping over a Christmas tree, Steve Martin dances with the transvestite, etc.) The movie mostly takes place on Christmas eve at a crisis hotline. It reminded me a little bit of Noises Off. If you have time to kill and enjoy a decent comedy-this is the movie for you! ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our family tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie holds up really really well to repeated viewing. We have watched it every Christmas Eve for about 10 years and the whole family knows most of it by heart. It's funnier every time. With its large cast of wacky characters who make the story unfold like a pinball game, it has a lot in common with "You Can't Take It With You", another family favorite. I simply can't understand why it is so little known: it's a classic screwball comedy, with hilarious ensemble work by some of our greatest comic actors. Madeline Kahn's performance alone should put "Mixed Nuts" in every comedy lover's DVD library, since her untimely death so cruelly limited her wonderful body of work. She's at her absolute best here.Some of the actors were at a relatively early stage in their careers when this was made, and it is a testament to the judgment of the casting director that they were chosen."Mixed Nuts" introduced our family to Liev Schreiber, who plays a gloriously funny role that, taken with the work he's better known for, illustrates marvelous range. It's surprising to me that, as a big fan of snowy, wintry Christmases, my favorite Christmas movie is set in sunny L.A. But that is part of its charm: it is a story that gets its power from the interplay of innocence and irony. And the winner is: the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a collection of Christmas movies that I watch between Thanksgiving and Christmas. "Mixed Nuts" has been in the rotation since the day I bought it. Madeline Kahn was a genius. Liev Schrieber cracked me up. Rita Wilson was adorable and Steve Martin is, well, Steve Martin. I understand that many folks didn't like this movie and that's OK. Not every movie needs to get 10 stars. Many reviewers say that the movie is too over the top. My answer is "So?". Shall I break out a Marx Brothers movie for you? Over the top made them very famous. So, if this isn't for you, I understand. However, for me and my family, this is a Christmas classic along with "The Ref" and "Scrooged" among a couple dozen more traditional films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake better than French original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I consulted the reviews and was pleasantly surprised to hear of a "superior" 1982 French version. The surprise was short-lived. It is not better.There are interesting points of contrast: the French have more artistic cinematography, better gastronomy, and less formulaic denouement. A particular shot of the leading man lying on a couch with clothes and upholstery perfectly synchronized was unquestionably tasteful. But the Americans deserve credit too.Kahn lends her character far more depth than her French colleague. She undergoes a moving transformation that is not evident in Pere Noel. Martin equals L'Hermitte's commendable effort. Wilson surpasses her predecessor in both charm and feeling; she's more deserving of our sympathy. Sandler is funnier and far less nauseating than his French counterpart. And the real surprise is Lewis. Her rendition of the crazed pregnant lady is far more dignified than the Frenchwoman's, who was as unlikable as Lewis in her earlier turn as a Griswald in Christmas Vacation.But the real fork in the road is the conclusion. Whereas the French plunge into macabre darkness, the Americans end on several high notes. A Christmas movie must be jovial, and this version leaves me feeling better. Sometimes, even the worst catastrophes and deepest despair are followed immediately by pure jubilation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie cracked me up and I'm a big fan of comedies like The Simpsons and Family Guy, Scrubs and The Office (UK and US versions) if you want to know my type of humor. The on-screen TV Guide rating only gave it one star out of four and the current weighted-average rating of 4.7 stars out of 10 on IMDb just don't do it justice. Mixed Nuts is a film with a lot of good actors who spout off tons of funny dialog that works well, despite the relatively fluffy storyline. I love finding little-known comedic gems like this one when flipping through the cable channels on a Sunday afternoon. :-)The story revolves around a bunch of people working for a suicide hotline called LiveSavers and other tenants who live in the building where the home/office is located. Their antics at Christmastime are hysterical...from Liev Schreiber's transvestite character dancing with Steve Martin's character to Madeline Kahn's singing in the elevator and other laugh-provoking performances make this movie a must-see comedy if your sense of humor matches mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be the worse Christmas movie ever made. Plot was really bad, so the brilliant cast had no where to go but up, but really couldn't overcome the story. It is really amazing that according to IMDb the budget of $15M was spent on this rather than helping the homeless. Steve Martin is a name draw that you would expect to have at least a passable script to accept. Jon Stewart of the Daily Show is in this along with Parker Posey, but they have bit roles and I assume it was before either of them were known. We have a pile of Christmas movies that we reserve every year for getting together with family, and hoped that maybe this would be an addition to that. I think the verdict is clear, forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to say it, but this is a Steve Martin superdud. I saw it in the theater amidst a sparse crowd, none of whom was laughing either. I've seen it in video stores since then, Steve Martin all over the cover. That makes sense because he's the only possible selling point; nobody you know is likely to recommend you watch it. Come to think of it, that's why I went to see it. I like most of Martin's stuff.The first few minutes (poking fun at SoCal Christmas) was the funniest part of the film...mildly funny. From there it just got worse -- incoherent, disjointed, at times just disturbing. It's one of the few movies I walked out of halfway through.Go ahead and watch this flick if: You've seen every other movie ever made and need to complete your record. You like Steve Martin so much that can't recognize when one of his movies sucks. Uhh...I can't think of another reason.</fullReview>

This movie is one of my favorites. For some reason, most people have never even heard of it, but it is absolutely hilarious and has an AMAZING CAST!! I highly recommend this movie if you get a chance to see it. My favorite scene is probably the time when Adam Sandler is serenading Liev Schreiber (the cross dresser)on the ukulele. Liev Schreiber's character has tissues stuffed up his nose from being hit earlier by Steve Martin. Adam proceeds to sing to Liev, and causes him/her to spontaneously laugh and blows the tissues out of his/her nose. SOO FUNNY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading some of the other reviews, I was shocked that this movie was called "Steve Martin's worst...." and "boring".

I think that sometimes people expect too much out of a movie. Life is not always entertaining and amusing and movies are about life. Sometimes I just want to watch a movie that does not require me to figure out the plot or to try and dissect a convoluted storyline and that is when I want to see a movie like "Mixed Nuts" (especially after a day at work where you must be constantly thinking). Give this one a try for a light-hearted pick-me-up.</fullReview>

Garry Shandling as Stanley Tannenbaum being turned into a Christmas tree is priceless. Madeline Kahn relieving herself in a bathroom full of people is side-splitting. Granted this has more slapstick and physical comedy than other Ephron films, it still slips in the sentimental "miracles." It's definitely worth seeing. Many times!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an underrated classic film that utilizes the comic skills of several great actors. I watched it twice through the first day I rented it, just to hear the great one-liners and see the crazy antics of a bunch of neurotic phone counsellors. Praise must go to Madeline Kahn (late), who performs hilariously, especially in the elevator scene, and later gives us a sample of her beautiful operatic voice. Rita Wilson's character is cheerily naive, Juliette Lewis is wacky and fun, and Liev Schriber is scene-stealing as the cross-dresser...the dance scene with him and Steve Martin is one of the highpoints of the film, especially with Liev spinning solo around the room. And Adam Sandler is wonderful as the musical neighbour- his singing 'hello' had me laughing for the rest of the movie. This is ONE wacky film, but unlike recent productions, which seem to scream 'look at me! I'm a wacky film! I've got weird characters and an oddball script!', Mixed Nuts doesn't have to. It just is. And that's good enough reason to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems one of Ms Ephron's best films is one of the least popular.Rita Wilson gives one of my favorite female comic performances as a sad suicide prevention operator in this movie. Steve Martin has a pretty funny non-dance with a transvestite. Steven Wright has a nice, dark little cameo. Hey, what more could you want? The late, great Madeline Kahn has a thankless scene where she improvises a kind of unfunny rap, but other than that I think the only disadvantage this movie might have is that is packaged as a slick Hollywood product which may not suit the story or attract the audience most likely to enjoy it. This film has a lot of smart, goofy and unforgiving stuff going for it, and manages to be sweet and while at the same time as unromantic and messy as reality. It's a great Christmas film if you're not really in the Christmas spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Nuts Review - from Average Man Critic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story -1. A suicide hotline headquarters becomes the sight of insanity and chaos on X-Mas Eve, involving several neurotic people, who's lives are falling apart. I like it.Characters -1. Mrs. Munchnick, Catherine, Phillip, Stanly Tannenbaum, Gracey and the other nutsos that make up the world of Mixed Nuts were beautifully created.Acting -1. Rita Wilson, Steve Martin, Adam Sandler, Dom DeLuis, Gary Shandling, Liev Schribber, Madeline Khan, J. Lewis, and Anthony LaPaglia all work their butts off to make this film a masterpiece.Cinematography -1. From the bright California beaches with Frosty the Snowman on roller blades and the chorus singing on the boardwalk to the scene where everybody is gathered under the stars to witness the birth of a baby, everything feels warm and friendly. And thats what I like about Noras' stuff. They have that feel good spirit.Beginning -1. The jazzy Christmas music as Steve Martin is riding his bike along the boardwalk instantly intrigues the viewer and get into the X-Mas spirit, even though it might be in the middle of July!End -1. Heartwarming and hysterical. What a surprise. This movie takes you in so many directions, but leaves you in the same wonderful place it began.Believability -1. At the films center it's merely about friends and family getting together to celebrate X-Mas and solve their problems. Any normal family does it every year. My house is like that office every December 25th.Attention Holding -1. A great film that you can't walk away from, even the end credits with that cool music keeps you captivated.Memorable -1. With characters like these and the situations they find themselves in... I don't think you can easily forget this one.Could Watch Again -1. Definitely, like my othert favs; Burbs and Clue, I watch this at least once a week. I doubt I will ever get tired of it.Mixed Nuts = 10+. A good spirited and funny movie. Excellent for X-Mas time and any other time you want to laugh and feel good about your life.</fullReview>

BUT, they were practically giving the video away at a remainder store and something inside me said NOTHING can be that bad, not when you've got names like Nora Ephron and Steve Martin attached. Alas! It IS that bad, in fact it's WORSE than that bad, it has to be, no contest, THE worst Hollywood remake of a French classic and that INCLUDES Buddy, Buddy, which wanted some beating. It's not just that 'Le Pere Noel est une ordure' is BRILLIANT and doesn't need and can't stand remaking, it's that, somehow, the Ephron sisters (who claim a joint 'screenplay' credit) have contrived to copy the original French film and bleed all the colour out of it in both a literal and a metaphorical sense, as if, for perverse reasons known only to themselves, they had decided to repaint say Rembrandt's The Night Watch in water colour instead of oils. Bizarre. The only possible rating for this is MINUS 10.</fullReview>

Until then I had only known her for the excellent When Harry Met Sally and the kind of charming Sleepless in Seattle. Throw in Adam Sandler (who I only knew from Saturday Night Live) and Garry Shandling, and I think I had every right to expect a good movie.After the cute opening credits, which prompted a few laughs, I became shocked at how not funny this movie was. Sandler managed a couple more laughs with that funny "Chanakuh Song" singing voice of his, but I don't think I've ever seen so little come from such a large assembly of talent. A complete mess.

		<fullReview>This film was poorly received when it came out in 1994, and continues to offend many. There are basically two types of people who hate this film: a) bitter film snobs who are offended at it being a very loose remake of a French film, and b) people who don't like dark comedy (despite the fact that it's not really that dark IMO).I compare this film with another dark favorite of mine, Death Becomes Her. Possibly even Mommie Dearest. All were poorly received. All are great comedies for a viewer who just wants to go along for the ride and enjoy the films for what they ARE. Not what they AREN'T.Mixed Nuts is not a faithful remake of the French film. Not even close. It's completely irrelevant to me that it's even connected to the French film. It has no bearing on a useful review of this film. So let's move on.The film itself is brilliant. It has the perfect setting, the perfect cast, the perfect soundtrack, and the perfect lack of logic to make you smile. Quotable dialog, exaggerated Christmasy atmosphere, corny jokes, holiday depression.I will say this: it gets much better with repeated viewings. In a few seasons you too can be quoting Madeline Kahn's brilliant lines with a twinkle in your eye.If you're an average viewer or a cult film lover, give it a shot. If you're someone who likes to talk about how the Novella/Broadway cast/European art film/haiku was better, you should avoid it lest your good taste be assaulted. I think Ina Garten is on. She's making chicken stock and buying cheese. You should check that out.</fullReview>

Then factor in the Ephron sisters having written this adaptation, Nora Ephron directing and an ensemble casts of various comedians and Hollywood talent all led by the amazing Steve Martin. It reads like a zany madcap holiday adventure not unlike National Lampoon's classic Christmas vacation. The problem is that this is where it all falls apart. It is simply missing something, an x-factor that leaves you feeling unfulfilled and really not having as much fun as you should be having. I think part of the problem is that it simply tries too hard. There is so much going on and it tries to incorporate all of these loud boisterous characters that you get overwhelmed. It perhaps feels more, at times, like a TV pilot to a crazy sitcom than a holiday movie.I love Steve Martin, especially his early work. He is a legendary comedian for a reason. He tries very hard to lead this cast and he does well playing the no-nonsense and almost uppity leader of the hot-line. He even gets a chance, albeit in very small doses, to show off that legendary physical comedy that I love. But he doesn't really get to shine and somehow seems stuck. Madeline Kahn is good but very stereotypical as the shrill and very uppity Mrs. Munchnik. I enjoy her but she doesn't really get a lot of character development to make her character go anywhere. Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia are lovers stuck in a perpetual battle against each other. Their banter is good and I think I would have preferred to watch more of them than everyone else. Both are very good in their roles. Liev Schreiber probably steals the show as cross-dresser Chris. He is the one character that really stands out and has some great scenes and is such a quirky and fun character that you can't help but like him. Rita Wilson is Catherine, a dreamer who is in love with Steve Martin's character. Wilson is fun and has some great charisma on screen and her and Martin are good together but like Martin, her character is left unexplored and without enough depth. You will spot a lot of very familiar faces in the supporting cast including a young Adam Sandler being the same Adam Sandler he has always been, complete with that stupid voice that has never been funny. Rob Reiner in a small cameo role that doesn't really stand out but he's always fun to see and Robert Klein in an even smaller cameo role.I think Mixed Nuts just simply has way too much going on. I think the Ephron sisters were a little ambitious and tried to cram too many ideas into one small story. They could have focused more closely on the key characters and maybe cut out some of the more chaotic scenes and Mixed Nuts would have felt more balanced. I mean, Nora Ephron knows comedy and romance and even drama and they just felt like a half hearted attempt all around. It wasn't completely un-enjoyable. It did have its moments and has some genuinely fun scenes but I honestly didn't even find myself laughing at much of it and this is the type of movie that should have you in stitches. Its just an okay entry in the holiday movie genre and with such a crowded genre with so many classic favourites...you have to be better than just okay. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some funny scenes but mocks the sacredness of Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found many scenes that were funny. Steve Martin is good and most of the actors were funny.The pregnant woman Juliette Lewis was just to loud and nuts for me. Felix her boyfriend constantly doing the same thing fighting and running in his Santa suit, very repetitious. To me the premise was that this help line center was to help people with problems but, the people that were taking the calls really didn't care. It was a job. The nuts were funny. One of the scenes with the cross dressing man dancing with an uncomfortable Steve Martin was funny.I cannot find out who played this transsexual in the movie or what his name was. There is some swearing in it an a minor/medium sexual scene with Steve and the co-worker named Catherine in the bathroom. I felt uncomfortable in some parts and felt it disrespected Christmas.Gracie gives birth and they have her looking like Mary at the end with a veil on her head. I felt is was a satire and they were trying to replicate the birth of Jesus in this scene. It did mock my favorite holy day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to select one film as the worst I have ever seen, this is it.The Characters are so out of the ordinary ( I know that's why you love it) but it's just so unbelievabley stupid. So much rubbish happens in this film, and doesn't actually go anywhere. You could say it's light humour intended for those that love slapstick comedy. I say Mixed Nuts? Nah, just plain NUTS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have just got to appreciate this film for its ridiculous narrative.characters are crease up hilarious. esp the transvestite. (bring it on Ken!) a must see movie...If you don't find the she male dance scene funny or in fact any of the movie that contains the she male then you must be lacking a sense of humour. not being rude but if you don't laugh you must have fallen asleep while watching. rewind it and play it again. you will laugh out loud.each to their own i guess but if you like silly movies then i recommend this as being a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Of All Time **** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mixed Nuts" is by far the funniest movie of all time. When Philip (Steve Martin) finds out he is going to be evicted on Christmas Eve, he and his staff follow misadventures with a bumbiling Santa (Anthony LaPaglia), his pregnant girlfriend (Juliette Lewis), a transvestite (Liev Screiber), and a ukelele singer (Adam Sandler) for a Christmas they will never forget. An uproariously funny comedy that should be a Christmas classic. It also contains a great Christmas soundtrack which is now out-of-print and there should be copies of it on EBAY. I found my copy at a local record shop. I am waiting for the movie to come out on DVD and that will be good. Everyone should have a copy of this movie because it's a big hoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst. Movie. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Martin works for a suicide hot line, and he's sorta self-involved, and he gets a caller on the line, and he's too distracted to handle it properly, and the caller kills himself! Ha ha! How hilarious! Seriously, if you think this sort of humor is as appalling as I do, stay far, far away from this movie. Martin, as the protagonist, is not funny. Rita Wilson, as his mousy love interest, is not funny. Madeline Kahn, as his ditzy boss, is not funny. Liev Schreiber, as a local drag queen, is not funny. Adam Sandler, as a falsetto-singing ukulele player (now there's a dramatic reach), is so not funny that, if there had been anything else funny in the movie, he would have sucked all the funniness out of it. This film is an hour and a half of pain. Spare yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad on a biblical scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given its stellar cast and pedigree, you could be forgiven for expecting "Mixed Nuts" to be really, really funny. Make no mistake--it's not. This movie is bad on a biblical scale--it's the cinematic equivalent of an Old Testament plague. Steve Martin heads a suicide prevention hotline on Christmas. This weak premise gives Nora Ephron an opportunity to roll out every cruel, mean-spirited and painfully unfunny stereotype in the bad movie book, from the mannish transvestite to the forced-zany suicidal loon to the ever-popular Recurring Dead Body. One wonders why Martin and his staff run a suicide prevention hotline if they hate the mentally ill. As a Christmas movie this cynical, nasty exercise makes "Bad Santa" look like "Miracle On 34th St." The script is an incomprehensible mess, even veteran comic actors like Martin, Garry Shandling and Madeline Kahn seem lost, and Ephron's direction is so sloppy and hamhanded that the film plays like cutting-room debris stitched randomly together. If you're a Steve Martin completist you may feel compelled to see "Mixed Nuts", but do yourself a favor and don't. This movie is physically painful to watch. Everyone involved with this film should be embarrassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Cast In A Very Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't really much to this by way of story. It's Christmas Eve, and what story there is revolves around the crazy goings on at a suicide hotline centre run by Philip (Steve Martin) and staffed by Catherine (Rita Wilson) and Mrs. Munchnick (Madeine Kahn). Once you throw in Catherine's friends Gracie and Felix (Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia), an irritating neighbour (Adam Sandler) a depressed transvestite (Liev Schreiber), the landlord who's about to throw them all out (Garry Shandling) and a veterinarian who seems to spend most of his time treating people (Rob Reiner) along with a subplot (and can you really even have a "sub" plot when there's no real "plot" to speak of?) about a serial killer on the loose you know what you're going to get - a pretty silly movie. There are some scenes in this that are very funny. Schreiber's role did make me laugh a couple of times and the scenes between Martin and Wilson were generally pretty good. Sandler did what Sandler usually does for me - which is irritate me. Aside from those few scenes that made me laugh, though, this isn't outrageously funny. It's not a bad movie to waste some time with, but it's not something you're going to remember for very long. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not his finest hour - but not an hour and a half wasted either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with Steve Martin is this: Once you've seen one of his finest movies like The Man With No Brain or The Jerk, you just expect every movie to be his next fabulous performance. It just doesn't work like that. If you are watching this movie expecting the above, you will walk away disappointed. That having been said, I enjoyed the film. Steve Martin puts in an acceptable performance, though I have to say his was not the best in my opinion. Madeline Kahn is great as the sour-puss Mrs Munchnik, who spends the whole movie moaning, and attempting to get to her dead husband's sister's house for Christmas Dinner... or is it her dead sister's husband...? Though I found Adam Sandler's character highly irritating, his 'compositions' were superb! But the award for best performance has to go to Liev Schreiber, as the transvestite - he stole every scene he was in, and outperformed everyone twice over!There are a few very funny moments in this film (Mrs Munchnik stuck in the elevator being one) but not enough of them, and too much of a disappointing and corny ending to warrant any more than a 6 out of 10 in my book. It's worth watching, but don't expect to be blown away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny misfire is faux black comedy, faux christmas movie and faux romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bunch of weirdos gather in a helpline centre and partake in some unfunny black comedy.I always remember this movie as being fun, so every time Christmas comes around, i find myself watching it again, but every time i'm reminded of how cruel-spirited and unfunny it is.Its a ham-fisted misfired attempt at black comedy from Sleepless in Seattle writer-director Nora Ephron.2/10. See it for one of Australian actor Anthony LaPaglia's rare Hollywood appearances (as the psycho Santa Clause), the late Madeline Kahn in one of her annoying roles (as opposed to the lusty temptresses she played for Mel Brooks), and some of Steve Martin's worst comic timing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy's a personal thing -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes one person laugh might make another cringe, so I can only offer my personal opinion on Mixed Nuts and say that, personally, I found it one of the worst comedies ever made. The French original, La Pere Noel est une Ordure, was not a great movie, but it did have some very funny gags and, amid moments of hysteria, had some beautifully underplayed comic moments. Unfortunately, this much lighter cover version is played at top volume and fever pitch almost from the start and is frequently just painful to watch. It boasts a talented cast (and Adam Sandler, here at his most irritating ever), the script isn't exactly terrible, but everyone seems to be overcompensating for the film's deficiencies so excessively that it is embarrassing to watch as Martin falls over for the umpteenth time for no good reason or Madeline Kahn hams it up to the point where you can feel the nausea rising in the back of your throat.The two major offenders here are Nora Ephron's pitiful direction and George Fenton's horrendous score, a classic example of 'Mickey Mousing' the film to point out "here come the jokes" in the knowledge that you wouldn't notice them otherwise. Like too many of the players, they're both trying way, way too hard and clearly have no trust or confidence in their material.For those familiar with 'Pere Noel,' the tone is lightened considerably - the dead body is no longer an innocent bystander but an unsympathetic character, and he no longer ends up fed to the zoo animals, for example. On the plus side, Juliette Lewis is nowhere near as bad as her French counterpart, Anthony La Paglia is okay, Rob Reiner very good in a nothing part and Liev Schrieber is good as long as he isn't required to do anything too ridiculous. But it's all too easy to believe the look of disgust on Martin's face near the end is real and only too clear that everyone involved knew that they were on a sinking ship with no lifeboats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To me this movie is a spoof on the California hot Christmas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie and watched. Then I laughed so much that I decided that I had to purchase the tape. I liked Delia and Nora Ephron's writing (When Harry met Sally, You've got Mail; soon to be released in video) that I started looking for movies where they wrote the screen play. Mixed Nuts is a hilarious noire-comedy. Maybe like Harry, Billy Crystal, in When Harry met Sally, I do have a dark side. If I get a book or any magazine I look at the first page and then go straight to the last page and read it.A line that made me laugh so hard was Rob Reiner's: "What is it with women and pillows?" When I first got married, I inherited my husband's grandmother's Singer portable sewing machine. The manual had such old English that you can almost see the thou, and thee coming out of it! I have made so many pillows that you won't believe it. I have pillows in the form of hearts, round pillows, square pillows, small neck pillows, long neck pillows. Sofa with matching pillows, pillows that mach the drapes and this never ends. Every little girl neighbor I ever had has asked me to make them a pillow. When my husband and I heard Reiner's line we were rolling. I had not laughed that hard since Bubba Blue, Mykelti Williamson (Primary Colors) in Forrest Gump said: "Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs,shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.. That- that's about it.". Sometimes when my husband comes home from work he announces his presence, or when we make our bed where I have eleven pillows; the three we sleep on, the four lace ones, a big lace one, a long neck one, a small neck one, two hearts and the rectangular; he says: "What is it with women and pillows?" To me this movie is a spoof on the California hot Christmas. Steve Martin (SNL, The Out-of -Towners), comes down the street on his bike and you see it is Christmas, and all you see are: sand, beach, dry desert plants and roller bladders. I have had the opportunity to spend Christmas on both the east and west coasts of the U.S., even in foreign countries when it is summer at Christmas time that poor Santa has to boiled inside those hot clothes. That to me is Mixed Nuts. The therapists from Life-Savers all need some therapy themselves. Catherine O'Shaughnessy, Rita Wilson (Now and Then, Sleepless in Seattle, and Rob Reiner much anticipated "The Story of Us") knits compulsively. When she gets upset she has to run into the bath tub and have a panic attack. Mrs. Munchnik, Madeline Kahn (Cosby, Nixon) is neurotic in her own way. It is so funny when she gets stuck in the elevator and starts doing sounds of drumming and vocalization. She is good at it! There is a nice ending which reminds much the manger scene, with the baby and all. It depends on your state of mind and sense of humor. I enjoyed this movie very much. Nora, Delia and I think alike.</fullReview>
