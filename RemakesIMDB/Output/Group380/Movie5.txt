		<shortDescription>Stands Up on it's Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember as a small lad seeing this on Walt Disney's hour television show where he regularly segmented his feature films for broadcast. Unfortunately this Robin Hood gets overlooked next to Errol Flynn's and the silent with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. but it has enough merit to stand on its own.Richard Todd is a dashing Robin Hood and he was at the height of his career when he did this film for Walt Disney. Todd was a fine performer and should have had a much bigger career than he did.The cast is filled out with a fine group of British performers. Two in my opinion really stand out. Peter Finch gets his first real exposure to American audiences as the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham. He probably had the biggest career of all the cast members.Secondly the booming James Robertson Justice as Little John is never bad in any film he was ever in. The classic battle between Robin Hood and Little John with staffs on a log bridge was never done better.During the 1950s this version also had competition from television where Richard Greene had a successful series for about seven years. The TV series was a good one, but this film doesn't have to yield to it either.A fine adventure film, the kind just not being made any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very pleasant, uncomplicated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an outstanding film, with superb acting, a wonderful musical score, and colourful scenes that unfold from the Disney picture book of life in the middle ages. I remember seeing it around 1956 as a 10 yer old, and was fascinated by the lives of the outlaws, sheltering in the glades of Sherwood Forest from the wicked Prince John and his cunning assistant the Sheriff of Nottingham.The script was tight and delivered in impeccable olde English by actors who often went on to become household names in the acting profession later on in life. The beautiful scenes of woodland glades, the sun shimmering brightly as it cascaded through the trees into the outlaws' camp, brought to life the story of their fight for freedom and justice, and added a strangely surreal visual effect.There are a number of memorable scenes, friar tuck singing with himself as he munched his capon pie among the most notable. The most captivating for me, however, was the sight of Tuck walking behind Robin and Marian out of an eerie Sherwood Forest, with the lilt of Alan A Dale's voice as he sang a pleasant, melodic little tune .Yes, a very pleasant, uncomplicated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Family Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This live action Walt Disney produced Robin Hood adaptation is among the best in the genre, perhaps second only to the outstanding Errol Flynn version of 1938 ("The Adventures of Robin Hood"). The cast is solid, led by the energetic and charismatic Richard Todd as Robin Hood.This version has a few features not commonly found in Robin Hood films. Eleanor of Aquitaine (the Queen of England and mother to both King Richard and Prince John) is a major supporting character and is played by veteran actress Martita Hunt. The real-life Eleanor is one of the most famous and powerful women of medieval English history and one that is (unfortunately) only rarely portrayed in film. Another historic figure that is represented is the Archbishop of Canterbury (played by Antony Eustral). Absent from this version is the traditional conflict between Normans and Saxons, but there is plenty of evil-doing on the part of Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham for Robin to deal with.This rousing adventure is not to be missed, particularly by those who profess to have an interest in classic adventure. Don't let the association with Walt Disney Studios fool you. Though the film isn't brutally violent, there is sufficient 1950s death and mayhem to satisfy most fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recaptures the spirit of Robin Hood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, this is actually worth going to some trouble to see. Probably not to everyone's taste -- the opening sequence, with a nimble-footed and saturnine Alan-a-Dale strumming the theme-song ballad, will sort out the sheep from the goats of those who simply can't stand this sort of thing -- but despite the live-action Disney label, it stands up well amongst all its predecessors and successors.It steers a skillful and essential line between tendentious over-seriousness and pie-in-the-face humour, and contrives a fresh view on the familiar set-pieces -- the shivered arrow on the bull's-eye, Friar Tuck and the river crossing, the recruitment of Little John -- with, unusually, a sizable part for the formidable Eleanor of Aquitaine as the mother of the King and Prince John. In the title role, Richard Todd makes a charming curly-headed rogue, whose merry eyes betray his identity beneath the most enveloping of disguises, and he brings the necessary charisma and impudence to the character: this is the recognisable Robin Hood of legend, whom men follow for freedom and for the fun of it. A little easy-going, perhaps, with little of the passion against injustice that flashes beneath the laughter of Errol Flynn, but this is Disney after all.Joan Rice is a spitfire wilful Marian, whose involvement is plausibly scripted without any anachronism; she also provides a couple of the best moments in the film, whether belabouring Robin on her fellow-travellers' behalf or silencing him with an athletic embrace at the end. James Hayter as Friar Tuck and Peter Finch as the black-avised Sheriff of Nottingham also give memorable performances -- and could that really have been avuncular Hubert Gregg, of all people, convincing us as Prince John?My main source of irritation about this film lay in some of the archery embellishments. Every arrow-shot we see zips past with the whine of a ricocheted bullet, presumably in order to make the fights sound more exciting in the absence of gunfire, and the system of signalling by firing colour-coded arrows in relays at one another seemed not only out of place but highly risky (credibility not helped by what I surely didn't imagine as people turning round to look as they hear the arrow coming!) The distinctly unpleasant fate of the forsworn Sheriff, on the other hand, was glossed over in suspicious silence, without so much as a cry.But caveats aside, the film scores well on sheer energy, with a healthy dash of humour. The 1967 "A Challenge for Robin Hood" (despite featuring Hayter as Friar Tuck again!) is an over-bright and sanitised Ladybird rendition; the 1990 "Robin Hood" (the non-Costner version) went the other way and overdid the historical grime. The latter is the better film, but neither of them has the enjoyability and spirit of the 1952 offering. This isn't on the same scale as the Curtiz/Keighley classic of 1938, and Todd remains an engaging boy rather than a rollicking leader of men, but it perhaps comes closest to matching the verve of its illustrious predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine retelling of a classic favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with 1938's "The Adventures of Robin Hood" w/ Errol Flynn and Olivia de Haviland Disney tries at making it's own version of the famous Robin Hood legend and succeeds admirably! Richard Todd is the perfect Robin Hood being a classic 1950s heartthrob and sporting a 50s haircut to boot and Joan Rice is a sweet and convincing Maid Marian. The script also presents a clever touch at including a wandering minstrel who weaves the story together in song. The only flaw I found was the overly-bright lighting causing the cinematography to be suffering a budget. But other than that, "The Story of Robin Hood" is very well-written, well-directed, well-acted and well worth the purchase of the video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story Of Robin Hood And His Merrie Men (Ken Annakin, 1952) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched this just once growing up, as opposed to the numerous viewings allotted to the definitive 1938 Errol Flynn version, so I was curious to know how it has held up (particularly since I recently enjoyed another Walt Disney epic starring the recently-deceased Richard Todd i.e. ROB ROY, THE HIGHLAND ROGUE [1953]). As can be intimated from the rating above, my reaction to it was by and large a positive one; to begin with, the copy I acquired ? even if viewed on a small TV screen ? was gorgeous, making this surely among the studio's most handsome-looking live-action efforts. Another immediately striking element is the casting ? modest in comparison to the earlier Warner Bros. super-production perhaps but no less capable and, more importantly, fitting to each respective character: Todd, one of the few Robins not to sport a beard(!), is suitably dashing and good-natured (though lacking the athleticism of Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks before him); incidentally, having mentioned Fairbanks ? whose 1922 ROBIN HOOD was treated with such rigor as to have the semblance of authenticity ? this one too would appear to want to present the 'true' story (not merely picking up from the moment King Richard ? played by an unrecognizable Patrick Barr ? left for the Crusades but also insisting on providing a back-story and a noble heritage for our hero ? even the famous archery contest occurs prior to his having turned outlaw and, what's more, Robin is beaten by his own dad in it?!). Anyway, to get back to Todd's fellow actors, pretty Joan Rice makes for one of the youngest yet most spirited Maid Marians; among the "Merrie Men", typically, the ones to get most prominence are Little John (James Robertson Justice ? who else? ? but with hair dyed blond!), Friar Tuck (James Hayter and, for some odd reason, fancying himself a singer in the film's corniest scene!) ? both of their introductions at least stick to the legend ? and Allen-a-Dale (Elton Hayes, whose brief cinematic career seemed to be stuck playing minstrels in historical efforts!); for what it is worth, the presence of the last two mentioned constitute the film's severest drawbacks to this viewer. On the side of the wrongdoers, we get Hubert Gregg as a particularly sly (though rather youthful) Prince John and, surprisingly, Peter Finch as the Sheriff of Nottingham (effective apart from an unbecoming coiffure ? incidentally, I may be watching his one other film in this vein i.e. THE DARK AVANGER aka THE WARRIORS [1955], with Errol Flynn no less, this coming week-end); by the way, another novelty to the lore which turns up here but hardly anywhere else is that of having a benign but obviously ineffective Queen Mother (a suitably regal Martita Hunt). While there is not quite the emphasis on spectacle or elaborate action set-pieces we find in other versions (though the drawbridge climax is undeniably thrilling), the film ? which, at a mere 84 minutes, does not run the risk of overstaying its welcome ? is very entertaining for the most part and, as I said, looks good enough to smooth over the occasional deficiency.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title (especially the British version) says it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A winner in every way. Lush Technicolor costumes and sets (featuring matte work by Peter Ellenshaw), crisp pacing, convincing--i.e., non-hammy--acting, all highlighted by vivid dialogue.Now, as to specifics, here are some of my favorite aspects of this undeservedly overlooked classic. First (and most obvious, but hey, it's pretty important): Richard Todd's Robin. I fell in love with him when I saw the movie on Wonderful World of Disney (I was born the year it was released, 1952), and have followed his career with interest ever since. His archery and other swashbuckling actions are persuasive but not gimmicky, his romantic aura is compelling but not slick, his leadership qualities are authoritative and incisive but not overbearing. And he has a sense of humor! Some of the less obvious reasons I rate this film a "10": The framing device of Allan-a-Dale (and the lovely singing/playing of Elton Hayes); within that, I love the small, unassuming, sweet-natured dog who follows the minstrel wherever he goes. The dialogue and business shared by the Archbishop of Canterbury (Anthony Eustrel, I believe), Prince John (Hubert Gregg), and Queen Eleanor (Martita Hunt). The childhood friendship of Robin and Marian that gradually ripens into romance. Thus, when she disguises herself as a page in order to seek out Robin Fitzooth to prove his loyalty to king and country, her emotional stake lends sympathy and believability to her actions. The economical scene-shifting that takes Robin from his quarterstaff skirmish with Little John to his brook-side battle with Friar Tuck--which in turn leads, seamlessly, to an ambush by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his goons. Spoiler Alert (in case another is needed)! Check out the grisly but tastefully handled demise of the Sheriff--getting squashed and/or bisected between an inexorably closing drawbridge and the castle wall! No matter how many times I see this film (and it's been quite a few), this scene always makes me rub my hands and cackle gleefully.I could cite many other reasons why I love this film, but if you ask for one quality that sets it apart from every other Robin Hood film I've seen--including one very famous (and in my opinion, vastly overrated) supposed classic--I would say: Heart. As in warm, true, and loyal. And it will warm the hearts of viewers not jaded by overblown yet hollow swashbucklers and pompous, pretentious epics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ripping Good Version of the Robin Hood Tale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first version of Robin Hood that I and my siblings saw, so we judged other versions based on this Disney take. I was 9 when I saw it with my younger brother. We loved the whistling arrows warning system used in this film and we found Richard Todd, a dashing, swashbuckling Robin, in fact we became huge fans of all his works. One of our favorites was Disney's "Rob Roy, The Highland Rogue" actually filmed in Scotland. Disney was not a miser when it came to his "pet projects" and Rob Roy was one of them. The Story of Robin Hood was no exception and it was filmed on location in England, even though some shots look like matte prints. The cast, too was impressive, with James Robertson Justice a perfect, burly 'Little John', Martita Hunt as Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, James Hayter a robust 'Friar Tuck', Peter Finch as the nasty Sheriff of Nottingham, Elton Hale a charming 'Allan-a-Dale', the great Michael Hordern in a small role as 'Scathelock' and Bill Owen as 'Stutely'. The production is top notch and the film very memorable, and to me, very nostalgic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and informative telling of the Robin Hood story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 9/13/2013 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Ken Annakin): *DVD I watched entitled just "The Story of Robin Hood"* Entertaining and informative telling of the Robin Hood story does a good job of keeping your interest and helping the viewer to understand why Robin became the outlaw Hood, and placed himself in the position of the leader of the group in the Sherwood Forest.(Aka. The Merrie Men) This is a Disney live action movie that actually has less fluff than others and is pretty straight-forward in the telling of the tale. Richard Todd plays the main character as a playful yet purposeful hero of the poor folk in the area after King Richard goes on a crusade and his brother takes advantage of his position by over-taxing everyone and trying to rid the forest of what he considers riff-raff(the Forresting folk). The first culprit of his arrows is Robin's father(thus providing the primary purpose of Robin's exile and revenge mindset initially). Quickly though the stealing from the rich and giving to the poor became a necessity for the poor folk to survive. The sheriff of Nottingham is the primary vehicle for brother Richard's type of thievery and justice, and eventually Maid Marion(played by Joan Rice) finds out what's going on and begins to help the Merrie Men. This live action piece seems to be a possible guide to the later animated Disney film, but some of the stronger emotional pieces were removed. I haven't viewed many of the versions of this story, but this is the best I've encountered so far because you understand Mr. Hood's plight and purpose. There is a little fun to be had with the Merrie Men and Robin &amp; Marion's teasing, but primarily the completeness and clarity of the story is what makes this film work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it again last night after reading an unfavorable review. I thought it was very entertaining and very well acted. Who cares if Richard Todd wasn't 6'2"? He was indeed athletic (in his autobiography, Caught in the Act, Todd said he did his own stunts), handsome, possessed a beautiful speaking voice, had a twinkle in his eye and had daggers in them when he confronted Peter Finch at the drawbridge. Excellent job.Errol Flynn's Robin was excellent, too. But the '38 version was big budget. Disney was able to do a lot with a lot less. I love both versions. Flynn is king of the big-budget Robins; Todd is king of the smaller production. Richard Greene was a good television Robin.Another reason I call it a draw is because of what Todd's Robin, Rob Roy, Dambuster meant to me as a kid. He indeed was a role model. And Disney's productions were wonderful. Others I still consider heroes of the 50s include Gordon Scott and Steve Reeves. I'm sure millions of other kids from that decade would agree.In those days, adventure, fair play and knowing right from wrong were big themes. Todd et al sure knew how to convey them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooray here comes Robin Hood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1950's Disney made several live action feature films of variable quality,some such as Treasure Island, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and The Great Locomotive Chase were actually rather good but perhaps the best of all was The Story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men.For a start it was actually filmed in Sherwood Forest in England and Richard Todd who plays Robin Hood had an impeccable upper class English accent.Peter Finch who plays the evil Sheriff of Nottingham was of course Australian but manages a reasonable English accent.The Merry Men and peasants all seem to have acquired an undefined West Country accent which is personified by James Robertson Justice who plays Little John.Watching the film recently one is reminded of what a big brawny chap he was before he started to get corpulent.The film itself has all the usual plot elements,e.g.Robin and Maid Marion played by the delectable Joan Rice,the archery contest and of course the usual comic appearance of Friar Tuck played by James Hayter,a part he was born to play.The story continues with the collection of King Richard's ransom which the dastardly Sheriff and his men try to steal disguised as Robin Hood's men.Hooray! The real Robin Hood and his Merry Men come to the rescue in the nick of time much to the relief of The Archbishop of Canterbury and Queen Eleanor the King's mother,a tough old bird played by Martita Hunt.There is plenty of action,energetic sword fights and last minute rescues all very tastefully done apart from two quite violent scenes.The first when two peasants played by Michael Hordern and Bill Owen who can't or refuse to pay their taxes are taken to the town square and hung up over heated braziers while the Sheriff's men ride around beating them with cudgels.Fortunately for them they are soon rescued by Robin Hood @ Co and become it has to be said not particularly happy Merry Men.The other is when,at the end,The Sheriff is squashed between the drawbridge and the castle wall,a grisly end which serves him jolly well right.I have nothing but praise for the entire cast,this is a wonderful adventure film for schoolboys of all ages and all in glorious color and brilliantly directed by Ken Annakin.In the final scene Robin and Marion are married with the blessing of King Richard who turns up at the last minute, yes I know the story is only a legend but I wonder how the couple would have fared in the years to come when King Richard is killed in The Crusades and the villainous Prince John becomes the legitimate King.In history he wasn't known for forgiving and forgetting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Energetic and rousing adventure film of the merry legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I do not think it is as good as The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn which is the epitome of what an adventure film should be. However, it is solid and truly excellent family entertainment, if a tad too short. The locations are authentic and the Technicolour photography is very fine. The score is suitably rousing, and the script has its fair moments of wit and light-hearted humour while the story never meanders or feels dull. Ken Annakin directs briskly and there is some lively sword-fighting as well. The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men also benefits from a fine cast. Richard Todd is enjoyable as Robin Hood, and there is a tuneful Allan-a-Dale. And Joan Rice is an alluring Maid Marion. However, the best of the lot are a stately Martita Hunt, a robust James Robertson-Justice, a wicked Peter Finch and a delightful Hubert Gregg. On the whole, not quite classic status but great fun and recommended. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD is hard to find....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. One I remember fondly from my youth and have purchased on VHS and laser. I now have it on DVD, but this is where Disney has done us wrong. You can only buy this DVD through their Movie Club. This is outrages. Several of the other Disney live-action features are sold this way. Kidnapped, Zorro. This is keeping these films from the general public. Disney should know better.This is probably the only Robin Hood film that sticks close to the original legend. It is well acted and Joan Rice is beautiful as Maid Marian. Having been to Sherwood Forest, Nottingham, and the surrounding area, it is nice to see that this film was actually filmed in England, not in California like Flynn's movie. And, of course, the war hero Richard Todd (he was one of the first on Omaha beach) is excellent as Robin Hood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Half Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Todd's first full-length outing into the world of medieval England isn't half bad. There's a great all-British cast featuring Peter Finch as a very believable baddie in the form of Nottingham's Sheriff, whilst James Robertson Justice weighs-in as John Little.The script is quite good for such an otherwise heroic tub-thumper. There's one or two nice subtle exchanges, reminiscent of a more academic work like 'Becket'. There's some fine castle set-pieces that are obviously 'worked' with a little imagination. Colours are vibrant, with sly little shifts from sepia B&amp;W intros.Action scenes and sword fights are a wee bit stilted. They lack the enthusiasm of Errol Flynn's version, and Todd himself seems a little reticent in the athletics department. One or two scenes are needlessly long, like the introductory sparring between Robin &amp; Friar Tuck at the river. Whereas the archery contest, which could have been much more fun, passed in a bit of a flash. That's an editing/directing/production issue. There were probably worthy pieces that finished-up on the cutting-room floor.All in all, not a bad version, if a little bit pedestrian in the swash-buckling department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a later version of Robin Hood, made a decade and a half after The Adventures of Robin Hood. It follows the Disney formula of using good actors rather than well-known stars, and a terrific attention to detail.This film does not take as many liberties with known history as does The Adventures. If you are an expert historian, you can find faults, but they are kept to a minimum.In many places, this film is as good as, and sometimes surpasses The Adventures. But it lacks Michael Curtiz's touch, and - sorry to say - Richard Todd is no match for Errol Flynn.</fullReview>
