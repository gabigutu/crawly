		<fullReview>Jon Hall gets a break from the exotic Arabian Nights films he was doing during most of the Forties and gets his chance to play the legendary Robin Hood in Prince Of Thieves. He's definitely a bit more of a rogue in this Robin Hood tale than you find in most.He rescues Maid Marian and her brother Michael Duane a pair of Saxon nobles who were waylaid in Sherwood Forest. It's the brother that's heading for his wedding to Lady Adele Jergens. However the powers that be who rule England in Richard I's absence have other ideas for some politically convenient marriages of alliance. Of course that's Prince John who is not seen in this film.As it's only 71 minutes, barely longer than an hour we don't get too much time for character development. The Prince Of Thieves plays like an episode of the old Richard Greene Robin Hood series. For those expecting Errol Flynn you will be disappointed.</fullReview>
