		<shortDescription>Criss Cross is the cruelest cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster, hot off his success in "The Killers," where he burned up the screen with the smoldering Ava Gardner, paired up again with director Robert Siodmak to make this noir hit with yet another sultry and exotic leading lady, this time the stunning Yvonne de Carlo. In this role she proves she's not just a decorative sex symbol and gets to strut the acting chops I've always suspected her of possessing. For those who are only familiar with her as Lilly Munster on the famous TV show, it is a treat to see her at her youthful beauty and in one of her best roles. Although I believe Gardner to be the more beautiful of the two, I couldn't imagine her pulling off this role (at least at this stage of her career; she later developed much more depth) as impressively as de Carlo does, who in my view is (or at least became, in this movie) the better actress. Lancaster also proves that his star-making performance in the aforementioned "The Killers" was not a fluke, and despite the two films' possessing a surface similarity--sexy dame double crosses love or lust-strucked sap with fatal consequences, which, of course, would describe many noirs--Lancaster makes a unique, interesting and multi-dimentional dupe in both roles. He exudes typical male 'traits' of toughness, masculinity and jadedness but yet is susceptible to the more typical 'female' qualities of vulnerability, sensitivity, lovelorness and hopeful, but ultimately futile, optimism in his refusal, or inability, to become completely cynical and hard-bitten, even at the end. In "Criss Cross" he plays the divorced Steve Thompson, who has recently returned to San Francisco where his ex-wife Anna remains, trying to convince himself of every reason in the book for moving back home except the real one--his lingering, potent love and strong attraction for her which still persists. He moves back in with his family and gets his job back at an armored-car company, all the while playing what will turn out to be a dangerous game--going back to their old haunts where he pretends he has no desire to see Anna, when he knows sooner or later he will. The situation proves to be all the more risky when he discovers she has married Slim Dundee, an abusive, big-shot gangster. But despite this extremely dangerous, untenable situation, he is unable to resist when Anna's siren song beckons, luring not only him, but her husband, into her lethal web and complex scheme with cold-blooded precision.The three principals give riveting performances: Lancaster's Steve--the viewer can feel his painful uncertainty in knowing he should not and must not get tangled up with his ex again, and yet he must; he is so in love (or lust) that there really is no other option for him. De Carlo's Anna in my view is the most difficult role in the film to convincingly portray--despite her despicable, heartless, self-serving actions, she still remains likable and even heartrending in her justifications. She convincingly displays vulnerability and anguish but at the same time is completely venal and selfish, willing to use the two men who love her and then discard them. We get the feeling that she *may* be good at heart, but really and truly has lost her way, has assessed she's too far gone to ever go back, and so she will plow on ahead determinedly, consequences and feelings and people's lives be dam*ed. The scene where de Carlo is with the men as they plan the heist is reminiscent of the one in "The Killers" where Ava Gardner is with the criminal gang--it is obvious they are no mere decorative dames, molls who remain in the background; they play an active role with the big boys, but they have something up their sleeves. As for Dan Duryea as Slim, despite his seeming, or in fact playing, the same kind of roles in all the movies I've seen him in, that of the smarmy, slimy, sleazy character who possesses many of the most undesirable, worst traits in humankind--mean, petty, greedy, cowardly, sneaky, etc., he remains puzzlingly fascinating and even likable, and he does not fail here. His character here is the kind of person no man, and woman, crosses without consequence, and like Lancaster, who loves Anna to the end, Slim is dead set upon paying her back what she has reaped, but despite the fact that all that she's done to him, he still loves her as well. In fact, his feelings for her and the devastated, shellshocked look on his face at the end brings to mind that song, or at least the famous line I've heard somewhere, "I loved her but I had to kill her."Lancaster, de Carlo and Duryea were such an electrifying trio that it's a shame the three never made a movie together again (in fact, Lancaster and de Carlo's chemistry was not limited to the screen, the two were lovers during filming). But perhaps it's just as well as it would be a challenge to surpass this example of film-noir excellence. The ending is one of the most stunning and shocking I've seen, and the final shot of Lancaster and de Carlo presents an almost artfully arranged, beautiful but devastatingly tragic tableau. Look for Tony Curtis (looking like a gigolo) as he makes an appearance in a small role as de Carlo's partner during a zesty, lusty rumba. And keep an eye out for the dramatic, stylish, minimalist ensemble Duryea wears in one scene consisting of an all-black suit with a retina-scalding white tie--talk about fashion being way ahead of its time, Duryea sure looks sharp! Fascinating noir, recommended also as a companion piece to "The Killers."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Siodmak and Lancaster (and DeCarlo and Duryea) scale one of the pinnacles of film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Siodmak and Burt Lancaster made beautiful movies together - two of them, anyway (The Crimson Pirate is, as they say, another story). Together, they mark Siodmak's most assured work in film noir - and indispensable titles in the cycle. Siodmak introduced Lancaster to the world in The Killers; three years after that auspicious debut, he starred him again in Criss Cross. With his chiseled face and rugged physique, Lancaster was the embodiment of the all-American pluck that had just won a war and was setting out to assume hegemony of the globe. So Siodmak cast him, again, as a loser.Lancaster returns to his family home in the shabby Bunker Hill section of Los Angeles; he'd been away trying to forget his marriage, which went bad after seven months. But absence made his heart grow fonder, and he thinks of his ex-wife (Yvonne DeCarlo) as a piece of apple core that gets wedged between the teeth and can't be dislodged, even with the cellophane from a pack of smokes. Ah, romance....Lying to himself, he starts hanging around their old joint, The Round Up, hoping to spot her. Neither a ritzy club nor a down-and-out dive, it's a blue-collar night spot divided down the middle, with the bar and phone booth on one side and, on the other, the tables and dance floor. It's there he sees her again, doing a smoldering rhumba with young (and uncredited) Tony Curtis to the insinuating flute warblings of Esy Morales. She's ready to get back together, and so is he, but pride gets in the way; in retaliation, she marries flashy gangster Dan Duryea.But Lancaster and DeCarlo keep bumping against each other, like cellophane and apple core. When Duryea confirms his suspicions by catching them together, Lancaster weasels his way out of a very tight corner by saying he's planning a job for them - knocking over the armored truck company he drives for, with himself as the inside man. He rationalizes his complicity away by thinking he and DeCarlo will abscond with their share of the loot.The brutal heist, filmed in a fog of smoke bombs, goes awry, with lives lost on both sides. Lancaster's arm is smashed, but he winds up acclaimed a hero - if one strung up by pulleys attached to his hospital bed. Only his erstwhile friend, a police lieutenant (Steven McNally) figures out the role Lancaster really played, and disgusted by his thick-headedness, warns that he's not safe from Duryea's henchmen, even while he's recuperating. He's right: Lancaster finds himself being abducted to the oceanside rendezvous where DeCarlo is waiting - and for a final reckoning with Duryea.Siodmak's establishes full command from the movie's first shot - a stunning aerial glide over Los Angeles at night, swooping into the parking lot behind The Round Up where Lancaster and DeCarlo are trysting - to its last, a darkly poetic piet?. Characteristically, he fragments the narrative through flashbacks, counterposing the hopes of Lancaster's return home with the desperation into which he has fallen. He also slows down for virtuosic sequences that only a great director could bring off: a long scene when the heist is being plotted, with the bored DeCarlo smoking cigarettes (`It passes the time') while the Angels Flight funicular railway criss-crosses the window behind her; and an equally long one in the hospital, involving a cranked-up bed, a tilted mirror on the bureau, and a visitor in the corridor - a good Samaritan who turns out to be his worst nightmare.Criss Cross displays almost documentary-style familiarity with the details of post-war life, when prosperity was finally trickling down to working stiffs. Lancaster's sporty duds showed a new, liberated look that would become the standard for men's casual wear for half a century (and counting), and DeCarlo, at the high-water mark of her career, looks as smashing in her slacks and barettes and print dresses as no woman has since. Siodmak catches the excitement of disposable cash in callused hands, but isn't condescending about it; but overzealous love for it, however unaccustomed, is still the root of all evils.Another German expatriate like Siodmak, Franz Planer photographed the movie (and it's probably his finest hour, too). He shoots the armored truck from a vertiginous, almost abstract angle as it invades a huge industrial plant, or savors the shadows hurtling across its hood as it speeds across an ironwork trestle. Nor does the living scenery get short shrift - close-ups of both DeCarlo and Lancaster are voluptuous (and Duryea's especially fearsome).As he was able to do in The Killers, Siodmak keeps the integrity of the script, never lightening the tone or taking refuge in sentimentality. The blend of crime and doomed romance, the tug-of-war between passion and self-interest, finds perfect balance here. Of course, it's the simplest and most infallible recipe for film noir. As DeCarlo says, `Love... love! You've got to watch out for yourself.' If only she'd said it a little sooner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Deal In L.A.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only fitting that Robert Siodmak directed Criss Cross, as he had also directed the film's star, Burt Lancaster, in his first film three years earlier, and this one is Burt's farewell to noir and city suits, as he was about to begin his swashbuckling phase, and after that would don military uniforms and cowboy gear.Criss Cross is basically a "big heist" movie, full of people double crossing one another with alarming frequency, and to such a degree that the story is often hard to follow. Yvonne De Carlo is the love interest, and Dan Duryea is an exceptionally nasty bad guy even for noir. The setting is L.A., and there is much excellent location photography that makes the movie a treat for people who want to see what the city looked like before half of it was bulldozed to make way for the highways.There's nothing startling or especially new about this movie. It has a fine and somewhat eclectic supporting cast which includes Alan Napier and Richard Long, Steve McNally and Percy Helton. As in The Killers, there's a strong air of fatalism in the movie, more oppressive here, with a darker tone, and a more Germanic, almost Langian feeling of hopelessness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.....typical entry for the genre. Dumb hero guy gets tangled up w/ the wrong gal for the wrong reasons, mobsters are hanging around, and there is a heist that winds up blowing everything apart in their lives. I liked how Lancaster played against type and was a 'sap' pretty much. Clearly DeCarlo was the one calling the shots in that pairing. Duryea plays his usual nasty Willem Dafoe/Peter Strauss type villain, and for my money was the most effective actor in the movie. The finale w/ him showing up at their door, well.....it's quite something, very striking.I also was surprised at the violence of the heist itself-gas going off, killings, etc left and right. Considering the laughable lack of security, personnel and etc that these keystone Brinks guys are showing, it's amazing how close the baddies came to not getting a cent for their efforts.Pretty decent cast too-there's Percy Helton as the barkeep, there's Alan Napier, there's Tony Curtis in a cameo, there's you other typical baddies of the day. Nice turn by Steve MacNalley too.Fine movie, bit lax on the plotting I think--but the tone, camera work, and of course DeCarlo-make this a worthy view.*** outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty noir the way I like it...ranks with the best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1940's seedier side of Los Angeles makes a fitting noir background for this highly well made film noir starring BURT LANCASTER as the lovelorn hero foolish enough to go back to his ex-wife (extremely well played by YVONNE DE CARLO) who has taken up with a bunch of hoodlums headed by the sinister DAN DURYEA. True love never does run smooth, especially in this kind of fatalistic melodrama in which we have a hint from the very beginning of a dark conclusion.The fact that Lancaster works for an armored car service is worked into the plot and makes for the movie's most suspenseful and action-filled moments. Some nice support from Stephen McNally as Lancaster's wise friend and Richard Long as his brother. Percy Felton does a standout job as an inquisitive bartender.Robert Siodmak squeezes every bit of suspense as the story builds to a gripping climax. The hospital scene is extremely effective as Lancaster becomes aware of the dangerous situation he's in.Lancaster displays some vulnerability and sensitivity despite his rugged good looks and has one of his best early roles here, even more impressive than he was in THE KILLERS. Miklos Rozsa's superb background score gives a jagged edge to the suspense.Any lover of B&amp;W film noir is guaranteed to find pleasure in this one.Trivia: If you watch real closely, you'll spot the young Tony Curtis as de Carlo's dance partner in the crowded nightclub scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where have you gone Yvonne De Carlo?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flick is a keeper. If you see one film noir from the Forties this should be it. Starring a very young Burt Lancaster, Dan Duryea and the great Yvonne DeCarlo, this dark and shadowy movie shakes the genre to its core. The movie is set in a post-W.W.II Los Angeles when the city was about to burst free and become a Metropolis. Virtually everything we see is gone: trolleys, single-family homes on hills and probably the worst armored car security put on film. (A driver is called away from a run by a suspicious phone call and no supervisor is notified!) The roster of character actors include Alan Napier, Alfred on "Batman," the ever present Percy Helton, and Stephen McNally. Another actor I've seen before has a habit of exclaiming "That's the ticket!" Could this be where Jon Lovitz got his lucrative catch phrase? But the true standout in the film is the exotic and sinfully talented Yvonne DeCarlo. Hollywood never utilized this this lady right. She was always dumped into B-Westerns or costume pics. However, whenever she was given something juicy such as an adult comedy or A-Drama, like this film, she excelled. And if you want to see her belt out a few tunes just check out the pilot episode of "Bonanza" or the ultra cool episode of the "Munsters," where she performs a bluesy number on the harp, you know, the one with the rock band The Standells.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Master Robert Siodmak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While driving an armored car in a lonely road, Steve Thompson (Burt Lancaster) recalls his life, after divorcing his beloved wife Anna (Yvonne De Carlo) and working in many places in the United States of America, from the moment he returned home in Los Angeles a few days ago. Although traveling for almost two years trying to forget Anna, he is still obsessed with her. However, when he arrives in town, the sentimentally inconstant Anna gets married with the gangster Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea). Steve plans a heist of the armored car with Slim, expecting to double-cross the criminal and escaping with Anna to another city to begin a new life, but things do not happen as he intended it was. "Criss Cross" is a magnificent film-noir, indeed another masterpiece of master Robert Siodmak. From the initial long scene, with an aerial view of Los Angeles reaching a spot in a parking area where Steve and Anna are having a conversation, to the conclusion of the story, there is no flaw in the script. Burt Lancaster has an outstanding performance in the role of a honest man obsessed with his former wife, who becomes criminal trying to regain the love of his fickle ex-wife. Yvonne De Carlo is also perfect and very beautiful, in the role of a cold and manipulative woman, being a perfect "femme-fatale". The black and white photography with many shadows is awesome in the DVD released in Brazil by the distributor Classicline, and the music score is simply perfect. In 1995, Steven Soderbergh updated this story with the excellent remake "Underneath". My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Baixeza" ("Lowness')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Thompson, Idealist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In faithful accordance with classic film noir convention (a modus operandi also reminiscent of the Greek tragedies of old), armored truck driver Steve Thompson, protagonist of "Criss Cross", Robert Siodmark's and Burt Lancaster's follow-up to the outstanding "The Killers", brings about his own ruin and demise through two primary tragic flaws, namely hopeless infatuation and unfounded optimism. The object of his affection is his ex-wife Anna, memorably played by the stunning Yvonne De Carlo, whose hubris prompts her to wed sleazy gangster Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea), apparently to spite Steve's detective friend Pete Ramirez (Stephen McNally) for intimidating her the night before. Regrettably I cannot be too sure of this plot point, though, as at the time my attention was solely focused on Miklós Rózsa's wonderfully dark and driving underscore.Naturally a torrid affair ensues between Mr. Thompson and the now-Ms. Dundee, and -- even more naturally -- they are almost immediately caught together by her new husband, which impels Thompson to divert Slim Dundee's attention by unexpectedly suggesting a heist of his armored truck. It remains somewhat unclear whether this is something he'd been planning all along or just an inspired attempt to weasel himself out being killed on the spot, but the gangsters thankfully decide to go along with it. Crosses and double-crosses follow, Anna somehow escapes with the money, lovesick Steve stupidly leads the mobsters to her hideout, and Slim shoots them both in cold blood.Undeniably this summary, either through simplification or omission, paints Steve Thomson as a bit of a nitwit, but although he makes some unbelievably bad choices, they are always well-rooted in his character, which screenwriter Daniel Fuchs (working from a novel by Don Tracy, of "Death Calling Collect" fame) takes great pains to establish in the first third of the story. The real conflict here is one of ideology, Steve being an idealist and Anna being a realist. One Imdb user cites Steve's refusal `to become completely cynical and hard-bitten' as his most admirable feature, likely unaware of the famous H.G. Wells quote that states `A cynic is what an idealist calls a realist.' Steve is more than just a hopeless romantic, he possesses and indefatigable optimism that allows him to rationalize any action not just for the sake of being with Anna, but due to the firm, absolute conviction that they belong together and that nothing will stand in their way. Alas, in film noir love does not necessarily conquer all and, as Anna put it, `you've got to watch out for yourself.'In the end, when taking one of the gangsters to Anna's hideout for a payoff, Steve has obviously abandoned all logical reasoning and is acting on pure, emotion-fueled impulse. He is so blinded by love, so single-mindedly focused on Anna, that he gives no second thought to Slim or the money, certain that his police friends will take care of the matter eventually. In many ways, the traditional gender roles of him and Anna are reversed here. She is the tough, down-to-earth pragmatist struggling for survival; he is the longing, pining fool, willing to sacrifice everything for her love. It is the against-type casting of Burt Lancaster, in other way the blue-collar macho idol of the time, that makes this reversal fascinating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Criss Cross was a blind purchase for me. I really had never read much about it until I decided to give it a try. While I was hoping to be entertained, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it this much. Burt Lancaster has never been a favorite of mine. In fact, other than The Killers, I can't think of another role of his that I've so completely enjoyed. He's wonderful in this movie. As for Yvonne De Carlo, the only other thing I remember seeing her in was the television show "The Munsters". And, while she may not be the greatest actress of all time, she's very good here. I never pictured Lily looking like this. As for Dan Duryea, he's a great baddie. Mannerisms, speech, and the rest of the package just ooze with sleaze. Together, and with the help of an excellent supporting cast, they're great.As for the movie, it's a very entertaining noir with plenty of twists and turns along the way. Lancaster is the kind of man who drinks too much, De Carlo is the kind of woman who uses men to get what she wants, and Duryea is the kind of man who would as soon shoot you as look at you. It's gritty, sometimes violent, and always entertaining. The film is expertly directed by Robert Siodmak, whose work I've always enjoyed. The script is exceptional with more double-crosses in the final half than one movie has a right to. No one is above double-crossing anyone else. It makes for a very entertaining hour and a half. The movie also features a nice look at Los Angeles in the 40s. The scenes of middle-class, single-family neighborhoods are quite different from the city of today.While Criss Cross may not be the best film noir I've seen, I would place it somewhere on a list of my ten favorite noirs. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As I Was Led To Believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film noir fan who read a lot of positive reviews of this film before seeing it, I wound up really disappointed with this after two views. For some reason, the first look wasn't bad but on a further viewing, it really dragged. The reason was simple: it took took long for the "heist" to happen.It turned out to be more of a talk-fest between Burt Lancaster and Yvonne DeCarlo before anything happened.I have nothing against the main actors and their performances. Lancaster, as always, was interesting and DeCarlo is also intriguing, especially for someone like me who grew up knowing her only as "Lily Munster." She had a convincing 1940s film noir look: pretty, sultry and not only looked the part but acted the part well, too. I wish she had done a few more noirs that were available on disc or tape. When you add Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally and others, this should have been better and the middle just went on too long. The beginning and ending are, by far, the best parts of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are three things that stand out as being particularly good about this film - a superb Miklos Rosza score, great black and white photography, and an excellent supporting performance by Percy Helton as a knowledgeable bartender. Other than these aspects though, there is little else to make the film worth watching. It is too slowly paced, and has a dull plot in which a heist plan is meshed in with relationship drama. It is also rather nasty at times, and the flashback narration feels like a forced way of explaining events. Even so, there are still some well done sequences and a number of exciting moments in the final third of the film, which help bring it up to scratch. Overall, it is a pretty typical noir thriller - but with some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film looks great - a classic noir - but the story is dull and predictable. I'm sure this frustrated Robert Siodmak as he can never really make the film fire in the way that he did "The Killers". The other weak link is Yvonne De Carlo, who looks great but is never really convincing. Much better is Burt Lancaster, also looking great, but very convincing as the love-sick fool hero. And the supporting cast of hoods and odd-balls is interesting. Worthwhile, but not great - with an excellent finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual in a movie directed by Robert Siodmark there are striking compositions and some really tense moments in this sombre tale of cross, double-cross and revenge in a botched armored car robbery.Some convincing location scenes give us an authentic look at 1940's Los Angeles.Burt Lancaster more or less reprises his role in THE KILLERS as an honest guy led astray by a beautiful woman. Yvonne DeCarlo doesn't quite hack it as the femme fatale but Siodmark makes the most of her looks and there is a well edited sequence of her dancing in a night club. (An un-billed Tony Curtis is her partner).Minor characters, the hoods, bartenders etc are well cast and there are good performances by those two stalwarts of 1940's movies Stephen Mcnally and Dan Duryea.The story line is rather ragged and there are a few plot loop holes but the action when it comes is well handled.Doesn't rank with THE KILLERS but it's an interesting look at a heist movie before they became cliches. You can see harbingers of future similar movies like THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, THE KILLING, RIFIFI etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criss Cross is directed by Robert Siodmak and adapted by Daniel Fuchs from Don Tracy's novel. It stars Burt Lancaster, Yvonne de Carlo, Dan Duryea and Stephen McNally. Music is scored by Miklós Rózsa and cinematography is by Franz Planer.Steve Thompson (Lancaster) and old flame Anna (de Carlo) begin to rekindle their love, much to the dismay of those closest to Steve. She's now unhappily married to mobster Slim Dundee (Duryea), they plan to run away together but Slim is apparently getting wise to their affair. When the two are caught together by Slim, Steve quickly concocts a story that they were plotting an armoured-truck robbery that he wants Dundee to be involved in. Slim notes it's near impossible, but with Steve working for the armoured-truck company it opens the way for inside man possibilities. It deviates suspicion on the lovers, but this is only the start of their problems, for nothing is as it seems.Criss Cross has come to be a favourite of many a film noir purist, a picture often held forward as one of the shining lights of the 1940's noir universe. But it so easily could have been so different given that the film's original producer, Mark Hellinger, suddenly died of a heart attack. The film under Hellinger's guidance was to be based around a racetrack heist, but with Hellinger's passing the project dropped into limbo and was sold off to Universal along with Lancaster and Siodmak as part of the deal. Although Lancaster was unhappy with the rewritten plot, his relationship with Siodmak had already been cemented three years earlier when they made The Killers, another of film noir's greatest triumphs. For Criss Cross, Siodmak, Fuchs and producer Michael Kraike took Tracy's novel and combined it with elements of The Killers (an Ernest Hemmingway short story). Ava Gardner wasn't on hand to reprise her Killers femme fatale performance, while Shelley Winters was considered but not offered the role that eventually went to de Carlo, who had worked with Lancaster previously on tough as nails prison movie, Brute Force (1947). Rounding out the link between the three protagonists comes with Duryea, he and de Carlo had made Black Bart &amp; River Lady in 1948.Alls well that ends well, figuratively speaking, because Criss Cross is a superb movie, one that begs to be re-watched whenever possible. All the classic traits of film noir are evident, both technically and narratively. The film begins with a portentous swirl of music from Rózsa, which in turn leads us into a dramatic aerial view of night time Los Angeles. From there we descend towards a parking lot and become witness to an illicit romance between Steve &amp; Anna. At the film's finale we again will be the only witness' to their coupling, only this time it has a kicker, out shot being that Criss Cross is bookended by sheer brilliance. Obsession, betrayal and inescapable fate pervade the narrative from the moment we the audience are clued in to the history of Steve, Anna and Slim. As the tale unfolds in flashback there is a constant sense of feverish doom lingering in the air, aided considerably by Planer's evocative lighting set-ups and Siodmak's wonderful gliding camera and clinical framing compositions of the characters. Even the perky action high point of the robbery comes laced with smoggy gloom, the chaotic sequence only serving as a precursor to the present, where a hospital and a mirror shift us tonally back to the world of unease. And then the finale, one of the most bleakest, and therefore essential, ending in film noir history.Cast are excellent, Lancaster, all square jawed and square shouldered, plays obsessed loser better than most, thanks in no small part to Siodmak's direction of him. Duryea does what he does best, playing a villain with oily verve and smirky menace, while de Carlo looks great and offers up a nice blend of sweet and rough, a different kind of femme fatale, the actress earning her acting stripes during "that" finale. In the main support slot, McNally impacts well with what he's given to do, and there's good value in the criminal ranks where Alan Napier lurks as the mastermind behind the robbery. Look out. Too, for Tony Curtis, who is seen in a cameo dancing seductively with de Carlo at the Round-Up Bar. Also worth mentioning are the Los Angeles locales used for the shoot, mostly at night we get Bunker Hill, Angels Flight and Union Station. It's sad to report that Bunker Hill, a favourite spot for noir directors, was raised to the ground in the 60'sAn obvious bedfellow to The Killers for sure, but even on its own terms it's essential film noir viewing for those of that persuasion. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above Average But Predictable Crime Noir Bolstered by a Top-Notch Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yvonne De Carlo smolders as a sultry femme fatale who juggles both fall guy Burt Lancaster and bad guy Dan Duryea in "Son of Dracula" director Robert Siodmak's "Criss Cross," an above-average but predictable exercise in film noir that boasts gloomy atmosphere, a gritty urban environment, and solid performances. Burt Lancaster gives an exceptional performance as the vulnerable protagonist who cannot conceal his sentiments about the De Carlo character from anybody, even the supporting characters. Speaking of supporting characters, "Criss Cross" boasts its share and they take an active part in the proceedings. Percy Helton as a bartender, Alan Napier as a crime planner, Joan Minor as the lush, Griff Barrett as Pop, and Tom Pedi as Dundee's accomplice all contribute memorably to the action.Although the film noir elements aren't as oppressive as in Siodmak's earlier and superior collaboration with Lancaster on "The Killers," "Criss Cross" is unmistakably noir. For example, a larger number of scenes in "Criss Cross" take place during the day rather than at night. Siodmak never wears out his welcome here and the use of an extended flashback 14 minutes into the action that takes us back for important exposition is expertly integrated into the narrative. Siodmak stages the action nimbly without lingering unduly on anybody or anything. A Dresden-born German, Siodmak is a highly underrated helmer who has never received the well-deserved recognition accorded Fritz Lang. Mind you, Siodmak doesn't have Lang's cinematic flair with staging scenes, but his films are nevertheless robust.Scenarist Daniel Fuchs, who later won an Oscar for "Love Me or Leave Me" (1955), based his screenplay on Don Tracy's crime novel with tough guy dialogue and continuity supplemented by William Bowers that emphasizes the theme of fatalism so essential to film noir. Moreover, Fuchs received an Edgar nomination for his "Criss Cross" script. Everybody in "Criss Cross" is destined to lose in some way or another. Lancaster's doomed character, however, suffers the greatest anguish by comparison. De Carlo's siren is second in line. Surprisingly, Fuchs and Siodmak generate more tension among their scheming principals in the first half of the action than they do with the gripping armored truck heist in broad daylight during the second half of the movie. Interestingly, the police don't figure prominently in "Criss Cross, though they hover on the periphery in the form of Lieutenant Frank Ramirez. The heist is still pretty engrossing material from its carefully planned stages to its skillful execution.The production values of "Criss Cross" look first-rate. Universal doesn't appear to have confined either Siodmak or the film--despite its B-movie subject matter?to claustrophobic studio sets. The armored truck set looks terrific, particularly when they load the truck up and leave with a tilting high angle shot that shows them exiting the building. "Champion" cinematographer Frank (later Franz) Planer's evocative black &amp; white photography is a considerable asset. Planer's location lensing is top-notch in several scenes, especially the multi-layered Round Up Bar and later at the factory where the heist occurs. Planer does an exceptional job of photographing the Lancaster character after he winds up in the hospital with his arm in traction. An interesting slice-of-life moment occurs early in the movie during a conversation between two employees at the armored truck firm when they discuss about the competitive price of two grocery stores and how one store undercuts the other with their prices o soap and tomato juice that enhances the 1949 setting."Criss Cross" starts out suspensefully as we learn that Anna (Yvonne De Carlo of "Brute Force") and Steve Thompson (Burt Lancaster of "Elmer Gantry") are hiding in the parking lot of the nightclub called The Round Up where they are necking. The story unfolds chronologically to begin with because Anna is married to notorious gangster Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea of "Black Bart") who is looking for her at that very moment inside the Round Up. Dundee gives Anna the third degree later when she comes back inside about what she was doing. Steve cautions her earlier that they must be discreet or they could blow the entire set-up. Later, Steve enters the Round Up to gate crash on Dundee's party. You see, Dundee and company plan to relocate to Detroit and he is giving a farewell party. Los Angeles Police Detective Lieutenant Pete Ramirez (Stephen McNally of "Winchester '73") tries to dissuade Steve from butting in where he hasn't been invited. Steve blows him off and moments later Ramirez gate crashes the party himself after Dundee has pulled a knife on Steve. Ramirez is Steve's friend, though we never know the basis of their back and forth relationship. Whenever Steve calls Ramirez 'lieutenant,' Ramirez has him call him 'Pete.' When Ramirez is all business because Steve has crossed the line, he makes Steve call him 'lieutenant.' Steve drives an armored truck and Dundee and his henchmen plan to rob the armored track company that employs Steve. Sure, "Criss Cross" has the stock-in-trade message that 'crime doesn't pay' and it is emphasized by everybody but the optimistic Steve. Initially, an armored truck official brags, "Nobody ever got away with the heist on an armored truck in 28-years. Matter of fact, they don't even try any more." Later, Finchley (Alan Napier, who played Alfred the Butler on TV's "Batman") objects to the robbery because they always end in failure until he listens to Steve's inside idea. Vincent (Tom Pedi of "The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three") raves about the interjection from another henchman that everybody on that robbery wound up dead or in the chair.Siodmak and Planer do a good job staging the heist. The criminals set off smoke bombs so that everything takes place in a kind of limbo with Steve trying to thwart the robbery after shooting breaks out that he didn't want. The paranoia in the hospital scenes where Steve feels trapped is gripping as is the ill-fated ending that Anna and Steve meet at Dundee's hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obsession, Betrayal &amp; The Hand Of Fate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Criss Cross" is a well made movie about a gullible guy who's obsessed with the past and his ex-wife. Having tried to heal his obsession by leaving Los Angeles for a period of time, he decides to return home and deludes himself that he's simply returning to be with his family, when in fact everyone around him knows the real reason for his return. His decision to come back to L.A. and his past is a dreadful mistake which ultimately seals his fate.Steve Thompson (Burt Lancaster) starts to frequent "The Round Up", a bar where he and his ex-wife Anna (Yvonne DeCarlo) used to hang out and when they meet up again, they rekindle their relationship. This exasperates his mother and his old friend Detective Lieutenant Pete Ramirez (Stephen McNally). They both know that Anna is not to be trusted and Pete is also aware that a local gangster called Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea) is infatuated with her.Anna is very materialistic and marries Slim because he's wealthy. Steve is very hurt but when he meets her some time later, she tells him that she's unhappy in her marriage and that her new husband beats her. She also says that she married Slim because Pete had threatened to arrest her if she didn't stop seeing Steve. Predictably, the couple then resume their affair.A little time later, Anna calls at Steve's home to tell him that Slim knows about their affair and almost immediately after, Slim and some of his gang have also entered his house. In a hurried attempt to justify why he and Anna had been alone together, Steve explains that he's planning an armoured car robbery and that he needs Slim's help to carry it out. Steve works as a driver for the armoured car company and suggests that he could be the gang's "inside man".When arrangements are made for the robbery to go ahead, Steve and Anna plan to double cross Slim but Slim also plans a double cross of his own.Director Robert Siodmak had collaborated previously with Burt Lancaster in the making of "The Killers" and their work together on "Criss Cross" produced another high quality crime drama in which Siodmak's influence is in strong evidence. The opening sequence which begins with an aerial shot of the city at night and eventually closes in on the guilty looking couple is very impressive as is the staging of the robbery and there's also a spectacularly high overhead shot of the armoured vehicle approaching the scene of the crime which is truly unforgettable."Criss Cross" is essentially about a heist, a dangerous love triangle, obsession, betrayal and a number of double crosses. With very good performances from its talented cast, it also has a consistently ominous atmosphere and is profoundly fatalistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, that woman is BAD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yvonne DeCarlo sure plays a heck of a femme fatale in this film! And, she's a heck of a lot sexier than when she played Lily Munster! It seems that she was married to a poor sap (Burt Lancaster) but they've since divorced. However, he has it bad for her...and she is beginning to show signs that she might like to marry him all over again. So his hopes raise quickly---only to be dashed when she suddenly runs off with a hood (Dan Duryea--who almost ALWAYS played bad guys). Yet, oddly, despite this, she STILL has her claws in him and is able to manipulate him into being the inside man for an armored car robbery--as he's one of the crew of the truck. Things, however, don't go as you'd expect...see this excellent film to see what happens next.Considering the film has great baddies and a taut script, it's one of the better examples of film noir--true film noir with the perfect dame, great dialog, wonderful camera work--the whole shebang!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good solid noir, with Burt Lancaster possibly running a little below best but Yvonne DeCarlo as the supreme femme fatale is in stomping form and more than makes up for any lapses from others. Gets going immediately and the aerial shot makes us well aware that this is going to be a beautifully shot movie, which it certainly is. Really great camera movement, especially during a stunning dance sequence, that includes an unaccredited Tony Curtis, and the heist itself with the surprising element designed to catch out Mr Lancaster. Good all the way through and if Lancaster sometimes appears a little lame it is probably because of the sheer ruthlessness of Dan Duryea as the chief baddie and the aforementioned DeCarlo who seems to be able to run rings round them all. Oh and what an ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep on Running Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Robert Siodmak-directed noir deserves closer attention. It's an excellent film that is much, much more than a re-hash of his 1946 noir masterpiece "The Killers". Granted, the plot involves a heist, director Siodmak is back on board and Lancaster again plays a big lug who dangerously falls for a sexy femme fatale and gets mixed up in a payroll heist, but it's deep, dark and tragic. Yvonne De Carlo's Anna is one of the more sympathetic of femme fatales, and as mentioned in some literature, her relationship with Lancaster is more romantic and complex, sort of "Romeo &amp; Juliet", than first envisaged.De Carlo is Lancaster's beautiful ex-wife, now married to shady gangster Slim Dundee (the always interesting, always menacing Dan Duryea). Lancaster's Steve Thompson, an armored car driver, is constantly urged by friends and family to stay away from her, but he looks for her every time. In voice-over, Lancaster muses on the workings of fate that always seem to drive him and Anna back together. But Siodmak shows us that Lancaster is a very active participant in his own destiny. He fools himself that it is fate-- in reality, he can't live without her. And it is that way too with De Carlo. Anna is a realist while Steve is an idealist. He stupidly believes that, after the bungled payroll heist, and he is kidnapped by one of Slim's henchman from the hospital, that the henchman won't give the money that Steve has bribed him with to take him to Anna, back to Slim. She flies off the handle and packs to leave, knowing that if Slim finds her he will kill both of them. But he is strangely at peace with coming death, because Steve is doomed with or without her. Steve is not the only one who keeps running back to their love--in the tragic, but cathartic, final scene Anna runs back to Steve as Slim pulls the gun to kill him. They die in each other's arms. Slim is also hopelessly in love with Anna, and he can't live without her either. Killing her because he can't have her, he also seals his own fate as the police arrive at the hideout.Aside from the complex emotions dealt with in this great noir, it is also quite excellent on a technical level. Siodmak handles a tricky flashback with ease, helped immeasurably by Franz Planer's excellent black-and-white photography, There is a brilliant overhead shot as Lancaster's armored car sets up for the failed heist. The hospital scenes, with an injured Lancaster fearing that Duryea will send henchman to kill him, is filled with nail-biting suspense. Francis Ford Coppola might have borrowed a trick or two from Siodmak in adapting the famed hospital scene in "The Godfather" to the screen. Lancaster does very good work in a role that, on surface, he would seem to be miscast in. Instead he excels. Stephen McNally actually plays the good guy for once, but he's nowhere near as attention-grabbing as in his other films. Watch for Tony Curtis as De Carlo's dance partner in a sexy rumba dance scene!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After repeated exposure, Criss Cross emerges as essential noir viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many viewers I was initially disappointed by Criss Cross. Some have claimed it to be a poor imitation of Lancaster's debut in "The Killers" but after repeated screenings I find that my appreciation increases with each viewing. The rather direct flashback plotting, the excellent supporting work of Dan Duryea and the whole stable of Universal bit players contribute to a delightful film noir experience. It does lack the irony and richness of story of "The Killers" and can't compare to "Out Of The Past" but the dynamic between Lancaster and DeCarlo ranks as some of the best interplay in the genre, even if a bit one dimensional.If you are new to the genre, Criss Cross is not a first choice. But as you work your way through the cycle this film represents one of the high points of the studio systems addressing this film-making trend with non of the drawbacks often associated with "B" films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just edgy and unsual and visual enough to be perfect on its own terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Criss Cross (1949)A dramatic, classic noir that is also a heist film and a doomed romance. Director Robert Siodmak knew exactly how to make this fast, complex, and still intelligible. It's a brilliant direction job, and on a so-so budget. The scenes of L.A. are worth the time alone, and the cleverness of the plot. There are also a couple times in the bar when music is playing, and the camera and director take the time to really show it, especially the flute and piano player. These are all member of the real Esy Morales and his Rhumba Band, with Morales on flute. They are great scenes and all too brief. In fact, the whole ambiance of this club is one of the key attractions to the movie.Yvonne De Carlo is a lesser known actress but she is spot on perfect here, both compelling and cold in turns. Dan Duryea is his usual snide, witty self, a joy in any movie. And Burt Lancaster manages to show a tender side as well has his more usual hardened and principled side. The three of them anchor the movie and make a great trio.There are some famous tidbits to look for, like the opening shot (through the credits) which is a helicopter shot at night coming into the city, probably the first of its kind. And later in the film Lancaster asks whether they have ever thought about protecting their armored cards from a heist from a helicopter, a nice subtle tie in. The gas mask scenes and the explosions are pretty dramatic and allow for a wonderful amount of confusion--you can't see who is who at all. The moving camera is often used for visceral effects, moving through rooms or attached to a car. But one great scene has Lancaster cranked up higher in a hospital bed, and the camera shows his subjective view changing as he is looking in a mirror. There is an interesting brief and very intentional early foreshadowing of this when Lancaster and De Carlo are making out in the parking lot. Twice De Carlo looks right into the camera, as if looking into Lancaster's eyes. This sets up early that our protagonist is Lancaster. Nice stuff.It's just a romantic, great, moody, dramatic, unusual film. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster and Yvonne DeCarlo are great in the Robert Siodmak film that helps define film noir. Lancaster is riveting in the role of the guy who comes back home to try and pick up his life while DeCarlo reminds me of Catherine Zeta-Jones as the object of his affection. Dan Duryea, one of the great film noir players, is the bad guy and there's a wonderful cast of players who fill out this drama including Steve McNally as Burt's cop brother and Percy Helton as the bartender. Tom Pedi is great as Vincent, one of the gang, and let's not forget Alan Napier later to play Alfred on TV's "Batman. There's also a great musical interlude from flute player Esy Morales and his orchestra during a scene when Yvonne is dancing up a storm. I missed them but maybe you'll notice Raymond Burr and Tony Curtis in bit parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, you've seen it all before: the snarling villain (Dan Duryea), the black widow babe (Yvonne DeCarlo), and the hapless fall guy who just can't help himself (Burt Lancaster). But this is vintage noir from the golden age, done with real style and conviction. What stays with me are those scenes that have since worked their way into the textbook. There's the nightclub scene, where Lancaster gazes longingly at lost love DeCarlo, while she sambas with new honey boy Tony Curtis. Meanwhile there's this pulsating Latin beat that keeps going and going and everybody's shaking it except poor Lancaster. You feel the doom in the air and know this has to end badly. Then there's that nervous scene in the hospital where Lancaster's all laid up. But who's this new guy. He looks like Joe Average, but is he. Director Siodmak really knows how to shift gears and make these quiet moments creepy. Everybody's been waiting for the robbery, but it seems like a cloudy dream, the kind you only half remember and wish you could forget. Ghostly figures drift in and out of focus, yet which one's Lancaster and who's got the money. Hollywood's fog machines were really working overtime on this one. Of course, it all leads up to the final scene, which is about as good as noir gets. The moment of reckoning when everything comes together, this time with a good view of eternity and in the moonlight, no less. The feeling that it all had to happen from the beginning is so thick you can cut it with the proverbial knife.Sure, the D-cup DeCarlo's not quite up to the acting challenge, and the great Duryea doesn't get enough scenes, but consider the screen time given to two deserving foot soldiers of the golden era. Once you've seen him, you never forget him: that raspy-voiced gnome Percy Helton as the bartender. There's been no one like him before or since, a sly little troll who's escaped from the pages of Grimm's Fairy Tales. Yet I've never seen him give anything less than an A-grade performance that lifted many a B-movie above the forgettable. On the other hand, there's the completely ordinary Robert Osterloh as the mysterious stranger. His face is sort of familiar. Maybe he's the guy who fixes your car or fills your prescription or on a really bad night, shoves a gun in your gut. But like Helton, he too never gave anything less than an expert performance. Too bad his little Hollywood star never glowed, but he sure made a lot of others brighter than they were.It's all there and in the kind of irreplaceable black and white that Hollywood's been trying to remake in Technicolor for years. So catch up with this original and find out why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve Thompson returns to Los Angeles after eight months of roaming around the country trying to forget his painful divorce from sultry Anna. He finds a changed city, but a trip to a night club brings him again in close contact with a woman he should have been better off by staying away from. Anna, now married to Slim Dundee, a gangster operating in the city. She cannot resist the idea of two timing her present man when she meets Steve again.Thompson, who has gone back to work as a driver for a security company, has no idea about how his life will change because of the fatal obsession he develops following Anna around town. As the two are surprised by Slim in his house, Steve, trying to get out of the situation, tells Dundee he has come with an offer he cannot refuse. He has the perfect solution about the perfect caper.The 1949 Universal film, directed by Robert Siomak, one of the best men that worked in the noir genre, is a film that will not disappoint the viewer because it has the right ingredients going for it. The screenplay is by Daniel Fuchs, based on a novel by Don Tracy. The material was the right one for Mr. Siomak, who must have seen the potential in a movie that embodied all the elements that made this type of pictures a favorite of audiences. The amazing black and white cinematography by Franz Planer contributes to our enjoyment, as well as the music score by Miklos Rosza, that adds another layer in the texture of the finished product.Burt Lancaster was at the height of his career. Having worked with Mr. Siomak in "The Killers", he probably felt this was the right vehicle, as he gives a subdued performance of the obsessed Steve Thompson. Yvonne DeCarlo plays the treacherous Anna with equal passion. Ms. DeCarlo always brought a sexual allure to most of the work she did, as it is the case of her Anna. Bad guy Dan Duryea specialized in the type he was asked to play, again, and again. He is a laconic Slim, who does not appreciate being double crossed by either Anna, or Steve.The supporting casts in most of the Hollywood films of that era were a joy to watch, no matter in what film they were called to grace with their appearances. Thus we watch a young Tony Curtis, uncredited, dancing a rumba with Ms. DeCarlo. We also spotted Raymond Burr in a minor role. Stephen McNally is seen as a good guy, a change of pace for the characters he played in most films. Richard Long, John Doucette, and an effective Robert Osterloh, without credit in the film, do a good job for the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster in this film reminds me of the Billy Joel song "Stiletto": "But you stand there pleadin'/With your insides bleedin'/'Cause deep down you want some more..." Like a lot of noir protagonists, he deserves it. My problem with "Criss Cross" is I never cared.Is Steve just a sap, or is he a jerk? A lot depends on what is in the heart of the center of his affections, his ex-wife Anna (Yvonne De Carlo). When Steve returns to the old neighborhood after a long absence, Anna draws herself to him, then pulls away and marries a local crime boss just as Steve begins to respond. Then she reaches out to Steve again. If only they had money to get away. Did I mention Steve works as an armored-car guard, delivering bags of money?De Carlo was a beautiful actress who didn't get the right parts, and that includes this. Is Anna genuinely conflicted, or just a tramp? Daniel Fuchs' script shortcuts the need for character depth by writing Anna both ways, and not expecting us to notice. The convenience of Steve's job also grates, as well as the film's flashback-dependent structure and logic-defying conclusion.I understand why others regard this film more highly than me. Lancaster is a classic film star who looks marvelous here. Director Robert Siodmak, who collaborated so well with Lancaster in the earlier noir "The Killers", employs interesting angles and textures to communicate a visual freshness unusual for early postwar cinema. Dan Duryea is a sleek and sturdy villain with a refreshingly snide sense of humor.Three sequences are standouts. One, taking place in a hospital, dramatizes the adage: "Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you." Another involves planning a big heist, with Anna and Steve's smoldering relationship as subtext and suspense point. "You're going to need a cover story" Duryea's Slim Dundee is told, and thus distracted from watching his wife and her ex-husband a moment longer than he should.Finally, the heist itself is well shot, a boldly paced shootout with layers of tear gas substituting for the fog you get in other noir films. But "Criss Cross" is not at its heart a heist film but a love-gone-wrong film, and that's what goes wrong here.Okay, Steve's a lunkhead, and his core issue: "He's divorced, but he's still got her in his bones" is one a lot of guys can identify with, but other than looking great together, Lancaster and De Carlo give us no reason to see what Steve sees, why he betrays family and friends. If De Carlo had more ambiguity to play with, that might have been effective, but here it's just that she's one person one moment, another the next.Too often we idle around Steve's mother's house or a bar where Steve is pestered by a well-meaning cop friend, who's got it all figured out but can't seem to do a thing to protect Steve. Expositional dialogue runs amuck, which shouldn't happen in a movie loaded with flashback. The crooks even discuss their heist plans loudly in an alley behind the bar where they could be overheard by anyone, just to fill us in.Siodmak has an eye for real-life detail a lot of people respond to, but this time, unlike "The Killers", he only has half a story and a psychosis to work with. "Criss Cross" has a classic noir title but it's almost too apt here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CRISS CROSS (Robert Siodmak, 1949) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically an inferior rehash of THE KILLERS (1946) by the same director and star, but a solid enough noir entry on its own; it was remade, much later, by Steven Soderbergh as THE UNDERNEATH (1995).Burt Lancaster has the same role of the 'chump', Stephen McNally is the cop too eager to look out for him, Dan Duryea is remarkable standing in for Albert Dekker as the jealous crime boss, but Yvonne De Carlo isn't fatale enough ? she merely comes across as someone who can't make up her own mind whether it's love she wants or money! Tony Curtis made his film debut here as De Carlo's dance partner in a club sequence; he would eventually co-star with Lancaster in the circus drama TRAPEZE (1956) and, most impressively, a superior noir-ish effort ? the cynical masterpiece SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS (1957).Miklos Rozsa's score here is quite similar to that of BRUTE FORCE (1947), another noir featuring Lancaster ? but, then, this particular composer's work always seemed to provide variations on the same theme (of course, depending on the genre). The highlight of the film, as was the case with THE KILLERS, is undeniably the elaborate heist sequence; the aprupt downbeat ending, then, is typical of the more doom-laden examples of the noir style.</fullReview>

SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper get back to Dundee so fast and Dundee shows up at the house in a matter of two minutes? Way out of wack here. How did Anna get hold of the money? No explanation at all. If the Pete the cop knew Lancaster was in danger, why didn't he have a cop at the door in the Hospital. This and many more questions remain. Too bad because the premise was there, just bad writing and execution.Good cast is wasted here. DeCarlo goes from bad to good to bad? Lancaster's character lacks development and Dureya is just blah as the "bad guy".This could re-made with a cohesive story line and better writing. Of course it would be much more violent with lots of gratuitous sex and everything. The editing would be jerky as well I guess, so let's leave well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lancaster miscast in this overrated heist noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would Burt Lancaster allow himself to play a poor schnook who is ultimately undermined by femme fatale Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo in 'Criss Cross'? The same reason why Robert Mitchum allows himself to be cast as another loser who falls for femme fatale Faith Domergue in the 1950 noir, "Where Danger Lives". Perhaps they both felt it was a good way to show that they had 'range' as actors?that playing against type, the usual 'tough-guy' role they were known for, would enhance their image as actors who could play any role. But the problem was that roles like Steve Thompson, the pathetic love-sick milquetoast in 'Criss Cross', did nothing to enhance Lancaster's career. Not only is Lancaster completely miscast in the one-note role of Thompson, but there's something inherently unlikeable (and may I say, pathetic) about the film's protagonist in the first place.'Criss Cross' is an interminably slow-moving film. Among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is at the beginning: the flashback which chronicles Thompson's confrontation with Dan Duryea's Dundee at the nightclub. Everything that occurs in that initial flashback is explained later in the picture: the illicit affair between Steve and Anna, Steve's strained relationship with Martinez the cop and his bad blood with Dundee. If Director Siodmark felt compelled to begin the film with a flashback, why not keep it under three minutes? I think it would have been more effective.In 'Criss Cross', it takes quite awhile before the protagonist commits himself and steps out of the 'ordinary' world of Act One. That's the scene where he's "passing by' and 'runs into' Anna at the nightclub. And notice how Siodmak spends so much time cutting back and forth between Anna dancing and Steve staring at her? In addition to the cross-cutting, he also spends a great deal of time focusing on Esy Morales and His Rhumba Band than moving the story along.Up until the crisis of Act Two, the story plods along with Thompson having various uneasy encounters with Anna and then drowning his sorrows at his usual watering hole. At the midpoint of Act Two, he learns that Anna has run off and gotten married to Dundee. It's becoming more clear at this point that one of the film's central weaknesses is that Dundee is never on screen throughout most of the second act. There are no confrontations between Thompson and Dundee during this time and we're left with the rather unexciting machinations between the two lovebirds. As it turns out (and Anna 'explains' this later to Steve), the reason why she left was not only because he disappeared for eight months but she also felt pressure from Steve's mother as well direct threats from Martinez the cop who implied that he would see to it that she ended up in the Women's House of Detention. Anna goes back to Steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with Dundee?it turns out that he's been beating her and she's now scared of him.One of the silly refrains uttered by more than one character in Criss Cross is that you can never hijack an armored car. But everyone acts so surprised when Steve points out it can be done if it's an 'inside job'! You would have thought that Dundee would have known about Steve's 'profession' as an armored car driver and propositioned him beforehand. But of course Steve needs to make the proposal so that Dundee won't kill him after discovering his affair with Anna (if they're so afraid at getting caught, why do Steve and Anna meet at his apartment where Dundee can so easily find them?). I really got a kick out of Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the 'brains' of the operation. Dundee is so dumb that he has to hire this alcoholic ex-professor type who plots out the heist on a map. Oh there is the matter of procuring the ingredients to construct the gas bombs used during the robbery and of course Finchley is good at that too!The only really well done scene in the entire film is the armored car robbery. The editing was quite good as it depicted the rising action of a heist gone bad. As the gas bombs go off, the brutality of the gang is shown in high relief when Dundee murders the innocent Armored Car Guard.The climax of the film is as drawn out as the rest of the film. Why does it take so long for one of Dundee's goons to kidnap Thompson? There's that nurse, then the goon is waiting outside, then he comes in and pretends that he's a friend, Steve falls asleep and finally after he awakes, the goon kidnaps him.When Steve finally meets up with Anna at the house, we wonder how Anna got her hands on the cash. Did she somehow steal it from Dundee after the heist when he went out to dinner? It's never explained. Even worse, Anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale out of the blue. Before, her selfishness and attraction to Dundee can be explained by her perceived rejection at the hands of Steve and Martinez's threats. But after going back to Steve because she fears Dundee, she inexplicably turns on him when he is most vulnerable. Just as there is 'instant coffee', you have 'instant femme fatale'.In "Film Noir?An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style" by Silver and Ward, the authors hail 'Criss by Cross' as "one of the most tragic and compelling of film noir". I beg to differ. In order to have tragedy you need characters that have great depth and in order to be compelling you need a story that's plausible. Criss Cross has neither. It's an overrated "B Movie" that somehow has found itself in the pantheon of art house noirs. Once again, the herd mentality has triumphed in evaluating the pictures of yesteryear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, Yvonne De Carlo really managed to pull it off here. For the entire picture you believe Anna Dundee is in love with Burt Lancaster's character Steve Thompson. Then, when Steve shows up at Palos Verdes, she throws him over in favor of the stolen loot from the Bliss Company payroll heist. What a low down, dirty, double dealing dame.But then again, that's what cool film noir is all about. Like many viewers who only ever saw De Carlo as Lily Munster, this was an eye opener. She looked sultry and seductive and had a way of wrapping Steve right around her little finger, even with gangster Steve Dundee (Dan Duryea) in the same room. Told in limited flashback style, the picture catches the viewer up to real time about half way through, at which point Steve makes his out of left field proposal to play inside man on the armored truck heist. Man, this guy was so blinded by love/lust he couldn't get out of his own way.You know, I couldn't get over the conversation between a couple of Herton security guards when they began discussing their wives' shopping habits. I realize it's all relative, but could it really have broken the guy's budget to buy the soap powder for forty three cents instead of thirty seven at the Great Western? Or the couple cans of tomato juice for a quarter and save another six cents there? Boy, it really makes you think how things were, going back a half dozen decades.This one ought to appeal to fans of film noir and gangster flicks, but you will have to pay attention. The business with the hood at the hospital looking in on Steve was a clever hook. For a while I couldn't figure why he would have been there on the pretext that his wife had an accident, but heck, lying would have been part of his repertoire. Same thing with Anna having the money from the hold-up, but during the planning, all the participants agreed that she would pay off the split with Steve. That's probably the one concession you have to make to suspending disbelief; knowing Slim Dundee, why would he agree to that knowing his wife's past with Steve.Keep a sharp eye out during the scene with the rhumba band. Dancing with Anna is a sharply dressed Latin looking guy who turns out to be Tony Curtis. Don't blink or you'll miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times the plot got a little hard to follow, but at least it held my attention. I don't think there's anything special about the film,but its definitely not a bad one overall. Entertaining to see how the characters cross one another(hence the title) is somewhat suspenseful enough to make you wonder what is going to happen next. Was very interesting to see the female role kind of take on the lead as head bad guy and mastermind, which i would think would be very uncommon in films of that time. Anna, the female character, was extremely manipulative. It seemed to me that all she cared about was money. You actually come to feel bad for steve, because hes really just a man in love. One scene that was all too real for me and kind of freaked me out, the couple is running through a meat packing plant. And there's like cows, and parts of cows hanging everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of this film before I saw it in class. I probably never would have seen it. Burt Lancaster is a great actor, he's great in this movie. I can seriously watch this guy in anything, he's terrific. This film has a solid noir plot, its dark as hell. The camera work is excellent, everything is very moody and dark. Lots of shadows obscuring acts of violence or characters faces. The film has a very mysterious tone to it. It has an intense flow to it, lots of unexpected moments pop out and hit you in the face. My only complaint has to be the guy who plays Lancasters rival, he's very irritating and annoying. I wanted to punch him in the face anytime I saw him, but I guess that worked because you really weren't supposed to like him. Still he just irked me. This is a very good film, I'd suggest anyone who likes their films dark to check this flick out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice noir package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, thanks to regular commenter Neil Doyle for confirming my suspicion that I did actually see a very young Tony Curtis on the dance floor in this film.This is a very tidy little movie, pretty gritty and very intense in its action scenes. Burt Lancaster stars as Steve, a guy who's willing to give up way too much to get back together with his ex-wife Anna (Yvonne De Carlo) even though she's taken up with a sadistic hoodlum (Dan Duryea). Duryea seemed to specialize in small-time guys who carry their nasty world-views on their sleeves, and he adds a lot to this movie although I wish maybe there was just a bit more of him. A few more scenes with Duryea and a few less with the moralizing cop friend (Stephen McNally) would have helped. But this film motors very efficiently towards its dark conclusion at any rate.The real set-piece is a big caper, so you could look at this movie as a heist film. Everything builds up to the heist by way of a flashback; Steve works for an armored car company and he's set up a heist with Duryea's character, Slim Dundee. There's nothing very original in the set-up, and it's not hard to see the double-double cross coming. But it's thoroughly enjoyable because of Siodmak's tight direction, Miklos Rozsa's subtle score, and quality performances from all 3 leads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An honest armored-car driver is suckered into a robbery plan, thanks to a soft spot for his ex-wife. Lancaster has the kind of role that was typical of his early career, as a tough guy who can't keep away from De Carlo. And who can blame him? De Carlo is extremely alluring as the femme fatale, a far cry from Lily Munster. Duryea once again plays the kind of sleazy character that became his trademark during the 1940s. Tony Curtis has a bit role as a dancer. Noted film noir director Siodmak tautly keeps the story moving at an efficient pace. The plot has some holes and some of the situations are not at all plausible but it's still fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Fans Of Burt Lancaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar in theme, tone, and noir visuals to "The Asphalt Jungle" (1950), "Criss Cross" is your typical 1940's bad guy movie, that centers on a love triangle involving two hoodlums and a floozy. The two guys are Steve (Burt Lancaster) and Slim (Dan Duryea). The gal who comes between them is Anna (Yvonne De Carlo). An armed robbery also figures into the story and complicates the interactions between these three people. The film is set in Los Angeles.The best elements are the noir B&amp;W lighting and the atmospheric rumba music inside the smoke filled bar where Steve and Slim hang out. A big part of the plot takes place here. The bartender is Frank, played by Percy Helton, a character actor well known in the 50s and 60s for his delightfully raspy voice.Characters in this film are mostly seedy and tawdry, lowlife who have to keep looking over their shoulders, lest they be blindsided by thugs or other lowlife with an agenda. I thus found it hard to root for any of these cheaters.The film's overall tone is pessimistic, dark, and gloomy. There's almost no humor. Script structure is a little annoying. The story is narrated by Steve, and told largely in flashback. I suppose the film's theme is how coincidences can lead to fateful encounters."Criss Cross" is a good film to watch if you are a fan of Burt Lancaster; this is really his movie. But I'm not one of his fans. And I found the story to be ordinary and rather bland, characters stereotyped and unappealing, and a plot structure that was fairly annoying. "The Asphalt Jungle" is a better film. On the other hand, the rumba music in "Criss Cross" is great. And Percy Helton is always a joy to watch and listen to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>greed, lust, betrayal, and other things leading to the fatalistic, a minor classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It will be arguable with most viewers on whether or not Criss Cross, Robert Siodmak's quasi follow up to The Killers (featuring the same star, Burt Lancaster), is a definitive entry in the period of the film-noir. Part of this could be attributable to the heist sub-plot in the film, the one that drives on the characters to their bleak conclusions, is only good, not great, and is only inventive in how it is set up at the start, in typical noirish style, and then comes around again right at the 2/3 mark. What is essential or definitive about the picture, however, is the relationship between Steve (Lancaster) and Ann (the sultry late Yvonne DeCarlo). Here's a bond that has 'noir' written all over it; they've been divorced and estranged for quite a while, and when Steve comes back to town thinking at first with no intention of seeing her, it happens, old feelings stir up, and what he doesn't know, of course, is that she's married, this time to a mobster, Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea). When they attempt at seeing each other again- as their push and pull relationship has them at a disadvantage- Slim gets wise to it, and Steve only gets out of this jam by offering a job- a "can't-be-done" job involving an armored car.There's something about the main actor and actress in a film-noir that always gets me perked up a little more, especially if they're in juicy roles, and here Siodmak has a near perfect pair on his hands. Lancaster, with his natural appeal as a (for a noir anyway) average-Joe, and DeCarlo, with everything that can make a man allured and dismayed by what he sees (dismayed, of course, because one might think that a girl like that would be unapproachable), play into these roles like it's second nature, and if for nothing else they're the real draw in Criss Cross. It's part of a sort of male psychological streak in these films, perhaps, that it's from the man's POV in how one gets drawn in by pure desire, even if the sense of fate and circumstance feel all too uneasy. There's great scenes in the nightclub, where Steve sees Ann again, dancing to a Latin tune that gets the mood to a high pitch, of the two of them talking together and seeing how they could work out as a couple, but also how tempers could flair at any moment on either side (I loved one bit where he asks her to go swimming with her on a weekend, and they're both grimacing the whole time). And then there's the sort of conventional fall-out where a paradoxical set of chances and bad choices send them to their respective dooms, of love getting criss-crossed (ho-ho) with greed and more pragmatic sensibilities. The ending at the rendezvous may seem a little too much without any hope, but then again who goes to see relationships like these work out as a happy ending? Not Siodmak and his writers, for sure, and it's a major credit that his whole cast pulls off the parts, not just the principles (Duryea, by the way, is another in a long line of film-noir villains who never has to raise his voice to let himself be known as a threat in a room full of gangsters), but supporting players, like the old bartender, the even older guy who plans out part of the robbery (and waits to have his drink), or the concerned lieutenant Pete who stands on the sidelines not with the usual determination to bust the case, but as a kind of witness to Steve's demise ("I should've kicked you to get it in your head," he says late in the movie). On top of this Siodmak lays on the moody thrills and suspense with effortless glee, with the actual heist scene itself, shrouded mostly in smoke, a winner. Although much of the typical aspects of Criss Cross are worth the while, it's really the core of the picture, of the ties between such an easily read love-triangle, that becomes most fascinating. If it were on television sometime I would watch it again just for their scenes- as well as a few others- and it should stand the test of time as a very fine Hollywood thriller from one of the better directors of the period.</fullReview>

The first half or so of the film deals mostly with mushy stuff between Burt Lancaster and Yvonne Decarlo, and apparent third wheel, Dan Duryea. It creaks along but then takes off when the caper (an armored car heist) begins. Then there's plenty of action, right up to the nihilistic conclusion. Dan Duryea gives a good performance. Burt is so-so and Yvonne reveals why she never was a major star. Good performances by the minor players. The direction was questionable, as the film slowed to a crawl several times during the seemingly endless first half. Worth watching for Duryea's performance and little else.

		<shortDescription>Steve and Anna go swimming with the sharks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Siodmak's gripping heist film, Criss Cross, resides in a parallel world of time and space. It's an address located somewhere between reality and fantasy. A world where criminals, "you're the only crooks I know," exist and ply their trade unimpeded by the authorities. The one cop on the job, Steve Thompson's childhood buddy, Pete Ramirez, is torn between protecting his dopey, love-struck chum and collaring his sorry tail. He is a man with an impossible task--who is simply not invited to the party.I love this film noir. I've seen it thirty times. The City of Los Angeles has (in my opinion) fifth billing, just behind the three leads and the super cool dialog. She is a city of steep hills, trolleys, nightclubs, the poor and the downtrodden. I never get tired of hearing the weird, repeated (for effect) dialog utilized by Yvonne De Carlo and company. I am obsessed, like Burt, with Yvonne's doomed ("I wished we'd never met.") words and sensual beauty. It's a timeless performance that survives today as the archetype of femme fatales. It's a layered, complicated character: she is not good nor evil. Somewhere in the middle, really. Deep down (I think), she is a practical woman (she weds to stay out of prison) who craved Lancaster and a stable home life. Instead, Burt blunders and sets into motion a series of events that hurtles the two of them down a road to oblivion. Generally, a place where most of these couples end up. Miss De Carlo, always a favorite of mine, was a superb actress and a commanding screen presence. You will not find three better acted scenes than the ones at the lunch counter, in the motel room ("see how he treats me") and at the seaside cottage. Her line delivery and physical movements are impeccable. If it had been up to me, she would have had a gold statue sitting on her mantle for this performance. It stands for all time. The final scene and "shot" in this film are unforgettable. Cue sirens!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite repeated warnings about her from his friend cop Stephen McNally, Burt Lancaster insists on going after Yvonne DeCarlo who proves time and again she'll settle for comfort and money as opposed to romance.Burt Lancaster is following in the footsteps of another luckless protagonist like he did in his debut film, The Killers. Although probably a better comparison would be Robert Mitchum in Out of the Past as another man done in by the wrong woman.Criss Cross though isn't so much about Lancaster as it is about DeCarlo. Criss Cross is in my opinion her career role. She is absolutely fabulous as the woman who is so obviously self involved that everyone including Percy Helton the bartender can see it. Everyone, but Lancaster.Even though she loves Lancaster, DeCarlo marries smooth crook Dan Duryea because of the material things he can provide. Lancaster sees what he has to do, get some of those material things for himself.He conceives of an armored car robbery and he goes to Duryea through DeCarlo because after all as he puts it, they're the only crooks he knows. All the while carrying on with DeCarlo behind Duryea's back.Dan Duryea is far more subdued in this film than he is in such Anthony Mann films as Winchester 73 and Thunder Bay where he played both a bad guy and a good guy respectively. Robert Siodmark gets a performance out of him that exudes the quiet menace of Howard DaSilva in The Blue Dahlia.Criss Cross is one of the best noir films of the late forties with a great cast and top direction. Though I think the audience figures out where it will all end, it's still a fascinating ride.</fullReview>

This being a film noir, I wasn't all that surprised by the scheme going awry, but I was surprised at just how badly it does so. This is one bleak movie with one very bleak ending, one I was not expecting at all.The three principles are terrific, not surprisingly. This is actually the only role I've ever seen De Carlo in outside of Lily Munster, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her. There's something endlessly fascinating about her.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film plays out in a rather ordinary tone and it does so to the point that you may not see everything that you would otherwise see. What I mean by this is that the characters are the characters and they are allowed to be this way without the tone and atmosphere of the film adding to them or overegging the cake. This is not to say I do not enjoy such atypical noir shadings, but here the scenes are lit and the things that are usually added to by lighting, music and captured looks are within the characters in a way I found enjoyable.Lancaster we presume will be a tough guy and a smart one but quickly we learn that he is pining for his ex-wife even though it doesn't make sense for him to try and get mixed up in it again. She, on the other hand, is interested in him but soon you start to suspect that she isn't so much in love with him so much as just looking for the best options for herself ? although this is never fully clear. De Carlo plays this pretty well, she never vamps it up but rather she plays it fairly evenly and produces an engaging female lead while Lancaster manages to be smart and tough generally, but lose those qualities when interacting with De Carlo ? which is what his character needed to happen. The supporting cast is OK but the film really moves best when focusing on these two. The delivery is matter of fact and this worked for what it was.Generally Criss Cross is a pretty strong film. It has scope for a tougher edge and more grit in the characters, but the focal relationship is good with the naivety and the selfishness well played by both leads. Not the most obviously dark film, but it is there if you let the performances deliver it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Criss Cross" is a typical noir, made in 1949 by Robert Siodmak. Burt Lancaster, a fairly new star at that time, really shines as Steve Thompson, a young man who comes home for the war and wants to see his ex-wife Anna (Yvonne DeCarlo) but keeps telling himself he's through with her and doesn't want to see her. However, he's drawn to the old hangouts and inevitably does see him. By now she's taken up with a hood, Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea), but she seems to want Steve as much as he wants her. They get back together quietly, but what they both want is to go away permanently.One night, Slim catches them at Anna's apartment, and to cover, Steve says he has an idea for a job, a robbery of the Brinks truck he drives. Brinks are supposedly impossible to rob, and all criminals know this, but Steve says it will work with an insider (himself) helping.Quite a movie, with the beautiful, exotic DeCarlo just smoldering - she and Lancaster, so athletic and good-looking, made a beautiful couple. Duryea is downright scary. The film is violent at times and quite exciting.This film actually proved to be a break for James Curtis, who is uncredited in the movie but can be seen dancing with Yvonne DeCarlo. Apparently people handing in the preview cards wanted to know more about him. He changed his name to Anthony Curtis for his next film. It would be a few years before Tony Curtis became immensely popular. Later, he costarred with Burt Lancaster. Raymond Burr can also be seen as a gangster.Good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone wrote to me the other day and was right on point, it's like cinema was invented for film noir. There's nothing like it, in the darkness being set a certain way, the memoryThis is typical; the zigzag of hopeless love, heist, doublecross, leaving behind just a hollow soul to welcome a few bullets from the dark.What elevates it first is how effectively everything fits. Siodmak may never be celebrated next to Hitchcock, but he was a master craftsman in his niche. Lancaster is just unselfaware enough to fool us?we don't know how much of the intricately naive character he plays is an actor job and how much the actor himself. The girl is pretty and desperate and the villain scummy enough.The heist is ordinary enough for this day, but pretty excellent for then. It bookends the film and inbetween we have the essential matter of noir.Hallucinative throwback to previous life. We're presumed, as usual, to take it at face value as things that happened, but we know better. It's too rich to ignore. Remember, it's all being recalled as he drives to the heist, anxious, unsure. From the heist on, he blacks out twice. The heist itself is rendered with smoke and confusion, mirroring the betrayal. Later he's incapacitated in a hospital bed, fearful of a gunman paying him a visit.This is Chandleresque, and noir in general. The losing of world and coming back to, coming and going. The timeline starts with him returning to LA after years of doing odd jobs around the country, looking for the girl he was married to but didn't work out. It's all something being revisited in the first place. But the greatest thing is how all that is melded into places, memorable, marvelous places around LA. In the drugstore, inviting her to an early morning swim the other day, and her framed in the door with street traffic behind. His looking at her unobserved as she crosses a street to get a cab. The meeting house at the old Bunker Hill, with a windowview of the trains going up and down. Here's a film that's outwardbound, looking out to vibrant life.To the end, we're unsure if the gang was really going to betray him at the heist, if the girl was going to disappear with the money, or if it was all illusion and chaos thrown by the gods.Noir Meter: 3/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burt Lancaster (Steve) returns to Los Angeles and his job as an armoured truck driver for a security firm. However, the real reason for his return is to re-unite himself with his ex-wife Yvonne De Carlo (Anna) even though he is in denial about this at the beginning of the film. They hook up with each other again but De Carlo currently has a serious suitor in the form of gangster Dan Duryea (Slim). Her relationship with Duryea is cemented when they marry, which of course, is devastating news for Burt, who then concocts a plan to steal her away from Duryea. It involves teaming up with Duryea to hijack his own armoured truck before running off with De Carlo and a bag full of loot. Things don't go as planned.This is a nicely filmed story that engages the audience from the beginning shots that reveal Burt and Yvonne in an embrace. We know there is an element of danger and that a plan is being hatched. The majority of the story is told in flashback which sets the scene for us to return to the hijack and its aftermath. And a very memorable ending ? I found it quite powerful as I didn't know what to expect. There are many good scenes, including Burt lying in a hospital bed paranoid that someone will come into his room to kill him off at any moment. He asks visitor Robert Osterloh (Mr Nelson) to keep an eye out for him ? oh well, some ideas are better than others I suppose. We are not quite sure about this visitor chap but all seems well.This is a film about love and betrayal but it is slightly unconvincing as to why Burt would want to get back with De Carlo after she has stood him up to marry Duryea of all people. True love is indeed blind for Burt and it brings about his downfall. All the cast are good and Tony Curtis gets an appearance in another memorable sequence at the nightclub where he dances with De Carlo. An enjoyable film with some great dialogue, nice location shots and an intense ending.</fullReview>

It's an ingenious title because it's what happens the movie. I love watching my favorite characters get betrayed and tricked throughout the bustling course of the film. Yvonne is pretty in this movie. The ending was all too obvious, I saw it comin from a mile away. My eyes were wide open. If there's one thing I learned from this flick, is don't trust women. All they want is your money. Yvonne had a good heart but it was blocked by greed and evil.Goodnight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man blinded by love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen a film from the film noir era prior to this film. I really enjoyed the story line of this film. It was interesting to see the male and female roles reversed. Normally we see the women in distress, and the man coming to her rescue. This film was the complete opposite. Steve, played by Burt Lancaster, was a man blinded by the love he had for his ex wife Anna, played by Yvonne DeCarlo. I enjoyed seeing a woman in charge.By Steve getting back involved with his ex wife, he was dragged into a secret underground world that she was now a part of. She was now involved with a man named Slim, who is nothing but trouble. Slim is involved with L.A.s mafia scene, something in which Steve did not expect to get dragged into.If you enjoy melodramas with some action, then this is a good film for you. I would enjoy to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first film I have watched from the film noir era. I was pleasantly surprised and I did really enjoy this film. It was something different than I had seen before, but it had a lot of nice qualities to it. For instance, I thought the main actors cast in this film were perfect for their parts. The character Anna, played by Yvonne De Carlo, was this strong headed, go getter kind of woman. She was very convincing when she was being nice or playing the more evil kind of woman. The character Steve Thompson, played by Burt Lancaster, I thought did a fine job in playing the role of being easily persuaded and almost lost in this new sort of world he got himself into.Another great point I found about this film and/or this genre in general was the reverse roles of men and woman. It showed woman to be more cunning and deceitful towards anyone who stood in their way to get what they wanted. In most movies it shows the man taking charge and not caring who he has to move out of his path to get his prize. On the other hand, in this movie, it showed a man in a more of a damsel in distress kind of way. What I mean by this is the main character is shown as blinded by love and is pressured into doing things he does not want to do. I do think this film is a great example of film noir and I would enjoy to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is certainly a very interesting movie. For one thing you don't know what's going to happen next because the characters are in a situation that can lead to a very nice and wealthy life, or death. The main male character in the movie came back home to see his family and he found the woman he loved and fell in love with her again. However, she was not for his to have because another man, who was a very dangerous man, had his hold on her. This only made him want her more and after finding out she was being abused he was angry and wanted her to come away with him. However the dangerous man has connections so in order for her to be free, the main lead character in the movie comes up with a plan to get close before having the chance to run off with him.There was only one way in which this movie could end, especially since the leading female only wanted the money and not really the love that the leading male character offered. Although this movie was interesting, if you do not like sad endings I would not recommend it to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great Film-Noir in every sense of the term, with a hefty dose of scheming double crosses, and a femme-fatale of the most literal sense. Half the story is told as a flashback, which catches up to where the film begins. Steve's narrations add the classic Noir feel, along with stark lighting and climactic action around every unpredictable turn. His obsession for Anna is made very clear and he is often at odds with himself when it comes to his love for her. Anna plays her manipulative role well, and it's often unclear what her true feelings are and where her loyalties really lie. The films dramatic and poetic end leaves viewers a bit dazed, but is done very well, with Anna and Steve killed in each others arms. I felt Anna may have deserved a bit of a less comfortable death as she was constantly flip flopping between loving Steve and being ready to desert him at the drop of a hat, but her last few moments show her true feelings just as it's too late.</fullReview>

After this scene i knew i was watching a great Film Nior flick. Like most Film Noirs it uses Flashbacks to show background of the plot, which is done actually well because it gives you just enough without dwelling too much on how things happen you know Steve has come back from somewhere most likely the military and tries to rekindle his love his wife, but she remarries another man. The best part of the film I believe is the end when we uses the titled and Steve is literally Criss Crossed losing everything: his girl, his dad, and his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criss Cross is a pretty good movie. I liked the films tone and the way it flowed, it reminded me of an episode of the Twilight Zone. I really like movies that are narrated from a first-person perspective, such as Orson Welles' Lady From Shanghai. It's always really interesting and entertaining to hear the inner thoughts of the main character and it gives the film a certain smooth feel that I can't really describe. Criss Cross had a really good plot as well and didn't get boring. I was held suspense for most of the movie, especially when the main character was in the hospital bed. You could really feel Steve Thompson's fear while he lay there in anguish just waiting for his killer to walk through the door. In Criss Cross Steve Thompson gets reluctantly roped into some illegal activities. The film does a fabulous job portraying a heavily conflicted man who is only doing what he thinks he has to do to be with his lover. The lover who, devastatingly, betrays him at the end. Criss Cross is a great film-noir and is very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criss Cross was a romantic story which kept my interest. I felt bad for Burt because he was still in love with his ex-wife and he went all the way back to LA to try to get her back. He really played the role of a heart broken man still in love, it was all he was thinking about, and everything he did was revolving around her. Burt is the type of man any woman would want, he is so in love with her and would do anything for her. Even though this is an old movie you still see how heart broken actions are still the same today. When Anna wants him back, her boyfriend gets in the way, typical of what would of happened today. This film was a typical love story and i felt each character really gave it there all and played each role great. The movie is set up in a nice way, it flows really good, and the action between Burt and Slim give it a little extra.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Film noir Criss Cross was directed by Robert Siodmak in 1949. Its a dark film, missing the cheerfulness of other films of its era. Film Noirs usually end in death and despair. The film portrays the messages "watch your back" and "keep your friends close but your enemies closer". Burt Landcaster plays Steve Thompson, the main character who gets mixed up in some trouble with some not so nice people while ultimately trying to get back together with his ex lover. Everyone in the movie is in it for themselves, stabbing the others in the back as needed. Typical of a Film Noir, everyone dies in the end. I enjoyed the film. The hidden agendas and actions of the characters keep it suspenseful and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Criss Cross 1949</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, never seeing a "film noir" before, I thought Criss Cross was a good representation of one. The story was not as enticing as I had hoped it would be. Although, I can't complain too much because I did get a little wrapped up in the film, because of the tumultuous love relationship between Steve and his ex-wife. However, the film was more about the photography rather than the story line. There are a lot of nighttime shots, as there should be for a film noir. But what really makes the film good are the aerial views, like when the camera swoops down into the dance club parking lot then shows the surroundings. The dark shots of the dance-club and ally way behind the club add an element of secrecy and surprise (at least to me they do). The movie seems to have a lot of secrecy to it, especially since Anna belongs to this underground element of L.A. Overall, the film was quite good. The camera-work shows progression and Steve and Anna's relationship is entertaining (for lack of a better word) as the viewer.</fullReview>

And it kept you guessing who was going to end up with who and who was going to live or die as sad as it sounds, it kept you on your toes. I still like Casablanca better just because of the "Hollywood love" aspect of it, also I thought the ending was perfect and clever. As for this one I found it cold and just not as good. The whole story with Anna going back and forth between men I found that rather trashy. As far as the camera and lighting aspects go i thought they were good. I noticed some scenes were rather long; a minute or two rather than just a few seconds. It was definitely a film noir just because of the "darkness" and night shots and how rainy and dreary it was.

		<shortDescription>criss cross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is about nothing but back-stabbing and, well criss cross. This film is a film noir because of the theme of gangsters, alienated lead characters, femme fatales, and dark scenes of cinematography. The theme of gangsters are like Slim and his gang, the alienated character coming back from war is Steve, the femme fatale is Anna, and many examples of dark, dramatic scenes. One example is when Peter, the investigator, tells Steve in the hospital of what he found out about between Slim, Anna, and himself (Steve) and what he thinks is going to happen from that point. The story worked for the movie, but for real life I think it is a little far fetched.Besides the story and the plot, the acting was good, the cinematography and lighting was great, and the directing was superb. I think I found this film a little boring and repetitive at times though. The only reason I think this is because I have seen so many movies that deal with double-crossing and back-stabbing that I just kind of anticipated what was going to happen. Also, I'm not a big fan of movies that don't have a happy ending, and when Steve and Anna die at the end I wasn't expecting it and I didn't really like it. I know that they were together, but not the way that I wanted them to be. Overall, the movie was good, but I just think it's simply not my kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Noir Outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Thompson (Burt Lancaster) returns to Los Angeles after a few years and despite his own misgivings and warnings from friends and family hooks up with his ex-wife Anna (Yvonne De Carlo) who is now involved with a hood named Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea) and this sets him on a dangerous path Though this is not amongst the best 'noir's', Criss Cross is overall a good film that uses many of typical 'noir' elements quite well. We have people trapped by their circumstances, we have double crosses, we have a heist and we have a femme fatal. Outside of the story elements we have some great use of light and shadow that along with the music (Miklós Rózsa) sets the appropriate mood for some typical 'noir' locations. Admittedly though the story is not really one of the films strength's, it's fairly straightforward and predictable though some parts work better.The film opens with what I assume is a helicopter shot over Los Angeles which looks fairly impressive, especially given that this is 1948. There is also some nice use of crane and some other high angle shots. The neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles where the film was partially shot along with a few other locations are used effectively in the film as well and integrate effectively with the sets.I found both Lancaster and Duryea fairly effective, but I have seen better work from both of them, I didn't think De Carlo really worked although she had her moments. I'm not entirely sure why Yvonne De Carlo didn't work for me in the role, but every once in a while I could help but hear Lily Munster in her voice. Another voice that may seem familiar to some is that of the raspy Percy Helton as Frank the bartender who is a fairly memorable character actor. The film also features the debut of Tony Curtis in brief appearance as a dancing partner for De Carlo.The novel upon which the film is based was again adapted in 1995 by Steven Soderberg as 'Underneath'.</fullReview>

As the car leaves frame, the camera pushes in on a couple kissing. They look up as headlights spotlight them: It's Steve (Burt Lancaster) and Anna (Yvonne DeCarlo).A hurried conversation. It is the night before some dangerous "job." They're lovers. There's another man. She's frantic with worry. He tells her to wait for him after.Anna vows that when they reconnect, she'll make things right, make Steve forget all the things that happened to them in the past. Siodmak shoots her declaration from Steve's POV. The angle is arresting: she almost stares directly at the camera. We see Steve listening and his eyes worship her. Lancaster, without any words, expresses a raw emotional need and naked vulnerability that is worrying.

		<shortDescription>Film Noir's Romeo and Juliet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a nut shell: A driven armored car driver seals his fate when he becomes involved with his sultry ex-wife.CRISS CROSS has got to be one of the most romantic films of all time and the fact it's a noir makes it a towering achievement. There's been romance in noir before (POSTMAN, MARTHA IVERS, LAURA) but not like this. Burt Lancaster's "Steve" can break your heart (no mean feat in film noir) and Yvonne De Carlo's "Anna" is a most sympathetic femme fatale. Anna's only "fatale" in so far as she's bad luck for the men in her life. It's true Anna ended up playing everyone for a sucker -but it wasn't calculated. The lady's self-preservation instincts would make a panther proud ("In some ways she knows more than Einstein", Steve's mother notes) and the destructive things she did (marrying Slim, leaving Steve to die) were done because she was backed into a corner like an animal. When Steve says "Com'on Anna, you know you" it's circular logic in more ways than one. Steve doesn't know himself but he knows Anna -and it doesn't matter to him. But Anna doesn't know her own mind. Most film noir writers overlook the fact that Anna didn't run off with the money when she had the chance. She was going away with Steve and was waiting for him at the beach house. Anna -because she was terrified of Slim -opted to save her own skin in a blind panic. How many of us wouldn't have done the same? I don't suppose Steve &amp; Anna's relationship/marriage was all that different from the marriage of Steve's co-worker (the one that took the call from his "wife" that set the robbery in motion) or the relationship between Steve's brother and his girl. Anna &amp; Steve really don't know what went so terribly wrong the first time around. They're ill-fated, star-crossed -the "Romeo &amp; Juliet" of film noir. Steve tries to fool himself (and the audience through voice-over narration) that it was Fate ...and maybe it was -if one's obsession is one's fate. This film foreshadows PSYCHO: the opening shot that pans the nightworld of L.A. before finally settling in on the parking-lot of "The Round-Up" nightclub where we join Steve and Anna's twisted tale in progress finds it's "dual mirror" in the opening sequence of Hitchcock's thriller. There's also a VERTIGO/POSTMAN RINGS TWICE-twist to the proceedings in that Steve had already married (and lost) his obsession once -yet willingly sleepwalks to his doom as history repeats itself. Then there's Dan Duryea's smoothly sadistic Slim Dundee (who, incredibly, also loved Anna) and the film's centerpiece, the robbery (and it's extremely suspenseful planning/execution) to keep any film noir fan fascinated . The urban nightclub milieu is as important to true film noir as chiaroscuro and "The Round-Up" exemplifies this with its daytime bar, night time dance floor, and parking lot/back room conniving. Slim &amp; Anna are never shown at home in their (undoubtably) posh digs ...only in the "Round-Up". The "Michaelangelo Pieta" portrait-ending is a haunting masterpiece of a final image. Seminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noirish but not really film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To a purist like me "Cross Cross" is not really "film noir" because it lacks some critical elements. The protagonist (Burt Lancaster, just off "The Killers") isn't really seduced into his ill-fated venture by a femme fatale. It may look that way, but in reality the plan to rob the armored car comes from Steve (Burt), not from Anna (Yvonne de Carlo), and not even at her instigation. And Anna is not really a femme fatale who double crosses our hero. In fact she stays wonderfully true to him until she must chose between his life and hers. In most film noir the femme fatale is not merely working for herself but usually with the antagonist (Dan Duryea). In this film she is double crossing Duryea, not Lancaster. There are many noir elements in the film. The urban setting (really nice to see downtown LA in the late 40s), the motley crew of crims, and the off-beat photography are all tried and true noir elements along with the downbeat ending. But many elements are not present, as indicated above, along with the unrelenting rain and lots of night scenes.Putting aside the film noir bonafides, there are some real big plot holes in the film, all of which you will discover for yourself.It's an OK film. You get to see an uncredited Tony Curtis dancing with de Carlo, and trolley cars operating in downtown LA. But don't expect to see your classic film noir. Best case, it is noirish. In reality it is more about the dangers of obsessive love, which is one of the themes in film noir, but usually done better.BTW ? if you're a fan of Robert Siodmak this isn't one of his better films ? "The Killers" (1946) and "Spiral Staircase" (1945) are my favorites, and for a change of pace his teaming again with Lancaster for "The Crimson Pirate"(1952)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its presumptuous for me to offer suggestions to Siodmak on how to structure or edit a film. After all he was a master. But I believe that structural problems prevent this film from being more memorable than it is. Yes its a good noir but:It seems to me that the heist happens too late in the film. And why all the scenes with Mom and dog- they are well staged but don't add anything. Too much talk with the bartender (although the bartender part is well acted). Too-long scenes of heist planning, and Napier's role is unnecessary- it probably should have been cut altogether to help all the scene clutter involving the heist. Its just my opinion but I believe all the mid-movie clutter could have been cut down for more lean and neat structure.On the plus side, the scenes of Los Angeles are wonderful and atmospheric and the night club is a fun place.Lancaster is physical and is intense. He gives a performance of force and power and is terrific. He and Yvonne DeCarlo have a lot of spark between them and she is smoldering and believable as a classic noir dame. All the performances are good, and once the dragged-out middle of this film is past it rushes to a very brutal noir ending that packs a lot of punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Curtis always claimed this was his first movie appearance. He said he was walking around Universal's lot late one afternoon when he literally bumped into Robert Siodmak who asked him, "Can you dance?" When Curtis replied in the affirmative, Siodmak took down his details and later phoned Universal's casting director. When Curtis arrived on the set, he had no idea what he was supposed to do and was amazed to find himself dancing with Yvonne De Carlo. When De Carlo leaves him flat on the floor, Curtis actually continued dancing by himself, earning applause from the crew, but this "solo" was deleted from release prints. In other respects, "Criss Cross" was a typical Siodmak film noir, masterfully directed by Siodmak and superbly photographed by Franz Planer. The screenplay by Daniel Fuchs, based on the 1948 novel of the same title by Don Tracy, still manages to work up almost constant edge-of-the-seat suspense.</fullReview>

The story line is very easy to follow and it keep the viewer interested the whole way through. The film focuses on Steve, a man with a plan who goes back to Los Angeles to see if there is another chance with his former wife Anna who is now "owned" by a powerful head boss of the "mafia." Everyone warns Steve that she's not worth it and tells him to not bother and go home but he's too blindsided and doesn't care what it takes to win her back. He bargains to get her back by organizing a certain heist that only backfires and causes more drama. In the end they do wind up with each other, maybe not the way they intended though.I absolutely loved this film, it's interesting and well filmed and it just kept my interest the whole way through. Burt Lancaster and Yvonne DeCarlo were great together and I wish they had made another film together as their chemistry was outstanding. All in all a great film that's not too long in length and has an interesting storyline at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good stuff, with man's man Lancaster involved in armored car heist and old feelings for former vamp/lover Decarlo, years away from Lily Munster. Intense noir and cynicism on high, with knockout terrific final fade out that really packs a punch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, well executed noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark, dense movie starring Burt Lancaster as the sucker, Yvonne de Carlo as the none-too-subtle temptress, and Dan Duryea as the sadistic baddie. It ranks right up there with The Killers and Siodmak's other noirs as a solid, well told crime thriller. I recently saw it on 35mm and visited the projection booth after the screening - the film itself was black as coal. Be sure to turn off the lights if watching this on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swede Smell Of Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clifford Odets began his play Rocket To The Moon smack in the middle of a domestic quarrel with no build-up. It's doubtful if Siodmak - who was still in Europe at the time - saw the play but he begins this movie in a similar fashion. The camera swoops over LA during the opening credits then comes to rest in a car park where Lancaster and DeCarlo are locked in a passionate clinch that reeks of danger and desperation. Siodmak and Lancaster hit one out of the park with The Killers where Lancasters' Swede had been part of a major heist and crossed his colleagues because of a woman (Ava Gardner). The director-actor duo clearly figured that warmed-over swede had corned beef hash beat seven ways from the middle so here we have Lancaster involved in a major heist and double-crossing his colleagues because of a woman (Yvonne de Carlo). Siodmak was, of course, a major league director so the movie is greater than the sum of its parts. The noir atmosphere is well handled and for good measure the two leads are both supplemented and complemented by Dan Duryea at his sinister best. Throw in Percy Helton and Stephen McNally, simmer gently and serve sizzling hot. A minor gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To appreciate this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To truly appreciate this film, you need an understanding of German Expressionist cinema. This genre is the root of 40's-50's noir and it shines through in this brilliant work of art.Of course, the Siodmak Brothers are just 2 successful German Expressionist directors who left the fatherland to make a mark in Hollywood film noir. Other greats include Edgar Ulmer, Billy Wilder, Otto Preminger, and (my favorite) Fritz Lang.This film is a text to be read. The formal elements of cinema (lighting, camera angles/movement, sound, transitions, etc.) are manipulated to impart ideas and emotions that are not specifically presented though dialogue. For example, Siodmak uses chiaroscuro lighting to foreshadow impending chaos and turmoil.The bottom line is this: if you watch Criss Cross as though it is a Spielberg movie, you may be disappointed. But if you 'read' the film as a complex work of art with carefully and methodically encoded messages/emotions/ideas, then you're in for a real treat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CROSSing ahead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few things I love about CRISS CROSS-- character actor Percy Helton as Frank the bartender; the sweet relationship between Richard Long and Meg Randall (who were paired in several Universal films); and the on-location filming in Bunker Hill and Union Station. It also looks like the robbery scene was filmed in Long Beach. So there is a lot of historical footage in this picture.But while these pluses make a strong case that CRISS CROSS is a film noir classic, there are some things about the picture that do not work for me.First, I think the ending is a bit overrated. It's effective. But Duryea is not doing anything different here than he's done with his other villain roles before or after. It's one of those everyone-must-die endings, and all he has to do after the fatal bullets are fired is to turn around and look into the headlights. Sirens blare in the background. Camera moves in and pictures fades out. One sequence, however, that does not seem clichéd is the robbery. But while it does contain a lot of action, it's staged in an uninspiring way (corny theatrics, with way too-obvious fake jabs and punches). A bright haze engulfs them from the explosion, but the director does not take advantage of the visual possibilities here. I can almost imagine what Orson Welles would have done; he would have had running shadows cutting through the bright cloud. And he would have done something to illuminate Lancaster's face in this sequence. Or at least with his hand holding the gun. His flesh is too pale and it blends in with the bright cloud of smoke to the point that we can barely see him. Overall, this film is a hodgepodge of ideas from 30s gangster pictures. It steals heavily from THE PUBLIC ENEMY-- the entire last sequence, where he gets kidnapped from the hospital is ripped off from PUBLIC ENEMY. Even the ending, where he dies is copied. The only new angle is that the girl dies alongside him.</fullReview>
