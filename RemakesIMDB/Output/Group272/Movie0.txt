		<fullReview>A film for ever in my brain. Not a bad thing for a film. I saw it for the first time when I was 8 and stayed with me always. I'm amused by some of the comments leveling this beautiful tale as "sick" and "twisted". I imagine it's the power of goodness that usually provokes more outcries than the power of evil. The film is what it is, no disguises to send its message as in Forrest Gump for instance. The film is a masterpiece no matter how you look at it and Pablito Calvo, the Marcelino at the center of it all, gives a performance that goes beyond any performance of any child actor has gone before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reply to the previous comment--</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel almost provoked to comment on this film here, and I say this not as an especially religious person (which I am not), but as someone who feels that a film should not be unfairly criticized because of someone's faulty--or would it be more accurate to say willfully (?) -- distorted summary of the plot.SPOILERS AHEADTo begin with, Marcelino is bitten by the scorpion while he is playing outside the monastery, but at no point in the film does he ask to see the crucifix for any reason. He has been frightened by tales of a "bogeyman" in the attic by the monks, who wish him to stay away from it. OUT OF CURIOSITY, and for no other reason, he ventures in, sees the Christ figure, thinks it is the feared bogeyman, and tears back down the stairs. (The figure, incidentally, is a beautiful wooden carving, not gory in the least.)After an unfortunate incident, in which he is taken to a festival and unwittingly causes a commotion by accidentally letting some animals run wild, the new mayor, an enemy of the monks who have raised Marcelino, swears to shut down the monastery. Marcelino is given the silent treatment by the monks, and it is then that he goes again to the attic, realizes the "bogeyman" is only a statue of Christ, remarks that it looks hungry, steals some bread, and offers it to the statue. It is then that a miracle occurs---the statue comes to life, eats the bread, and eventually, because of Marcelino's repeated visits, becomes Marcelino's teacher and confidant (Marcelino realizes who he is). And the vision is *not* a hallucination. The statue's final act in the film is intended only as a reward for Marcelino's kind actions, and it is done at Marcelino's innocent, but completely self-aware, request.This is by no means a vicious, sadistic film; it is a beautiful, gentle one. It is a pity that there are those who would distort its meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILER*** I like a previous viewer saw the movie around 1958 ('57), but it was shown by WGN in Chicago. They showed it yearly around Thanksgiving or Christmas every year for several years. Each holiday season, I awaited with great anticipation for this movie. The first time I saw it it brought tears to my eyes (hard to do for a boy of 10). I've been married now for 33 years and have been wanting to have my wife and children/grandchildren to see it. I will soon have the opportunity to do so for I have just acquired the newly mastered version.It appeals to the pure in heart, compassion, loving and tenderness in all of us. At the end of the movie when Marcelino leaves us, I was met with sadness, but I understood that his love and desire was to be with Christ and this was Christ's gift to him.Simply beautiful. Count on foreigners to make such a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Innocent, Tender Movie From The Mid '50s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this was stunning, both in photography and in content. Here's a nice, old-fashioned "religious story" you rarely see anymore. The English title goes under "The Miracle Of Marcelino." It's a simple tale of a group of monks who discover a baby at their monastery doorstep one morning and then raise the boy. They try to find suitable parents for the infant but are unsuccessful. The infant scenes don't run too long because, before you know it, they have fast-forwarded it to when the boy was six years of age....and that's where he stays until the end of the film.Pablito Calvo as the title character, Marcelino," is excellent. Kudos to cinematographer Heinrich Gartner for beautiful black-and-white photography. The DVD transfer was outstanding, too. The lighting, particularly on faces, is terrific.Other reviewers here at IMDb, such as Albert Sanchez Moreno, have described the story nicely. I will just add I found it oddly captivating the entire way and very touching and moving in the last 20 minutes or so, after the boy discovers the big statue of Christ and begins communicating with Him. Yeah, I'm sure it looks really far-fetched to almost everyone, especially non-Believers, but I enjoyed and marveled at the end of this film. I'm not quite sure what to make of the monks in here and why they would "warn" the young boy against going up in the attic, where the statue is located, unless they somehow supernaturally knew what was going to happen.....yet they still should have put their trust in Christ, anyway. Their actions are puzzling at times. There is a real mystery to this story overall, anyway. Not being Catholic, maybe I missed something in the translation. This is a very "Catholic" film but a Christ-believing Protestant as I am can still fully appreciate this story, too, as much as anyone, and I did.You'll never find this at a rental store but those you are curious, you might want to add it to your queue if you belong to one of those mail-in rental programs. This film was a collaboration of Spanish and Italian filmmakers, I think. There was a color re-make in the early '90s, but I haven't seen it.It's a film of tender "innocence" like few I've ever seen, which makes it very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>small masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, human nature!!. No matter how great a film may be there is almost always someone who will post inane comments about the movie that makes me shake my head in wonder, This is a small masterpiece, a little gem with a surprising outcome that I thought about for days after seeing the film. They remade the film in 1992, with an older too Hollywoodish child actor.. The child in the earlier version gives a one of a kind performance. A six year old actor playing a six year old kid, how the director got such a moving performance from someone that young is a wonder. His voice was dubbed so I initially thought it was the actor doing the voice-over who was playing the part so well. Then I saw the film in Spanish ( I speak the language) the dubbing doesn't do justice to the original performance.You will not find the movie at Blockbuster, so you have to buy the DVD. They issued two versions last year, first a digitally remastered copy, THAN a version that was not computer enhanced. I know, it is confusing. I love this little movie, I have already sent a copy to my granddaughter in Florida who was weaned on 70's films with Technicolor, Dolby and all that stuff. I expect a call in the next few days asking how I found this "great" movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film with my parochial school in the late 1950's and I have never forgotten it. Went to school one day and the nun said we were going to see a movie. All the students in our school went. The movie petrified me at the time. I saw a portion of the film broadcast on a religious television station last year. After all these years the crucifix of Jesus coming to life has been a memory I have never forgotten. The film was handled beautifully although the ending was a bit unexpected. I didn't remember Jesus taking Marcelino, but the scene was handled very well. This is a gentle, family film. Maybe we need more films like this one and less of the sex and violence genre. I will let the negative reviews pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for the gentle-hearted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A baby loses his parents and is left at the door to a monastery. The monks take him in and he grows into a mischievous but essentially good little boy. One day he sneaks into the attic and sees a life-sized image of Jesus on the cross...For pre-teens and younger, a parent should probably watch it with them, since some children will be disturbed by the ending. With understanding, this film helps the viewer to grow a little in faith, hope and love.... well, that is all I really wanted to say, but IMDb now requires ten lines of text for a review. I noticed the early reviews of Marcelino were extremely negative. If you have a lot of anger towards Christ or the Church, you will *not* like this film since it shows different types of people turning their hearts towards Jesus to varying degrees. This is not sinister propaganda, but the way the world really is. Christians are not the monsters you imagine them to be. If the Nazis *had* made films like this, as one reviewer suggested, instead of the inspirations to resentment and violence they actually did make, the world might have been a better place. Peace to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. I saw it many years ago as a child in my Catholic grammar school and still remember it. It is a beautiful moving experience and is a movie that can be watched by the whole family. I encourage everyone to see it. We need more movies like this one. I believe I may have seen it again on TV many years ago. I believe people of all faiths can enjoy this movie. The story is about innocence and faith. They also have made a remake of the movie, I believe in 1991. I have not seen the remake but, usually there is nothing like the original. So, if they thought the movie was good enough to be remade, you know it has to be good. Watch this movie, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensitive story proceeded in simplicity and delicacy by Ladislao Vadja</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts in a long flashback narrated by a priest(Fernando Rey), he tells how an abandoned baby is picked up by monks residing in a monastery ruled by a humble Father Superior(Rafael Rivelles). The little boy named Marcelino(Pablito Calvo) who lost his mother and became a pure and simple of heart kid devoted friend of Crucified Jesus.Meanwhile, he gets into mischiefs, he plays and puts nicknames to monks, as Brother Door(Antonio Vico),Brother Cookie(Juan Calvo), Brother Bad(Mariano Aza?a), Fray Giles(Juanjo Menendez) and Brother Ding Dong(Joaquin Roa).But in a touching scenes, Marcelino finds at the loft to Jesus and gives him bread and wine, then happen an ecstasy at the final.This a sensible and feeling movie full of mirth,humor touches, and enjoyable message based on novel by Jose Maria Sanchez Silva.At the same time the film gives us an agreeable panorama about monastery life, its pity and goodness; furthermore, the oration, sacrifice, work,companionship and various situations happen in monastic existence.Its perfect developing resides on superb characters well played by all casting monks and the sympathy, simplicity of Pablito Calvo-Marcelino. Musical score by Pablo Sorozabal responds appropriately to the ambient, originating a religious atmosphere . Precious and luminous cinematography by Enrich Guerner(Vadja's ordinary)who give us an accurate scenario of the times is developed . The motion picture is excellently directed by Ladislao Vadja, born in Hungary, he's author of magnificent movies, such as 'The Bait', and 'Cord of prisoners', and three with Pablito Cavo: 'An Angel over Brooklyn'( along with Peter Ustinov) and 'Uncle Jacinto'( with Antonio Vico). In my opinion this is one of the best films to come out of Europe in the decade of the 50s.The picture touched the hearts of numerous spectators around the world. Rating: Above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever seen in my life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie since I was like 8 years old, and I read the book ass well in Spanish. It's a very nice movie and I think it can mean a world to everybody, so they can see what it's like to be a real and good human being! Just the best of all! I think that the film makers should make this movie or book come a live again, cause it has been like stuck in the 19th century. It's very recommendable to read this book or watch the movie. I think that seeing movies like this of real life, will make you feel and understand what it's like to be a good person and not only thinking about ourselves like the modern world we all are in now. We can make a better world by being ourselves and by realizing that it's not always about us only. If you can make someone happy with a little thing, why not? If we want peace, we have to start with our selves first, and that is what this book or movie will let you see and feel at the same time. It's real, and it's realistic!Greetings, Cari_G</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to be browsing this site and saw the Marcellino Pane e Vino description. I hadn't thought about this film for years. I was born in Italy and in 1955-56 this was a huge success there. I can still remember the song that accompanies the movie. I was too young to know it was dubbed from Spanish. The movie was so popular that my grandfather, who was a barber, would give me and countless little Italian boys the "Marcellino" haircut..that is, front comb and bangs. I've seen photos of me many times but only now remembered the reason for my hairstyle. It has also brought back many memories of my grandfather and our life together in Italy, which at the time wasn't so different from the Spanish countryside depicted in this movie. A lasting memory..wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spanish film that marked an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religious Drama of great success in its time. In the 19th Century, after a long war someone leaves a baby, barely a month, to the door of a convent of Franciscan friars. They will baptize with the name of Marcelino. The years passed and, although the child live happy among monks, cannot help but think that do not have a mother. Attempted seek a family, but nobody wanted welcome. In an attic of the convent there is an image of the Crucified, of which Marcelino becomes friend, spoke with him, and he goes to the kitchen so you can: bread and wine...It is one of the largest commercial successes and criticism in the history of Spanish cinema, getting the bear of silver in the Berlin film festival and a special mention to Pablito Calvo in Cannes. A film that within its framework and historical context, yes, it is a movie lovely and difficult to forget all Spaniards, because all, for some time in its viewing, we have spilled some that another tear. It's a job with a beautiful photography, some notable performances and a marvelous storyThis Spanish film became a classic cinema family. Ladislao Vajda , extraordinary Hungarian director of extensive history behind his backs, offered his wisdom to film the movie, helped by the magnificent camera of Enrique Guerner, technical of German origin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A portrait of Innocence and goodness with some humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>January 2006, and we're talking about a film made in 1955! I too saw this movie possibly 50 years ago and have never forgotten it. I tried to get some more information on it in Sydney with our so called movie experts but got nowhere. The internet was not much help either, then last week, lo and behold, I found a DVD in "Parklea Market" Sydney Australia (sort of organised flea market) And it was selling for 5 Australian dollars (perhaps 2.5 Euros). Only one problem the tittle was "The miracle of Marcelino" ... It had to be the same though so I bought it. I could not wait to run it on my DVD player... and there it was "Marcelino Pan y Vino"! Yes try to search for Marcelino pan y vino, chances is you'll get nothing. Of course the reason I'm here is because of my newly acquired knowledge of its English title. I then was a little boy in France and I think the film was in Spanish with french subtitle. I personally think the dubbed version does some damage to the integrity of this beautiful story. I have to be honest here too. I found the movie rather rusty in the light of the ever growing technology in this field and I don't agree that the music is beautiful; it's markedly aged and I don't think I'd like a sound system with this quality. But what a reunion, I had almost given up any hope to see it again. I think My parents took me to watch it in Paris. They were non religious as I am now. They only love it for it's beauty and artistic value. I'm pretty sure if you're reading this you've read other entry and you already know the story, so I won't go into it. I just hope you'll give it a chance in your lounge room, I think the reward will be greatmm Feb. 2006. I had to come back to this movie and read more commentaries since I was here. I felt saddened by some, expressing some kind of paranoia or just pure negativism. One entry asked us to take off our "rosy" glasses to watch this movie... For one I wish I could find my 'rosy' glasses again as the world I see today needs badly to be seen through such device or we'll soon run out of Prozac. Then people wear all kind of glasses with all kind of colours and so see things accordingly that is not to say that other should join in. I wander what colour of glasses Mother Theresa, "l'abbe Pierre" or the like of them wore to achieve what they did. I see Marcelino Bread and Wine" as a simple,touching and beautiful story despite not having entering a church for decades. MM PS Having mentioned my difficulty to search this tittle I tried again because I forgot to bookmark it. This time I made sure to enter in the search field "The miracle of Marcelino" and for result got : Marcelino Pan y Vino (Aka the miracle of Marcelino)...How this for contradiction!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Dubbed the English Voice of Marcelino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 49 years, the memory of seeing this movie remains very fresh. Because, you see, I was the English voice of Marcellino in the dubbed version of "Marcellino Pan y Vino" that was, from the comments I've read, shown in just about every Catholic school in North America. Back in 1958, my parents and I were living in Rome, Italy--my dad was stationed at the American Embassy. I was about 8 years old. My mother saw an ad in the American newspaper looking for English-speaking voices to dub in the dialog in European-made movies slated for export. We went to the famous Cinecitta' studios, I auditioned, and got the job. "Marcellino" was the second or third movie I did. From what I recall, it took a couple of days to do, and I was only allowed to see the scenes that I actually had lines in, and they weren't many, when you come right down to it. I stood on a platform before a lectern in a very large studio facing a screen and microphone. I had to stand on a box to reach the microphone and read the script. I got a lot of coaching and we did dozens of takes. I don't know if they ever used the work I did, but I was there and I got paid--or my mother received the money. I only saw the movie once with the English dubbing just a few years ago--never saw it in school and never really mentioned it to anybody because I thought no one would believe me or be interested. I just purchased the DVD but it's only Spanish with English subtitles. Does anyone know where I can get the English dubbed version?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best religious movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know and never knew many religious films, but despite my lack of knowledge on this sort of films, I can say that "Marcelino pan y vino" is a very good movie."Marcelino pan y vino" is one of those movies that conquers our hearts for its simplicity. It proves that it's possible to make great movies through a simple story. This is a beautiful but sad story. Simple but unpredictable and absolutely charming. Simple yet with a particular magical touch. Perhaps a sweet, innocent, heartwarming and emotional story? Of course! This movie is a great mix of emotions. Not to mention that the ending is completely unforgettable. Yes, it is that memorable. The soundtrack by Pablo Sorozábal is powerful and combines perfectly with the movie's nature.Although this movie is also known as "The Miracle of Marcelino", its title means "Marcelino bread and wine"."Marcelino pan y vino" is a Spanish film, beautifully directed by Ladislao Vajda. Let's be very, very frank: this is really one of the best foreign movies of all time. Luigi Comencini directed a remake of this in 1991 under the title "Marcellino" but I never saw that one.The actors are all great, but cute little Pablito Calvo steals the show as the title character, Marcelino. And those eyes of his are so expressive!This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You call Marcelino Pan y Vino MPV a "Sick Sick Sick" flick ? Sounds like you have an ax to grind sir. Why are you so angry?. Heavens !!! It's only a movie !!!! This movie had nothing sick to it. I found it to be clean and heart warming. I have definitely seen really filthy and sick movies before and MPV does not fit the mold. If you don't agree with the contents or the way it was projected, why don't you explain how the movie can be improved or changed or presented. You sound like someone who is angry with the church.....perhaps with Christ ????? Hmmmm ...now who is really the propagandist? I saw this movie when I was a child and it had a positive impact on me. It was magical. I felt the same way as if I had seen Snow White or Sleeping Beauty. The only difference with this one is that I do believe miracles do happen and I believe Marcelino did not hallucinate as he saw Christ descending from the cross. If I did not believe in Christ or was an unbeliever, I would look at this movie as another family fantasy movie but I know I would not call it sick. I detect anger in your criticism and nothing constructive can come out of your opinion sir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is funny to see some comments that say that this film is awful and propagandistic. First for a Catholic to die and go to heaven is a bless (actually the biggest bless), so I don't understand why so many people get offended or shock by the idea. Second, if you don't believe in god or have the Catholic views of religion, it is okay, you may want to see it as a piece of fiction or just as another story, I don't get why there can be a reason to get offended or say that the film is bad.I saw this film as a kid many times and I never got to be "psychological traumatized" or anything likely and probably is the kind of film I would not mind my kids to see.If you want to see a good 1950's film, this is it. I have to be honest, it is not perfect, but is really good for its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best family friendly movies I have ever seen. The first time I saw it I was 8 years old and with my dad watching on an old reel to reel, it was his favorite movie also as he felt connected to it because he grew up in a boarding home for fatherless boys. The sound was terrible, the dubbing was way off, the footage was grainy to say the least, and there were a number of cracks in the reel. Despite all those imperfections, I loved every second of this film. For the longest time I could remember every detail about the movie but its name. I wanted to see it again but had very little information to research. One day I described the movie to a friend (this is something I always have trouble doing because I get so choked up), the friend jumped up and said "thats my dads favorite movie, he grew up an orphan" We went to her dad and he knew the name of the movie right away, from there it was just a question of finding it on media other then reel to reel. The first copy I picked up was on VHS, picture quality much better then the reel to reel but still bad. I was going to burn a back-up copy of my VHS version on DVD, but for a movie this great, I will just buy the DVD version, maybe the DVD will be a little better then the VHS version, at least I know I will have the DVD version for a lifetime. Regardless of the quality of the picture, you must see this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious Classic; Glorious Simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man." (Rabindranath Tagore) "We worry about what a child will become tomorrow, yet we forget that he is someone today." (Stacia Tauscher)I have selected two quotes which, at first sight, have little to do with the film. However, when we look deeper at this Spanish classic, the 1955 winner at Cannes and Berlin festivals, we are led to draw a conclusion: it's a movie about a CHILD, a friend of God who, by being fully himself, did not have to become mature in order to address adults and enrapture them with awe and beauty. The thing that has touched me most in this religious classic is its simplicity. A religious theme depicted in movies may absorb different manifestations of spirituality. You can preach something and you make others hear powerful slogans. But conveying values without love has occurred barely useful. Instead, you can address hearts and you make others feel it so intensely that no additional explanations or lectures are necessary. Simplicity is something that touches various people and, meanwhile, something paradoxical: we own it as innate and yet, we lose it somewhere forgetting that this simplicity of life can constantly renew us. Where can we find it more than in such an ingenious, partly naive yet touching story about a child? THE MIRACLE OF MARCELINO (1955) written by Jose Maria Sanchez Silva and directed by Ladislao Vajda is a movie of such influence. The opening sequence is marked by crowds of people who head for a town located in the picturesque landscape of Spain. One monk (Fernando Rey), however, chooses the opposite direction in his journey because he is going to visit an ill child. This is a festival of Marcelino, his feast day which makes so many people celebrate. "Do you know who Marcelino was?" becomes a question addressed to the child in her bed and to viewers in their seats alike. He will be our little protagonist - an orphan boy with such a sweet sounding name who was abandoned as a baby at the gate of a monastery and looked after by twelve Franciscan monks. The flashback brings us to the 19th century Spain and its unique story. Is it a legend? an adventure? a fairy tale or a miracle? As people helped brethren rebuild the monastery, God helps them tackle the dilemma of what future to 'invest' for a crying baby at the gate. Although there are some people who would adopt the boy, including the mayor of the town, brethren know what it means to be good (note the scene at a blacksmith's). They decide to keep him at the monastery as the thirteenth one among them and baptize him Marcelino. From this day on, a great adventure begins for all of them, an adventure filled with the supernatural, awesome experience...The film beautifully handles the core idea of a child that has a spiritual power to change people around him. Many religions stress the aspect that even little children may achieve the heights of spirituality. 5 year old Marcelino (Pablito Calvo) is such a sympathetic protagonist because he owns all childlike characteristics. When he learns, he is curious, when he prays, he is joyful, when he plays, he forgets about the world. There is a lovely scene that presents his everyday activities through a song. At the crucial moment of the film, he shows no fear - he knows who is talking to him. Yet, how can he be afraid of a Friend? Let me highlight one psychological aspect.Although Marcelino seems to have much fun in his everyday life, there is one dream that absorbs him: MOTHER. The little boy is among twelve men but he has no mum. When encountering a woman (Manuel's mother), he is lifted up. His eyes sparkle at once and he imagines the bliss of being in Manuel's shoes, bliss of having a mother (mind you the meaningful name, Manuel, in the course of later events). He immediately creates a friend in his mind whom he never meets. He plays with him, he talks to him...as long as it occurs that there is Someone who can fill this need for true friendship in his little heart. This aspect is important since there have been many critical views that religious films barely carry any psychological development. MARCELINO proves otherwise.Fantasy blends with reality, mysteries with facts and a legend with a historical background. That is also what makes this film so captivating. The scene when he climbs the 'forbidden staircase' and discovers the attic is one of the best moments in the film. Each single detail plays a role in the inner experience, explains a lot: near the stairs, we read the excerpt from Psalm 33 "Humiles Spiritu Salvabit" (God will save the humble of spirit); the close-up of Christ's hand, though considerably influenced by the cinema style of the period, supplies the moment with mystery and piety. HUMOR: Brethren's behaviors and Marcelino's tricks draw our attention and amuse us. One of the most hilarious moments are the missing slices of bread. Moreover, the town sequence offers some moments of laughter. At the same time, the artistic pluses are executed in cinematography and music. But who deserves the credit for being the best Marcelino on screen is PABLITO CALVO. He gives a powerful performance skillfully avoiding the danger of shallow sweetness. His character moves us as a saint child but still a CHILD. Note the subtlety and mystery of the scenes when Marcelino talks to Jesus. We see the boy's face marked by various feelings: from surprise and a little confusion to confidence and peaceful communion.MARCELINO PAN Y VINO is one of the most beautiful religious films ever made, a religious classic that you may watch with heartfelt attitude. Glorious simplicity where 'the small' equal to 'the greatest' in humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very sweet little tale....even if you aren't Catholic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is for the Spanish language version. While I know that it was also dubbed into English, I chose to watch the subtitled version instead.I am not Catholic and did not, like so many other reviewers, grow up watching this film. I just stumbled upon it recently and am glad I did. It's a nice little morality tale--one that you really need to stick with, as the ending comes as a real surprise.The film begins with the founding of a monastery. Years later, a foundling is left at the front gate. The monks try to find the mother or a surrogate family but without success--plus, it looks as if many of the monks were so taken with the baby that they didn't try especially hard! Plus, the only person willing to take the child was the cruel mayor--who obviously wanted to use the kid as cheap labor! Years pass and the little boy has remained with the monks. While he is quite mischievous, the monks adore him. He's not really bad--just a 6 year-old who is full of energy and silliness. What happens next you'll just have to see for yourself--I really don't want to spoil the amazing direction the film takes near the end. I will say, however, that it really did come as a surprise and was very sweet.Technically speaking, this is a lovely film. The actors were wonderful as the monks--coming off as very kind men--the sort you'd hope would become men of God. As for little Marcelino, he was simply adorable and effective in the role of this precocious child. Casting couldn't have been much better. As for the writing, the story is terrific but probably not a film an avowed Atheist would enjoy--after all, it's a religious tale. The cinematography is in lovely black &amp; white and the director's touch was gentle and worked well with the story. Frankly, there isn't a whole lot you could do to make this a better story, so I was surprised to learn from the DVD that there is a remake. It might be very good as well, but can't imagine it being any better.This one might just put a tear in your eye--sweet and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Moving Movie I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I'm not religious. The first time I saw it as a child I didn't really think about religion and stuff like that. My grandmother, Catholic, recorded this show when it was on the television so I could watch it. And boy, it truly is a moving movie. I did cry, and I still do when I see the last part of the movie. Yet it's not a sad movie. I cry because it is so beautiful that Marcelino gets what he wants and therefore has to leave this world. I still do not believe in stuff like that, but it would be great if it were all true.Why do I rate this one 10 out of 10? Because it is beautiful and it sticks. I know every single thing that happens in this movie, even though it has been 10 years since I've last seen this movie. Unlike some of the violent, graphic movies like Pulp Fiction and Boondock Saints (which are great) this one is great without being violent nor graphic. True classic. Amazing. Masterpiece.I'd love to get this one on DVD sometime in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an extraordinary experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was overjoyed by the outpouring of affectionate comments for the film. It has become a collective experience for all of us, little Christians in the closet. Most of us probably became passive or agnostic but the humanity does not elude us. Let me just share with you that i first watched it on Greek state television when i was 8 and cannot get it off my mind and my heart. The quality of the film was lousy but the feeling was utterly uplifting. It remains in my memory one of the single, most touching and glorious moments of movie-making. Come to think of it, everything about Marcellino is theoretically tacky, anachronistic, almost gooey. However, the result overcomes every dogmatic obstacle and connects the viewer to the basic need of hope and emotional security. I am pretty sure that Spielberg had this old Spanish film in mind when he was working on "Close Encounters of the third kind".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the moment my heart was born, pureness whence this film began had come. Since then, I've been gazing the time of life upon the rood in the realm as a little space for breathing like Marcelino did. The belief surpassing description was rooted under the rose. Come closer! and feel to surface an innocent smile on his resting face in arms if you would not waver to be brave to value substances, no matters.The actor as Marcelino had done well to depict the symbol of proud sadness. God's hand invited him to return into the source of existence and gave him the meaningful life with some pieces of bread. His last smile appears to accept all forthwith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During a time of war in Spain, an orphaned infant is left at the door of a monastery. The monks are charged with finding a permanent home for him, but because they want to keep him, they don't try very hard. Finally they reject the mayor's demand that he be given the boy?even when the mayor threatens to evict the monks?and so they wind up raising him, calling him Marcelino. He grows into a rambunctious but likable lad who wonders why he doesn't have a mother like his village buddy Manuel. Though he's been forbidden from wandering up to the monastery attic, one day he does; there he finds a life-sized damaged wooden crucifix. At first, Marcelino is scared of it, but soon he begins talking to Jesus, going so far as to being bread and wine to the figure on the cross because he looks hungry. Suddenly, we see (from a vantage point behind the crucifix) the wooden arm of Jesus become human, taking the food and drink from the boy. The two share meals and chat, and when Marcelino tells Jesus that his fondest wish is to be reunited with his mother, Jesus makes it happen.SPOILER: Most reviewers of this film, especially ones of the Catholic persuasion, like it and find it heartwarming. As a former Catholic, I do have a soft spot for mystical religious fantasies (like THE BISHOP'S WIFE) and even the occasional non-mystical non-fantasies (GOING MY WAY). But this one, though well-made, comes off like a creepy Twilight Zone episode: Marcelino gets his wish because he dies. Off the top of my head (and aside from versions of LITTLE WOMEN in which the doomed child is more a supporting than starring role) I can only think of one other classic-era movie in which a central child character dies, the 1939 fantasy ON BORROWED TIME. I have to say that killing off a child whom you assume will live is an effective way to stun a viewer, and it works well in ON BORROWED TIME, but here, it just seems unsavory. The boy in BORROWED seems unhappy with his life on earth, but Marcelino does not?Jesus couldn't think of a better way to handle this kid's wish? I didn't dislike this movie?indeed, I would commend it for being different?but I think the people on IMDb who call it tender-hearted or inspiring or sensible either saw a different movie or need a dictionary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spanish masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember very well the day I first saw this amazing movie. I was 13 or 14 and a teacher of mine brought us the movie to watch in the school class. For some reason, I never forgot that ending. Such a strong and emotional ending, one of those endings never to forget.This is one of the simplest films ever, but it's also an all-time great exactly because of the simplicity. In other words, its simplicity is part of its charm and charisma. Everything in this movie oozes simplicity: story, settings, sceneries, cast and even the black and white color and the strong but fabulous soundtrack.Actually, the movie does itself a favor for being in black and white. It combines well with the kind of movie and its mood. It's a beautiful, innocent and happy tale, but also a heartwarming and sad one. So simple yet so effective. There is little to be criticized.Although the cast consists of adults in their majority and they all play their roles well, little Pablito Calvo is the best. He is amazing as the title character Marcelino. The "pan y vino" is added later for a reason. He is authentic and he's got very expressive eyes and face. Even though he is cute and tiny, he's got a husky voice for a child combined with the loud tone of voice Spanish and Italian people are known for. You've also got to love Marcelino because he has that innocent and angelical face, yet he's not all that innocent. However, that only means he has character.I know that there is a remake from 1991, directed by Luigi Comencini (the same director of the amazing "Incompreso" from 1966). The remake is called "Marcellino". I never saw it, but it's kinda surprising that this one time a remake wasn't American but Italian. Americans are well known for remaking films, both foreign and their own nationality, so this comes off as an unexpected surprise.Title in Portugal: 'Marcelino P?o e Vinho'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sort of Fairy Tale for the Vatican.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WE WELL RECALL how every good, little Catholic school boy or girl were urged to go and see this one. It did appear that every one of them did in our neighborhood &amp; parish in Chicago. Our neighborhood was called either South Lynne or Ogden Hill and was a segment of the greater community known as West Englewood. The Parish was St. Theodore; a now defunct and otherwise forgotten geopolitical subdivision of the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, located at 62nd Street and Paulina Street.* THE FILM IS basically a pleasant story of an orphaned Italian boy who is adopted and being raised as the ward of a monastery of priests. Although little Marcel (hence the diminutive form of "Marcellino") has been dealt a sad hand in life, he is an example of the direct opposite of what one would expect. Marcellino is a total delight as a little guy, being the epitome of happiness incarnate.WE ARE PRIVEKEDGED to follow the little tyke as he explores the monetary and finds a large, lifelike statue of the Crucified Jesus. In his own, totally child's understanding of things, he brings gifts of bread and wine to the image and miraculously accepts them, coming to life and conversing with the child.MUCH TO THE chagrin of his older, holy men inhabitants of the cloistered digs, he continues this behavior. One day, he tells the living image of the Christ that the two things the boy wishes are "to see my Mother and yours!" He is then immediately taken to his eternal reward; amid both the mourning and celebration of the friars.WHEN WE RE-EVALUATE what we originally saw, some 62 years ago, we find that what we have is a sort of hybrid story. It is somewhere between a Catholic/Christian morality play and a classic Fairy Tale. That's not to say that it is not without its merits. It surely has that; particularly to the children who are being brought up in the Faith.AND THAT IS perhaps the main message of the story; that we should strive t have the Faith of a Child. Didn't Jesus say something about "unless one comes to him with his Faith like a Child...." ONE OBSERVATION THAT we have made is the special effects that bring the crucifix's statue of Jesus to life are very similar to that of the German silent picture, THE GOELEM (1920).THAT'S JUST AN observation and is not intended in any way to be derogatory to MARCELLINO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of Catholicism...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with some heart &amp; charm to it; I am a Bible-believing Christian, who does believe in miracles, and do believe that Jesus Christ is God the Son, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of world. Redemption and salvation are free through Him, and He is the Creator of all things.However, Catholicism is NOT Christian! By any historical, biblical, or spiritual elements. You have, of course, in the story, a boy talking to an IDOL of Jesus... which comes alive. lol wut? The 2nd Commandments (which Catholic "churches" omit) states, "You shall not make any graven images (idols."I'd say this is no more than a touchy, good-feeling propaganda film to try to pull at your heart strings that'll convince you to join Catholicism, which is the Great Whore spoken about in Revelation 17. I love catholics but hate the false catholic teachings and beliefs that are contrary to the Word of G-d . Jesus did NOT establish the catholic organization. Catholicism is unbiblical, anti-biblical and anti-Christian. The early church as described in the New Testament did the following: shared all things in common, relationships, support missionaries/ministers, teaching &amp; preaching, praying, worshiping, reading of&#xfeff; scripture, evangelism, fostering&#xfeff; spiritual gifts. Nowhere does the NT dictate fancy buildings, robes, repetitive prayer, a priesthood, Mary worship, worship of the dead, sectarianism, or any order of service, etc.. All these are MAN-MADE traditions ADDED ON. If i do not use any &amp; all opportunities to point out&#xfeff; the error of the catholic cult ( or Buddhist cult, Mormom cult, Hindu cult, Muslim cult, JW cult, etc. ) to you guys, then your blood is on my hands. Turn from the pope and instead trust Jesus ALONE. Catholicism is FAR&#xfeff; from the "church" that Jesus founded which taught love and forgiveness, where as it teaches idolatry and superstition. Jesus founded His church on what Peter SAID: "the Christ, the Son of the Living G-d ".While the Catholic "church" was seeking to control the world through religion, true Christians were running for their lives from the Catholic holocaust that ran for centuries. The Catholic empire murdered and killed Christians (like 50 million) who had a Bible in their house during the Middle ages. Because the satanic inspired papacy did NOT want people to read it.The Catholic "church" is heterodox &amp; corrupted by neo-Babylonian Semiramis paganism and is the Great Whore riding on the Beast of the book of Revelation. So yes there is a valid schism between Protestant Christians and the Roman Empire. The Empire is not following the Bible and has changed laws and times&#xfeff; (the Sabbath) so I grant there is a schism.Catholicism was responsible for the Crusades, with a corrupt pope and the knights of templar, it was an illuminate organized war... The ppl had no say, they weren't Christians,&#xfeff; just claimed they were. If they were real Christians they would have valued life &amp; not slain a million non-combatants, I understand why you have these anti-Christian views, because so many evil doors have claimed to be Christians &amp; raped the image of Christianity, it shouldn't be about religion like Catholicism, it should be about the Lord &amp; His great works &amp; Message."I believe the spreading of&#xfeff; Catholicism to be the most horrible means of political and social degradation left in the world."~ Charles Dickens3/10 for some heart, cute images, and pretty music. &#x200e;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Worth Seeing (Again)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A previous commentator regarded this movie as a piece of sick and twisted propaganda. While I can understand that point-of-view, the movie should also be viewed within its larger genre as well as a work of genuine film art. I also saw the film (twice) as a child who attended parochial school in the late 1950s and was tremendously affected by it, even haunted in a way, at the time. Back then, the nuns did not have the training to prepare children for films about children and death; I doubt many schools today would show the film to children 7 - 12 even though many children - ironically - routinely watch TV and videos that have violence and death as a regular feature. This film is deeply affecting precisely because the relationship to death is hinted at and never seen. Yes, this film seems somewhat manipulative, but mostly in the way the Church's distribution of it targeted children. However, that kind of overt propagandizing was pretty common in the middle years of the 20th century, and often much more crudely done than in this film. Seen from the perspective of either a child or an adult (at least in my memory of more than 40 years ago) there are many good things about the film. The cinematography I thought was quite good, the scene settings stark and simple yet emotionally appealing. The acting is also pretty good, especially the principal character of Marcellino, all the more so for a foreign language film (i.e., foreign at the time to this viewer). I really see this film as worthy of its genre, which I would put in a group with other magico-religious plays and films. All films are manipulative in some way. The fact that this film was used for religious propaganda at times does not, in my view, take away from its artistic power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reflections on "Marcelino"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film back in 1958, I was a somewhat pietistic adolescent and loved it and this sort of thing, as I had with "The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima." I went to it a number of times, as a kind of masturbatory ritual that reveled in new Jesus sightings.I recently re-watched the film, for the first time in its original Spanish version, and while there are a number of things in the movie that are truly appealing, it can also be viewed as a fairly sickening piece of religio-lachrymose schlock. My feelings are actually rather ambivalent. I like the occasional poetry of the piece, which suggests Rossellini's great "Francesco giullare di Dio." I like winsome bug-eyed Pablito Calvo as Marcelino. He seems to have won the heart of Europe, if not the world, when the movie came out. His winsome innocence, innate goodness, despite all the Dennis the Menace pranks, are appealing, and his search for a real mother and a real friend has all the poignancy associated with the life of a lonely orphan. The "Marcelino song" sequence as the young boy gets up one morning is quite tender and beautiful. The music score itself is one I like.As for Jesus-in-the-attic sitting down to talk with Marcelino and accept his gifts of bread and wine and then take him (give him death) so that he can see his mother in heaven, that is frightening and sentimental treacle. Perhaps Jesus might have done better if he had come down in to save the Spanish in their fratricidal civil war instead or bring the Jews of Auschwitz to see his mother. It's interesting that Pope Pius XII received actor Pablito Calvo in a special audience and watched the film. It must have brought tears to his eyes, the eyes that looked away from the Jews at Auschwitz.Perhaps none of this makes sense or is even fair, but they are thoughts that went through my head as I re-watched the film from a new adult perspective.One interesting thing for me is the actor Fernando Rey, who appears at the start and finish as the "narrating" monk. Six years later in 1961 he would star in the very anti-clerical film of Luis Bu?uel, "Viridiana," which leveled scathing criticism at exactly the kind of bathos dripping out of the treacle of Spanish and Latinate religiosity at its worst. Hmmmmmmmm! Come to think of it, a Spanish monk started the organization Opus Dei, marked by member self-flagellation and general fundamentalist intolerance.Watch "Marcelino" indeed. Enjoy it as I do much of it. (I've also seen the 1990s Italian version by Luigi Comencini, which is inferior to this one.) But examine the mind-set that produces this kind of thing and ask yourself some questions afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never knew whether this was one of those Catholic legends that a few people said they experienced and then it becomes written in stone as true, or this is just a movie; but a movie to teach....what? I saw this film when I was in about the third (early 60s). The nun who taught religion nearly went into rapture at viewing it~~~it scared the crap out of me, and the only part I remembered all these years was the end where Jesus KILLS THIS HEALTHY LITTLE BOY!! Our church had a crucifix with a life-sized body of Christ on it and for a long time after that, I was afraid to sit anywhere near the front of church for fear Jesus would reach down and snatch me away. What a terrible film to show young, impressionable children. I just happened to be flipping channels when I saw it on EWTN and wondered if it could possibly be the same movie (I couldn't remember the title) that had me paralyzed with fear when I was a child. It was.I have left the Catholic Church because of the variety of "events" which have occurred through the years. The last straw was the election of the most recent pope, a man who set the Roman Catholic Church back decades instead of moving it forward. I had long ago decided what I was taught in parochial school was a load of crap, written by men to control and frighten people. I am also thoroughly convinced that if priests had been allowed to be married all along, there wouldn't be all this.....well, you know.A movie like this just adds fuel to the fire of disgust that many "fallen away" Catholics feel towards the Church. Things need to change; I don't think anyone will disagree with me on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious horror tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1958, when I was in the fourth grade in a Brooklyn Catholic school, we kids were taken by the nuns to see a double-bill of "Marcelino Pan y Vino" and "The Song of Bernadette." It was perhaps the most morbid day of my life. I was deeply shocked and disturbed by this movie, and have never forgotten it. It seemed to have a similar impact on the other kids.In brief, the story: the orphan Marcelino is taken into a Spanish monastery, and begins to grow up amidst the mostly kindly monks. He is forbidden to enter a certain attic room, but does so anyway, and discovers an enormous crucifix with a typically gory figure of Christ. He apparently hallucinates that Jesus comes to life on the cross and accepts his gift of bread. The monks discover that he has entered the room, and are very angry with him. Later, Marcelino is fatally stung by a scorpion, and the monks give in to his plea to be taken to the attic room to see the crucifix. As he dies, Jesus comes alive again, leaves the cross and, enfolding Marcelino in his arms, ascends to heaven with the spirit of the little boy.Death, martyrdom, whatever you want to call it -- the theme is delivered to the viewer through a haze of superstition and fevered religiosity -- and the same is also true of "The Song of Bernadette." These movies were very inappropriate material for young students, and I have resented being forced to see them ever since.</fullReview>

This is of course a "must see".This precious fascist document portrays reality in such a distant way from the daily reality of that age that it can be compared, in some ways, to the propaganda-documentaries about alchool during American prohibitionism... with the difference that people would now laugh at that blatant manipulation of reality because they now achieved some higher consciousness about freedom (at least in their drinking habits) So we can see this movie is still "believed" probably by those who had no/little achievement of consciousness about mythologies and spirituality. Conservative ideologists, religious fanatics, nostalgics enclosed and suspended in their freezed bubble of childhood... they will probably all find it a "good" movie... and this tells us that the movie works, in the end, on people by thematic selection of their mind problems rather than offering an human and universal experience based on our common nature.My hope for a healthy humankind vanishes when I'm thinking at this kind of movies. When I'm thinking at the number of people who claimed to like this movie... I feel like the doom of mankind is going to be much worse than "just" total illness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the previous comments, this movie defies description. I guess it has been around for so long, people have forgotten its dark, sinister symbolism. Nowhere else have I ever seen a plot so intended in distorting truth by enveloping the plot in pure, unadulterated hogwash. I shudder to think that every year, hundreds of thousands of children and exposed to this extremely damaging movie. I do not believe in banning films, but this one should have a large, warning sign in big bold letters, even before the credits go on.</fullReview>
