		<fullReview>A remake of Marcel Carnes French film Le Jour Se Leve, with excellent performancies, Henry Fonda is very good in the leading role and Vincent Price at his smarmiest. Barbara Bel Geddes makes a very good debut as movie actress. The director Anatole Litvak have done the film with great flair, it has a nice feel to it and is interesting and dramatic. I think this film is very underrated and should receive more attention than it does, Sol Politos camerawork is very interesting and give some scenes a claustrophobic feeling with his use of light and shadow. If you like atmospheric, dramatic noir dramas I can recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just have to say... It seems as though every negative comment about this film starts out with "this is a bad REMAKE of..." Surely, I suppose it's nearly impossible to view THE LONG NIGHT as itself when you have already seen Marcel Carne's 1939 flick (and maybe even harder if you have created within yourself a dedication to anything foreign, slightly obscure, or non-Hollywood). The great thing about this movie, if one can get over the remake aspect of it, is that it is truly LOADED with great things! The set design and artwork are fantastic! Tiomkin's music is, once again, a fine creation! Polito's cinematography, camera work, and use of light are brilliant! Sure, the great story is, for the most part, taken from somewhere else, but the screenplay by the great John Wexley is excellent. I might be reading a bit to much into this, but I saw working class heroism, touches of popular justice, and just a hint of bourgeois deceit. The latter showed in the fantastic performance by Vincent Price as his character continued to try to sell a fantasy to Jo Ann (Barbara Bel Geddes) by means of magic and falsehood. All in all, I think this one is just like any good work of art: if you put a little into it, you can get a lot out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Long Night is a nearly excellent, if obscure, movie I recently discovered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to my local library to check some DVDs, I stumbled onto this obscure flick that starred Henry Fonda, Barbara Bel Geddes (in her film debut), Vincent Price, and Ann Dvorak. With that cast (I just remembered that Elisa Cook, Jr. has a memorable role as a blind man here), with Anatole Litvak as director, and Dimitri Tiomkin conducting his score (as well as some Beethoven pieces spread among it), I expected an excellent suspenseful movie and I got it! Well, maybe nearly so since the speech Ms. Bel Geddes says to Fonda at the end is obviously contrived to address the audience as well as the leading character about the faith of people. Otherwise, the dialogue was mostly spot-on especially the heated exchanges between Fonda and Price who, as usual, is absolutely charming even in his creepiness. And Ms. Dvorak marks a nice contrast with her cynicism as compared with Ms. Bel Geddes' optimism. Fonda himself goes the full range of emotions whether during the flashbacks or his present condition of being holed up in his apartment while the police are waiting outside. So for all that, I highly recommend The Long Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Partially successful noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Fonda goes through "The Long Night" after committing murder in this 1947 film noir directed by Anatole Litvak and also starring Vincent Price, Ann Dvorak and Barbara Bel Geddes. Fonda plays Joe, a returning veteran, now a blue collar worker who falls in love with young, pretty fellow orphan Jo Ann (Bel Geddes), only to come up against Price. Price plays Maximilian, a creepy magician with a show that features dogs and Charlene (Ann Dvorak). At first, Maximilian asks Joe to stay away from Charlene because she's his long-lost daughter and he wants better for her. From Charlene, Joe learns the truth - Maximilian is not her father, and she's attracted to his worldliness - though she claims to love Joe. Depressed, he turns to the sexy Charlene, his heart still with Jo Ann. During a fight in his apartment, he shoots Maximilian, and spends the entire movie under siege in his apartment as he relives in flashback and flashback within flashback what led him to this moment.Litvak, a talented director, stages this film in an interesting manner - it begins with a blind man (Elisha Cook Jr.) stumbling across the body of Maximilian in the hallway of the apartment building where he lives. Joe will not leave his room, and the police work throughout the film to get him out. The photography and direction capture the darkness and drabness of Joe's surroundings, the cheapness of the nightclub where Maximilian performs, and focuses a harsh light on Charlene's room and Charlene herself.Despite all of this great style, the film has a cheesy quality; the characters aren't really likable except for poor Joe; and the motivations of the characters aren't fully fleshed out, so the story ultimately doesn't make it. The acting is very good - Fonda shows us some still waters that run pretty deep in an excellently crafted performance. He's sexy as all get-out, too, when he lays down on Charlene's bed and smiles. Dvorak does a great job as a brittle Charlene, and Price is a complete sleazebag as the cruel Maximilian. Bel Geddes is incredibly young - this is her first film, and though she was 24 or 25, she looks and acts about 18, which is appropriate for this small-town, inexperienced girl."The Long Night" has some interesting elements, but because of a spotty script, we're not invested enough in the film for it to be really intriguing or exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't say The Long Night is a great film, and if anything it only peaks my interest more to see how much more classic the film it's based on is- Marcel Carne's La Jour se Leve. But for the time it ran, I was mostly glued to the screen, and got wrapped up in the plight of Henry Fonda's character Joe, and his predicament of his downfall from normalcy. It probably isn't very original, taking aside its connection with the French source; it's about a factory worker, very nice guy, who falls in love with a woman whom, he finds out, was an orphan just like him. But one night he follows her to a bar, sees her cavorting sort of with a sleazy magician (Vincent Price), and his perfect image of her is shattered, and grows only darker after he meets him (he first tells Joe he's her father, which is a truly great scene between two huge stars of classic film), and when she tells him about her history with him.While I could never take my eyes off the screen, it should be said that for all of the strong craftsmanship with the picture (it's one of the finest photographed 'noirs' of the late 40s, especially for those stark scenes of Joe alone in his room with the whole town on the street calling for him) and for all of the tremendous talent in front of the camera- besides Fonda and Price, who the former it's a splendid and rewarding if not best-ever performance and for the latter a triumph of playing sneaky and villainous, the girl playing Jo Ann (Barbara Bel Geddes) is very good- it only works up to a point. I was engrossed the most in the last twenty minutes or so, as the film revved up its pace and tempo to the "will Joe or won't Joe" beat. Before that, it's many scenes that mostly rely on the presence of the actors to uplift the material past the breezy and conventional air of the dialog. There's nothing especially "wrong" with the material, but it doesn't go anywhere aside from hitting its main points.The Long Night is something of a minor lost marvel- only recently did it come out on DVD in an OK print- and for Fonda and Price fans its a can't-miss kind of picture. Just don't go expecting anything that will change your perception of what film-noirs can go that don't go for the easy routes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Long Night The Long Night -odd suspenseful and surrealistic 1947 movie starring Henry Fonda as WW2 veteran and orphan .He works in a factory on subsistent wages- one day he meets the love of his life(Barbara Del Geddes) - a fellow orphan and flower delivery girl.It is obvious they belong together- but the catch is- she already has a suitor.Magician and full time liar(one of my favorite lines-"Why should I pay for having a superior imagination) Vincent Price is a total heel in this movie.The movie is told in flashback during a siege of Fonda's character - who shots Price in the first scene.Look for noir standout Elisha Cook,Jr. as the blind neighbor.This is a retelling of a 1939 French film- the DVD has clips comparing the 2 versions and a virtual essay on the production design.This was a riveting movie where I was hoping for the best and expecting the worst the whole time.It is imperfect- Fonda is tough and jaded - until he gets around the girl of his dreams- then he becomes a puppy dog- I found it charming-but I could see it annoying some folks.If you are looking for an older movie with a unique feel and compelling story - find this one.

		<shortDescription>Coded Remake Of Le Jour Se Leve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe one of these fine days I might get to see the French film, Le Jour Se Leve that The Long Night is based on that starred Jean Gabin and Arletty. Just reading the user comments from that board kind of tells me where The Long Night went wrong.Henry Fonda for one thing is horribly miscast in this film. This was a part better played by someone like John Garfield or Montgomery Clift. Either of those two might have better showed the angst that Fonda was feeling as Vincent Price ruins the woman of his dreams.The title The Long Night refers to Fonda holed up in a fourth top floor apartment after he shoots Vincent Price. The film opens with Price staggering out of Fonda's room at the boarding house and falling dead at the top of the stairs. The police investigate and Fonda shoots at them. They settle in for a long siege overnight. The reasons that led up to the homicide unfold in flashbacks.Price plays a Snidely Whiplash type villain. He's a nightclub entertainer with a magic act. Ann Dvorak is his many times around the track assistant, not a few of those times with Price and Barbara Bel Geddes is the young girl who Fonda falls for but Price seduces. Price overacts outrageously to cover the script defects.The problem with adapting Le Jour Se Leve to the American cinema seems to be the Production Code still firmly in place. What they could show in France, they could not show here. Made for an absurd plot.This and The Fugitive are Henry Fonda's two flop films in his post World War II period before going to Broadway and Mister Roberts. I'm sure he would love to have forgotten The Long Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say it ain't so Joe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Long Night" starts with nightclub magician Maximilian, Vincent Price, getting blasted as he falls down two fights of stairs right in front of blinded US Marine vet Frank Dunlap, Elisha Cook Jr. As it turns out Maximilian got blown away by Joe Adams, Henry Fonda, whom he paid a visit in his one room apartment at the Travelers Hotel.As the police surround the hotel and try to take Joe Adams into custody we get this long flashback in what happened that lead up to Maximilian getting rubbed out. We see in retrospect that Joe was involved romantically with flower girl Jo Ann, Barbara Del Grebbs, whom he met, delivering flowers, in the power plant that he works at as a sandblaster. As it turned out both Joe and Jo Ann were orphans and spent their formative years at the local Good Shepard Orphanage.As things started heating up for the two lovebirds, Joe &amp; Jo Ann, Maximilian suddenly dropped in-at the local nightclub "The Jungle"- and started to make a play for the very shy and sensitive Jo Ann. This lead Joe, in feeling that Jo Ann was two timing him, to get involved with Maximilian's former sidekick and assistant in his magic act Charlene, Ann Dvorak. Being the sensitive type himself, like Jo Ann, in not knowing whom his birth parents really are Joe in later having a mournful Maximilian confront him at a local diner is shocked to find out that Jo Ann is actually his, Maximilian's, daughter whom he abandoned at birth! The movie then goes from one flashback to another, and at one point even having a flashback within a flashback, where we and Joe find out what a first class BS artist Maximilian really is.It soon becomes evident that Maximilian is putting on an act to both confuse Joe and get into Jo Ann, who's as much his daughter as Joe is his son, pants! It's when Jo Ann tries to break off her relationship with the very determined and overbearing Maximilian that he goes to Joe's apartment and what happens there is whet we just got a glimpse off, with Maxiamilian getting blown away, what happened at the start of the film.In between the flashbacks, with Joe bearing his soul in the mess he got himself into, we have Joe holed up in his apartment holding off the entire city police force. It's only when Joe realizes that he's not alone in the world with Jo Ann and almost the entire town, in him being such a nice guy, coming to his defense that not only the cops but Joe himself cease firing giving himself a chance, in gunning down an unarmed man, to later prove his innocence in a court of law!***SPOILERS***You couldn't really feel that sorry for Joe in that not only did he put himself the local police as well as dozens of peoples lives, including Jo Ann, in jeopardy he acted like a real jerk in making himself out as the victim, in order to gain sympathy, in this whole scenario which in fact he wasn't. Talking about his experiences in the war and how he killed people in the defense of his country rang a bit hollow in his gunning down the totally helpless Maximilian who in fact handed him the gun that Joe shot and killed him with! Even though the movie ended with Joe giving himself up and looking like a hero, in gunning down an unarmed man?, we never got to see what the jury at his trial , after reviewing all the evidence in the case, final verdict was!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing performance by Henry Fonda in a neglected near-masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I've been digging into movies for 45 years without ever finding this gem. It's about as noir as it gets, in my book (taking the great definition from one of the guys over at Rara-Avis that hardboiled = tough, while noir = screwed). Henry Fonda is quite astonishing in a role that takes him from average Joe to suicidal killer. I think it's one of his very best performances, and I'm a GREAT admirer of his other performances. Barbara Bel Geddes is mousy but real as the na?ve young woman Fonda falls for. The only problem I had with the movie was Vincent Price's performance of an overwritten role. On one hand, it's exactly the kind of role Price normally excels in, but it's far too florid and phony for this kind of film. Watching his scenes with Fonda, it's like watching two movies at the same time--when the camera's on Price, it's "Forever Amber." When the camera's on Fonda, it's "Out of the Past." For the perfect version of this kind of pseudo-über-sophisticate in a noir setting, one need only look to Clifton Webb in "Laura." Webb made that character live and breath. Price orates. With his fey ways and foppish hairdo, he grated on my nerves. The character should very well do so in this film, but to me it was Price and the scripting of his character that were grating. But that's a mere cavil. This is a splendid film, digging as sort of an ancestor to "Blue Velvet" into the rot beneath the seemingly every day--the difference being that most of the people who populate the edges of this movie seem to be very decent and honorable. Anatole Litvak's direction and Sol Polito's brilliant photography surprised me in scene after scene with their classic yet innovative dark style. And crowning it all is Henry Fonda in yet another performance of a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moral melodrama, tight, fast, gorgeous--and offbeat but defining film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Long Night (1947)This Anatole Litvak movie is about four things: Henry Fonda, Sol Polito, and Le Jour se Leve.1) Fonda is a nice surprise here. He's got those sad, brooding, innocent expressions that make you hang in there for him alongside the young Barbara Bel Geddes, who is both demure and a screaming desperado in her support role. Fonda also has time of downright cheerfulness, and when you see him being lively and chipper you realize how often he is cast as a solid, sober, dignified type (from The Grapes of Wrath to 12 Angry Men, on and on).2) Polito is the cinematographer, and a great one (see any of his films for proof). He moves the camera up and down that stairwell, around the darkened room, through the crowded streets, on and on, really making the experience visceral and lyrical. It's no small feat. Watch.3) Le Jour se Leve is the 1939 French movie that is the basis for The Long Night. The writing for this Litvak version is really sharp (and a couple times, hilarious in the best way), and they make the most of the original idea, of a man thinking over his crime and the causes for it. Which bring up number four, the essence of film noir. We often think of "film noir" as a style, and this one has lots of night shooting and deep shadows. It's also sometimes a period, which is mostly post World War II (so late 1940s into the 1950s). One of the key elements to classic noir is the idea of a man alone, out of step with the world, often vulnerable to a woman (or two) who may or may not have such good intentions. And this man represents the returning soldier, who in reality was out of step with the new booming America.4) So here we have a textbook example, a soldier who was forced to do his murderous job during the war and now faces an America that he can't quite fit into. The struggle is all on the surface here (even the crowds make clear they are ready to support him through his adjustment), and even though there are no classic noir lines from some detective hardboiler, and even though Fonda is no Mitchum or Bogart, this is a perfect noir in other ways, and more about inner human struggles than external drama. Is it good? Yes, for all these reasons. It's not flawless (Vincent Price is an odd presence, but if you like Price you'll enjoy him, too), but it has its flawless aspects, and is guaranteed to move you. For many men in a 1947 audience, it had to have been gutwrenching and inspiring. And it still is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange, unsatisfying movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen bad movies. This is not a poorly made movie. But it's bad nonetheless.Why? I asked myself as I sat through it, never bored for one minute. The black and white cinematography is often quite good. The acting, at least Henry Fonda's and Vincent Price's, is good, given what they had to work with.The script, certainly, is terrible. Far too many things don't make sense. At the end, when all those men down below are calling up to Fonda saying that they're his friend and that they will help him, you remember that in all that preceded the end he had been shown as a loner with no friends. Where did all those very devoted friends come from all of a sudden? And how could Barbara Bel Geddes' character be so na?ve as to go on trips with a man who had "forced his affections on her"? There is a limit to innocence, after all.I kept having the feeling that there was a LOT of script that had for some reason never been shot, that we were missing out on a lot of details that would have made sense of some of what remained.I honestly can't think of any reason to recommend this movie to anyone. I very much like Anatole Litvak's better movies - that's why I rented this one - but even so I found this very disappointing. Maybe if you're a fanatic about b&amp;w cinematography you could ignore the plot and just watch the picture. Best to turn off the sound if you do.I can't imagine why anyone would have made this movie, nor how anyone could have imagined it stood any chance of making any money.Postscript: Having now seen the French original on which this movie was very closely based, Le jour se l?ve, I understand the reason the script of the American one so often makes no sense: puritanism. In the French movie, the young woman, Françoise, has evidently had an on-again, off-again affair with the animal trainer (Vincent). Jean Gabin's character, the one played by Henry Fonda, finds out about it. In fact, he shoots the animal trainer (Vincent Price's character) when this latter threatens to tell him about their sex life together.The French movie is very beautiful, a real masterpiece. Everything makes sense. Including the end, which is the one thing they completely changed for the American version. I won't spoil the French movie by telling you what it is, but I will say that it is both very powerful and astoundingly beautifully filmed.Don't waste your time on The Long Night. Yes, there are some good touches in it, but by the time they have taken all the sex out, what remains makes no sense. See Le jour se l?ve. It's a powerful masterpiece.And if you have seen The Long Night, make SURE you see Le jour se l?ve. The very different end will overwhelm you, as it just did me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both interesting and underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Fonda, Vincent Price and the film noir genre are reasons enough to see any film, and The Long Night did show a lot of promise. I didn't find that the The Long Night quite delivered enough, but it certainly has a lot of good things. It's very well made for starters, one of the most beautifully shot and visually atmospheric film noirs of the 1940s in my opinion. Dmitri Tiomkin's music is far from his best work with a lot of it sounding like re-arranged Beethoven(you decide whether you consider that a compliment, but it is very haunting and fits the film very well. But the high point of The Long Night was the acting. Henry Fonda gives an intelligently sensitive lead performance, and Barbara Bel Geddes- managing to look younger than she was- in her film debut is very touching as the love interest. Ann Dvorak is deliciously cynical, and Vincent Price is effortlessly ominous and smarmy as an utter sleaze-bag of a character(people will argue that he was at odds at the rest of the film but I rest the blame on the writing not Price). The Long Night does have faults though, the characters are not fleshed out enough to make me care for them(I would have cared more for Joe if the "when he's in jeopardy" scenario had been made less emotionally hollow and senseless), while the script is of rather rambling quality with Bel Geddes' final speech particularly contrived-sounding. The Long Night also lacks momentum pace-wise- well the final twenty minutes picks up a bit but comes too late- and the constant switching back from past to present and vice versa is enough to cause confusion. There are even some ideas like with Joe and Charlene's involvement with one another that are shoehorned in but not explained satisfactorily. So in conclusion, interesting for the cast and how it was made, but with stronger script and story execution it would've been less underwhelming than it turned out to be. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is one big tease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original French film upon which this film was based, but I can tell you I kept waiting for a plot line payoff that never came. It has everything going for it - solid cast giving good believable performances, good direction, even a good speech that Fonda's character delivers from this broken out window as he is under siege by the police that gives us some insight into what it's like for an average guy who has returned home from years of killing and seeing killing in the war expected to pick up where he left off. But ultimately, I never see anything that Fonda's character, factory laborer Joe Adams, has been put through as far as shock or emotional torment or even disillusionment that would justifiably cause him to kill a man. Is Vincent Price's character Maximillian eloquently taunting and creepy? Yes, and in a way that Price excelled at over the years starting in noirs and proceeding on into his horror films. However, at no time does he do anything that would drive anybody to do more than shoo him away or stuff earplugs in their ears or possibly call the ASPCA (You'll have to watch the film to understand this last remark). I'm giving this film a five just for the fact that I believe the production code is the reason any hard edges that seem to be just under the surface never appear. I'm almost positive the script would have gone further if the censors would have allowed it to be so.The real point of interest to me was the action of the police, who behave a lot like the fascists that Joe Adams spent years fighting in WWII. Sure they have a murderer holed up in his rented room, but he's holding no hostages, they've emptied the building, and still they spray him twice with automatic gunfire unannounced - once from the outside into his window, then from the stairwell into the door. When he pushes a sturdy dresser against the door and they realize they can't force their way in THEN they try talking to Joe, starting with the line "We're not fooling"?? No kidding! After Fonda's speech to the crowd, once the crowd starts voicing their support for Joe and promising financial help with a lawyer the police form a line and practically trample the crowd forcing them out of the street. I don't know if the heavy handedness of the police was something that Litvak wanted the audience to notice, but it was something I noticed.I'd recommend this one just for the good performances and atmosphere and some imagery you don't see that much in films immediately after WWII, but don't expect something shocking or even interesting to happen just because of all of the talent assembled here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational film debut of Barbara Bel Geddes in gripping noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting aside the fact that this film is a remake of a French classic by Marcel Carne, and trying to judge it independently, it is a superb noir production. It most notable element is a spectacular film debut by Barbara Bel Geddes as the innocent victim of a sleazy seducer (Vincent Price at his oiliest), who starts out frozen from her traumatic origins in an orphanage and ends up screaming her heart out with all the passion of first love. Geddes holds back in the first half of the story, refusing to accept or engage with Henry Fonda, who has declared his love for her so readily. Not only does she find it difficult to trust him, but she is in thrall to a dream created by the master illusionist Price. Fonda does very well in this film, being less droll than usual, and actually manages to convince us that he is emotionally engaged rather than a bemused spectator. The fantastic amount of firepower trained on him as he is holed up in his room in a boarding house, and the readiness of the police to shoot first and think later, is horrifying. I found it bizarre in the extreme that the music credit on the film stated 'Music composed and conducted by Dimitri Tiomkin', when most of it was a dumbed-down re-scoring by Tiomkin of the second movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. That is really an outrageous 'steal'. Anna Dvorak is very good indeed in this film as Charlene, who has seen it all and then some, falls for Fonda but takes it on the chin when she sees he doesn't see her. But the film must have been seriously cut, because at one point, we see Fonda throwing himself onto Charlene's bed with a very familiar air, obviously being her lover, but the dialogue makes no overt reference to there even being a meaningful relationship. Clearly a gutted script! If you look too hard, you will see a lot of holes in the story and the action. But this film is pulled off satisfactorily anyway, is gripping and because of Geddes, is also moving.</fullReview>

Fonda plays another one of his "everyman" roles but is more of a lost puppy than usual in this depressingly dark noir directed without his usual style by Anatole Litvak.The first twenty-five minutes had me wanting to switch the movie off, it was so poorly constructed. I found it impossible to watch the whole thing.If any kind of film noir is your thing, you may stick around to see the whole movie. I found it a frustrating waste of time and certainly not a film that Fonda or Bel Geddes should be proud to have on their resume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry is WWII vet still getting his feet on the ground after the Big One, Price is womanizing magician, Bel Geddes is naive young thing and Dvorak is jaded showgirl. Right off the bat Price comes stumbling out of Fonda's apartment with a bullet in his gut, the rest of the film covers police attempts to take out Fonda and flashbacks of how we got here. Fonda is good if a little overdone in the Everyman role, Price is great as always as the slick dirtball, but Bel Geddes steals the show as vulnerable, sincere Jo Ann. Nice bit roles also abound, including the always welcome Elisha Cook as a blind neighbor. Movie makers today wouldn't have the patience to tell this type of story this way, but it works well here. My 12 and 8 year olds were entranced by this movie, which we saw on a trip, that's a rare haul for a black and white crime drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Long Night is a Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Long Night is a classic noir story of a man and a woman, and the other man who comes between them. The title comes from the fact that Joe Adams (Henry Fonda), our protagonist, is holed up high in an apartment building while the police in the town square below try to flush him out. Most of the action takes place as flashbacks.Joe seems to live on the edge of society. He meets Jo Ann (Barbara Bel Geddes), a young inexperienced woman who is also a misfit. In her way, she lives on another edge of society. Their relationship becomes complicated by the presence of a mysterious older man, Maximillian the Great (Vincent Price), who has dazzled her with his charms and his knowledge of a larger world.We find that Maximillian is a selfish, conniving liar whose intentions are never honorable. But he is somewhat intelligent and seems to understand the psychology of others. As a result, he gets away with a lot. But it is only a matter of time before Joe and Maximillian must come into conflict.Like all noir films, The Long Night is largely filmed in shadows. This is done very stylishly. The mood is also heightened by some crafty camera work and the fantastic score. Note how near the end of the film Jo Ann must operate in the shadows, entering the world of the men.To tell any more of the story would ruin it. I will just add that I found the performances of Fonda, Price and Bel Geddes to be among their best. Price, in particular, has an air of smarmy evilness that makes this film more than it otherwise would have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provides an unusual role for Henry Fonda, but the plot is seriously lacking...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Americanized version of "Le Jour se Leve" from 1939 has Henry Fonda cast as a straight-laced boarding-house resident who is taunted and prodded by the decadent magician who has eyes for his well-scrubbed girlfriend, resulting in violence. Peculiar melodrama (with noir-ish overtures) has flashes of grit and atmosphere to spare, but a plot rife with flashbacks (one of which overlaps into another). Some amazing moments, but it feels watered-down, blunted. The emotional state of the street crowd outside Fonda's window isn't used to point up the central action--they seem to gather only to hear Henry make a corny, impassioned speech. Nevertheless, Fonda does well with an atypical character, though Vincent Price's shady showman and Barbara Bel Geddes' love-interest are left deprived by the weak writing. It certainly looks good, and the finale doesn't tidy things up too much. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holed up in his apartment after committing a murder, a depressed war veteran engages in a gun battle with the police while reflecting on the circumstances that led to the situation. It sounds intriguing on paper, but the script is rather sloppy, featuring flashbacks within flashbacks. It's basically an uninteresting story with dull characters. Fonda tries to make something of his role, but is given little to work with. Bel Geddes makes an impressive film debut, and Dvorak and Price are also fine, but they are all let down by the screenplay. Litvak has made better films, but here his staging of police work and the shootout is poorly executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-Seen but Seminal Film-Noir?Expressionistic and Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nerve Racking and powerful Film-Noir can be seen as a Seminal Work and a very accurate display of the Noir Tropes that defined the Genre.The Film is exquisitely Photographed using Forced Perspective and is bathed in shadows and a Working Class Environment. The Script is also purely Working Class with its Small Town, Dirty Template of trains, smoke stacks, and seedy Hotels.Henry Fonda and Barbara Bel Geddes are Orphans who find each other among the "barely making enough to survive" World. Fonda's Joe has just returned to "Civilization" from the War and there is much Dialog about the experience and semi-traumatic residue of the Veteran. Vincent Price is a Fake Intellectual, Liar and Lech.Dimitri Tiomkin's Score comes close to overwhelming some scenes but is effective most of the time. The Supporting Cast of Ann Dvorak, Elisha Cook, Charles McGraw, and others all lend superior support. A Minor Nitpick may be the accelerated pace of some of the Dialog that at times is a bit breathtaking.The Movie's strong suit is the sometimes Expressionistic frame and the strong Acting and Melodramatic Story. It is an Off-Beat, Interesting, and Little Seen Film that is a Must-See for Fans of Film-Noir, Henry Fonda, and the Post-War Milieu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brief review of "Decision Before Dawn", "Sorry, Wrong Number" and "The Long Night", three films by director Anatole Litvak.Born in the Ukraine, Litvak's career as a film-maker took him from Russia to Germany to France and eventually to Hollywood, where he became a contract director for Warner Bros. He directed "Decision Before Dawn, regarded as one of his finest pictures, in 1951. It tells the tale of Happy (Oskar Werner), a German soldier who, in 1944, defects and becomes an Ally double agent. At the command of American Colonel Devlin (Gary Merrill), Happy embarks on a mission deep behind German lines."Decision Before Dawn" was one of many Hollywood films released in the 1950s which attempted to rehabilitate Germans as "now our allies". Like the similarly themed "The Big Lift" (1950), it boasts superb location photography, Litvak filming in actual cities still scarred by war and still littered will real WW2 machinery. Whilst the film's promises of complexity are eventually betrayed, Litvak's establishing shots, handling of spaces and architecture, his grand outdoor vistas and a beautifully dour performance by Oskar Werner, elevate things tremendously. Werner would milk similar material in Martin Ritt's 1963 masterpiece, "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold". Today, "Decision Before Dawn" plays like a rebuke to Litvak's own "Confessions of a Nazi Spy" (1939), one of the first blatantly anti-Nazi films.Released in 1947, and a remake of Marcel Carne's superior "Le Jour Se Leve", Litvak's "The Long Night" stars Henry Fonda as Joe Adams, a man who blockades himself in an apartment following the murder of Maximillian the Great (Vincent Price), a nightclub magician. Via flashbacks we delve into the circumstances which led to this crime.Typical of Litvak, "The Long Night" boasts audacious camera work. Litvak's whip-pans, cranes, clever forced perspectives and snaking cameras were novel for the era, and his locations drip with atmosphere. While beautiful in a clinical way, Litvak's visuals still can't match Carne's poetic realism and the gauzy romantic humanism which made "Le Jour Se Leve" so famous. Litvak's film ? noirish and brooding ? also ends on a note of optimism, a reversal of the Carne's more downbeat ending. The film was a financial flop.Litvak released "Sorry, Wrong Number" (1948) a year later. A precursor to high-concept, modern thrillers, "Number" stars Barbara Stanwyck as Leona, a crippled woman who overhears a murder plot on her telephone. From her bedroom ? the film's base of operations ? Litvak's camera embarks on a dizzying quest to avert the crime, dipping into the past, different locations, through telephone lines and back out again."Sorry, Wrong Number" was based on a Lucille Fletcher radio play, which Litvak's aesthetic attempts to break free from. He glides from New York suites to State Island beaches to Manhattan skylines, but the film's print-oriented origins are hard to escape. Interestingly, Stanwyck's character is revealed to suffer from psychosomatic issues, and it is her very own flights-of-fancy, her constricting nature (epitomised by her crippled legs) which results in the film's central crime. Leona smothers her lover (Burt Lancaster), wants to make him as immobile as she is, a fact which pushes him into criminality. Throughout the film, Leona's stationariness is thus contrasted with the film's countless telephones and telephone wires, devices which seem to enable and amplify Leona's neuroses. Rather than connecting her to the outside world, these wires alienate Leona further, wrapping her up in paranoia and further illusions of control. Litvak followed "Number" up with "The Snake Pit", "Wrong Number's" thematic mirror image.7.5/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "Young Man With a Horn" (1950) and "The Clock" (1945).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barbara Bel Geddes and Henry Fonda perfectly matched and convincing as the victims of Vincent Price.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess the ambition behind this film was to make it better than the original, that is the French "Le jour se l?ve" by Marcel Carné with Jules Berry outstanding as the crook with the tragic hero Jean Gabin and his heart-breaking love Arletty in the greatest of French melodramas. In all films with Jean Gabin he dies in the end. Henry Fonda does not and is a somewhat more prosaic and convincing tragic hero, more humanly credible, than Jean Gabin's great cliché. Barbara Bel Geddes as his love is even more down to earth, a very palpable orphan girl displaying total honesty all the way, while Vincent Price as the crook, here a magician and expert trickster and con man living by professional lies all the way, is more subtle than Jules Berry but less of a character, the least convincing of the three. Ann Dvorak, on the other hand, makes an impressing sub and plays a very important part in triggering Henry Fonda up to his total fury, which simply must be sympathized with, which also the crowd does, which is expertly filmed. On the whole, the direction in this film is as marvelous as in any Anatole Litvak film, he knows like Elia Kazan how to handle people and make them convincing in probably some very deep knowledge of human nature, which makes this film a great experience to live through. To all this comes the music, Beethoven's seventh in fantastic arrangements, different every time, which adds to the moody dark atmosphere growing and ominously building up towards the inevitable catastrophe - the music puts the last touch to the masterpiece. I have to admit it, I felt the Jean Gabin film rather overrated, slow, heavy and even partly boring, but this simpler but more efficient American version is not. I have to give it ten points, even though it's no more than a humbler remake of one of the most famous of all noirs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like remakes--and that is why I waited so long to watch "The Long Night". Originally it was a dandy French film ("Le Jour Se Leve") and I saw no reason to redo the film, as the original was quite good. And, after seeing it, I stick by my original opinion--there just wasn't a need to make this remake. However, I can understand why they made it, as folks in the States back in the 1940s did not watch foreign films--and when they saw this American version, it did seem original. But now with DVDs, Turner Classic Movies and Netflix, you should just stick with "Le Jour Se Leve".The film is a talky picture about a brooding guy (Henry Fonda), his sweetie-pie (Barbara Bel Geddes) and a completely bizarre blabber-mouth (Vincent Price). Fonda and Bel Geddes are in love but Price is determined to break them up--and push Fonda to the breaking point. The story is told through flashbacks and is similar to the Jean Gabin film--without the film noir camera-work and lighting. Also, the American version comes off as much talkier--much. All in all, not a terrible film at all--but not the 9 that the other film deserved when I rated it a couple years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Long Night is directed by Anatole Litvak and written by Jacques Viot and John Wexley. It stars Henry Fonda, Barbara Bel Geddes, Vincent Price, Ann Dvorak and Howard Freeman. Music is by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Sol Polito.A man is shot and falls down the stairs, as the police surround the apartment of the apparent murderer, Joe Adams (Fonda), a siege unfolds and Joe reflects on the circumstances that led him to this situation.Think we'll just about make it.A remake of Marcel Carne's La Jour se Leve (Daybreak), The Long Night is a sweaty and sullen film that also comes cloaked with noirish atmosphere. Essentially the plot is driven by a love triangle, but there is nothing remotely corny or melodramatic about this fact. Story is told via Joe Adams in flashback, and in some cases flashbacks within flashbacks, this format gives the narrative some real edge, a complexity that sidles up nicely to the troubled emotional state of Joe as he sits holed up in his cheap hotel room, chain smoking and pondering the hand that life has dealt him since returning from service in the war. There's intelligent asides in the writing involving the act(s) of killing, a skew-whiff expectation of womanhood and a dangled carrot by way of hope for the common man in a new dawn of Americana. Litvak already had Carne's excellent template to work from, his job here is to get powerful performances from his cast and let Polito work his photographic skills. In that respect it's a triumph for the director. Some have said Fonda is miscast, he really isn't and his tortured performance underpins the grim nature of the story. Price is at his magnificent best, all smarm and charm and rightly bringing the creeping ham to the character. Bel Geddes is sweetly enigmatic, the perfect foil for Fonda's confused emotions, and Dvorak has the tart with a heart portrayal down pat; with legs so beautiful they could start a war as well! Polito is the ace card, serving up some striking images in moody black and white, be it an industrial working class back drop of cement mixers and steel works, or filtered lighting of a stairwell, his photography perfectly marries up with the psychological depth pulsing from the human characters.The PCA pleasing ending stinks and annoys in equal measure, and we of course want more for Elisha Cook Jr and Charles McGraw than the secondary supporting slots they get, but this is still a fine movie that holds its noir head up high in a year that would prove to be one of the best noir years ever. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Henry Fonda performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not familiar with this film when it turned up on TCM, but I'm glad I didn't skip over it. It's a darned good "sort of" film noir, which for the most part seems rather realistic.Henry Fonda is excellent here as a WWII vet for whom things quickly go down hill, despite being well-liked by virtually everyone. And that's why his performance is so good -- he plays a wide variety of emotions here -- joy, love, despair, anger -- each done effectively.Barbara Bel Geddes made her film debut here, having come from Broadway. She was always a very different actress, as you see here, but quite effective. Ann Dvorak has an odd role here as a sort of "the other woman", and former state assistant to a magician. She is quite effective, as well. I'm not sure what to make of Vincent Price here. As the magician, and a liar, he is quite creepy, but I can't quite decide on the quality of his performance. One problem is that his makeup is quite distracting, and I think poorly done. So while he is supposed to be older and more mature, his skin looks very young while his hair is gray.One of the things that was done very effectively here was the telling of the story through flashbacks, including at one point a double-flashback! That technique is, in my view, often overdone. But here it is the perfect way to tell the whole story. Bravo to the screenwriters and the director! The score for this film is supposed to be notable...by Dimitri Tiompkin. Well, I don't see it as being notable...just overly loud and oppressive. And, that's odd. A film score is meant to compliment a film, not overpower it. And, I generally like Dimitri Tiompkin.Although the ending is not quite satisfying, this is a very good film that will keep you watching! Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a disastrously bad remake of a charming French movie. The cast is promising and the director is a fine one. He is Anatol Litvak and they include Henry Fonda, Barbara Bel Geddes, Ann Dvorak, and Elisha Cook, Jr. Sounds as if it couldn't miss, right? It does miss, though, and by a mile. What I watched seems to have been patched together from reels and reels of footage. When the action doesn't make sense, there are voice-overs.Henry Fonda was one of America's finest actors but he seems at sea as the bitter war vet here. Bel Geddes is good but it's a little hard to buy her as a poor, ignorant, little innocent. Hey, this was going to be the original Maggie the Cat! Ann Dvorak is wasted in a decent-sized role, for which I trust she got well compensated financially. She wears a dark wig that does nothing for her looks or charming pathos.One minute Fonda appears to be shacking up with her and the next he is swearing his eternal love for Bel Geddes. Things must have been cut and the remainder reassembled sloppily.I don't know anything about the history of the movie. Maybe all of it was lost and this is a total reconstruction by the estimable Kino. If that is the case, my hat is off to them. It's not good but it's historically intriguing; and may they do many, many more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very inconsequential, and it takes the long way round. Despite the bizarre structure, which involves multiple flashbacks, and characters having flashbacks within other characters flashbacks (!), the characters are so hunky-dory as to be objectionable... mockable. This is mainstream morality. It's movies like this that gave generations of women "good girl" complexes, convinced these dreary wall-flowers were role models. Audiences (of saps) in this milieu are captivated by a crappy magic show performed by 'classy' Vincent Price. Fonda is achieving fame in this era not for great acting, but for naturalistically embodying defeated characters who pontificate.People debate whether certain movies are noir or not - noir style does cross multiple genres. But I'd argue that this is not noir. There's nothing edgy about it. Maybe it's chick noir. But there's no new, post-war morality to be found in it. It's as dark as a Hallmark card. By the end its becomes some very weird, trippy, long-winded mix of Meet John Doe and As the World Turns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly an entertaining piece of film. It does have a bit of time getting to the point and Fonda's character is unyielding to a fault. Vincent Price has made the mistake of not only winning, but feeling the need to rub someone's face in it. He did seem a bit surprised when Fonda shot him. The movie is told in several flashbacks and works pretty well. Barbara Bel Geddes is pretty emotional. Why are movie guys so stuck in sacrificial mode. The guy had to know that the authorities had no choice but to arrest him and possibly shoot him. Unless his lower class status was so overwhelming, it seems he would have had a reasonable chance. Anyway, it's a tense little piece of entertainment. Cagney might have been better, but Fonda's big sad eyes fill the bill.</fullReview>

He is essentially a beaten down character, at war with society who vacillates between pessimism and optimism.Bel Geddes is outstanding especially in the latter part of the film. Her justification for living would ever serve as an inspiration to Bishop Fulton J. Sheen.Ann Dvorak, as the mysterious Charlene, is also quite good.

Unfortuantly, the plot simply didn't transfer from the fresh version; and it just seems absurd, dull, and unconvincing. This was Hollywood trying to get at the problems in the lives of the little people; yet the story reeks of cheap melodrama. Vincent Price was an interesting actor who tended to work in a part or not. This is one of his worst performances, his last scene is laughable. Fonda is assured in the lead but by the time of his big scene we have already written off the trite story.
