		<shortDescription>Before the flood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was one of the last French masterpieces of the thirties just before the war.Marcel Carné was accused of pessimism and the movie was quickly forbidden by the military censorship that used to say in 1940:"if we've lost the war,blame it on "Quai des Brumes""(Carné's precedent movie.The director answered:"you do not blame a barometer for the storm"). "Le jour se l?ve " is,if it's possible,darker than its predecessor. From the very beginning,the hero,a good guy (Gabin) is doomed,his fate is already sealed,because the tragedy has already happened .That's why the movie is a long flashback.The memories are brought back on the screen with an astounding virtuosity by some elements of the set (the teddy bear for instance).Only three main characters outside that of Gabin,the evil one (Berry who was to play the devil in "les visiteurs du soir "1942),the lucid one (Arletty) and the ambiguous one (Jacqueline Laurent).The latter providesthe only flaw of the movie:Laurent acts Françoise as the innocent pure girl,however Carné leaves no doubt about her relations with Berry. A remake was made by Anatole Litvak with Henry Fonda ,Barbara Bel Geddes and Ann Dvorak (who must have been studying Arletty's acting for a long while),called "the long night" with an absurd happy end. Needless to say,it's the French Carné movie that you've got to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragedy of everyday proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We see a man shot; who he is and why we don't know. The murderer has locked himself inside his room. Police are forced to shoot in, trying to get him to surrender. The story then proceeds in flashback.Marcel Carné directs this famous French film starring Jean Gabin. The two had worked together the previous year on "Le quai des brumes", a film well known then and now. If you are unfamiliar with Gabin, he was to the late 1930's in France what Bogey would be shortly in America, only Bogey with a soupçon of Cagney. More animated than Bogart, but less than Cagney with his agile song-and-dance-man side. A tough guy who's actually a good guy.Now, a soft-hearted tough guy who's surrounded by police -- that could also describe Bogart's breakthrough film, "High Sierra", from 1941, and perhaps there is some superficial similarity.However, this story is mostly a tale of love affairs and working class life -- that's really where its interest lies. There's a real sympathy here for the common man, when even a modest house on a rutted street would seem beyond his reach.This film's original reputation may have been based at least in part on its Gallic openness about sexual matters. It's quite outré by the Anglo-Saxon standards of 1939. Regardless, the justly celebrated "Le jour se l?ve" has a poetic quality overall, and a memorably ironic final shot of the kind we don't seem to see quite often enough anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful performances and cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fantastic film, which plays with the emotions of the spectator while stunningly portraying the feelings of a pent-up man whose end echoes his pent-up life in the city. The film is beautifully shot in black and white and is a perfect example of French realism, with a modernist time disorientation tossed in for good measure. I found the performances by Jean Gabin and a showgirl with whom he gets involved (played by Arletty)to be strong, portrayed with a kind of hopeless, clutching pathos. Worth it simply for the beautifully constructed final shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carné gave eloquent voice to a mood of fatalistic, romantic pessimism?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late '30s and early '40s, the films of Marcel Carné gave eloquent voice to a mood of fatalistic, romantic pessimism? After the war, however, his career was a sad shadow of its former self? Central to Carné and Prévert's conception of doomed love was Jean Gabin's proletarian antihero, trapped in darkened rooms and foggy streets while awaiting retribution for crimes he barely knew he might commit: in "Quai des Brumes," Gabin's deserter comes violently up against local gangsters in a battle over the girl with whom he has fallen suddenly, passionately in love; in "Le jour se Léve," surrounded by police but unable to contemplate surrender, he recalls the events leading to his shooting of a girlfriend's seducer? Widely described as poetic realism, Carné's style is in fact anything but realist; the squalor, shadows, and smoky bars all externalize the hero's melancholy resignation to an unjust Destiny? Without Carné's expert control of atmosphere, the effect might seem merely picturesque, for rarely have solitude, alienation and death been imbued with such elegance and beauty?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carne and Prevert on a roll; hot on the heels of 'Quai des Brumes' comes this, next up will be Les Visiteurs du Soir' and THAT will be followed by 'Les Enfants du Paradis'. Get out of that, John Ford/Dudley Nichols. Where do you start with something like this, someone send a Runner for a new set of superlatives. Start with the heavy? Jules Berry, they don't come any oilier, he'd already scored in a previous Prevert script, 'Le Crime du Monsieur Lange' with Renoir on bullhorn and he used this as a warm-up for his Satan in 'Visiteurs'. Arletty? Garance-in-Waiting, 'Hotel du Nord' behind her, 'Visiteurs/Enfants' to follow. Gabin? What can I say. Even Nat Cole didn't have a trio like this. To quote the title of an earlier (1935) Gabin vehicle this was truly La Belle Equipe. How Hollywood could cast Hank Fonda in the Gabin role is beyond me. Hank, 'aw shucks' Fonda, niceness personified as decent but RUGGED Gabin? Come on, already. Vincent Price plays Jules Berry? Get real! Sandy Trauner's brilliant apartment building sets the tone here from frame #1. What an opening, Jules Berry exiting Gabin's room and running out of breath. Crowd assembling. Nowhere-To-Go Gabin holed up in his 10 by 6 reminiscing in Gitane time. Never had a chance, life's a bitch and then you die. Basically that's all there is to it. But, as someone once said, it's the way you tell them. Brilliant in spades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and unique storytelling makes great and unique movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thing that this movie is best known and appreciated for is its unique way of storytelling. It's one of the very first movies that features a story that gets mostly told with flashbacks and it keeps switching back between past and present. This storytelling technique was later made more famous and popular by Orson Welles with his masterpiece "Citizen Kane".But of course a movie requires a bit more than just some good storytelling, though it still remains a very important aspect. But this movie also has a great, quite simplistic movie, with still a lot happening in it, like only the French could make. It's a bit of a sweet love-story, that shows the events leading up to a fatal shooting. Some people will call this movie slow but hey, that was just the way movies were back in its days. But it's not like it's slow pace ever makes the movie a boring or dragging one, or at least not to me. It might had been the case if the movie had been a bit longer but with its running time around 90 minutes, it's simply a short movie to watch.It's also one beautiful looking movie, that features some great cinematography and especially lighting. Shadows play in important part in the movie its visual look. Amazing thing about its cinematography is that the movie actually had 4 different cinematographers attached to it. No idea what the story is behind this but I guess that each used their own specialty for this movie, or some of them simply got fired or stepped up during production. Anyway, whatever was the case, it really didn't hurt the movie its visual look. Marcel Carné movies often were visually a real pleasure to watch and this movie forms no exception on this.It's also a movie that quite heavily relies on its actors to tell its story and to deliver its great dialog, that got specially written by poet scenarist and songwriter Jacques Prévert. And this movie luckily had some great actors to work with. At the time Jean Gabin really was one of the best French actors. He really did his best work in the '30's and starred in some other classics such as "Pépé le Moko" and "La grande illusion" during the same decade.Some great and unique storytelling equals a great and unique movie.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French cinema at its best. Ideas of freedom, entrapment, isolation and realism wound into a great film which is carried by Gabin from the opening scene of the murder, through flashbacks he has remembered to the amazingly brutal final shot. Gabin and Laurent in the factory near the beginning of the movie is poetic realism at its most involving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is it about French films that makes them so special?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something so lyrical about the tale of the doomed François portrayed by the great Jean Gabin that even in its hardest luck moments you feel you are watching poetry in motion.In addition, Le Jour se Leve is a character study with all the contradictions that tend to go with pained souls like François' - except that there is a further depth that renders the film quite universal, a depth made of little moments in human relationships and the flaws that gently emerge but only renders the humans involved more endearing.Still, all that glitters is not gold: the apparently pure Françoise has actually been bedded by M. Valentin (Berry); and the police are more interested in getting their man than in saving him.The direction is precise and inspired, resorting to the then much used flashback technique but never allowing it to dominate the film.The photography - well, it is gorgeous and it gives the film its expressionistic ambiance. Finally, Gabin - one of the greatest actors ever in one of his greatest roles. Need one say more?The ending can be predicted from the moment François kills a visitor in his apartment but that aside it is a film full of cinematographic treasures, acting to gape at, and a quality of direction that is seldom seen these days. A must see for anyone who cares about movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the main setting of "le Jour Se Leve" is the top floor of a french apartment. the film opens with Jean Gabin character Francois - a factory worker- killing a dog trainer named Valentin who we find out (as the story unravels itself) was "involved" with his girl. Francois then barricades himself from the police, and the reason for the death of Valentin is told in simple sets of flashbacks that Gabin remembers between cigarettes as he decides what his next move will be. the story is simple and delicate in manner and substance but nonetheless the director/writer team Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert succeed in turning the realistic (and sometimes edgy) conversations, movements and places into poetry. and in response to an earlier review, the simplicity of the flashbacks, is what makes the movie so intriguing. instead of relying on a heavy plot that might challenge audience, Prevert and Carne decide to put great detail into a simple tale about a sentimental man who is torn to ruin by a contemptuous and Machiavellian man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a character study than a thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot device of having a story begin with a pivotal event and then filling in the details as to how that event came to pass can be effective, as is illustrated here. The event is a murder and your interest is piqued as to the circumstances that provoked it. Details are supplied using flashbacks intermixed with events subsequent to the murder. As the movie progresses you can see potential motives develop, but it is not until the actual murder takes place that the mystery is resolved.The appeal of this film for me was in trying to understand the four main characters: François, a blue-collar worker who loves Françoise; M. Valentin, an unctuous older man who also loves Françoise; and Clara, Valentin's partner and François' mistress. John Gabin plays François as an ordinary man, but with a more complex personality than first meets the eye. He can be amiable and easy-going in most situations, but contentious and angry when pushed a little. I thought Gabin did a great job in integrating these disparate moods into a believable character. I am a bit mystified by his behavior after the shooting - I found his reaction of barricading himself in his room to be unusual. The murder was impulsive and, given the circumstances, could have been presented to an understanding jury in such a way as to yield a minimum sentence. So, why did François immediately behave in a manner to insure his doom? Did he see his future as hopeless? Was it anger bubbling to the surface at a society that he felt had kept him down? Was it to give himself time to decide what to do? This is where a novel may be superior to a movie - a novel could tell us just what François was thinking in his time of being holed up in his room.Françoise is played with seeming innocent sweetness by Jacqueline Laurent, but her character is also hard to figure. Her relationship with Valentin is never clear. She seemed to love François, but vacillated in committing to him apparently because of her relationship with Valentin. Jules Berry does a fantastic job in creating a unique and unforgettable character in his portrayal of Valentin. He has an appealingly glib charm but ultimately comes across as being offensive and pathetic. He is aware of his failings and his behavior is due in good measure to his self-hatred. But why did he taunt François in such a provocative and self-destructive way?And then there is Clara. She dissolves her partnership with Valentin and then takes up with François. What is François doing taking up with Clara when he really desires Françoise? That can't help. And what is Clara doing taking up with François when she knows he loves Françoise? As seen by François, Clara is a mistress, but is there more? Clara understands how François views her, but she develops a deeper attachment anyway. However, she is able to break things off with a world-weary detachment. Behavior is not rational I guess.As you might expect from director Carné, the black and white cinematography is creative and engaging. The script is tight; every scene has substance. Consider the scene where François first meets Françoise. François is at work in a line of men who are sandblasting heavy equipment. We see the miserable conditions of his workplace, but when Françoise comes on the scene he takes off his head gear and is quite tender with her. We learn a lot from that simple scene. And the scene showing Valentin's act with the trained dogs is transfixing and gives us a quick insight into his character. And the final scene is a memorable classic.As is shown, life is tenuous - a single impulsive act can change the course of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Le Jour se Leve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say that this is my favourite Jean Gabin film (which is either "La Bete Humaine" - which he made immediately before this one - or "Pepe le Moko"). However it is still exceedingly good, and is one of the best efforts of that most distinguished director, Marcel Carne. It has a good claim to be one of the best films of the 'golden age' of French cinema.It is, above all, a film of atmospherics. The tall, stark tenement building, with a huge, rude, blank wall fit only for advertisements in some dismal north-eastern coal town - at the remote top of which lives this remarkable bundle of repressed violence and sexual energy, Francois (Gabin). We are transported, through the brilliant, claustrophobic sets of Alexandre Trauner, the emotive music of Maurice Jaubert, the smoky photography of Curt Courant (and co.) and, above all, through the haunting, eccentric, almost verbose script of Jacques Prevert, into a state of almost intolerable tension. Francois is almost the ideal of a type - the sturdy, manly cannon fodder of the Marne and Verdun, who would surely have backed Leon Blum and marched behind Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos. He is tempted by the pure love of Francoise (the luminescent Jacqueline Laurent) and the slightly debased love of Clara (the lovely Arletty). Set against him is his antithesis, the somewhat demonic M. Valentin, a cut-rate showman, cruel to the dogs from whom he profits (Jules Berry, excellent). So we have a love triangle (or is it a square?) about a story that passes in a circle (the ending being the beginning).And, with his back against the wall, Francois lies in his bare, empty little room, smoking his last Gitanes, ruminating on his shattered dreams, and contemplating his forthcoming extinction. A bit like France in 1939, perhaps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carne's murder romance seems a little dated now, its rigid structure and frail artifice too polite for the hysteria necessary for film noir. Carne's tendency to reduce to types is at its most stilted here, leaving one with little room to breathe. There is still much that is majestic and dreamlike - the extraordinary sets, their imposing facades as repressive to Francois as the human world he can't understand; Carne's elegant way with composition and camera movement, especially when he allows himself to see people, not allegories; the unparalleled acting, emotion from another age, yet yearningly, recognisably human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-acted but plodding, uncreative glimpse at love quadrangle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le Jour Se Leve was considered good enough by Hollywood to be remade into a Henry Fonda vehicle in the 1940s. It's also currently considered a classic by many film critics and appears on some of the top ten lists for best film of all time. From my perspective, it's just another one of those films that's gained a reputation and because everyone else says it's great, it must be! But looking at it objectively, the story not only plods along but fails to pay off.The film begins with Francois, a factory worker, who has barricaded himself in his rooming house after shooting a man. The police arrive and he fires bullets through the door which almost hit the unarmed officers standing outside. The police call for reinforcements and a standoff ensues. The rest of the film involves flashbacks which explain how the situation arose as well as flash forwards to the present, with Francois holed up in his apartment as the police take various actions to try and get him out.It seems that Francois has fallen for a young waif, a floral shop worker by the name of Francoise and courts her assiduously. After a few weeks, he wants to stay the night with her but she tells him she has another engagement in the evening. Francois follows Francoise to a nightclub where Valentin, an older man, is performing a dog training act. Francois spies Francoise as she goes through the stage door in the back of the club to visit Valentin. Meanwhile, Francois runs into Clara (played by Arletty who was blacklisted for awhile in the French film industry after having an affair with a German Officer during the Occupation in World War II). Clara, who is Valentin's assistant and lover, reveals that she's just broken up with him after a three year relationship.The rest of 'Le Jour' revolves around Francois shacking up with Clara but also seeing Francoise. Valentin confronts Francois continuously and at one point falsely claims that he's Francoise's father. Finally, Valentin comes over to see Francois with a gun and admits that his initial intent was to shoot him. After further angry conversation, Francois takes Valentin's gun and shoots and kills him with it.That's almost it. After all the flash forwards to Francois dodging police bullets fired into his apartment, he finally decides to shoot himself. After all the machinations amongst the quadrangle, the suicide is probably the most unimaginative way to conclude the story.Le Jour's characters are all rather one note. Francois is the probably the best of the bunch since he has that gift of gab with women. But he's also an obnoxious hothead who can't control his temper. After he shoots Valentin, are we really supposed to feel for sympathy for him? The shooting is completely uncalled for. As for Valentin, his wacky demands for Francois to stop seeing Francoise become tiresome. Yes we get it that he's insanely jealous but it would be nice if we found out some things about him. Francoise appears particularly spineless as she continues her relationship with Francois despite continuing to see Valentin. I couldn't understand what she saw in Valentin and it's never really explained. Perhaps she's 1939 France's answer to a 'flower child'. Finally, Clara is the most level-headed of the bunch. She garners sympathy at the end when she attends to Francoise after she faints as the police close in on Francois. But Clara's screen time is limited and seems to be the odd woman out in the drama.Le Jour is certainly well-acted and Jean Gabin is particularly good as the smooth-talking Lothario who seduces both women. But with all long-winded 'present day' scenes with Francois besieged by the police, unexplored motivations of the various principals, one note characterizations and that climax which ends in a whimper, Le Jour Se Leve is a decidedly overrated film, undeserving of inclusion in the pantheon of art house winners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A French Masterpiece about the Tragedy of a Simple Man's Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a painfully realistic story bringing to the surface the most basic, noble if not primitive human instincts.The setting is simple but the background context is more complex. As we are looking back at a story filmed on the eve of the most devastating war in world history, in the country that will serve once again as the killing ground where thousands will die. The times, 1939 and France is still bearing the emotional scars from the First World War (La Grande Guerre) and recovering slowly from the United States led Great World Depression. Germany has rearmed, reoccupied it's common territory, the Rhineland under an obscure and belligerent new leader, Adolf Hitler. Times are uncertain, world news are not good, Fascism and Communism are gaining ground in several countries that France is intimately tied to (Spain, Italy, Germany?). The population is insecure especially since the "Grande Guerre" (WW I) had brought human suffering to an atrocity and scale never envisaged before with gas warfare, aerial bombardment, machine guns to name a few.On a smaller scale, under the shadow of the storm building over the world horizon, a man, described as a "simple unfortunate manual laborer" has just killed another man and barricades himself on the top floor of the boarding house he stays at. Cornered like a trapped animal, he awaits his fate by the forces of justice while curious people are assembling in the street to witness the outcome.The victim lays on the floor as he yells his state of mind to the bystanders in the street. And now, through a series of flashbacks, he reviews the main events of his existence that brought him to his last hours of his destiny, and what a pitiful life has it been for Francois (Jean Gabin). The tragedy of his youth is not only written in the features of his facial expression but also in the way he speaks, the harsh tone of his voice, the cynicism expressed in the choice of his words. We learned that he was raised as an orphan in a state run agency (l'Enfance). He held many jobs and his only rare possessions surround him in this spartan attic room, a bicycle, a bed, a table, a desk with a mirror riddled with bullet holes (I think) and a few pictures of better days cycling. As he winds his mechanical alarm clock, we discover that is entire day consists of waking up in the morning, working senselessly all day, and coming back late to get some sleep. He is not getting anywhere, just surviving the absurdity of life. I almost forgot, there is also a little medallion (broche) like my grand mother used to wear, attached to the side of his mirror. Remember this medallion...In another flashback, we find out that in the arrid winter of Francois' life, a little flower of hope grew, her name was Francoise. She was young, innocent and fragile. She too had suffered and had been raised as an orphan. Francois falls in love, discovering hope possibly for the first time in his dark life. Francois, who has lived so devoid of all the basic human needs now finds "wholeness", Francoise completes him and soothes all his past pain as they consume each other in a green house, surrounded by flowers like the Garden of Eden. They even dream about picking lilacs at Easter, in the country. Strangely enough, outside of this flowery oasis is a fenced shaded alley, overlooking a noisy railroad track where a steam locomotive hurls by.Unfortunately, winter was not over for Francois yet as an older man, a cruel animal trainer called "Valentin", through some machiavellic explanations claims the rights to Francois' protégée and salvation. Francois, angered, resists the impulse of aggression, helped by Francoise's loving reassurance. In one last flashback, Valentin returns and deal a cruel blow to Francois, a devastating final revelation which will cause his own demise and end Francois' hopes for a future. The details of the revelation and the outcome of the story are for the viewer to discover.Technically, taken in the context and time this picture was filmed, the movie is a masterpiece both in the story as in the cinematography. Francois' struggle for a life that is meaningless or ludicrous is the fate that most of humanity endures. All of us (I hope) have felt at one time or the other the energizing uplifting joy of love and experienced the relief from pain that it can bring. The tragedy of Francois' life is very real, very human and affects many of us. For those who are following the movie from the English sub-titles, there is confusion in the dialogues at the end when Francoise is talking with Clara about her love: Francoise is the feminine version of the masculine name Francois. It is difficult at times to differentiate in the dialogue which one is the speaker referring to and the translator switched the names but it does not change the overall meaning of the drama.In summary, this cinematographic masterpiece reminded me that love is the only thing that makes life worth living, may be the last memory that a dying person remembers? and I have seen a lot of people die? as a war Disabled Veteran.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Le Jour Se Leve is directed by Marcel Carne, has a screenplay by Jacques Prevert. The film stars Jean Gabin, Arletty, Jules Berry and Jacqueline Laurent.It's not difficult to see why the Vichy government during World War Two hated this film and had it censored. The film shows the police using force to stop someone who didn't pose a threat to them at all. The film also shows that if one person and their beliefs gains support from others, then the minority may become the majority(as shown in the scene where the crowd in the street yell their support for Francois).I also think the film shows that you can destroy a persons reputation and life but you can't destroy their minds and feelings. Francois has no escape from his building when he is surrounded but he can escape into his mind and as we see at the end he can decide his own fate.The film begins inside a French apartment building. A man is shot inside an apartment, he falls down the stairs where a blind man stumbles upon him and yells for help. The man who has shot him is factory worker Francois (Jean Gabin), he locks himself in his apartment armed with a single pistol. He shoots at some police who come to talk to him and a large crowd gathers outside the building.As the Police try and use excessive force to get him out and then try and kill him, Francois recalls the events that led him to be in this situation. This film was one of the first to use flashbacks and the film explains this at the beginning, this was done so audiences at the time would understand what was going on.Francois falls in love with the beautiful and gentle Francoise (Jacqueline Laurent). The scenes between these two characters are some of the most beautiful and tender as they fall in love and seem to be living an idyllic life. All that changes when Francoise falls in love with charming dog trainer Valentin(Jules Berry). Valentin's assistant and lover Clara (Arletty)begins a relationship with Francois to get back at Valentin but soon realises that she is nothing to either man.Gabin gives a strong lead performance, he makes Francois tough and vulnerable at the same time. Jules Berry is superb as the manipulative and charming Valentin. Jacquleine Laurent conveys innocence and purity as Francoise. Arletty is excellent as the frank and sexy woman who finds she is not wanted by either of the men she loves.The relationship between Francois, Francoise and Clara is interesting because both women represent (in my opinion)the two different types of love. Clara is the physical, a woman who lives in the moment and who is fun. Francoise represents emotional and romantic love.The entire cast are superb, the photography and sets are unforgettable, as is the mood this film conveys. Gabin's powerful speech from the window shows what a talented actor he was and that is a scene you don't forget in a hurry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After talking to a number of fellow IMDbers about French cinema during The Occupation of France in WWII,I decided to watch 5 films which would show the effect that the beginning of the invasion in France,the Occupation itself, and the ending of the Occupation had on French cinema.Whilst struggling to find a title that could act as a starting point,I picked up an old dusty copy of a UK film mag called Empire,and I spotted a DVD review for a 1939 French Film Noir which had been banned by the Vichy gov, (which also cut some scenes from the film,that thankfully survive)due to it being "demoralizing" which led to me getting ready to see the sun go up.The plot:Walking up the stairs of a 5-story guest-house,a blind man stumbles upon the dead body of M. Valentin laying at the bottom of the stairs,with bullets buried deep inside him. Surrounding the guest-house,the police attempt to interview all of the residence of the building,but find that one room is locked.Hearing the cops knock, François starts shooting at the door,and telling the police to leave him alone.As the police start making plans to arrest the killer, François begins to think about the events that led him here.A few weeks earlier:Whilst working at a foundry factory, François meets a floral shop worker called Françoise.Spending time with Françoise, François finds himself falling for her,but feels that Françoise is holding something back from him.Secretly following Françoise one night, François discovers her attending a magic show being performed by Clara &amp; M. Valentin.Talking to Clara, François finds out that Valentin is an old charmer who has had every girl who he has set his eyes on become his mistress,which includes Françoise &amp; Clara.Talking to François,Clara finds herself taken by him being nothing like Valentin.Furious over Françoise and Clara pushing his charms aside for François,Valentin decides that he must turn François's bright life into black magic.View on the film:Surviving the censorship of the Vichy gov and an attempt by RKO to destroy every known copy, Studiocanal delivers an elegant transfer,with the 2 minutes of cut footage being seamlessly re- instated,and the audio/picture quality being crystal clear. Rumbaing behind the stark background of the opening credits,the score by Maurice Jaubert creates a superb undercurrent mood for the title,as Jaubert keeps the score light &amp; breezy during François's blossoming romance,which transforms into a bellowing shriek,as François sinks into a Film Noir dead end.Made just before the country fell to Hitler,the screenplay by Jacques Viot and Jacques Prévert brilliantly displays the impending darkness that France was about to enter,as the writers show the police to be faceless figures who attempt to "gas" François out of the building,and stop anyone from criticising the government.Along with the ruthless shots at the police and government,the writers smartly take a Film Noir route to reveal the unease that France was experiencing,as François and Valentin spy/listen in on those nearest to them,whilst the Film Noir loner François becomes a hero to the crowds standing outside the guest-house,as François yells that he wants to be left alone in his flat,where he can lock his door to the despair taking place outside.Showing Valentin's stairway to death with a hard stare which makes the viewer feel every thud that his dying body makes on the steps,director Marcel Carné unleashes a chilling Film Noir atmosphere,as long,winding shots around the guest-house,and tightly coiled whip-pans in François flat show the doom-laden mind-set that François has entered. Delicately using flashbacks, Carné creates a contrasting feel to the bleak Film Noir world that François is now locked in,by giving the scenes with Clara &amp; Françoise a stark,shining lightness which represents the relax mood that François feels around them,which slowly transforms into a brittle darkness,as Valentin starts attempting to wipe François from his two dream girls.Sharing a mutual desire for François's love,the gorgeous Arletty (who destroyed her career by having an affair with a high-ranking Nazi,and spending most of the Occupation going to fancy dinners held by the Nazis) and Jacqueline Laurent (who in a banned scene appears topless!) each give beautiful performances as Françoise and Clara,with Laurent showing a genuine sweetness in Françoise's desire for her past with Valentin to be left in the dark mists of time,whilst Arletty lights up the screen as striking Femme Fatale Clara,whose mask of acceptance over François fight for his "true love" Françoise breaks,as Clara finds herself being pushed to the wilderness by Valentin &amp; François.With Carné sealing his fate by filling him with bullets in the tense opening, Jules Berry gives a wonderful performance as Valentin,thanks to Berry turning Valentin's charm into sharp manipulation ,as Valentin finds François trying to take all that is his.Sealed in his prison cell/flat, Jean Gabin gives an explosive performance as François,with Gabin hitting a light touch with an expert eye in François's blossoming romance with Françoise,which is haunted by the bleak, burning rage that François's fate is now trapped in,as François looks out of the window in his flat,for hope that daybreak will appear from the darkness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sentimental, far to be great, almost common. but seductive under the science of Carne to give delicate nuances to flash backs, to transform scenes in little gems. and, in same measure, the art of Prevert to transform each detail in a precise piece of puzzle. a film about love and innocence. about a kind of Mephisto - remarkable performance of Berry - and delicate lights of role in Jacqueline Laurent performance. but, in many aspects, a film of Arletty and Jean Gabin. not a surprise. the names of director and scriptwriter are basic guarantees for a remarkable work. but, after so many years, like many other films," Le jour se leve" has more seductive sparkles and great profound value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast for the Gabin fans?Gabin in one of his very best roles ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daybreak is one of the best, if not the best Gabin film of the French poetic realism. Gabin was a handsome young man, still supple ,and here he plays François, a virile, vigorous workman ,disputed by two women?an older seductress, Clara, and a girl, Françoise. The workman François registers as one of Gabin's top performances, especially memorable; and the movie is maybe the finest product of the famous Carné/Prévert collaboration?among the richest in human, psychological content. François is a doomed character in this suspenseful drama?yet the movie does not belong to Prévert's symbolical , fatalist plays, it rather gives place to several realistic characterizations. The economy a means needs not be underlined?it is a drama of four characters (the three already mentioned, and a deprived , poisonous debauch oldster). The story ,presented from François' point of view, is told as he, after murdering his rival, recapitulates the phases of his love affair. François recounts how he met a girl, while at work; how he dated her; how she had a mysterious night life, and he eagerly follows her and spies. Then enter a demoniac character, from the variety's world, and Gabin begins a relationship with the former mistress of this spinster. He gets caught in a net of lies and of dirty secrets which destroy his inner coherence. His need for joy remains unsatisfied, he is betrayed. He is a honest rough tough workman unaccustomed with the ambiguities of the small world that allowed him in. His drama is precise, well defined, tangible and concrete. If other poetic realism outings favored the lyricism, this one favors the realism. The things inhere are very concrete, and of a remarkable good taste, something Carné had in his best days.This is not a symbolical misty allegorical drama, but a love movie, a hugely interesting and beautiful and humane, with likable characters, very _relatable to. One of the great French love movies. Particularly involving and enjoyable and masterly composed. The good taste is enhanced, strengthened by a particular lightness?the touch is light, fine, masterly ;such art warms the heart, encourages and satisfies the mind. It is one of the great almost unknown (today) films. Yet this precious _pellicle registered Gabin in one of his ample, large youth role, and benefited from Carné's talent ?. Indeed, one cannot love Carné and Gabin too much ?.And Gabin performs with such a verve, a dynamism, an obvious pleasure he takes in his role ?. When he did not enjoy a part, he could simply be lukewarm, detached, bored?not so here, where his interest is evident.From this film, one understands why Gabin was looked upon as a sex symbol; in his work outfit, or in his leather jacket, he looked awesome indeed. He was young, blue eyed, a chain?smoker, and his head, with his mean mouth, had a leonine air. This makes the film especially important for all the Gabin fans, who can see him here in his best shape.For every one who wishes a marvel, or just a strong large Gabin performance, this is the movie .A singularly graceful one.In popular terms and low?brow jargon, I would state that here is the coolest Gabin movie that I know. It is cool in all respects?first of all Gabin himself; the other roles (Clara, Françoise, the demoniac tamer) ; the movie's look and brio. Gabin is self?aware of his coolness in the Cagney/ Gable/ Grant/Bogart/Brando/Rourke/Crowe way .He knows he is young, handsome, has beautiful hands and looks cool as a chain?smoker. The movie is a tribute and a testimony of his youth coolness. Yet it's also far from being only a pretext for showing Gabin's good looks. It is a work of art, a meaningful work made with unspeakable lightness and discernment and also instinct, feel for these things. It leaves a wonderful taste. Gabin's coolness is only a side, an aspect of the movie, it serves the film, it does not deprive it of autonomy and inner interest. It is subordinated to the film's significance. It verifies again the assertion that Gabin basically made one role throughout with career?with virtuous variations and deft modulations (as opposed to the _chameleonic Americans like Brando, De Niro, Pacino, Rourke?and also unlike the great Europeans: Simon, Fresnay, Jouvet, Stroheim and Belmondo). This is part type?casting, and part vocation. Gabin brought all the roles to himself (and the roles were anyway visibly similar and homogeneous); not that he did not take chances, but in his choices, so stable and almost uniform, there was something at unison with his own human nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This French film is a great film from 1939 starring Jean Gabin, (Francois) the French Humphrey Bogart who is a factory worker and meets up with a sweet innocent young girl named also Francoise,(Jacqueline Laurent) who sees Francois working in the factory and has a hand full of flowers to deliver. He politely shows her where the flowers are suppose to be delivered and gets involved with her, it is almost like love at first sight. These two lovers go on dates together for three weeks and Francois has desires to make love to her, but she makes excuses and runs off to a theater house and watches M. Valentin,(Jules Berry) who appears on the stage with dogs who do all kinds of tricks. The story gets quite involved with Arletty,(Clara) another gal and there are many flashbacks which was rather new for film goers in 1939. There is plenty of suspense and a great story with great actors. Don't miss this film, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating, slow, intense original to "The Long Night" from 1947</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le Jour Se Leve (1939)This French movie is oddly famous as the original, almost lost (destroyed) version of the American, The Long Night (1947), and it almost demands comparison. In all, the American version with Henry Fonda in the lead is more beautifully made, and perhaps more compelling for a lot of very small reasons. But this French one, which is not only first, has a couple key qualities that make it worth getting absorbed into. For one, it is more seriously realistic, with both a sexual frankness (implied, but not ignored) and a lack of a "Hollywood ending," naturally enough. It is filmed beautifully, and acted really well (the "bad" man in this one is more convincing and lifelike than the Vincent Price incarnation in the later one). But it is also a slow film, with far too much of the man, played by Jean Gabin, who was also in the 1937 Grand Illusion) staring and pacing. Here is where the photography and editing of the later film sustain us through the solitary moments much better. This version almost feels low budget, at least by American standards, without making the uncomplicated production always a virtue (it doesn't cost more to move the camera closer, or cut out sections of staring into space). I know this is all an aesthetic decision, and the slow, sad realizing of the character summing up his life is really at the center of it all, but see both films and see what you think.Two things are really astonishing. First, the almost scene by scene similarity of the second film to the first. Camera angles, dialog, flashbacks (many), even the dog trainer's show, and the teddy bear missing an ear, all of this is just copied and reproduced in the later movie, to an almost ridiculous extreme. (No wonder RKO tried to destroy every single copy of Le Jour Se Leve before making The Long Night. Sad and weird.) That's certainly a bowing down to this first one for good reason.Second, the dilemma the men face in the two movies is actually a little different at the core, and this is a product of the times they were made. In The Long Night, the man is an ex-soldier suffering from having been through the horrors of World War II, and so the standard American film noir themes are distilled and honed down to this one man (Fonda) in his room. The earlier French film was made just as the war was about to start, and the man (Gabin) is suffering from a more universal problem of being a working class man putting in long hours, cheerfully, with little hope for a future for himself. The dandy-ish counterpart that is his nemesis is unattractive in nature, but has charm and education and abilities beyond this man's noble simplicity, and it seems that society, and women, favor this more false kind of man.It's because of these themes the French version has a growing reputation. It's really well acted, and a classic dilemma played out with beauty and pathos. That it isn't perfect is something we have to adjust to, remembering it was forward looking for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an exceptional Noir film from France</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent French film that deserves to be discovered by modern audiences. Although many "Film Noir" fans might consider the gangster films of Warner Brothers from the 1930s to be true examples of the genre, I look at them more as "Noir-Lite"--as they are more formulaic and more upbeat than the Noir films of the 40s and 50s. So although the thug that Cagney or Raft or Bogart plays in the film is tough and often uses the lingo of true Noir, you KNOW that by the end of the film the bad guy MUST lose and this is all an object lesson to us all about good and evil. But, with later Noir (as well as this film), it rose to a new level because things were often not so "cut and dry"--sometimes evil DID win or the line between good and evil was blurred. It's because of this that for a 1939 film that Le Jour Se L?ve excels as a film--unlike the traditional Warner "baddies", the lead, Jean Gabin is neither good nor bad--and his story of how a normal guy can feel forced to kill that makes this film stand out from the crowd.The film begins with a murder and within moments you know that Gabin shot the victim--there is no mystery about this at all. You see how Gabin meets a nice girl and falls for her but this also ultimately leads to the murder. In many ways, this is reminiscent of the great Noir classic DOA, as the film begins you KNOW that Edmund O'Brien will die but the story leading up to it is what the focus will be.I could talk about this story further, but I don't want to spoil the suspense. Instead, let's briefly talk about the technical merit of the film. Jean Gabin was an amazing actor and while I didn't always like all of his films, I definitely admire his casual acting style. In many ways, he looks and acts like a slightly more rugged version of Spencer Tracy. This "everyman" quality make him a good choice for Noir--he's not just some "pretty boy". The supporting cast is very good as well. But the real stars, apart from Gabin, are the writers, director and cinematographer. The story works as does the dialog, the pacing and composition is great and the camera angles and lighting are superb. A fine film with little to complain about--and for me THAT'S unusual!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Despair, inevitability of fate, and a working - class character unable to find his place in the world"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film is a Masterpiece. But I am somewhat uncomfortable with this thought - why? This is a truly great movie - films like this have everything to do with why I fell in love with the idea of living in France. The frankness about love and sex, and about all of the similarities and differences between the two. That still seems so audacious. And the A Team brought its A Game: Carné, Prevert, Alexander Trauner, Maurice Jaubert, Gabin, Arletty, Jules Berry...all killing it. When Gabin puts on the leather jacket and goes through all that torture with a cigarette - it is perfection. Pre - War Existentialism at its finest! The shot of Françoise carrying the flowers down the alley by the factory - this is the kind of poetry that cinema alone is capable of.So what's my problem? Something a bit unacknowledged - ly "pulpy" in its heart? Ultimately, is it a "real" Work of Art? How many films really are? Does this matter, in any way?Carné's reputation is complicated. The younger generation - the Nouvelle Vague - really denigrated him, it seems. How much did this have to do with his being seen as a collaborator during the Nazi Occupation, and how much did this actually have to do with his style? He needed Prévert, that seems clear. Prévert - how does he do it? Screenplays with such a deeply poetic quality, still managing to move and inflect. Genius. Gabin - my favorite screen actor. What he doesn't know about screen acting isn't worth knowing. His poise. His coiled energy - that voice that, at the drop of a hat, can modulate from silence and repose into a vicious growl. Arletty - when I first saw her in Children of Paradise I was mesmerized. Every time I've heard someone say "But I don't understand why people fall all over her - she's not really THAT hot!" it has felt like a friendship dealbreaker. At the very least, it evokes Andrew Sarris' great line that anyone who resists Children of Paradise's charm deserves never to see Paris.Maybe I see through this film a little bit. Maybe some of its gravitas seems not quite earned. But look at that set! That street! The crowds! All those fantastic details - the bored coat - check girl plunged into her book during the dog show. And that ending, with its brilliant pile - up of several key images, one at a time...which makes me think of what we lost when we lost Maurice Jaubert, not just a great film composer, but also a brilliant critic of film music and its meaning:In The Lost Patrol?otherwise an admirable film?the director was apparently alarmed by the silence of the desert in which the story was laid. He might well have realized the dramatic possibilities of silence, but instead he assaulted the ear?without a moment's pause?with a gratuitous orchestral accompaniment which nearly destroyed the reality of the visuals.Well, Jaubert practiced what he preached - so much of this film is underscored by little more than subtle and ominous low - register percussion (tympani, but not only, I think...). Are those the storm clouds looming over Europe when this film was made? Or is that reading too much into it all?And, after that question - one more question: how can the man who made Hôtel du Nord, Quai des Brumes. Le Jour Se L?ve and Les Enfants du Paradis be considered more - or - less a Tradition de Qualité hack? These are the mysteries...Subjects for further study and reflection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth, lies, society: symbolic and realistic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Le Jour se l?ve" is a French cinema major classic and more specifically the lead title of "poetic realism" genre of the 1930s. Apparently simple in its form, it is an elaborate movie about hidden truth and apparent lies, with social background.The movie is not the first one with flashbacks, but is probably the first to use them so consistently and skilfully, two years before "Citizen Kane". There are three of them, surrounded by four "present" sequences. Interestingly, the latter are relatively consistent in duration and space: they all last between 6 and 11 minutes; they all occur between evening and dawn of the following day; they all happen in François' room or around. This contrasts with the flashbacks (see below).*** WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS ***Overall, the movie moves from exteriors (first sequence, first flashback) to interiors and increasingly to François' room (following scenes): we are more and more confined inside like François. But most remarkable is how flashbacks progressively condense time and space, building up dramatic intensity.- Flashback 1 (22 minutes). Duration: three weeks. Locations: road to the factory, factory, outside Françoise's house (twice), Françoise's house, café.- Flashback 2 (24 minutes). Duration: at most a few days. Locations: François' building, Clara's room (twice), café, greenhouse.- Flashback 3 (7 minutes). Duration: real time. Location: François' room only.As we see, the condensation is threefold: length of the flashback itself, length of the action, space where it happens. While the first and second flashbacks represent some mental escape (duration, exteriors, love, future plans), the third one merges with present action in terms of length, action and location. This creates a sense of increasing pressure and inevitable tragedy: there is no escaping the reduced environments and limited time, just like François remembering these events in his room during his last night. "It is a small world. It turns around, we meet again", Valentin says. Indeed: smaller and smaller, faster and faster.Additionally, to augur the tragic ending, the movie hints references to death. François and Françoise both are orphans. François tells her: "It would be nice if everybody were dead and there were just the two of us". Valentin says: "I am coming back like a ghost". Clara tells François: "It seems you are informing me someone died". François shouts at the end: "François is gone!" The teddy bear that looks like him is shot. François is increasingly seen through his window and his mirror riddled with bullet holes.The contrast between present and past reveals another opposition: apparent versus hidden. The mystery of the murder at the beginning, behind a closed door, is only explained at the end. François looks healthy but his lungs are filled with sand. He is considered a nice fellow but will eventually commit murder. He has a happy eye and a sad eye. The deputy director has a nice garden close by the factory which inside looks like a nightmare. Valentin's show is a success but he tortures his dogs to achieve it. Françoise gives François her allegedly personal brooch that is actually Valentin's. Clara is understanding but cruelly hurts François on purpose by revealing the secret of Valentin's brooches. François says at the end: "Everybody kills, but secretly, little by little so it doesn't show". In a revealing scene, Valentin tells François he is Françoise's father. It is moving and we feel sorry for him. However, we later on discover it was a lie. But where is the truth? Does Valentin just want to manipulate François and Françoise? Or does he genuinely love her so much that he is willing to do anything?The apparent/hidden antagonism is visually illustrated by the lights and shadows that frequently divide faces and bodies. Also, many shots through mirrors and closed windows show us reality is double-sided. And the blind man appearing from time to time tell us truth is more than what we see.Characters also are antagonised: François (simple, frank, honest) versus Valentin (intelligent, manipulative, sleazy); Françoise (young, shy, apparently chaste) versus Clara (experienced, outspoken, flirty). So is society: opposition between workers and "artists", people and policemen, hard work and pleasure, living conditions and plans for a better life. François is a strong character but denied a proper existence: he dresses like a monster without a body and a face in the factory; he is dominated by Valentin's rhetoric; he lives isolated at the top of the town's tallest building; the police do not negotiate with him, they simply shoot; he shouts at the end, in a memorable monologue, "There is no François any more!"As a result, the movie manages to be both symbolic and realistic: working conditions, living conditions, social context just before WWII, close shots on important details (a burning cigarette that will allow François to continue smoking, a brooch that Valentin gives to his mistresses, a gun that François will use). Ironically, at the end when François is dead, his alarm rings so he can wake up to go to work.A last note about the crew. The three main actors (Jean Gabin, Jules Berry, Arletty) are among the greatest ever in French cinema and it is their only common appearance. Notably, it is the only movie featuring all-famous Gabin and Berry together, which makes the contrast between their styles even more striking.Dialogues by Jacques Prévert (a major French poet) are simple, powerful and somewhat poetic. Scenery is the work of the master Alexandre Trauner: symbolic rendering of the quarter, efficient usage of the staircase (e.g. fabulous travelling shot from top to bottom), minute reconstitution of François' room condensing his past. Cinematography is from another master, Philippe Agostini, and lightings from yet another, Curt Courant. A true dream team.Last but not least, Carné is an acclaimed director and "Le Jour se l?ve" is considered by many as his masterpiece, ahead of other classics such as "Port of Shadows" and "Children of Paradise".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Le Jour se L?ve (Daybreak)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this French film in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was rated very well and the plot sounded good, so I was looking forward to what would hopefully be a good foreign language film, directed by Marcel Carné (Les Enfants du Paradis). Basically factory worker François (Jean Gabin) has shot and killed M. Valentin (Jules Berry), and following this he has locked himself in his guest house room on the top floor of the building with many flights of stairs, the police soon arrive to arrest him, they fail to shoot their way into the room as François has barricaded the door. In a series of flashbacks, occasionally returning to the present to see his attempts to avoid being caught, it is revealed François had been having a relationship with both naive floral shop worker Françoise (Jacqueline Laurent) and more experienced performing assistant Clara (Arletty), who until meeting him was working with Valentin for his performing dog act. Valentin is manipulative and had also become involved with both women, and becoming jealous of François, as a constant liar he even tries to convince his foe that he was Françoise's father, but in fact both she and François were raised in orphanages. The rivalry between the two men eventually leads them to the guest house, Valentin confronts him with a gun, and in the tussle between them François grabs the weapon and fires, this is what has lead to the events of the present. As he continues to protect himself in the room François continually chain smokes with nerves, he has become delirious having learnt of his plight, before two police officers throw tear gas grenades into the room François consumed by despair shoots himself in the heart, the film ends with his lifeless body on the floor and gas filling the room, and the alarm sounds to announce it is morning. Also starring René Génin as Concierge, Mady Berry as Concierge's wife, Bernard Blier as Gaston and Marcel Pér?s as Paulo. Gabin certainly exudes existential despair as the man who has unintentionally and sympathetically got himself into trouble, Berry is a terrific villain as the deceptive entertainment performer who tries to get one over his rival and treat his women like possessions, while Arletty is as loathsome as the showgirl, and Laurent is fine as the innocent woman stuck in between. It has moments of suitable claustrophobia, it works well as a tragic story filled with false love and a man breaking down into complete sorrow, it is written well and it has many interesting moments, a worthwhile crime melodrama. Vey good!</fullReview>

Also, writers_reign from London ("Twilight At Dawn", writers_reign from London, England, 8 December 2003) adds context for the principal participants. Finally, nowlang ("A French Masterpiece about the Tragedy of a Simple Man's Life", nowlang (lancelot1953@msn.com) from Small Town, New England, USA, 12 September 2006) adds interesting insight.***"Le jour se l?ve (Daybreak; 1939, Marcel Carné, France) is another superlative film from Carné. A common laborer is known to have killed a man, and is holed-up awaiting his fate. With the arrival of the Second World War looming, the participants involved in this project still manage to leave behind a story filled with understanding about the human condition.The film is very brave, as it is not hard to argue that "Daybreak" is a veiled protest against the increasingly repressive government. (The Vichy regime, which collaborated with the Nazis, took over a year after this film's release.) In the film's opening, a title card informs us that a murder has been committed and we will see what caused the murderer to act. The message has little purpose but to create the idea of a government proclamation announcing that someone is an enemy of the state. Who threatens the state the most? The French police exacerbate tensions whenever possible. They have François (Jean Gabin) trapped in his third-story apartment. Without a word of dialog, they begin shooting at François. Later, they deny a potentially crisis- ending conversation between François and several of his coworkers. When the laborers in the street begin to show signs of support for François, the police crush the public expression with violence against the helpless crowd. By starting with the title card that clarifies the government's official position and then presenting a story that encourages sympathy for the public enemy, "Daybreak" makes the statement that the present French government is getting out of control.Some viewers have an issue with the central cheat in the story, namely that François completely fails to recognize he has a legitimate case to make to an impartial jury. This is explained in part by the Fascistic police, which offer no sign they intend for him to receive a fair trial. There also seems to be relevance in the deceased having been an animal trainer. His ex-girlfriend and show partner Clara (Arletty) will describe some of Valentine's cruelty to his dogs by mentioning a specific example. So, perhaps François does not take steps to improve his situation because he is identified with the unfortunate puppies who can never escape Valentine's sadism. When weary François hysterically communicates with the crowd below, he might be offering some of the despair of show animals being cruelly trained. (An example of how Valentine torments François is by repeatedly calling him "simple." BTW, "Daybreak" sure has a lot more awareness about the plight of animals than does the "Wizard of Oz," also made in 1939.)It is a trademark of the collaboration between Carné (direction) and Jacques Prévert's (dialog) that a sense of balance is felt with the entire cast. Even the characters with brief moments on screen are perfectly realized. Jean Gabin is excellent in the lead role. He's one of my all-time favorite actors. If you mixed Spencer Tracy's looks with Humphrey Bogart's grit, sprinkling in Robert Mitchum's indifference, while supplying the result with a vast quantity of cigarettes, you might produce an actor similar. Gabin excels at portraying primitives, and is as convincing as a criminal as he is endearing. Gabin is a perfect choice for this despairing role of a laborer who grew up in an orphanage and now endures soul-crushing work to get by."Daybreak" is useful in understanding how Arletty was a successful leading lady despite being in her 40s. As an actress, she brings mystery and cleverness to her roles. While Arletty/Clara is an attractive woman, it is obvious that the younger, sensual Françoise, is intended to be the head-turner. Still, Arletty's Clara is a lot more streetwise than Françoise. Clara does not fall to pieces when situations get tough. Arletty appears to have been successful as a romantic lead during this turbulent era because she seems to offer the French male a partner that can hold up under duress.The sexuality is very advanced for 1939. There are four main characters and each has partnered with two others of the group. The scene where François joins Françoise on her bed is risqué. Françoise is also "ruined" when it is revealed her relationship with Valentine is not platonic. One can imagine the government censors having many internal conversations about just the sexual behavior on display. (I was a little annoyed in the naming similarity between François and Françoise. However, maybe this is to emphasize the similar states of mind the pair have at the finish.)If you are a cinema buff you won't want to miss this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A common laborer, Francois, shoots, and kills, M. Valentin, a despicable man who has come to his room in a housing complex unexpectedly. In flashbacks we get to know the story behind Francois' action, as he sequesters himself from the police that has been called to take him away. It is a tense moment for Francois, a quiet man, otherwise.The story of Francois involvement with the beautiful Francoise, a young woman who grew up like him in an orphanage, brings them together for they feel the need for one another. Francois does not think for a moment he will be in such a position, but when his sweetheart decides to go alone to a music hall, he follows her there. He is astonished to see Francoise going to M. Valentin, a dog trainer whose act is part of the revue in the local theater. Clara, who is M. Valentin's assistant in the act, is clearly disgusted with him. Leaving the stage, she joins Francois in the bar. They both witness the trainer and the young woman leave together. It is evident they know one another and that perhaps Francoise is not as naive as she pretends to be. Things come to a head when Valentin comes to see Francois with a feeble excuse about Francois' girl, ultimately resulting in the shooting.Marcel Carne's masterpiece came right after "Quai des brumes", another dark tale of people in turmoil. Jacques Viot's original scenario was given life by the great Jacques Prevert a man who collaborated with M. Carne in other films with his perceptive take on the dialogue. This is pure Carne who felt attraction for telling stories that involved ordinary people, as it is the case in this film. Although well respected in his work, the film was not embraced by audiences because of the obscurity of the subject. The figure of Francoise, the main interest of our man in this story, is not immediately made clear. On the one hand, she appears to be a somewhat naive woman, while leading, perhaps, another life with the older Valentin. The other role that is quite enigmatic is that of Clara, who obviously must have been connected with Valentin, not just as his assistant for the theater. Clara clearly wants Francois, but he is blindly in love with Francoise, who might be hiding a secret side of her personality when she is with Francois. It is indeed a complex story in many levels, but Carne delivers an intense drama that keeps his audience glued to what is happening on the screen.Jean Gabin, at the height of his film career made a perfect Francois. He does not make a false move throughout the story. Jean Gabin was a natural for cinema, as he demonstrates here. The great Arletty appears as Clara, the woman who loving Francois, stays out of his way since she realizes she cannot have him. Jacqueline Laurent projected the right kind of naivete as the sweet Francoise. Jules Berry plays the odious M. Valentin with relish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Gabin plays his usual handsome devil in this film but this time he's not winning the girl. Rather, he's wondering if the girl is sleeping with a slimy scumbag of a dog trainer. And the trainer takes sadistic pleasure in making Gabin worry and squirm.So one day Francois can't take it anymore and kills the bastard. It's all rather nihilistic and grim.Why does Francois self-destruct? As a foundry worker in a dead-end job, he does show signs of depression. But I don't think the depression is bad enough to do him in.Rather, this film seems to presage existentialist thinking in the way it shows a fateful act that changes everything and brings no regret.(On a lighter note, I may remember this movie best for the beautiful words Francois utters on the subject of women wearing face paint."Do you want me to tell you you're pretty? I can't tell under all that makeup..." And later, "You're pretty like that -- the unvarnished truth."Music to the ears of a natural woman!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is almost rudimentary. An honest plain-speaking working man, Francois, is in love with a fresh-faced young Francoise, but she begins hanging around with an older man burdened with a diabolically sinister face, Valentin. The older man travels around with a trained dog act and a pretty but worn assistant, Clara, who falls in lust with Francois, much to the annoyance of Valentin.Actually neither man cares much about Clara. They both have their eyes on Francoise. There is a big argument between the two men in Francois' room and Francois shoots and kills Valentin.The police surround the room in which Francois has hunkered down. He broods about the events in flashbacks, then shoots himself. Fin.Maybe I was expecting too much because the movie is generally regarded as a classic of its kind. "Poetic realism"? The subtitles are sometimes far enough off to be amusing. The acting is nothing to write home about, but the direction is functional and the success of the movie -- and it IS successful -- hangs on the characterizations.Absolutely nobody is entirely sound morally. Take Francois (Gabin). Yes, he's honest, plain-spoken, ordinary looking, and honest -- he hates people who lie. But, well, there's the business of that rather nasty murder. Valentin has just insulted the beautiful Francoise but he's also suggested that Francois is a pedophile for wanting her. It's at that point that Francois picks up the pistol and plugs the other guy. Is he responding with such fury to the insult aimed at Francoise -- or the one aimed at himself? In either case, the insult is delivered casually, almost jokingly, and hardly an excuse for such an explosion of rage. And we can't overlook the fact that -- insult or no insult -- Francois is shooting and killing a rival for his girl friend's affections. All through the movie, Francois has shown himself to be ill tempered and the murder seems not much more than a logical expression of that character flaw.Valentin is evil looking alright. His eyes seem pasted onto the sides of his head. He wears a loud phony checked overcoat, as opposed to Francois' working kit. He waves his hands dramatically. He lies fluently -- at one point claiming to be Francoise' father. A roguish fellow, the sort, as he explains to the slightly dull Francois, that interests women, while Francois is the sort that women fall in love with. He's probably more perceptive than anyone else in the movie, even about himself. "People loathe me. I am a figure of ridicule," he tells himself in the mirror. He's obviously meant to be some kind of bad guy. Why doesn't he leave Francois and Francoise alone to live happily ever after. Why does he keep NUDGING them? Okay, but that's hardly enough justification for his murder.Anyway, his possessiveness towards Francoise does raise an interesting question. Not about Valentin but about Francoise. What is her game anyway? She seems to like Francois well enough and kisses him warmly once in a while, and she keeps his photo on her mirror, although when he proposes marriage to her (more than once) she guides the conversation in a different direction. She turns down Francois' offer of a soirée to watch Valentin perform in the café, but although she applauds enthusiastically and allows him to shepherd her around, she never seems to care that much for him. All in all, she's a blank.The complexity of the characters adds a layer of meaning to the movie that the plot simply can't supply. I was glad I watched it, in the same way I'd be happy to take another peek at the Mona Lisa, because everybody says its so good. But I don't think I'd watch it again.</fullReview>
