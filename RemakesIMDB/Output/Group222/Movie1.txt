		<shortDescription>Unintended parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I entered the theater with fond memories of Fred Zinnemann's 1973 "Day of the Jackal", expecting a chance to scoff at a butchered remake of a fine, suspenseful and tensely-paced film. After the first half-hour or so, it suddenly occurred to me that what I was seeing was not a remake at all, but a parody. Then I began to enjoy myself.Watching to see what modern filmmaking sensibilities had made of the more memorable scenes from the original kept me thoroughly entertained for the rest of the show. Edward Fox's neat little sniper's rifle--with its disguise constructed from a marvelous, high-tech material called "stainless steel"--metamorphosed into an immense carbon-fiber contraption suitable for demolishing an armored battalion. Fox's deadly silent assassination of a cantaloupe turned into a market-garden recreation of the Battle of the Bulge. And so on.I don't think my companion, or anyone else in the theater, appreciated my snickers and occasional belly laugh. Too bad. I had a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daft, noisy and senseless - but it's still quite fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In retaliation for the FBI war against the mob in Russian, the mob pay famous assassin Carlos the Jackal to kill a senior figure in the US government. FBI deputy director Preston discovers that the Jackal has been contracted out he contacts one of the few men who can identify him - IRA gunman Declan Mulqueen. With the Jackal moving freely within the US it is a race against time to find and stop him before he reaches his target.Before he died, the director of "The Day of the Jackal", Zinnermann approached Universal to have the name changed so that it wouldn't be so closely associated with his own film. They didn't change it and it's easy to see what his point was. The plot of this is a bit silly and doesn't have any intelligence or subtlety. The Jackal is careful is some scenes but takes on FBI agents in others, he covers all his tracks in designing his gun, but he kills the builder and leaves the plans for the FBI to find! It doesn't totally make sense - things are tidied up too easily - Mulqueen finds the Jackal too easily when the film needs a boost of action.Willis is OK as the Jackal but he's not totally convincing because he usually plays roles where he runs round shooting, rather than being a very clinical hitman who only fires one shot then leaves undetected. Even here he does some planning but he only looks comfortable when in running gun battles. Gere is good in an action man role (I'm not a big fan), but he has one of the worst Northern Irish accents even put on the big screen - it goes from N.Ireland to Southern Ireland and back again from one scene to the next. Poitier is a classy inclusion in the pack but doesn't have much to do but act tough beside Gere. Support is interesting, but they don't have much to do - Jack Black was great in High Fidelity, but is cannon fodder here. J.K. Simmons is amazing in Oz but is just an agent here. Venora is good despite a very heavy accent. Sophie Okonedo is beautiful as she was in various British TV series but only has a few fleeting lines of dialogue. And Leslie Phillips is wasted in such a small cameo of little significance that you wonder why he bothered.The whole plot sits funny with me - I really don't understand why Gere's character had to be an IRA murderer. There's an early scene where he's verbally attacked by one of the FBI for killing women and children, but he's given time to defend himself. After that we all forget who he is and everyone loves him. The final act of the film left a bitter taste in my mouth (I grew up in NI), and you can't help but wonder who in America wants to promote the IRA as somehow honourable or sympathetic (also see "The Devil's Own") - I wonder if Hollywood understands now how offending it is to see terrorists displayed in this way?Overall, it's quite fun in a brash, loud sort of way - but ultimately it'll leave you wondering what you just watched and "how did that happen" and "hang on that bit doesn't work". As a distracting blockbuster it's quite good but as a relative of 1973's "Day of the Jackal" it's an illegitimate third cousin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Decent acting? Unnecessary! Respect shown to its mighty progenitor? Unnecessary! Yes it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the Butch Bruce canon.I mean where do you start with this film? Okay, let's begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was, in some way, related to either the book or the original film, The Day of the Jackal. It's not. In fact it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to have his name taken off it. Now I'm not necessarily a stuffy Brit who can't hack Hollywood remaking British films. Well, okay, maybe I am a bit like that, but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive.Now let's move to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster gets killed in a Moscow police raid (somehow involving the FBI although no one bothers to explain why). In revenge, brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the US President (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move ? although to be fair it was pre-9-11, so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the US airforce carpet bombing Eastern Europe). Gangster hires "nasty" killer (Willis). Police hire "cuddly" killer (Gere), "cuddly" killer tracks "nasty" killer. Police fanny around and periodically get killed. "Cuddly" killer kills "nasty" killer. First lady is saved and we all realise that the IRA are just this bunch of real sweet guys y'know, who just happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice.Let's put to one side the distasteful Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park (I deal with this point more extensively on the message boards). If Hollywood directors want to cast the Belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold, that's up to them. I, of course, reserve the right to despise them for it. It's a free country.More egregious, however, is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the Irish while trying to support them. That's not politically distasteful, it's far worse: it's incompetent. It's no wonder, for instance, that Gere still looks so damn good, given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of cra*p. The fact that Gere's accent is not only Southern Irish, but an appalling parody of Southern Irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond America to make money from this film. Then there is that lovely scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this film) says he's off for a coffee, offers to get our "cuddly" IRA man one, then casually says "Ah, but then you guys drink Guinness don't you". Yeah that's right Sidney; the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes.While we're on the subject of Poitier: why? In the original film the detective is the tracker. In Jackal, Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well, he just hangs around and looks like a tw*at of course. He's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end, and he only does this because the nice IRA man tells him to.While we're on the subject of Gere: why? I suppose it's only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing ex-Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s India (he is, after all, a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a Muslim fundamentalist). Let's not forget that Gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. And if he's not, why does he know The Jackal? If he's not, why does he know all his moves? And if he is, why is he such a limp biscuit and such a "loveable" person? All this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character(c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend ? I honestly thought this had turned into a Bond movie (d) give the "central" characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence.This film is an insult to the British and Irish killed at the hands of terrorists, it's an insult to the Irish people, it's an insult to not great, but pretty good film it rips off, and an insult to the intelligence. But most of all ? and most unforgivable ? it is an insult to my a*rse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish. Honestly, you'd think with no plot, no characters and no dialogue, it would be over in no time. But they didn't even have the decency to quit early.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different from the original, but still quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sure this movie was going to be a disappointment, but after seeing it I have to say I was deeply wrong. Sure, the story has numerous big holes (Gere knows the operating technique of his opponent so well and down to the last detail, you'd think they used to live together from the moment they were born - total exaggeration, another example are the lame effects when he's between two trains), and Gere's dialect is way off (for some reason it didn't bother me at all), but the rest is pure action and entertainment extravaganza. Bruce Willis was a perfect choice for the Jackal and Sidney Poitier was as always amazing and really helped the atmosphere of the movie with his role. The ending was a bit short, but in my opinion necessary, because I knew what was going to happen, so why delay it. Nicely done, and great music. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of thrills, but lots of absurdity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although The Jackal is one of my favorite films, due to the fine acting of all the principal players (especially Diane Venora), and good direction of the action scenes, the plot contains an amazing number of outright ludicrous elements that I must protest. Taking it from the beginning: In the opening scene, a coalition of police forces storms a Moscow nightclub to arrest a Russian gang figure named Gazzi. Now, as any policeman knows, the first thing you do in an arrest is handcuff the perp. But in this case, despite their overwhelming numbers and armament, Major Koslova (Venora) and Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier), stand and argue with the guy for a few minutes while the other police stand by and do nothing. This, of course, allows Gazzi to get the jump on Koslova with a knife. Not the greatest police work. Then as Gazzi and Koslova struggle, she manages to get her gun free and shoot him. A few minutes later Preston thanks her for saving his life. His life? She was the one he was trying to kill.For revenge, Gazzi's brother hires the Jackal (Bruce Willis) to perform an assassination of, as it turns out, the First Lady of the U.S. In the next scene, the Jackal purchases a weapon on the internet - from some sort of eBay for terrorists, it would seem. He chooses a huge Gatling gun that fires monstrous depleted uranium bullets at an advertised 1400 rounds a minute (although if you time the actual firing later in the film, it isn't even a third of that rate). Now the question is: Was he high? If you want to kill a single person the best weapon is a sniper rifle of some kind, like the one used by the Jackal in the original novel. One of those would have been infinitely easier to acquire, transport, and hide. Instead he buys a machine cannon that would be more appropriate for engaging an entire army division. Okay, dramatic license, but please.He smuggles the giant weapon to Canada, and there he contracts a local techno-hood (Jack Black) to build him a remote controlled firing apparatus. He tells the hood he doesn't want to attract any attention, and demands that he turn over the blueprints for the thing when he is finished. Then when the hood asks him or a few thousand bucks for the plans (out of 70 million the Jackal is being paid), he takes the guy out into the woods and uses him for target practice with his weapon, leaving the corpse and several hundred somewhat unusual depleted uranium bullets for the authorities to find. How's that for not attracting attention? In the book, the Jackal kills the guy in his house and hides the body, much more credibly.After the gruesome murder scene is quickly discovered, Preston and Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) fly up to Canada and locate the hood's shop, where they find the blueprints for the firing station that were so important for the Jackal to destroy, although after he'd killed Black, the Jackal seems to have decided the blueprints weren't worth going back to the shop for. This is a guy that is the absolute best at his trade? Mulqueen takes one look at the plans for the device, which had nothing to do with the weapon itself except to mount it and fire it, and immediately deduces the exact cyclic rate of the weapon's automatic fire. Brainy.The Jackal manages to smuggle the weapon across Lake Michigan on a pleasure boat, and as he's docked at a marina he spies Mulqueen, who appears to be searching for him (Mulqueen had not yet seen him at that point). Does he try to hide, to appear inconspicuous, to keep a low profile? No, he pulls out a gun and starts firing at Mulqueen! How's that for not attracting attention? Then he has to make a screaming getaway in his van. Great plan, for someone whose success depends on not being discovered.For her safety, Mulqueen's former lover Isabella (Mathilda May) is moved out of her house by the FBI people, who fear the Jackal may come after her. Why he might be after her is never explained (perhaps he would need a pleasantly sadistic diversion from the tedious job of planning an assassination). Rather than leave the house empty, Koslova and an FBI agent remain in it, sitting ducks. Why? At one point they realize the Jackal is probably inside the house (they were outside at the time). Do they call for backup? Do they establish a perimeter and contain him, knowing that they have him boxed in? No, of course not. They run back into the house, where the Jackal, hiding and waiting for them, kills them both. Police Work 101? In the film's climactic scene, the Jackal and Mulqueen face off in a DC Metro station in the middle of the day. The scene is a good 5 minutes long, and for the duration of it no one else (except for Isabella) appears in the station. Even assuming that all the riders had been scared away by the gunplay, it's hard to imagine that no police of any variety showed up. Maybe the director waved them out.Considering the competence of the good guys and the bad guy, it's surprising anybody won.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, fast-paced, but sort of ordinary suspense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't really approach this as a remake of the classic 'The Day of The Jackal.' Though broadly similar, the entire feel of the two films is incomparable. And suspense thrillers are all about "the feel" aren't they? The story is pretty standard fair - a super villain assassin (Willis) is going to make a big kill using a huge weapon and leaving a trail of bodies along the way. Gere, an IRA soldier (jailed for "terrorism") is brought on as consultant because he is one of the few people who has seen 'the Jackal", and given a few vague promises in exchange for his help. As it turns out, Gere has more than just knowledge - he has a vendetta. Poitier oversees Gere and the investigation of Willis, and comes to realize that Gere is the only hope of stopping him.I like Sidney Poitier, Bruce Willis and Richard Gere, so I was predisposed to like this film. I was neither very surprised nor disappointed. The Jackal is entertaining and the performances are strong. Poitier is always a class act, and Willis and Gere have terrific anti-chemistry. There's nothing wrong with the cinematography or directing, and the pace of the film, though a little breathless, is fine. Regardless, the story-line never reached much beyond the ordinary thriller fare. Making a truly great thriller requires either doing something really original (very hard to do) or using a truly inspired script. This film's script is decent, but the story line could have used a little more careful thought and a bit more complexity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated thriller undeserving of all the hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never understood why The Jackal has been cursed with poor reviews from pretty much everybody. From the day I saw it as a 17-year-old in January 1998 I always found it entertaining and exciting. This might be down to the fact that I have never seen the 1973 original.Brucie plays a nameless assassin, cool as ice and utterly emotionless. Richard Gere is the only man to have seen him. He's let out of prison to assist the FBI in catching the Jackal before he takes out an uncertain high-ranking official. Willis and Gere are, for the most part, leading their own movies as they never meet until the climax. It's very interesting watching them both go about their business, Willis hatching a master plan and Gere methodically picking apart his trail and hunting him down. There is great support from Sidney Poitier and cutie-pie Diane Venora as a scarred Russian cop.With a wide variety of brilliantly photographed locations across the US and Canada, and plot with a medium-level of complexity it's not entirely brainless viewing but not too taxing as to alienate lazy viewers. I honestly do not get why so many people hate it. Willis has done far worse films (even seen Mercury Rising?) that get off scot-free somehow, but The Jackal doesn't get off so lightly. Aside from Gere's slightly dodgy Oirish accent I have no complaints about this film. Give it a chance and you might just be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop comparing the two "Jackals"... it's useless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a bit of fun reading through user comments on Jackal, and there are two perpetuating issues in about 90 percent of them: 1) this "version" of "Jackal" has nothing on the original (because the original was "oh so great") 2) only idiots enjoyed this version (because its plot is silly).My response would be: 1) the original wasn't so great either (go ahead and jump at me) 2) anybody who thinks only an idiot would enjoy silly movies is an idiot himself.On the first point - why is even so necessary to compare remakes to originals if they can stand perfectly on their own? This one can. In fact it even has advantages over its classic predecessor, such as better editing, better cinematography and even better acting. You may think I'm holding onto a straw here by nitpicking but I'm an odd person that values the benefits of modern productions.On the second point - if silliness (better yet stupidity) of the plot was the criteria by which to avoid the movie, I would probably have seen only about a dozen movies in my lifetime. I would have avoided Bond movies, period movies, parodies and what not. And I'd be poorer for that. So, forget silliness, it's no big deal.Now a little on the movie itself. The plot is indeed stupid (for an in-depth analysis I recommend reading hilarious Roger Ebert's review). The cast reversal is also a bit of misfortune as Gere was initially supposed to be the Jackal. The fact that the role eventually went to Bruce Willis, together with adventuristic nature of Jackal's business, made me root for the bad guy as I never did before. He is conceived as sort of an upgraded James Bond here, being more ruthless, with drier sense of humor and taking advantage of both sexes (not only females) to his cause.I don't know if making bad guy look good was the intention on part of the film crew, but it turned out a very subversive move for a typical Hollywood venture (making an IRA terrorist that pursues Jackal a likable guy as well is probably another one, but I wont go into that). All in all, it was a suspenseful voyage with such a good pace that you don't care about the shortcomings at the first viewing, so I say it's recommendable. There are certainly far worse ways you could waste two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag of good and weak points.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a re-make of "The Day of The Jackal" this movie succeeds in updating the setting without completely destroying the character. As so many re-makes tend to do. Here we find the historical and geo-political context totally changed but there is successfully conveyed the sense of an urgent hunt for one dangerous, faceless force of doom.The technical aspects are among the best features. The cannon is for me the true star of the movie. Willis's multiple identities make for the other star feature. Also his portrayal of the psychopath's obsessional attention to detail and determination to make his lethal "toy" fulfil it's dreadful promise. Check out that look in his eyes in the climactic park scene as he wiggles his "joy" stick.These things allowed, there is one blundering and grossly offensive feature. Gere's character could have been any terrorist from an imaginary outfit or assassin or foreign agent, who happened to know about the "Jackal". Why make him a "hero" out of the IRA? This is yet another manifestation of Hollywood's liberal mind-set dabbling in things of which they have not the glimmering of an understanding. As a UK citizen I have seen plenty of IRA and UDA thugs dragged out into the daylight. Fat tattooed men with twisted faces, scruffy facial hair and mullet hair-cuts. There never was one who could by the remotest stretch of the imagination be likened to a suave sex-bomb like Richard Gere. When one of the FBI agents suggests that his "war" took the lives of women and children rather than "British" soldiers he declares that he never got involved in such things. That is a statement every bit as ridiculous as if it were uttered by one of Osama Bin Laden's lieutenants! Can you imagine Richard Gere at a meeting planning the Manchester city centre bombing, saying to his "colleagues" "Aw, I'm sorry, I 'll have to sit it out on this one, chaps, this isn't my way of fighting a war." And, incidentally, Ulster has been a constitutional part of the British Isles for five hundred years ( twice as long as the U.S.A has existed ). Please note, Hollywood, the Northern Irish ARE British. Moreover, the use of the expression "British" to refer to the English ( which would have been what he meant ) is a uniquely American error.There are also numerous "howlers" in the story. For example, if destroying the plans is so important to the assassin, why does he go off and leave them laying about to be discovered? When the gangster falls dead in the car-park, what happens to the body? Where did Gere's pistol come from in the final scenes? Why did the Jackal wait for the FBI to arrive before opening fire on the intended victim? Why, when they knew who it was and that he was there, did they not simply postpone the opening? Why were there no police or security arriving in the Metro station ( apart from the one killed )? These things aside, a good set of cliff-hangers and one excellent and novel twist, a play on our assumptions, at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; The Bad Of 'The Jackal'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A almost-typical modern-day crime film in which a hired killer goes after a political figure and the FBI tries to stop him.THE BAD - There is a shootout scene at the harbor where nobody was shot despite three professional killers all doing the shooting. Then there is the classic Hollywood hesitation by the killer at the end, thus enabling the potential victim to be spared. That same killer ("The Jackal," played by Bruce Willis) would also have killed the FBI man (Richard Gere) without hesitation at the end. And, how Gere knew Willis was in the subway is never explained. There are other credibility holes, too, in here: too many.THE GOOD - The cast of Willis, Gere, Sidney Poitier and Diane Venora is first- class. All of them play interesting and likable characters - even the villain! Gere did a credible job with an Irish accent and Venora the same, playing a Russian. It was fun watch Willis with his various disguises. The story keeps your interest all the way. It does it right by not having too much action, but shocking and memorable when it does occur. If you have good speakers there is some great sound in the last 20 minutes. A good movie if you like suspense.OVERALL - Definitely worth a look...or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure why this movie seems so low rated, it's well worth a view ! It's fast paced with a number of strong actors and characters portrait very well by them. Maybe the story is not entirely believable, it seems that some leads are obtained a bit too easy, but does that matter? It's just great, action packed, clever, and if you like crime it should keep you on the edge of your chair. No, it's not like the original but I don't think the makers set out to do this. It would have been a crime to do that actually as the original is in it's own an excellent movie and remakes are most of the time disappointing. Go watch it, buy the DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did They Have To Call It THE JACKAL ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fundamental problem with remakes is that you find yourself comparing the remake with the original . When watching THE JACKAL I found myself comparing American and European films . The original DAY OF THE JACKAL was a very European movie filmed entirely in Europe with a mainly European cast and crew with a very understated performance from Edward Fox as a very English assassin . It was a film that was both intelligent and compelling . The remake on the other hand - Despite having a Scottish director - is a very American film : Loud , vulgar , not very clever , with box office consideration over riding creative and artistic factors . You want a determined and ruthless assassin ? How about Jean Reno ? Ah but you can`t do that because the studio want a big name American actor like Bruce Willis in the title role , a role where his character has to don several disguises none of which make him look like anything more than Bruce Willis in a disguise ( A bit like Val Kilmer in THE SAINT where no matter how much the hero disguises himself he always looks like Val Kilmer ) And being an American film who better to play an IRA man than that well known wee , short , fat , middle aged Irish actor Richard Gere whose " oirish " accent is less convincing than the Jackal`s disguises . Once again this is the fault of the studio who are dying to cast a big name no matter how unsuitable they are for the role and once again I`m disgusted to see an IRA character as a good guy . Note to American film producers : By the 1990s most Irish Americans recognised the provisional IRA for what they are - Murdering scum . In fact one of the main reasons the IRA wanted to reach a settlement was because they`d lost all political and financial support from the Irish American lobby . The IRA had few friends over there then and have no friends over there now so stop making films with IRA characters hoping you`ll have a guaranteed hit in Boston and New York , it`s patronising to Irish Americans and offensive to us BritsI do concede THE JACKAL is entertaining in parts and I did like the bizarre title sequence featuring a montage of 20th century Russian history set against a techno soundtrack , but it`s a very inferior film compared to the original . In fact I can`t help thinking the producers shot themselves in the foot by describing this as " A remake " because there`s very little common ground between the two except for the assassin plot . If you changed the name of The Jackal character to something else there`s very little chance Frederick Forsyth or anyone else would have sued for plagerism . As it is watching this Americanised version I found myself saying out loud " The original was better . The original was better . The original ... "</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*CONTAINS SPOILERS*Caton-Jones once described himself as a set-em-up and shoot 'em director. He sees himself as a journeyman then, which is fair enough, it's hard enough to forge a career in film as it is; but his 'Rob Roy' shows he's capable of more. Still, it's to his credit that he keeps this shambles on the road, but that's half the trouble. His competence prevents this turkey from becoming the laughter riot it needs to be in order to be truly entertaining.I won't bore you with the daft plot details. But what's this? I've just received a fax telling me that my dog has been kidnapped and I won't see him alive again if I don't. Blimey, okay then. Did you know that the KGB allows the FBI to bust Russian Mafiosa in the heart of Moscow? In fact, they're best buddies now, and the KGB is invited over to run around the USA too. So it was only ever a luke-warm war then. In fact, if a Russian nuclear submarine was ever to sink they'd call their American buddies straight away for help. Anyway, the Russian mafia man Terek Murad is mildly miffed at the death of his brother in the afore-mentioned raid and gives one of his serfs a splitting (not to mention life-long) headache for failing to protect him. "I loved that man like a brother. So I took no joy in that. Imagine what I can do with someone I hate," he tells the assembled mobsters. Bravo! Encore! The orchestra stands. Garlands fly. Tears flow. A superb delivery of a classic line. Familiarity can never wither it's sweet bloom. Long may it reign. "Imagine what I can do to someone I hate." Well, actually I can. You give them a Tom Cruise video.Meanwhile, the FBI man involved in the Moscow raid, Carter Preston, is in Ireland to get an IRA man released from prison to help him find the Jackal who has been hired by Murad to exact a bloody and unknown terrorist outrage in the States. The terrorist, Declan McQueen (giggle) is not like those other nasty provos. He doesn't bomb. An attitude that no doubt made him a man to trust within the organization. Maybe he just handled the cloakroom during army council meetings. Or did the sandwiches. You see, our Declan is a man of integrity. Instead of hiding behind a bush and blowing the legs off people he just shoots them instead. Hey, there's a war on, you know. Or so Declan tells us. Hang on a minute, wasn't an IRA man involved with the deal to partition the country in the first place? Blimey, I do wish they'd make their minds up. One minute it's peace on, then next minute it's peace off. Anyway, to hell with politics, this is Hollywood. On with the action! Or in-action in this case. So Declan is released by a curiously magnanimous British government (HA!) to accompany Mr.Porter and a chain smoking Russian agent named Koslova to find Declan's ex-wife Isabella, who has seen the Jackal's face and is also a Basque terrorist turned housewife. So what did she do in that terrorist organization, make the tea? Is she cuddly too? Still, if a bottle top gets stuck in the kitchen she can always shoot it off. Koslova ignores Isabella slipping Declan a key to his cuffs. After all, he's no danger to the public, just a cuddly chap who shoots people he disagrees with. Declan reveals to Preston that he too has seen the Jackal while being double crossed during a Libyan arms deal. What, arms that were intended to be sent to Ireland to blow up innocent people? But he said he doesn't bomb. He just let's someone else do it. So that's alright then, he's still cuddly. He only bombs when he tries to do an Irish accent.Meanwhile, the Jackal is taking a different approach to his predecessor Edward Fox, who disposed of a blackmailer with a discreet karate chop and then hid the body in a trunk. Taking a more subtle approach in this remake, our Jackal takes the blackmailer to the wide outdoors and proceeds to shoot at him for several minutes with a very big and loud gun followed by the blowing up of his car in a massive explosion that must have been heard for miles around. Later on, our hero Declan has traced the bad guy to a boat race moored in a harbour. Preston, realising that some people are born cuddly while others have cuddlyness thrust upon them, lets our Declan go wandering off on his own to find the Jackal but without a walky-talky. What's he supposed to do when he finds him, jump up and down screaming "HE'S HERE! THE *******'S HERE!"? Thus getting himself shot at. Saved by Koslova, Declan is mysteriously promoted to what looks like the boss of the whole FBI operation. But hang on, since Koslova got a good look at the Jackal's face, hasn't Declan's involvement become redundant thus earning him a one-way ticket back to the nick? But NO! They need him. He's indispensable. He's a grubby little sniper. He's...he's...Irish? Yes, that's it, he's IRISH! And looks a bit like Richard Gere. Funny that. And this time it's personal. The 'war' in Ireland, his big calling, is forgotten. Meanwhile, our highly professional and single-minded Jackal decides to stage an entirely superfluous attack on Koslova who is guarding Isabella in a house. He is also somehow able to determine how many people are inside and outside the house at any given moment from a vantage point hiding in a dark closet under the stairs. Must have x-ray specs on. Finally, after serving up a little lead salad, he leaves giving Koslova a clue as to his intended target. My God, he must want that $70m so badly. Anyway, she got off lightly. Think what he might do to people he actually HATES. Like leave a map with arrows. I mean, can you imagine Edward Fox's Jackal poisoning his van's door handles thus leaving a somewhat conspicuous corpse next to it in a public car park? AND he was only offered a million in that film. Perhaps This Jackal prefers a cat and mouse game. But a mouse doesn't usually send up flares.So finally getting his mind back to the job in hand, our Jackal decamps to a speech given by the first lady where he sits inconspicuously next to an open van with a large gun sticking out the back of it. But our Declan has sussed his move and is on the roof looking for him through the sights of a rifle. Will he be able to shoot the Jackal or will his shooting arm be irresistibly drawn towards some innocent civilians? Old habits die hard. However, the Jackal legs it into the subway and spotting Declan looking for him in the crowd, decides to do the sensible international man of mystery thing by staring directly back at Declan. With conveniently dyed blonde hair. A chase reaches on to another platform which is mysteriously empty. Have all the people suddenly left to join the IRA? Including the police? After all, an organization that is full of members refusing to bomb things must need all the help it can get. Our Declan is soon in a sticky situation with the Jackal after exchanging his gun for a child hostage (what a guy. So cuddly. I'm seeing fluffy bunnies!) But the Jackal is taking an awful long time to shoot him. But help is at hand. It's Isabella! Blimey, what a coincidence. She must have been out shopping for banana clips and other house hold appliances. Well, Carter Porter is impressed by our homicidal man of the people. So he decides to look the other way and let Declan wander off. How heart warming. Just imagine if that was a British film and that was one of the Oklahoma bombers Scotland Yard let disappear into the sunset. Really gets you there, doesn't it?Well, it's a very long and boring review, but let me tell you, it's not a long and boring film. This is a GREAT film. A masterpiece. It's amazing. Wonderful. Encore! Author! Now please release my dog. Mind you, if it's the Jackal who has done the kidnapping I've nothing to worry about. He could use cyanide, a tank, an Uzi, 100 pounds of plastic explosives, the Iraqi air gun, chemical weapons and last but not least, a small nuclear device and the pooch would still be left smiling and breathing untouched. Could you just do me a favour Mr Jackal, and feed him for me, before releasing him? No, not that end, the one that barks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked this movie? Congratulations, you're an idiot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may well be the worst remake Hollywood has ever produced, and that's saying something. I'll take it further than that and say this movie is so stunningly, deliriously bad that IT MUST BE SEEN. I don't know if I'm even capable of tackling all the things wrong with it--like the fact that the casting director appears to have pulled names out of a hat, or the mind-blower of Richard Gere's character being allowed to walk away scot-free at the end (I'm sure the people saying, "It's just fiction, who cares" would have no problem if it was a former Al-Qaeda operative who just wants to return to his home country)--so I'll just devote my review to the utter hilarity, which is mainly the scene where Bruce Willis is testing out his gun. In the original version, you'll recall, the Jackal practices his kill on a pumpkin. The pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "understatement." In THIS version, Willis sets up a pumpkin target, but he doesn't use a sniper rifle--he uses a gigantic remote-controlled cannon which costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge conspicuous minivan (this man likes a challenge). He reveals the cannon by pulling away a tarp, at which point Jack Black, who is there to observe, jumps around and says, "That ROCKS! This thing ROCKS!" about 18 times (I guess Willis didn't have to disassemble it first, he just lifted it, tarp and all, out of the back of the van, despite it probably weighing several tons). The scene then turns into an Austin Powers movie as Willis misses the pumpkin and takes out a tree, then has Black run through the mud with his pants falling down, finally blowing off Black's entire arm. The pumpkin falls to the ground, unharmed. If I can recommend this movie for ONE non-ironic reason, it's for the Diane Venora character as a tough Russian major who becomes romantically linked to Gere despite having a facial disfigurement--a bold move for a Hollywood feature. By mid- movie I was really liking this character, so it was a shame when she had to be killed. I would have liked to see a movie about her. Other than that, this pile of crap is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis got a big ? Gun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a friend a lot of convincing to make me see "The Jackal". After all, the original "Day of the Jackal" remains one of my all-time favorites and since I'm not particularly fond of remakes, I gave this film a skip for many years. However, there come those days of 'nothing else on TV, so what the hell' and must admit, the remake isn't half-bad.Edward Fox is one of my favorite on screen-assassins, having played his role so convincing, that it was frightening. His passionless killing-machine made him look less human than Arnies Terminator and, seeing the "Day of the Jackal" as a kid, the thought that people like this could actually exist, gave me the creeps. Other than his strange stage-crooner-persona of 'Bruno', Bruce Willis' Jackal may well be the most unusual Willis you've seen to date. Let's speak honest: Bruce is a character whom everybody likes to watch on screen ? but a thespian with a great repertoire he's not. Willis seems to try and 'out-Herod' Edward Foxes psychopath from the original ? and does a remarkable job. At times his performance is eerie, indeed having the evil glare of a jackal.It's a nice nod to the original (where it is not only left open whether the Jackal was hetero-, homo-, bi-sexual or something completely different) that there are hints that Willis' Jackal may actually be gay. This is not meant to sound demeaning but a gay Bruce Willis is like, let me think, a straight Bruno (the Sasha Baron Cohen Bruno, not Willis' alter-ego). While Edward Fox slept with victims of both sexes, Willis is only once seen seducing a future victim, in this case a male politician. But more so, during the few moments where we see the supposed real personality (if something like this exists) of the Jackal, there's something distinctly feminine about the character. One example would be when he kills Major Koslova, the other, more poignant, when he receives the call that the contract is off while taking a bath and sipping on Rose wine (also a remarkable scene because Willis manages to do all the acting with his eyes alone).To speak of the 'supporting' roles (because a film with Bruce Willis, other than "Pulp Fiction" only has one real star): all fine as you'd expect from veterans like Richard Gere (despite the cringe-worthy accent), Sidney Poitier (sadly, one of his last few screen-appearances), JK Simmons, Tess Harper or Jack Black (according to rumors, the audience was cheering him being shot to bits, with people remarking "wish this would happen in every film he's in").Of course the movie has weaknesses and plot-holes that are bigger than that Freudian nightmare which is the Jackals gun. For the life of me I still don't understand how the ex-terrorist Isabella Zanconia could have aided with the capture of the Jackal. But so what? In the end, this is a "boy's movie": boys who like big guns and dramatic action-scenes involving helicopters, car-chases and big guns. Boys who like loud, snappy techno-soundtracks accompanying Bruce Willis firing big guns. Boys who like to watch Jack Black being obliterated by a big gun. In short, boys like you and me ? and despite still not being very fond of remakes, I can honestly say that I liked "The Jackal". "Doesn't have to be caviar all the time", goes a saying ? sometimes a burger from greasy McDs will do, just as there are times for a no-brainer like "The Jackal".7 generous points out of 10, because giving points doesn't cost money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, But Generic Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jackal is based of the 1973 film, The Day of the Jackal. This 1997 version is a different story than the 1973 version. It is more of a generic story with the feeling "been there, done that." However, it is still a good movie with action, great acting, and some unexpected moments.This is about how FBI deputy director gets a terrorist, Mulqueen out of prison to help him track down a shady assassin, known as the Jackal, before he assassinates his political targets.The acting is great. Bruce Willis and Richard Gere had great chemistry. Willis was the reason why I saw this movie. I was surprised to see Sidney Poitier here but he did a great job as usual.Overall, this is a solid film that is there for enjoyment, not for awards or major critical success. Even though I seen many of these kind of films, I liked it. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension,action packed and man hunt in this thriller with good playing by the main cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture deals the known history about Jackal.Bruce Willis stars as an ice cold series killer,he's employed by the Russian Mafia wants avenge for a FBI intervention in its issues and his target is allegedly killing FBI's chief. Jackal is an unknown man and he's solely known by a convict terrorist from IRA named Declan(Richard Gere).He's given a bargain by an experienced FBI official(Sidney Poitier)and his group(Diane Venora,J.K.Simmons) and the chase,the manhunt, is on to find the vicious killer escaped with ominous purports.They team up to catch the biggest world hired murderer.Declan contacts with an ex-ETA terrorist(Mathilda May)who had a deep relationship with Jackal.Meanwhile the unemotional murderer is preparing the hired assassination and buys technological weapon to an arms-crafter(Jack Black)what are experimented in alive(in similar scenes from the first version with Cryl Cusak).The picture contains lots of action,suspenseful,past paced thriller,intrigue,tension but at times it seems too similar to another action films.Agreeable chemistry between Richard Gere and Sidney Poitier along with excellent action sequences like as the breathtaking final game in the subway are someone of the worthwhile items in this rehash from the classical Day of Jackal.Willis,Gere and Poitier,the trio protagonist, make a solid portrayal of their characters backed by a splendid secondary casting. The film is based in Frederick Forsyth's best selling novel of political intrigue previously adapted successful by Fred Zinnemann with Edward Fox.However here is quite different,but the target is political ,the general Charles de Gaulle by the OAS(terrorist organization anti-independence Algeria),while in this film is apparently the FBI's director. Colorful cinematography with beautiful locations by Karl Walter Lindenlaub and enjoyable music by Carter Burwell .The motion picture is regularly directed by Michael Caton Jones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think people here expect to see a remake of The Day of the Jackal. This movie has nothing to do with The Day of the Jackal. This is an independent fictitious tale based upon Carlos the Jackal. It is one of my favorite Bruce Willis flicks, and has one of the greatest movie scores of all time. As far as entertainment by Bruce Willis goes, this is an 8 out of 10, hands down. Get over this being a lousy remake of an entirely different movie, and appreciate it for what it is. An outstanding effort - $60 million worth. In my opinion, Bruce Willis is as good as a bad guy as he was in any of his good guy roles. I would not dismiss this movie until you see how great he was in it. A terrific cast and great story line make this a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1973 "Day of the Jackal", directed by Fred Zinnemann from the Frederick Forsyth novel, while not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things, was nevertheless quite an above-average thriller, written and carried out with considerable panache, wit, and style. It remains a pleasure to rent and watch now and then.In adapting that for the 1997 "The Jackal", it seems that at every turn the writers and director made the worst possible choice, making it all quite leaden, overdone, unsuspenseful, unsurprising, unsexy, and unthrilling. If we put together a catalog of all the specifics that went into this movie, big and small, I could give you a mini-essay for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation ****ed up.Item: the weapon. In the original, there is considerable intrigue over how the assassin is going to smuggle it onto the scene, how he intends to disguise it, and why it needs custom work from his underground craftsmen. In the remake, they apparently thought that today's action-flick-raised audiences wouldn't tolerate a small rifle whose point is precision and would demand the lugubrious off-the-[black-market-]shelf machine gun, which needs a minivan to transport it, and whose point is to shout Macho. The whole involved and interesting business about disguising its components, has been reduced to showing us (repeatedly, like this is a difficult point to follow?) that the joystick for his absurdly high-tech remote-control system has been in his pocket as a pen. Item: the conspirators and motive.Without resorting to dry lecture, the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the "pieds-noirs" [ "blackfeet"], the French-Algerian irredentists who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism, and formed the view that De Gaulle had betrayed them. This gives the whole plot some historical weight. The remake seems to leave it as a gangland-shootout revenge story, minimally spicing it up by making them Russian gangsters. Note please that I'm not opposed to updating: they could have done this intelligently and come up with something more current but non-trivial. Certainly Russia and the rest of ex-USSR have been through huge changes of late, and an updated story could have been situated there in a way that would make us feel that it *matters*.Item: the relationship of the assassin on the run and the police hunting him down; and the complex steering of the viewer's sympathies from the bad guy to the good guy.Above I hesitated somewhat at calling the original a masterpiece overall; but in this aspect it really was one. We follow along with the assassin for much of the first portions of the film, and having seen his cleverness and resourcefulness we begin to admire him, and not want to see his plan thwarted or see him caught -- at least, not too soon! Then we meet the policeman who gets pushed into heading up the investigation / protection efforts, and bit-by-bit we take to him, and see he is not the sad-sack his domestic troubles may have suggested. By the time it matters, we have been won over to his side.In the remake, perhaps Poitier could have handled that sort of development , but Gere sure can't. And the absurd "48 Hours"-derived gimmick of the con brought out to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from. The remake has the assassin and the assassin-hunter *talk* about how they 're like players above a chessboard, communicating indirectly via their moves and only able to *infer* what the other is like. That was achieved superbly in the original. But in the remake in fact they're brought into face-to-face confrontation way too soon, so they can grimace at each other, bloody the place up, and go through some fairly standard chase scenes.Item: photography, and "scenery".The remake does have some nice images, particularly in snowy Finland in the opening section. But the Washington, D.C Metro cannot really compete with the streets of Paris for interesting perspectives and bystander faces. &nbsp; &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on cable a few nights ago. I originally saw it in the late nineties on DVD. The all-star cast of Bruce Willis and Richard Gere combined with an attractive storyline give this movie a running shot at being a successful thriller. Unlike the book (Day of the Jackal), this movie is filled with so many flaws and inconsistencies that it falls flat. Its apparent that the writers and directors did not consult experts in the fields of espionage and law enforcement. Willis gives a better performance than Gere, who is stuck with the awful task of mimicking an Irish accent. If you like the premise of this movie, then I highly recommend you read the novel Day of the Jackal for a better written expose of this assassin.</fullReview>

This aside there is very little to entertain the viewer. Though I have to admit to side splitting laughter at the finale (yes I got to the end - just!) as a family-mover lowers its window to reveal a 33mm canon targetting at the first ladies rather ugly thighs (not a dig at Hilary surely?) and noone in the crowd notices?Basically the plot goes through mind numbing paths that are either meaningless, have such deep meaning that the profoundness is lost, or are boring.

		<fullReview>If they can't think of new story lines, it would make sense for Hollywood producers to at least do remakes of films which were mediocre or had visible flaws in their original version, because then they will have room for improvement. For example, Soderbergh remaking Sinatra's Ocean's Eleven, a film that looked great but was actually a bore, was a great idea.But what oh what is the point of taking one of the sharpest, most compelling, most stylish and also most famous thrillers of the seventies and "updating" it to the 90s by adding inane pyrotechnics, absurd characters and tearing the storyline to bits? Did this resulting piece of trash actually make any money? Really? Beats me.To everyone who has voted any higher than 4 for this thing, I recommend you take another good look at the the original Day Of The Jackal, and learn to tell apart the men from the boys.

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis plays an assassin nicknamed the Jackal, the most deadly man in the world. Personally I thought he was about as deadly as Michael Cain with a spud gun. Willis is hired by a powerful K.G.B boss to take out the head of the F.B.I because they killed his brother in a major raid. The F.B.I get wind of this planned assassination, but they have no records of the Jackal, nor as anybody ever seen him, except one I.R.A prisoner who is Richard Gere. Doing two life sentences for murder, he agrees to help them find the Jackal if he is allowed the possibility of being set free after it is all over. The film starts off very slow and continues that way until the last thirty minutes when the action starts, if you could call it that as Gere and the F.B.I try and locate the Jackal. I won't give away anymore, but basically this film is slow, uneventful, unimaginative and lacks any good action sequences. Willis is a professional hit man but he didn't convince me that he was an expert, or a cold blooded killer, who everybody respected and feared. Maybe it was just bad acting. In the film the "Saint" with Val Kilmer you actually believed that he was a brilliant con man who could get in and out of anywhere and his disguises were actually convincing. As for the other actors Gere played his part well as did Sidney Poitier as the F.B.I agent in charge. My opinion is keep well away from this film. I give it a TWO out of ten.</fullReview>

Furthermore, it brought angry protests from the creators of the original film because it had retained the original title. Director Fred Zinneman, along with novelist Frederick Forsyth and screenwriter Kenneth Ross, forced the producers to change the title to The Jackal. The producers declared they were adapting Ross' screenplay and not Forsyth's book, a dubious claim, to be sure.The Jackal is a pure waste of time.See the original film, and maybe read the book beforehand.

		<fullReview>This is an awful, awful movie -- made even more so by being a remake of one of the finest thrillers ever made, _Day of the Jackal_. Where to begin? The whole thing is such a dead loss: the performances (by hollywood heavyweights versus the original's international cast of skilled professional actors), the plot (silly sensationalistic pandering versus the very real political context of the alleged plot to kill deGaulle), the gimmickry (Willis's Jackal relies on theatrical disguise instead of the more subtle and proven approaches taken by Fox's), the gadgets (so, tell me again why he needs to use a Vulcan Cannon when a simple one-shot rifle was enough in the original?).It's really saying something that the high point is the low-key romantic involvement between Venora's hard-bitten Russian cop and Poitier's sly FBI man. It's like something from a Nick Fury comic, but oddly enough it's as close to anything like reality that this movie comes.Don't rent this unless you're looking to fill the docket at a bad movie party. It's probably pretty good for that, full of pretty posturing by Geer (ouch! where'd he get his accent coach?!) &amp; Willis, and improbably plot elements a-plenty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine action movie. Strong cast and excellent story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen some fairly negative reviews about this film and as the "Day of the Jackal" is very high in my estimation, I was expecting to watch something less than excellent. I was astounded to find that "The Jackal" is at least as good and in some respects better. The production values greatly transform the film; the budget was well spent and the result is total credibility. A strong cast helps; Willis is brilliant as the cold, chameleon-like central character. Poitier and of course Gere are equally superb. Jack Black is at home with the role of technological wizard; who of course has an Achilles heel; as his hippy, cool persona reveals. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jackal is certainly not the best film ever made perhaps due to its lack of subtlety if compared to 1973's The Day of the Jackal, which is used as its main inspiration. I think what lets it down a fair degree is the casting of Richard Gere as an IRA henchman (although it is hilarious having to listen to his character Mulqueen's accent though)! On the other side of the spectacle, Bruce Willis as The Jackal is convincing enough - although the many disguises he uses are quite laughable - and Sidney Poitier is always a class act.The action jumps from one place to another perhaps a little too quickly, one scene focusing on the Jackal's preparations, the next we're seeing the authorities planning their own next move. The supporting cast - including Diane Venora and JK Simmons - perform well although Jack Black's inclusion is a bit mellow.In a nutshell, The Jackal is a (very) loud and brash sort of action thriller that is good enough to pass the time with a bucket of popcorn with your friends, but it certainly won't go down as a memorable movie of its type. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a good movie to watch. Th disguises by Bruce Willis are really good and keeps you in the seat. the gun too is amazing to work in action for the kind of people that like all smoke and no target.But those who think much might never recommend this movie. Tactics never seem realistic.1. Jackal(Bruce Willis) is hired for the work. Then there is no news of the client. Whether he is dead or alive no one knows or cares, not even the Jackal.2. Is it really possible to buy that sort of a gun on "the internet". Don't think so.3. The Jackal is suppose to be best at his work. Surely he seems like a rookie He can't even do silent kill.4. The way Richard Gere deduces things is far fetched. How in the world can he know Jackal is going after the first lady from that.5. Jackal lacks effort. The guy cant even get a second car, instead of the one everyone knows about.Lot more questions...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping Modern Assassin Thriller, Bruce Willis at AAAA****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say it now; I'm one of the few commentators on IMDb that has seen this (The Jackal) and not the 1973 'The Day of the Jackal'. Actually I lie, I saw the first 10 minutes of 'The Day Of the Jackal' before my attention casually wandered. I'm not here to judge the Zinnermann classic, except to say it clearly was not in the league of such unmissables as "A Clockwork Orange / Soylent Green / The Shining". And no, I don't have Attention Deficit Disorder; I am simply a man of 24 years old who was born long after the 70's, and thus have little engendered appreciation of the languid movies and scripts that automatically awed the children of that era.Now onto 'The Jackal' of 1997. First thing to note is this movie doesn't particularly show it's age. Bruce Willis in "The Fifth Element" was released the same year. If I was to guess which film was early 90's and the other was in the 2000's; The Jackal would score that more recent time-slot for sure.The context provided by this movie was sufficient and convincing. Bruce Willis's portrayal of the Jackal was superb; never more so than in his first scene where we see his probable 'true persona' (interrupted from watching a nature documentary on Hyena's), as he meets up with the Russian Mob boss to discuss his contract.The Jackal's preparation throughout the film was an absolute joy to watch. We are treated to seeing Bruce Willis in a diverse range of disguises exceeding the extremes of any character we've seen him play in movies before or after. I'm sure many first-time viewers will be equally agog at his warm-hearted interaction with ID-falsifiers, the way he can quickly convert his vehicle's colour and plates, his same-gender seduction-technique, and his manner with bank managers on multi-million dollar sums. Also we joyfully get to hear a Stephen-Hawkins-type synthesised voice receive and reply to Bruce Willis's enquiries between tokes of his cigar regarding arms dealing in a mahogany-clad office. What superb preparation! Now I must come to the ultimate painful downfall of the movie. Let there be no mistake; Bruce Willis as The Jackal is the superstar at all times. He is the one who we empathise with if you have even a slight inclination/respect toward 'coolness' or 'efficiency'. Despite your moral position; you will be routing for The Jackal. Unfortunately we have Richard Gere thrust upon us as our Protagonist. Just as Bruce Willis is a joy to watch; Richard Gere is the exact opposite. I'm British, so the fact that he's playing a mythologically-good hearted IRA terrorist incarcerated in a US maximum security prison, who eventually becomes the lead riflest/tactician/forensic psychologist/clairevoyant of the FBI is the singular largest plot-hole imaginable to me. The nearest comparison-for-plausibility for our stateside folk is that of Osama Bin Laden being pardoned then employed as a palm-reader for the NYPD in busting a low-key brothel. That or Sadam Hussein's corpse hosting Jay Leno's Show.I've read several reviews of this film, and they've brought forward several plot-holes. Some truly mystify me, and some I find that I can easily explain away:1) Why did The Jackal continue after finding out that Richard Gere's character was a 'consultant' in the operation against him. Answer) Personal Vendetta / Prideful Arrogance / Premonition of Richard Gere's character/acting ability.2) Why did The Jackal visit Richard Gere's ex's house Answer) Personal Vendetta / Prideful Arrogance / Premonition of Richard Gere's character/acting ability / Indirect vengeance for R.G's intervention in Chicago on Lake Michigan.3) Why was an enormous cannon chosen over a simple sniper-rifle. Answer) The assassination was supposed to be public and SHOCKING. I'm no fire-arms expert, but I think a depleted uranium round from that monster would be a head / torso exploding event should it find its target. Also, I doubt a sniper-rifle can be operated by remote control and from such a huge range. Plus no chance of escape for a conventional sniper i'm sure.The one mystifying plot hole I can't explain (Other than Richard Gere's character existing):1) The Jackal did not return to the mechanics garage to erase all traces of the plans for the mount.This was the gaping plot hole. From this, Richard Gere was able to predict mode of transportation, weight of weapon, and rounds per second apparently.I'm tired, so i'll skip to a conclusion. Bruce Willis as The Jackal was superb, but then a flawed formulaic Hollywood storyline brought the fun to an end, and with a horrible horrible protagonist. Personally I would have quite like to have seen The Jackal win, and enjoy many more sequels. But that's me. As for any potential viewers, this is definitely one of the more gripping and enjoyable film's you'll see, and an absolute must for Bruce Willis fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose you could overlook a number of silly points like Geres weird wandering accent. It does occasionally hit "Irish", but most of the time it is just "not American". Or why exactly the jackal needs some sort of anti tank weapon to take out a single civilian 200m away. But why should I overlook these points? There are plenty of better movies out there.If this movie had renamed the characters, I suppose it might have rated 5-6 stars. Unfortunately it just had to pretend to be a remake of a classic, so you are just going to get people making comparisons. The original Jackal was a calculating killer on an important job. He didn't leave a wide trail of corpses behind him because the decided to flip out to prove how hard he is. Neither did the original Jackal make simple mistakes like revealing his plan to taunt his trackers or leaving blue prints behind. That last part was stupid, he request the plans from the Jack Black character then kills him for demanding more money, but then doesn't bother to pick up the plans afterwards? As a remake, this deserves around 2 stars. As a brainless action film, it might get 6. So I will be magnanimous and average at 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad, its mesmerizing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately for you and me, Bruce Willis has not always been discerning in his selection of roles. While succeeding with his stint in Pulp Fiction, and doing a fine job in both the Sixth Sense, and in Unbreakable, Mr. Willis chose a rather terrible movie here.Its difficult to describe this movie without giving away too much of the plot line, but suffice to say that the plot is utter and complete crap. There are made for TV movies with better dialogue, script, and effects.Yes, effects. For example, when you see a character standing on a rooftop, and even that looks fake, you have a bad movie, my friend.The elements in Russia steal directly from The Untouchables, and not in a good way. The accents all around are horrible, not just Gere's Irish, but the Russian is terrible as well.Willis looks like he's hung over throughout the film, and just can't wait to get to his aspirin. As well, the violence is random, and in one particular scene, rather needlessly gruesome.(**very mild spoiler, I promise**)The film concerns a Russian mafia honcho who is seeking revenge for the death of his brother (at the hands of a Russian police/military woman) by having the super-special secret assassin Willis assassinate a high-ranking American (we don't know who, yet). So, the Russians, who are working with the Sidney Poitier led FBI (Sidney looks absolutely lost, btw) come to America to help the FBI track down this big time assassin, who apparently nobody has ever seen or knows what he looks like. Never mind the fact that the Russian Mafia Honcho just hired him with a snap of his fingers AND IN PERSON (doh!) (that's the mild spoiler). Somehow, Richard Gere's IRA terrorist character (introduced out of nowhere) has seen Willis and lived, so he is of course the only one who can help the massive military and intelligence agencies who are trained to do this type of tracking out.The rest of the film just spirals out of control into a terrible ending. Not one character is developed, nobody is believable, and all of the dialogue is in spurts and stilting. Gere tries, but he looks to be crying at the stupidity of this thing.What makes me angry is somewhere a director and some writers got paid for this thing. Come on Hollywood, if you are going to consistently hand out money for crap, pay me--I swear, I could at least flesh out a consistent plot. Of course, so could my 12-year-old brother.I really question the intelligence of anyone writing a good review of this film. It makes me wonder if they are being silly just to get a reaction.El Stinko, avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis is the whole show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original movie "Day of the Jackal" has nothing to worry about from this remake.I'd like to know why the Jackal intentionally gives important clues throughout. I'd like to know how Isabella knew where Declan (Richard Gere) was in the subway and where she got another gun. I'd like to know why the Jackal kills 3 agents in Isabella's hiding place, and then she shows up. I'd like to know how Willis got the weapon off the boat and to another location. That's enough loose ends for now.The second half was not as good as the first half, but the whole movie was surprisingly lacking in tension. It had too many hackneyed lines. It seemed tired. Sidney Poitier seemed tired. Willis was very good. His expressions and facial contortions and impassiveness at times made the movie. Gere's part was just too Hollywoodized. I knew that Diane Venora would bite the dust. She underplayed admirably.A flabby thriller flabbily directed. Apart from Willis, it had a neat monster weapon and method of assassination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, I know, it is so easy to bash this film as so many of you have done.It's a thriller that doesn't stand out in it's genre, pretty easy to watch but not more than that. It has a high profile cast including Bruce Willis, Richard Gere and a couple of very very decent actors slash actresses like J.K. Simmons, Diane Venora and so on, so nothing wrong with that. A more than decent director in Michael Caton-Jones, who does his best with the material he's got and doing a good job at it. Sadly he has to work with a script that has potholes the size of Hummers H3 in it, so it's easy to see why this film doesn't work the way it's supposed to.but!!!! If you have read some of the novels written by Robert Ludlum (may God rest his soul) you will have picked up some of the vibe he has put in most of his novels, putting the Jason Bourne Trilogy upfront. And just to be clear about it, I'm not talking about the miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain and also not even mentioning the Matt Damon movies (although those were really cool) but the original novels as Mr. Ludlum intended them to be. If you have these novels in the back of your head and are a fan of them you will find this movie pretty enjoyable to watch although the execution of this movie has some problems in staying believable.It is in general a pretty normal thriller with ('m sorry to say) some mayor flaws. But I can't escape the feeling that the script (allthough adapted from an apparent classic of which I haven't yet had the pleasure of watching) was written in the mindset of an all-out genius Robert Ludlum-vibe, which I picked up on immediately and enjoyed very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Jackal" Is A Howler!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching horrible movies like "The Jackal" is enough to make you howl in derision. This Bruce Willis &amp; Richard Gere assassination saga ranks as a pallid remake of director Fred Zinnemann's classic 1973 thriller "The Day of the Jackal." Typically, Hollywood remakes are inferior when compared with the original, and "The Jackal" indisputably proves the point beyond a shadow of a doubt. Sluggishly paced, abysmally written, and hilariously performed, "The Jackal" has managed nevertheless to sucker large audiences into cinemas, based undoubtedly on its stellar cast, rather than its narrative."The Jackal" draws its inspiration from scenarist Kenneth Ross's "Day of the Jackal" script. No screen reference appears in the opening film credits for novelist Frederick Forsyth who penned the international bestseller about a lone assassin gunning for French president Charles de Gaulle. Whereas the original "Jackal" took place in the 1960s, the "Jackal" remake unfolds in a contemporary setting. What made the original "Jackal" a tense, spellbinding, but imaginative actioneers was how the filmmakers got around their obvious dead end ending. Everybody knew that De Gaulle was never shot down by an assassin, so Zinnemann and his write Kenneth Ross had to dream up a plausible resolution. They did. "Memphis Belle" director Michael Caton-Jones and scenarist Chuck Pfarrer, however, come up with nothing to match the original's clever conclusion.That's not to say that "The Jackal" isn't an elegant looking epic with some interesting high-tech firearms. The movie makers have spared no expense in rehashing the original. The story globe trots from the new Moscow to Helsinki, then London, England, and finally the United States. The problem is that director Caton-Jones and scenarist Pfarrer have eliminated the best parts of Ross' original script and replaced them with their own brain-dead plotting. When the characters in "The Jackal" aren't acting like imbeciles, the people who made the film are.FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier) storms into a Moscow disco on the heels of Russian Intelligence officer Major Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora of "Wolfen") and her policemen to bust arrogant Russian mafioso Ghazzi Murad (Ravil Isyanov of "GoldenEye"). When he cannot bribe Koslova, Ghazzi whips out a knife. During the ensuing struggle, Koslova shoots Ghazzi at close range and kills him. Terek Murad (David Hayman of "Walker") is furious when he learns about Ghazzi's death. Terek is so upset that he buries an axe in the head of the mafia soldier who brought him the bad news.The vindictive Terek hires a lethal assassin known only as "The Jackal." Demanding bloody retribution, Terek pays the Jackal the sum of $70-million dollars, half in advance and the other half on completion of the killing. Specifically, Terek demands the head of the FBI killed in spectacular fashion. The Jackal orders Terek to hole up somewhere outside of Russia until he has iced the FBI chief. Meanwhile, Russia authorities abduct one of Terek's bodyguards.Under gruesome torture the bodyguard yields the word 'jackal.' Koslova informs an incredulous Preston that the KGB once used the Jackal's services. Moreover, they learn that somebody is alive who can positively identify the Jackal. The catch is that the FBI doesn't know where they can lay their hands on Isabella (Mathilda May of "Lifeforce"). The best that they can come up with is her old flame, IRA terrorist Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere of "Internal Affairs"), who is pulling a 50-year stretch in a Massachusetts lock-up on a weapons charge.Reluctant initially to reveal the whereabouts of his ex-girlfriend, Mulqueen decides to help the FBI. Not only does he tell Preston that he has seen the Jackal, but also that he can recognize the Jackal's methods. Caton-Jones and Pfarrer cross-cut between the authorities tracking down the Jackal and the Jackal's painstaking efforts to elude capture and devise a failsafe scenario so he can get away without a trace. As the tight-lipped, amoral, icy-hearted eponymous character, Bruce Willis turns in a Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hide performance. Willis' hit-man travels incognito with several identities and passports to get him through customs anywhere he goes. Talk about dressing up. Half of "The Jackal" is wasted as we try to spot Bruno in his next outlandish disguise. Willis has more fun dressing up than shooting people. None of Willis' disguises are as ingenious or playful as the ones Val Kilmer wore in "The Saint." Now, you "Die Hard" fans are going to be disappointed with "The Jackal." One of Bruno's disguises is playing a homosexual, and we get to see Bruno kiss another homosexual. No, you don't see their lips smack! Willis and the filmmakers photograph the kissing scene tastefully so that you cannot actually see Bruce's lips on the other fellow's mouth.Although Willis makes a tolerable villain, he is supposed to be the deadliest hit-man in the world. Truth of the matter is that the guy cannot hit the side of a barn with his pistol. In an early shoot-out with Valentina, the Jackal misses practically every shot! Later, in a subway gunfight with Mulqueen, the Jackal incredibly cannot put a bullet in the ex-IRA gunman! Here's the Jackal behind a pillar swapping lead with Mulqueen who is standing out in the open without a bit of cover, and the Jackal cannot hit him! Which brings me to the Jackal's sophisticated Gatling gun weapon. Does he want to make the shoot-out a bloody one with a weapon that can empty its clip of ammunition before the first shot tears into its target? Or is it simply that the Jackal is a pathetic marksman? Richard Gere looks hopelessly miscast as an honorable IRA gunman. His emerald accent is acceptable, largely because he doesn't have to utter a lot of singsong dialogue. The movie makers do everything that they can to whitewash Mulqueen's character."The Jackal" could have been a great cat-and-mouse thriller, but all it manages to be is a wedge of cheese with a thousand holes in its storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jackal is quite simply one of the dreariest movies I've viewed in my life. Bruce Willis is the "Jackal", a professional assassin. He is hired by a Russian crime lord to eliminate the head of the FBI. This happens about ten minutes into the movie and from there the whole film went downhill. From the beginning the movie was totally unbelievable, in a bad of course. While some movies successfully produces a suspension of belief, The Jackal is simply outrageously beyond belief.All the cliches one expects from an action movie are in The Jackal. As I sat on the couch trying to watch the movie, I could predict the plot lines. The characters are completely flat, the attempted emotions in the movie have absolutely no human feel. It was as if the characters are reading off the script somewhere. Much of the movie is passed by waiting for Willis to assemble his gadgets and get reading for the assassination. The entire process is so boring that The Jackal could have been a blank documentary film about how a hitman prepares himself for his "jobs".Willis is supposedly an expert in disguise, yet the viewers are never allowed to see him disguising himself. Apparently, the director assumed that the audience would imagine this and not ask any questions. A serious continuity problem.All these issues and more make The Jackal an utterly unenjoyable film, and I truly regret the time I spent watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but I wanted Willis to win</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS I liked this film. OK at times it seemed to go along quite slowly but every scene with Bruce Willis was electrifying. For this reason I found myself wanting The Jackal to succeed in his assassination attempt. This is obviously not what the film should be doing, leaving the audience wanting the antagonist to win the day but there just seemd to be no empathy with the other characters. Richard Gere's character's emotion at the death of Diane Venora was totally uncalled for. They only actually spoke properly in a conversation once in the film. And anyway he would not be the first to approach her, he's a convict for heavens sake! I also hated the ending with his old bird saving him. She would never have been there. And in the chase prior to that why didn't Willis just turn round and kill Gere in the tunnel. He's a killer and excellent shot, as he proved earlier. There was no need to run off because it was only Gere chasing him, not an army of men.However Jack Black's torture was sublime and by far the best scene in the film. And as I said before every scene with Willis in, bar the resolution was first rate. Enjoyable action fare overrall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All through this movie I found myself not really caring about what happened to the characters. The movie stars Bruce Willis as "The Jackal", a cold-blooded hit man, Sidney Portier as a dedicated FBI official trying to stop him, and Richard Gere, an I.R.A. prisoner and the only man that can stop the Jackal. This all sounds very exciting, but it really isn't. The movie's action doesn't really start until well into the film, and I got pretty bored in between. Finally, there is the big blow-out action-packed ending, which I had predicted entirely by the time it actually happened. The movie did, however, have a few good action scenes, and at a couple of parts, I found myself laughing at scenes that were supposed to be serious. So, all-in-all, I give it a 4 out 10, and advise everyone over twelve to stay away from this movie (despite its 'R' rating).</fullReview>

Gere is an IRA terrorist who is in jail for double murder (and doubtless lots more!) and we also have a Basque terrorist as his "love interest". Now you might not believe this, but these two are the "good guys". They are employed by the FBI, who mysteriously have operating rights in Helsinki, to catch Willis the hitman. With a plot like this it is no wonder that I think a lot of people will actually support Willis as at least he does not blow up innocents in shopping malls etc. Maybe I am reading too much into this, but it is about time that Hollywood woke up and realised that terrorists are mass murders and not romantic heros and the thought that the FBI would make a deal like they did with them is just laughable. Anyway at least Willis's wigs were interesting. See the original Edward Fox one, that had some class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. if it weren't for Tarantino (and probably Fever Pitch, though i will never know) i think this would be the in the top 3 of worst movies ever. besides just being boring, it is also absolutely ridiculous. Why would Bruce Willis need that enormous gun??? and why did he need a remote control? and why did he sit right there when he used it? and why did he open the van window? and why did the Russians want to kill the first lady? why not the president? and most importantly, Why in the world was this movie ever made? I really don't think there is a single redeeming quality about this movie. couldn't they have at least gotten ONE decent looking girl for one of the lead roles, and possibly done a topless shot? at least that would've been something. i am trying so hard right now... anything? haha, i guess it was funny to see jack black in a semi-serious role. but still. just ridiculous. i give it my lowest rating, sixteen hundred forty five thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laughably awful. One might think that all the big-name actors involved in this movie would at least make it believable, but they do not--this one is a stinker.Characters either sprint around without having a good reason to know where they are going, or they stand around making constipated faces when they should be running for their lives.Check your higher brain functions at the door if you intend to try watching this movie. Or, get a bunch of your most clever friends together and give this one the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment. That's what I was doing through the second half of this turkey.And PLEASE don't confuse this with the excellent movie "The Day of the Jackal," a far-superior thriller from 30 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this was an intelligent thriller that lived up to the original. I thought that willis portrayed the perfect cold-blooded assassin. Richard Gere did a fine job as well. Even though you can tell his cheesey accent is a fake. This is not an action movie, so if you're expecting cars and planes blowing up, it doesn't happen. Even though one car blows up. This is a thriller and a good one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected The Jackal to be Hollywood fluff and it is certainley hokey. The direction and cinematography are really outstanding though. Michael Caton-Jones is a major talent. This film is cliched, but it is one slick looking film. I got caught up in the story somehow and ended up enjoying it quite a bit. Maybe it's because I saw it on DVD with the surround sound cranked up, but I think this film is worth watching for the talent behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jackal (1997): Dir: Michael Caton-Jones / Cast: Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier, Diane Venora, Jack Black: Remake of Day of the Jackal that gets reduced to formula and a game of cat and mouse. Bruce Willis stars as the Jackal, an assassin whose disguises mainly consist of wigs but his methods are savage. The C.I.A enlist a criminal played by Richard Gere to help track down Willis. Graphic violence becomes the norm including a scene where someone's arm is blown off. It is obvious the Gere and Willis will meet and have a violent confrontation that will solve absolutely nothing. Director Michael Caton-Jones handles the action but the production is nothing marvelous. Willis and Gere have little screen time together and when they are within the same general location it is indicated with a really lame glare via Willis as if he senses Gere's presence. Willis also phones up some homosexual guy whom he shoots dead for no reason. Also wasting time is Sidney Poitier and Diane Venora who hopefully didn't get their hopes up on this film actually turning out good. Jack Black appears to supply Willis with arms only to have his arm blown off before being finished off with a second blast. This sort of junk has been done countless times but for the two leads it will hopefully lead to a better film to embark upon in the future. The screenplay has more bark than bite.

		<fullReview>They, whoever they are, say this is an action movie. No, this is a love story about two men who have guns, and also they are sad. Love is hard to come by for some folks, like for instance the protagonist and antagonist, so the story plays out as a mirror between the two. Like Bruce Willis's character wants to love dudes but his commitment to his job blinds him to happiness , so instead of getting laid he kills people. Richard Gere wants to love ladies but his past gets in the way and all he gets to do instead of loving is kill Bruce Willis. The moral of the story is : Human beings concoct mountains of bullsh*t everyday specifically to get in the way of love, because loving somebody for real, like no bullsh*t, is scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, I didn't watch The Day of the Jackal (1973). I just picked this movie out of the blue, liked its summary and went for it. And to be fair, it's quite good.I like action movies like this. Straightforward. They just cut to the point. No, this doesn't mean this movie is all about action. I think the storyline was good: they provide you with enough information, nothing more, nothing less.Of course it can be a little "over the top", but people need to remind this is fantasy; it's just a movie. So you can't take fantasy here, but shiny little vampires are OK? C'mon..! Also, to be fair, I think the movie is pretty believable!I saw people complaining, comparing this movie to Day of the Jackal. Well, like I said, I didn't watch it, but this movie is only based on Day of the Jackal, as if they just took the idea. I'm OK with that.</fullReview>

The first 1.5 hour of the show, it tells you how the "good guys" admire and fear the "Jackal". In the entire show, I think the Jackal only killed 1 security guard, 1 guy who helped with the equipment, and nerve poisoned another dude. Okay, fine - not killing a lot may not matter much. However, he was supposed to be a "pro" assassin/killer. Clearly, the movie plot is so one dimension that after the failed assassination, the Jackal has become an amateur, becomes vulnerable and has no plans at all.It does have some slight actions, just some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best political action thriller ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a an action political thriller movies, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.The Jackal (1997) is one of the best political action thriller movies I have ever seen. It is entertaining enough and worth seeing on it's own. It is million times way better than the movies that are made today. The gory violence of "The Jackal" is a big "screw you" to PG-13 thriller movies. The movie is very enjoyable it has everything in it. The acting in this movie is very realistic and superb. The action is non stop and intense and delivers on a good way. Bruce Willis did outstanding acting performance of the character Jackal. He acted the role perfectly and very believable realistic. He was cold ruthless man with thousand names and thousand faces and mystery disguise. He killed anyone who figure it out his true identity or was suspecting him. He used a lot of guns and weapons. This movie made from the book was brilliant and intense packed so that the viewer is hooked up on the edge of a seat and keeps guessing what will happened next. This is the first time I saw Bruce Willis playing a villain in the movie and did gave us superb acting performance. He did in this film a masterful performance ever.The acting in this movie is very realistic and phenomenal and I mean from everyone who played in here. This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations. This is Michael Caton-Jones's best movie to date and that he ever made. The director did an outstanding direction debut and knew what he was doing. Richard Gere as Declan Mulqueen an Irish Republican Army sniper who was locked and imprisoned in maximum security did and outstanding job helping the FBI and Russian Police tracking down an intelligent and genius assassin down. Richard Gere was very convincing in his role as an Irish, his ascent was more British than American. Even for American his ascent was convincing. I thought that Richard Gere could have been the next James Bond 007 not that we have Daniel Craig in it.This is Sidney Poitier's final film appearance to date. I think he acted convincing and it was his best performance I have ever seen! Sidney Poiter played three times an FBI agent that I counted. Twice in a year 1988 Shoot To Kill and Little Nikita and the third time in this movie in the year 1997. I don't count other movies he played in the 70's. I am glad that he is still alive. The last actress I wanna say that I love in here is Diane Venora as Major Valentina Koslova, MVD. This was her last and I mean last acting debut of her role of a tough woman. I never saw her in any other roles like are that now, she even wear a scars on her face, It was outstanding. I only wish that Diane Venora would get more roles like is this one. She was awesome and I loved her, the death scene was really amazing no one could acted better.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The action scenes were incredible and very fantastic. The shout out scenes are incredible and outstanding executed. Even Jack Black has a small role in it. The most awesome scene that I have in mind is the helicopter when US Marine sniper Akashi (Daniel Dae Kim) gives the rifle Heckler &amp; Koch SR(TC) to Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere), who uses the rifle to shoot the scope off of The Jackal's (Bruce Willis) automated machine gun. Akashi then uses the rifle to shoot the gas tank and ignite the fuel, blowing up the SUV housing the gun. That scene was realistic I am pretty sure that Richard Gere had a lot of practice with the riffle, before he was in front the camera shooting with the riffle in the film.The face off between The Jackal (Bruce Willis) and Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) was phenomenal! It was so realistic acting performance that I seriously believe it and I was convinced that the acting is and the story evolves in realistic world. I'm not sure what else would you want in a movie like this? Probably moral content, the movie portrayed and executed perfectly the book. I have very enjoyed this movie from beginning till the end it is my favorite best action thriller ever. I am giving it 10/10.The Jackal is the 1997 action thriller starring Richard Gere as a former IRA sniper who is recruited by the FBI to track down a professional assassin known as "The Jackal" (Bruce Willis), who has been hired by a Russian mobster to eliminate a major American political figure. The film is a loose remake of the 1973 thriller The Day of the Jackal./: That is the basic plot and I think this movie deserved to bashed or hated for. It is much better than the new movies are today!!!10/10 Score: A+ Studio: Mutual Film Company Alphaville Films, Universal Pictures Starring: Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier, Diane Venora, Mathilda May, Jack Black Director: Michael Caton-Jones Screenplay: Chuck Pfarrer Story by Chuck Pfarrer Based on The Day of the Jackal by Kenneth Ross Producers: James Jacks, Sean Daniel, Michael Caton-Jones, Kevin Jarre Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hrs. 04 Mins.

All that is know for certain is that the target is American, important and the world will know who it is once his target is killed. Bruce makes his way around the world, assembling the parts of his plan. The only person they think can identify the Jackal is an Ex-Irish Republican Army militant Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere). The plot has many twists and turns. Jack Black, a female Russian spy and other characters add spice to this well built cast. If you enjoy thrillers this one will get you at more than one spot.

		<fullReview>Not a patch on the The Day of the Jackal (1973). Bruce Willis is about as miscast as you could possibly get, while Richard Gere's Irish accent nearly sinks the entire film. The original's high-level suspense is discarded here in favour of more action; and, while Caton-Jones' direction is good here, to much emphasis is placed on bigger bangs, at the expense of the storyline. This concerns The Jackal being hired by the KGB to assassinate a particular high-ranking member of the US government. Apparently the only person to have seen him is Irish terrorist Gere, and he also is (conveniently) the only person who can stop him as well. Don't watch this; watch the original.

He is wonderfully matched by Richard Gere's IRA terrorist, with a great Irish accent who has a score to settle with Willis.Willis is cunning, sly and remains unknown to all with the exception of Gere who had worked with him at one time.What the Willis character does to the Jack Black character is horrifying and yet we're able to watch it on screen.Sidney Poitier gives excellent support as a CIA agent. He comes to trust the Gere character fully as seen by the film's ending.</fullReview>

Nevertheless, this movie is well worth watching just for Willis's superior cold and calculating performance that most evil assassins just become another stereotypical, sub-intelligence by the numbers performances. There is just enough rough edges in this movie to make this movie well above average because it avoids being too cute, too polished, too super-ordinary implausible and that's this movie's nuanced directed distinction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake of the 1970's Film--Good Acting But Somewhat Predictable Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis and Richard Gere have to be given a lot of credit for saving this film. If not for their excellent acting, the script does lapse into somewhat predictable political-espionage thriller clich. It's not like we don't have a lot of similar fair piled into the film archives of the studios. Willis makes a great assassin nicknamed "Jackal". He' been hired out for 70 million no less to take out someone famous in the US, but we don't know who. He's the ultimate man of mystery, taking on different disguises in different parts of the country.The FBI and CIA can't get a handle on him. Figures. So the only guy who might have a chance to keep the Jackal from blowing up the whole country is a US prisoner formerly with the IRA. Although not all the details are clear, he was involved in some kind of operation with the Jackall who shot his bride-to-be, wounding her and killing their unborn child in the process. The CIA and FBI, headed by Sidney Poitier, convince Gere to sign onto the operation to stop the Jackal from whatever heinous crime he is going to enact, which we assume is of a higher import than taking out the local janitor. He already does that with ease. In exchange, he might be released.The best parts of the film consist of the many disguises Willis dons as the Jackal. In one, he appears like a former hippie out of the Haight-Ashbury with long blond hair and plaid shirt untucked. In another, he's an international businessman. He even plays a homosexual. In one of his more contrived efforts, he's an overweight laborer with hideous taste in clothes. But he not only disguises himself. He constantly changes the color and plates of his van. And those who gets in his way pay the usual price.A superb cast infiltrates this movie. Besides Willis, Poitier, and Gere, even Jack Black makes a surprise appearance as a sleazy underground arms manufacturer. He receives an order from Willis to supply him with some kind of weapons device. Half now, half on delivery, Willis' typical terms. Of course, the schmuck doesn't understand who he's dealing with. You don't up the price on a hired assassin.Pretty good through about 2/3rd's to 3/4th's. When the actual crime is finally revealed, I found it somewhat of a let down. The very end seemed typical of many films of this type, leading to a final confrontation with Willis and Gere. I was hoping the film would take a detour and lead in an unexpected direction, but about 30 minutes toward the end, I kind of knew where it was going. That said, Willis' portrayal is still worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One review above says "Gere did a credible job with an Irish accent". Another points out that the director was so lazy that he didn't care that the IRA man had a Southern, rather than Northern Irish accent. According to the Trivia, Gere worked with a voice coach to get it right.All I can say is, that both my wife and I commented the moment he opened his mouth, that we could not work out from where he was supposed to come. Clearly the intention was Irish, but it was so awful that it defies description. I couldn't say it was Southern rather than Northern, because it was so terrible that you couldn't begin to ascribe it such an accolade of being recognisable as either.Did add a nice touch of humour to the film, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very predictable techno-thriller from Michael Caton-Jones ("Memphis Belle") adapted from the original 70's classic, "The Day of the Jackal".Technically the film misses the mark too many times and often the FBI is too completely stupid. Add to this several character inconsistencies and you have a looming disappointment. Such a shame considering the promise shown.Special effects are explosive when needed, as is the sound. Carter Burwell's score is underused. Bruce Willis makes an enjoyable villain, and one rather wishes he was more successful against drab "hero" Richard Gere. Diane Verona makes a much more likable good guy as the tough as nails Russian Major, Valentina Koslova. Sidney Poitier is always good value, though not at his best here.Friday, January 30, 1998 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you expect much from this movie, you have not been reading the reviews.However, if you don't expect much from the movie, you might enjoy it. It is miles from the Forsyth novel, with just a few key aspects recognisable, and has been rendered something other than the intended, by the Hollywood machine and too-big budgets. The original '73 movie was much better, if a little dated at this point.Almost everyone plays well, with believable, if somewhat basic, acting, holding up the storyline. Declan, Isabella, Preston, all the major characters are in place, with the sad exception of Bruce Willis. Somehow, I found myself not believing his character, which is unfortunately rather key to the movie, being the part of the Jackal himself. If you can look away from this basic fact, as I could, not the first, but the second time, you might find yourself rather enjoying this movie, as an action movie, but not much more. Good entertainment, with a single flaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pays homage to the original, but stands alone in presentation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1973 classic "The Day of the Jackal," this remake does pay a lot of homage to the great novel and film. But I believe that director Michael Caton-Jones intended to make the film stand on its own, and thus didn't make a pure remake.The Jackal in this film is American, not the Englishman featured in the original, and obviously he isn't planning to assassinate the President of France. Instead, Jackal (Bruce Willis) is hired by the Russian Mafia to eliminate a high-profile target in the United States Government. Of course, FBI deputy director Carter Preston (Sidney Portier) and Russian MVD Major Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora) are right away sent to Washington to notify FBI Director Donald Brown (John Cunningham) that he is a prime target by a man who "?in twenty years has not made a mistake in a profession that doesn't allow error?"Preston and Koslova alone cannot track or find Jackal, but Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere), a former IRA soldier/sharpshooter, has seen and tracked him before.I believe that fans of the novel and the original will be disappointed at the lack of detail in this film. We all remember the scenes of intense preparation spent by Jackal in the 1973 version, and they are much more detailed. Then again, this is an updated, more modern interpretation. Today's audiences aren't satisfied anymore in an action film that only has two or three minutes of action.Acting is good, particularly by Venora and Gere. Willis stays comfortably in his typecast and doesn't push the limits of his talent, although it is good to see him as a villain and not a good guy.For those with DVD players, the DTS-encoded presentation makes the film come to roaring life with precise clarity and realistic sound. Much better than the Dolby Digital track that Hollywood's still embracing.</fullReview>

Basically everyone in this movie overacts, but it is not fun to watch as it is in TRUE LIES, because everybody thinks he is really serious - this movie lacked the suspense to be a good thriller and the action to be a thrill ride... sure, the names look good, but the movie does not deliver, and sorry, but there is no really recognizable, high profile victim like DeGaulle. My recommendation: Rent DAY OF THE JACKAL, the original movie featuring Edward Fox, THAT is the movie to watch, not this poor attempt of a copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The easiest way to explain The Jackal is to say - "Shooting, assasins and blood." It stars Bruce Willis as The Jackal, a man with no true identity who is a mission to kill, um, this woman. It also stars Richard Gere as a man who is let out of prison to stop The Jackal from killing more people and making the world a bloodbath.I recommend The Jackal.My rating - 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...as giddily entertaining as "Point of No Return"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all means, if you are interested in seeing this movie, go out and rent the 1973 thriller "Day of the Jackal" , of which this movie is a remake. You will have the opportunity to see an excellent and fast-paced movie which will place the Jackal in context when you do eventually view it. Armed with the knowledge of "the Jackal"'s precursor, I found it interesting to which elements were kept and how they were manipulated. From this, it is directly evident what candy major-studio American pictures are: more and bigger guns, explosions, necessary love interest, and endings which continue on and on and on...The only novel and redeeming element of this movie is Bruce Willis. His man-of-a-thousand-faces presentation is so delightully expressive (in that subdued way that a cold-blooded killer can be expressive) that I was content to stay 'til the ending of this one. But please, by all means, save a few bucks on the rental and get a copy of Day of the Jackal" first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It`s nothing compared to Day of the Jackal. With a story like this it should have been a much better movie. Bruce Willis is terrific as the Bad-Guy, but Richard Gere could have been better as an Irish terrorist, his accent was terrible. The rest of the cast is quite good, Sidney gives a great performance. The directing could be better and also the screenplay. What`s worst with this movie is that everything goes too easy. You have the world`s greatest assassin (Bruce Willis) whose been in the business for over 20 years, and is considered incatchable, and yet all you notice in the movie is how he makes one mistake after another, and the end of the movie is the worst I ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From time to time you see a good actor in a truly appalling movie: in this there are three. I wondered at first if it wasn't a Naked Gun style take off - it was stupid enough, but not quite as funny. The plot was as thin as rice paper, and the notion that a skilled assassin is going to use a .50 cal machine gun to shoot their prey is preposterous. Also given the remote control system used to control said machine gun (through a cell phone link - shades of Speed!) how stupid to be sitting right next to it. The myth of super-assassins is that they don't get caught the Jackass (sorry, Jackal) would have been miles away.I thought Gere's Irish accent was quite good; infinitely better than Meryl Streep's feeble attempt at an Australian accent some years ago. Bruce Willis was totally miscast as the Jackal - I would have picked Leslie Nielsen or Michael Palin and really made this the comedy it deserved to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis is Fun as Jackal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script may be contrived, employing plot devices unnecessary to the plot (ex--the Gatling gun...a sniper rifle would have done the trick with far less commotion). It may throw into the mix countless plot devices seen a thousand times before (ex--Gere is the ONLY one who can stop The Jackal, but must be let out of prison first; it is personal between Gere's Declan Mulqueen and The Jackal). It may be twenty minutes overlong, occasionally tossing us a hint that is never explained or referenced later (ex--what is that paper handed to Willis at the bank near the beginning?). Gere's performance may sway the entire audience toward The Jackal's side (probably against their will), as his accent is unconvincing and his character unremittingly routine...you will find yourself on Willis' side, no doubt. And it did p**s me off that the good guys are (in order of importance), an IRA assasin with a bad Irish accent, a female Russian KGB officer (Diane Venora, excellent), and a black FBI operative (Sidney Poitier IS one of the greats of American cinema, hugely likable here)...the bad guy however, as put by one character early on is simply "an American." A white one at that. Yes, the film is flawed tremendously. But Willis is having so much fun being the bad guy that whenever he is onscreen, he is magnetic. He delivers one of his finest performances here (still a DIE HARD fan, he is the quintessential action hero), causing us to take his side, even though, if given deep enough thought, he really is an unscrupulous b**tard with not one redeeming quality. But so what? Gere had a chance to draw us onto his side, he blew it; he is upstaged embarassingly by Willis' calm, calculated, menacing performance. Who won the '97 Best Oscar anyhoo? Geoffrey Rush wasnt it? Christ... Yeah, see it for Willis, and the number of riveting vignettes featuring blown-off arms, subway chases (climax #2), dead gays, and the "public and brutal" climax (#1). Q</fullReview>

Sometimes I think people get to caught up in making movies real life. The movie is about trying to catch an assasin "Bruce Willis" The Jackal. They let an Irish terrorist (Richard Gere)out of prison to help catch him because he has had dealings with the jackal in the past. Richard Gere isn't my most favorite actor but he did ok in this role. Sidney P. as the FBI guy as always does his part justice. I love the suspense and action. I have never seen the original "The Day of the Jackal" so I don't have anything to compare it with, and frankly I don't think I'd want to. I like this movie for what it was.

		<shortDescription>An Action/Thriller That's Not All Action And Thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many of these kinds of movie depend on action and adrenaline and little else. That's more or less what I was expecting with this story about an ice cold assassin known as The Jackal (Bruce Willis) who's hired by a Russian gangster to kill a high profile American political figure in revenge for the FBI's involvement in taking out his brother in Moscow. My expectations were exceeded. The main problem with action/thrillers is that they often have little in the way of story. Some would argue that this is a standard type of suspense movie, I suppose, but I found the story interesting, and the characters more fleshed out than one would usually find with this type of movie.Although called "The Jackal" the movie revolves more closely around the figure of Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) - an Irish terrorist jailed in the United States who's recruited to help the FBI find The Jackal before he pulls off the plot. Gere was quite good in the role, and the story filling in his background gave a plausible reason for why he would become so involved with the FBI's efforts. Yes, they made some promises to help him, but there's more going on. It's personal between Mulqueen and The Jackal, which perhaps gives everything a bit more of an edge. At times, the movie looks as though it's just about to fall into unnecessary romanticism with Mulqueen's relationships with a couple of women in the story. Valentina (Diane Venora) - a Russian agent who's involved in the search for The Jackal - and Isabella (Mathilda May) - a former Basque terrorist now living a quiet family life in the US - both look as though they're ready to "get physical" at times with Declan, but the relationships never go there, which I appreciated. Sidney Poitier was solid as Carter Preston, Deputy FBI director.Generally speaking, I thought this went above and beyond what one would normally expect from the genre. The level of post-Cold War American/Russian co-operation depicted struck me as perhaps a bit too naive or hopeful, and one of The Jackal's identities (the Canadian "Charlie") grated on me (as a Canadian) a little bit. He came across as too much of a stereotypical American perception of Canadians, saying "eh" in every other sentence and using an accent that I've never actually heard in Canada. The same could be said for Jack Black's gun- dealing Canadian "Ian" who's also a bit of comic relief. Nationalistic sensitivities aside, however, I found this a very enjoyable, fast-paced and interesting movie.</fullReview>

Next to him in my mind stands Bruce Willis in the title role in "The Jackal". What happened to David Addison? Where is the Jersey Goofball? If this guy wants you dead, you're going to be dead. He is in no hurry. He does his homework. He has a backup plan, and a plan C, and a plan D. And he thinks on his feet. And he can change his appearance in seconds. He blends in. He is a great actor--he BECOMES who he wants you to think he is--charming, obnoxious, smooth, bungling, whatever the occasion requires.Watch him win the shootout with the FBI agent toward the end! She lies, writhing in pain, bleeding copiously. The killer strolls over: "Oh! that has got to hurt! The dark blood shows you've been shot through the liver. Take your hand and push it in hard right HERE and you can prolong your life maybe 20 minutes. Or don't, and your pain will end sooner." Have I said enough? Watch this movie! Get ready for chills. Richard Gere is excellent. Sidney Poitier, as always, excellent! But as for the actor in the title role, Who are you, and what have you done with Richard Gere?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Stars, But A Great Scene With Willis and Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this by accident, and was glad I did as I was looking for something to watch, but by the time it finished I was telling my friends who were watching also, boy this is one stupid movie. I'll tell you what part really impressed me though, and why I rate it a 6 just because of the movie up to about this part did rock. The scene was when Willis' Jackal tests the gun out on Jack Black, I did not see that coming AT ALL! LOL. OK now, the movie gets stupid as hell, when they have this guy tracked to the marina, and Willis is clearly trapped and he somehow gets away. You've also got a ton of 1st billed stars and the material can't support them all, PLUS, the bunch of nobody Canadian (?) actors that seem to all get their own face time. Than finally, what was the point of killing a First Lady? Would that change world politics much? I guess it was cool to make a Hillary a target but I still couldn't see, ANY, point in that. Willis is cool though like when he blows up Black. One last point, when Willis is blasting away at the end, did anyone in the crowd get shot? It looked like on my small TV that all the bullets went high, that was pretty lame. 6 of 10, its worth at least one viewing, just to see Willis and that cool gun (and what it did to Jack Black, LOL). I vaguely remember the original movie and it seemed a lot more realistic, plus since it was French (?) I'm a sucker for that stuff, I don't think it had a whole lot of action though, good suspenseful ending though.</fullReview>

Like at the horrible, disgusting ending. He could control the gun from virtually any point in the world - but he chooses to sit 10 feet away from it. Christ. I nearly walked out of the theater when I saw this. Up until to that point I really liked the movie. Bruce was great, Gere's character sucked. But I could live with that. But from then on it went downhill. Oh boy. They literally drove it into the ground.Coming to think about it.. it was Gere's character that ruined an otherwise good movie. He was way too good. His dark past as an IRA terrorist is mentioned in two sentences. From there he is the hero. The good guy. A role Gere plays with a disgusting nice guy attitude and a horrible Irish accent.And then there is the finale. The big shootout. I could've lived with all the aforementioned would've been there another ending. My god. The jackal, near death, ready to shoot Mulqueen but then Isabella pops out of nowhere and takes vengeance.

The romantic battle for freedom and one mans fight for love and revenge against the man who murdered his unborn child. Didn't quite gel with me I'm afraid. Maybe being British meant I had trouble rooting for an IRA terrorist. In fact, I had trouble with the way the film treated a convicted IRA terrorist as a fundamentally good man, focused on his love story and loss, and ultimately allowed him to charge through the streets with a gun because he gave his word he wouldn't do anything bad.The whole film is testament to the flippancy shown towards terrorism by America in the past, when it was "somebody elses" problem. I wonder how Gere's character would be portrayed nowadays, and instead of being an IRA terrorist how about an Al-Qaeda terrorist instead. Would he still be a loveable rogue?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Willis fan - in particular 'Twelve Monkeys' and 'The Sixth Sense'. The Jackal, however, was a huge disappointment. Firstly, the film-makers managed to irritate me enormously by portraying an IRA terrorist as an action hero and by allowing Richard Gere to stink the place up with his cod blarney. Secondly, although you'd expect some elements of fantasy in a film like this, the plot was so ludicrous that I found it hard to become engrossed. Surely a stone cold killer like 'The Jackal' would have been able to dispatch Gere in a one-on-one, and I for one was hoping he would do just that.If you're looking for positives Jack Black's demise is quite entertaining, otherwise well worth avoiding.</fullReview>

So it'd be better if this movie had a different name anyway but good.... We are in modern Russia that's ruled by the Russian mob and since the FBI and the KGB started work together, maffiatypes got eliminated...this of course asks for revenge and so they hire The Jackal (played by Bruce Willis). The sole person on earth who can get him is a prisoner (Richard Gere) who was sent there for life after being involved in several IRA-bombings. Don't ask any questions how things can be possible cos there are some black spots in the scripts, better watch the excellent performances from Bruce Willis who plays at least 10 different personages here and he's the kind of killer who has no mercy... Also great to finally see Richard Gere in another role then a bored lawyer. Not a superb movie but better than the rest...</fullReview>

The good guys Declan, Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier) the FBI deputy Director and Valentina Koslova (Diane Verona) the Russian Major who is on top of mob hit list form a team with the major US agencies to track the jackal. The story takes you to Russia, Canada and USA. Overall the acting of all the characters is very good. Richard gere and Bruce Willis are simply terrific. The story sidetracks when there seems a relationship is developing between Declan and Valentina, though it gives a nice touch to the film. The cold, feared feel of the jackal seems very authentic, and puts this film in top of the list of assassin movies. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED A MUST SEE FILM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the film, which first version was made in 1973 directed by Fred Zinnenmann and acted by Edward Fox (Jackal). That version was based on the original novel of the writer Frederick Forsyth. The plot of the former film consisted of an attempt to kill the president of France, Charles DeGaulle, by the members of OAS after the war in Algeria. Now this new version has been changed, since the victim is the first lady in USA. Sorry, but Bruce Willis is not the best "Jackal" if compared with "cold bloody" Fox. Richard Gere is an imprisoned IRA fighter who helps FBI to find out the criminal, to abort the attempt and to finally kill him. Suspense exists but no more than in the initial version. Poitier and Gere acted as usual giving necessary emphasis to the film, but it is difficult to assert how many of the public was convinced with Willis performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Day of" was a classic because the slow exposition of the Jackal's master craft made the audience finally start to empathize with him. In this one, as well, Willis adopts numerous disguises and personalities, but there's too much over the top American crap that would draw attention to a real professional.Loved the scenery of Russia, despite some dubious scenes (they send a woman to arrest a top gangster and nobody has their gun out?). I was a reporter there, and trust me, the Mafiya is as bad as every story says- in fact the whole story of a Mafiya hit on an American official is not at all unlikely. Venora's dry, tough Russian cop is a masterful performance, Gere's credible as a reformed Irish terrorist (doing a decent accent), and it's nice to see Sidney Poitier again. Even Willis, a vastly underrated actor (see Sixth Sense again- nobody uses quiet better) is OK as the icy soulless killer- (picked up that blank look in the bars of NYC). But, yeah, they do have him doing some dumb things- the weapon, and the latop remote control is stupid and wildly implausible.Still, if you liked the original, you'll probably like this.

		<fullReview>(spoilers)The Jackal is the story of a payed assasin, Bruce Willis, who receives the job of killing the FBI director David Brown. The FBI, together with the russian Police, get a convict out of jail, Richard Gere, to help them in their hunt.When this movie began and the intrigue was set, i was absolutely sure what was going to happend. The Jackal, a well known killer with 20 years in which he didn't miss any job, receives a new mission. That's what the whole movie is about. During the whole film everybody talks about the Jackal and we get to know what he has done, so his character grows in our eyes as an uncatchable guy, who never misses and is impossible to capture. We know this trough what everyone sais but during the film The Jackal is just an ordinary guy who plans his hit. He does nothing spectacular or to confirm his name, just kills some helpless guys. I think this is a bad point of the film. We don't see him doing nothing special.The ending is so predictable that it's not even necessary to warn you that spoilers are coming up next. When we find out that The Jackal is actually planning to kill the First Lady, not the FBI director, the situation gets even more "normal": he will miss. And is it normal for an assasin as the Jackal to leave clues behind by his free will? (I'm talking about the "You can't protect your women" stuff). That seemed like a desperate cry for getting caught, didn't it?And a goof: after he gets shot in the leg, the Jackal walks normally for a few seconds and catches that girl, but in the next scene he limps heavily.Maybe the only good point of the film is Richard Gere, who plays very well his role. He has a good irish accent and convinces everyone with his way of acting.Except that, action, and only action. My vote: 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this updated version of the Jackal, Bruce Willis plays the elusive Jackal, supported by Richard Gere, and Sydney Poittier, and Diane Venora, with Jack Black,, its a good action movie,, tense,, with some twists and turns,, lots of things getting blown up. i can't really compare this Jackal to the DAy of the Jackal, which follows the original true story, along with the book, but this one i thought, should have gone after a different target, or maybe had other bad guys,, the cold war is over with and their's Russian bad guys. but anyways, the movie is solid,, and lots of action to keep you on y ou're toes, Bruce does have a few good comedic lines in it, overall i would recommend it to anyone,, just don't get caught up in the oh have to compare it to the original Jackal movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mysterious assassin known only as The Jackal (Bruce Willis) is been hired by the Russian mob boss (David Hayman) for his next target for $70 million. The Jackal is also a master of disguise by changing his identity, passports and looks. No one could identify The Jackal expect for one man, Ex-IRA Sniper Delcan Mulqueen (Richard Gere). Which he's serving his time in the USA. Now FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston (Oscar-Winner:Sidney Poitier) and an Russian Agent Major Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora) needs Delcan helps, since he could identify him. Which they need his help before he's successful hitting his next target.Directed by Michael Caton-Jones (Basic Instinct 2, City by the Sea, Rob Roy) made an watchable global trotting film that is well made and well acted by the cast. Gere is effective in the lead but he has problems with his accent at times. Verona is also very good in the movie. Perphas the problem of "The Jackal", it gets to be a bit silly at times. Especially when we follow "The Jackal" and his disguises gets to be a bit much at times. But Willis does an fairly good job as the villain. This picture was a box office disappointment in theaters but it's the kind of movie that does well on DVD or TV. The locations are good in the film. There's some familiar faces in supporting roles or bit parts, probably the highlight is Jack Black in an infamous death sequence. The movie lacks credibility but it's pleasant enough as a thriller. It's worth a look. Screenplay by Chuck Pfarrer (Darkman, Hard Target, Red Planet). Based on a earlier screenplay by Kenneth Ross (Black Sunday, The Fourth War, The Odessa File). "The Jackal" is loosely based on the novel titled "The Day of the Jackal" by Frederick Forsyth (The Dogs of War, The Fourth Protocal). Panavision. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of the action movies but there are a few that I really enjoy watching, and this is now one of them. The story revolves around a mysterious assassin and the people who are trying to stop him from reaching his next target. To do this, they enlist the help of Declan Mulqueen, an ex-IRA member. Richard Gere was ill-cast in the role of Mulqueen. The accent is generally off or very poor and the acting seems forced and unbelievable. However, Bruce Willis was brilliant as the "Jackal", mutating into each identity seamlessly while always remaining mysterious.7/10 A good, entertaining flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess that, once you've seen the original, and liked it, it's hard to stomach a remake, especially when the remake is American fluff.However, I have not seen the original, Day of the Jackal. Afterhaving read the reviews here, I'll plan to see it.In the meantime, having not yet seen the original, I gotta tell ya, I had fun with this one.Sure, things are quite contrived. Any thinking person willspend too much time asking "why" to a lot of things that happen.But, the long wait to find out just how cold and ruthless this Jackal could be was well worth it. He was certainly cold, wasn't he?The acting was good all around. Willis was certainly acting up a storm to act like a character who pretends to be gay to make contact with a stooge.Who doesn't love what Sidney Poitier brings to the screen?Gere? Well, I thought that he was refreshingly not polished and sophisticated, and he did maintain consistency in his accent through the film, hats off to him for that. Was it a "bad" accent? Well, that depends? Do ALL Irish people speak withexactly the same accent? Are there no regional dialects? Sure there are, and with that escape, he might have been playing anorth Irish person (giving it a slight Scottish lilt, perhaps).It had its faults, but if you don't take yourself too seriously, it's fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We don't need to make fun of Hollywood and its movies... they both do that just fine by themselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose this one is just easier to enjoy if you know nothing about the original version, and/or the novel from whence that film came. I say "that", and not "these", because beyond the title(which, it should be noted, Fred Zimmerman, R.I.P., the director of the 1973 version, fought to change on this one), the movies have fairly little in common(I wouldn't know about the book, I haven't read it). Instead of relying on the tastes of the audience, and the memorable writing, this Hollywoodizes the entire thing; it gets "personal", the lead characters are more clear(in stark contrast to the "presenting" nature of the original, Day of the Jackal, more like a documentary than something for/on the silver screen), subtlety tends to go out the window, and of course everything is "bigger". Several scenes are remade from "Day", with some exaggeration and such, to the point where it, at times, resembles parody, presumably not intentionally so... and I am not the first to point this out. This is more action-oriented than "Day", which is not to say it's *entirely* devoid of interesting elements(there are just few of them which aren't found in "Day", and more well-done, there). Music and script is about what you'd expect, and hey, there are worse of this kind out there. Acting varies, this gets its share of attempts at accents and lesser performers. Direction, well, it's not particularly bad, but do note that the guy went on to do the second Basic Instinct, which I've not seen, but from what I hear, it's clearly just a recent sequel of the sort that not so much "just doesn't live up to the first" as "destroys some of what the first carefully and skillfully built up and/or developed", which, even just planting himself in the director's chair for would indicate that he does not get that fact, that he does not care, or that he simply needed money *that* bad, and none of the options are conducive to commanding respect as a serious and intelligent director. Not necessarily awful, suffers from the unavoidable comparison to a far superior piece of cinema, which it could have easily steered clear of by merely eliminating the similar situations and, you know, calling it something else. I recommend this to fans of action as done by Hollywood, and only the fans of Day of the Jackal, book or celluloid, who want a send-up of the material. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the criticism regarding this movie is, for the most part, entirely unwarranted. This is an excellent film, hands down, with an amazing cast. People will always whine about how poor the accents in movies are, but it's all about suspension of disbelief. If you want to see realistic movies, well, you're going at it the wrong way by going to see an action-thriller.This is hands down the best action-thriller movie I've seen since The Rock. Willis plays the Jackal excellently and the script is amazing. Despite what some people say about this being "a poor remake", they are mistaken; this is NOT a remake. This is an entirely different film, which anyone who has half of a brain would realize. The two movies may be based upon the same novel, but both of them are fundamentally different. Don't discount this one -- give it a try. It has been my favorite movie since '97 when I saw it in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Original film had an intelligent story line, and suspense, with brilliant acting. Only decent actors in this were Richard Gere and Sidney, even though Gere's character seemed to be propaganda for a terrorist organisation. Remember how president Bush said if any person in any country has anything to do with terrorism in any form, and that country doesn't act against those people, then the whole country is against the USA? That part of the film shows how hypocritical the USA was before 9/11.Apart from that, Bruce ran around shooting like one of his mindless action characters in other films. I actually got bored half way through and turned over for a while because it seemed to lose all form of storyline, until deciding to give it another chance to watch the rest. Reenactment of the original film scene where he was pretending to be gay to hide out at another gay man's house became a little better, but it didn't improve much.Then I read a review on here about how another person approached it as a parody, which made it actually funny and I could see their point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier) is working with Major Valentina Koslova of the Russian MVD to take on the Russian mob. In a raid, they kill the brother of mob boss Terek Murad (David Hayman). He hires the Jackal (Bruce Willis) to assassinate a target in revenge for $70 Million. The joint task force is desperate to identify the mysterious Jackal. Basque separatist Isabella Zanconia (Mathilda May) may have seen the Jackal and they use former IRA shooter Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) to help track her down. When they tell him the target is FBI Director Donald Brown, he tells them that he actually met the Jackal.Everything about this movie screams 70s. The pacing is slow like a 70s movie. There are unnecessary side trips. It's a terrorist plot ripped out of a 70s novel. The premise itself is ridiculous. For that amount of money, the Russian mob could hire dozens of killers. Like almost everything in this movie, it feels a little old and outdated. Director Michael Caton-Jones tries his best but this just doesn't have a chance. It's interesting to see Bruce Willis play the calculating assassin but there isn't much else that interest me in this movie.</fullReview>

In the remake, the combined efforts of the American FBI and Soviet military are no match for the Jackal.For some reason, the Jackal in the remake uses a weapon that he has to move around in a minivan, while Edward Fox used a small sniper gun in the original that could be broken down into innocuous looking tubes which were then hidden in crutches! I think we can figure out who the more believable professional assassin is.There's also the inexplicable addition in the remake of both an Irish terrorist (Richard Gere) and his former girlfriend who happens to be a Basque separatist!?!?Nobody is particularly convincing in this film, though I'll give it one more point for the presence of Sidney Poitier.

For example, this contingency of the FBI (which is frantic to protect its own #1 G-man from the assassin) doesn't even use telephones to warn/help each other, much less cell phones or secret/hidden mikes or short-wave/radio contact. And gee, I really believe it when they not only allow a former IRA terrorist to join their international team, he's welcome to sit in on THE highest level "intelligence" meetings.Still, I have to admit, was compelled to watch the whole thing to see who would win and how.</fullReview>

The disguises and hair colour changes were highly amusing and some of the moustaches looked like they were going to drop off any minute.But the thing that did it for me was how it was done.......in the original the Jackal is a highly skilled marksman....that may be true in this film but he just uses his portion of the fee that was paid up front to buy a high tech weapon which he can operate remotely. Where's the skill in that!!!!The only decent scene in the film was the subway scene at the end with the trains but even this was poorly done by 1997 standards!!!I gave it 6 out of 10 but that's only because I liked the original story and the basic idea. If this had been an original film I would have given it 2.Please note that I've not mentioned Richard Gere until now...this is because I feel he doesn't really deserve a mention based on his performance in this film.

I wanted to see it again, as what i had seen before falling asleep had been visually stunning and entertaining. So i dragged a mate in with me the next day to check it out, i watched it in depth and i loved it. I don't know why i did, it had been bashed by critics and plagued with bad reviews, but its whole atmosphere was inviting to me.The movie has a very messy, and loosely written plot, but i think it got bad reviews because it was expected to follow in the shadows of the earlier 1973 film adaption of frederick forsyth's 'the day of the jackal', which should not be expected as this film only borrows the main aspects of that similar plot. Despite the poorly written plot, this film has some great features with a GREAT soundtrack and score that fit the film beautifully. Bruce Willis is thrilling as the deadly, cunning and sly 'Jackal', and throughout the film made me wonder who he was going to shoot next as he punished his victims with his rouse style of killing that only Willis himself could of portrayed so well. Richard Gere and Sidney Poitier are also brilliant, as they reluctantly join forces to capture the unknown assassin.The movie follows a deadly assassins quest to take out the director of the FBI after being hired by an angry Russian mafia head, and those involved in tracking him down to stop him. The film has a very modern feel to it, with a cold war twist, and a european / North American backdrop. The plot lacks but the film is very entertaining, and worth a look. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

If you enjoy the formula, you would like the movie, otherwise you will not find it satisfying. Its really very simple.Bruce Willis is the highlight; he is perfect as the stiff, cold-blooded killer, whose methods are, if nothing else, extremely elaborate and interesting. Some complain they are too elaborate, but I personally think its intriguing to see him change identities making himself impossible to trace. My main complaints lie with the police characters. These characters are pretty standard and awfully boring. The ending is the worse...very atrocious and standard "climax". There's no doubt that this poorly written screenplay probably ruined what could have been a top notch action movie. However, as it stands, if you enjoy action movies you'll probably find something to like about this one. Final Rating: 5/10 A decent but flawed action genre film.Noob Aalox</fullReview>

One gets so tired of invincible, brilliant criminals who do stupid things so that they can be caught. Naturally most of the law enforcement types are played as hopeless, inept dopes who have to hire a jailed IRA assassin (Richard Gere, whose subdued, understated performance stands out in these surroundings) to help them track the down the Jackal, an anonymous international assassin (Bruce Willis--is he a bad actor or a good actor who attracts stupid roles?) who apparently intends to kill the FBI director. The final scene is implausible even by Hollywood standards (How did she know where he was?) The weakness of assassination movies based on real life (say, the original Jackal and Nine Hours to Rama) is that one already knows what is going to happen at the end but even then, those movies manage to maintain a certain tension. In the Jackal remake, we aren't quite sure of what will transpire (except that the Jackal will probably fail) but most of us won't care because the movie is so sluggish, convoluted, and stupid at the top of its voice.</fullReview>

The choice of weapon is well, plain ridiculous, are we seriously expected to believe that the world's most feared and experienced hit man/terrorist would select that for an assasination?The whole point of the original story was the tense dual of intellects between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who crafts a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his target and then get away. None of that survived. All we have is the tired old American CIA/FBI/army vs the evil terrorist plot, we've all seen 1000 times before.But of course the movie company's MBA's realised that a new intellectual angle here would lose them revenue from the short attention span gang, so the answer is ......Bruce Willis, BIG explosions and a crippled plot. They assume the American audience wont be able to relate to a threat to a foreign statesperson (where is France on the map afterall) so it has be an American!Another example of a movie defiled by the boardroom.</fullReview>

The story revolves around a perfect killer who can change his appearance and attire to avoid being caught. The fact that only a handful of people know what he looks like only enhances the persona.This killer is played by Bruce Willis and although sometimes he's "over-acting" he delivers a good job. He has been hired by a Russian "gangster" to kill someone important in the US. This information becomes known to the FBI, who hire the only living man, who has seen the face of the Jackal. Unfortunately, he is serving two life sentences for some involvement with the IRA concerning weapons. This Irish fellow is played by Richard Gere.What follows is a cat and mouse hunt between Gere/FBI and Willis. Both sides of the story are shown; the investigation by the FBI and the preparations for the assassination by Willis. I found this segment the most enjoyable part of the entire movie. Towards the end Gere/FBI seem to know every move of Willis and somehow prevent the assassination by taking out the gun one second before Willis presses "fire".This movie could have been good, but it fails to deliver and it has an ending which is too predictable.Avoid seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is the reason I cared about this movie. After watching it through to the end, I have to say that you'll want to watch it for reasons other than Willis. Though he does a good job of working from the script, I think, and though there is an interesting twist to the genre, the movie ultimately falls victim to that cloud of misery that surrounds any movie which makes grandiose promises and fails to fulfill them.The story here is rather simple at first glance. Yet the twists keep it interesting. The FBI is visiting Russia, and they happen to kill the brother of an important official there. The official is enraged and, in a scene that seems like it must have been torn from about every corny villain scene from every movie ever made, kills his best henchman and hires an assassin to get revenge for his brother's death.Most important is that Bruce Willis plays a villain here. He's the assassin. Yet his first few lines, the ones that make that all-important first impression, make him out to be rather simple, and calm. That persona stays with him throughout. The problem, then, is that you have a hard time taking him seriously, until you've watched a good two thirds of the movie. Only after he is in several scenes meant to establish his more vile side do you even begin to hope that he'll not survive to the end of the movie. And even then, you might be rooting for him. He really pales in comparison to other movie villains.The movie's other important element is Richard Gere, who has suddenly adopted an Irish accent. He's going to try and stop Willis' character. After seeing him speak normally in so many movies, I had a hard time accepting him as an Irish criminal. I felt like maybe he would take Willis out on a date and turn him away from a life of crime (sarcasm, but you get my point. I hope).About the only thing I would call a strength in this film is that you see both sides of the coin. That is to say that you'll see a lot of it from Willis' perspective, and a lot of it from Gere's perspective. It's nice to see how the two are reacting to each other. If it weren't for some truly corny lines (that none of the movie's actors could help), this would really work well.In the end, the movie loses points because of the simple fact that there are only about two scenes that are truly thrilling. This is an action/thriller kind of movie. That's another of its more obvious draws. And it fails to deliver that promised action, for the most part.What you have, then, is a movie that makes numerous promises but does only a mediocre job of fulfilling any of them. Worth a rental, certainly. I hadn't previously seen a movie in the genre that did such a good job of showing both sides of the coin. But you'll want to think twice before taking this one home to own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loosely based on the classic `The Day of The Jackal' the plot revolves around cold war politics and the attempt to assassinate a leading government official. If you like your guns big then The Jackal does not disappoint, but if you like your films to have someone you can identify with then The Jackal is sadly lacking. Willis usually excels as the likable all-American hero, this time he is asked to be the ruthless assassin. The Jackal has many aliases, much like Val Kilmer in the Saint they all look like Willis with a wig and fake moustache, but he just about gets away with it. By his pursuers, he is described as `cold' in the movie, and throughout the mysterious `Jackal' is just that as he despatches various people that stand in his path. He is an assassin, he is allowed to be cold, Willis portrays him as such adequately, but we don't like him so who do we identify with?The Russian MIV agent is strong and unyielding, but her part is relatively minor and I am afraid to say that this film was calling out for a strong male hero. You would think that was the purpose of casting Richard Gere as his foil ? they have a past, and Gere can offer the FBI information on how the Jackal operates - but he is a convicted IRA terrorist (with one dodgy accent!) who wants freedom in return for his services, can we really identify with him and hope he succeeds? So what about the FBI Agent played by Poitier? Honourable and charming yes, he also does not take a central role and his principles are willingly compromised in the end.The Jackal gives us little opportunity to involve ourselves with the characters, it does not encourage us to care, but even more importantly the plot is contrived with developments just happening as a matter of course. The Jackal moves to a new destination or assumes a new identity, and the FBI just know it as if he is sending them post cards. The Jackal equally seems to be able to find out anything he wants at the drop of a hat. Little or no explanation is offered, the film-makers seems to concerned in making sure that Willis and Gere WILL meet in a show-down no matter what and this is obvious from the start.Predictable, uninvolving and contrived. Laughable really, more a hyena of a film than a jackal.3 out of 10 (to be generous)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Bruce Willis' disguises were laughable and nearly as transparent as his performance.However...to top it off, this film has what must be the most gurgly death scene ever filmed. The scene goes on and on...and the character gurgles and bubbles and gurgles some more. Classic. It had the opening weekend crowd laughing right along with the poor gurgly terrorist.I applaud the director for injecting such a surprising dose of humor into a scene others would have filmed much more dramatically, completely ignoring the comic possibilities.Kudos to that!Andy.</fullReview>

I haven't even seen 'The Day of Jackal' but I assume it's good or else why would anyone bother to remake it. The thing is this film is so full of holes you could catapult an elephant through it. Why would the FBI allow a convicted terrorist to wander around doing his own thing and telling them how to catch an assassin. It's patently ridiculous. The FBI have years of experience tracking down criminals, but instead of using their tried and tested methods to catch the Jackal they employ Richard Gere and his dodgy Irish accent. Please give me a break and stop it with the happy endings. Not all people are emotional retards who need to walk away from a film glad that the good guys had won.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big disappointment. Where are all the great movies for the end of this year? It's yet another thriller we've all seen before, glum, not very bright. The hit man (played coldly by Bruce Willis) is charging $70 million to assassinate the head of the FBI. You know, half now, half later, payable on completion. Willis is great as the hero but wasted as the silent deadly type. The film simply does not work on a script level. Direction is fine, acting also good but without a decent script, it's just an exercise in celluloid. 1.5 stars out of five. - John Kimble</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost paid to see this movie when it first came out. I decided to wait five months for the video instead. It turned out to be one of the wisest decisions I've made.This movie is by no means a masterpiece, but it's not a total piece of crud either. There's a lot to admire about it - the locations come to mind. From as far away as Moscow, Helsinki, and London, to stateside locales like D.C., Chicago, and even up north in Quebec, the movie takes you places. The performances are okay at best: Willis doesn't have much depth; he kills without hesitation and changes looks like a chameleon. Gere, gives a decent performance, despite an almost irritating accent. It was good to see Sidney Poitier onscreen; it would've been even better to see him do more (it was tight when he swooped down and saved the lady's life, I must admit). Diane Venora, who I admire despite an over-the-top turn as Lady Capulet in "Romeo &amp; Juliet", gave probably the best performance as a hardened KGB officer.The movie's other saving grace is the soundtrack, a great mix of industrial and electronic music from acts like Fatboy Slim, Massive Attack, Goldie, Primal Scream, and LTJ Bukem.I'd advise seeing Zimmerman's original 1973 "The Day of the Jackal" if you want an action thriller with depth and freshness. If you want a typical Hollywood escapism piece, try this one.BTW, did any other D.C. area viewers notice the first part of the subway scene took place in a false Metro station? None of the stations in the area have "METRO" in big, black letters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a mess this film is. Not only is the original premise and film better than the remake, absolutely no improvements whatsoever where made and certainly no evidence to show that any effort was made to even attempt it.A brief (and pointless if you've seen the original) summary is that the Jackal is hired make a high-profile assassination for $70 million, a sum so unbelievably huge it really makes you wonder if his hirer - is really aware of the market rates of this sort of thing. Apparently not. Surely for that sort of cash one could purchase a small nuclear bomb and do the job yourself. But that's just the start.The film is completely preposterous and shabbily made with so many obviously stupid oversights it makes it look as if it had been assembled by a five year old. We're told that the Jackal is cold, methodical and works in a world where mistakes are not made, but I'd be suprised if he'd last even five minutes. For example, the Jackal goes to huge expense to furnish himself with a remote-controlled gun complete with vision camera so that he doesn't need to be anywhere near it to fire it, and yet sits (at most) a couple of hundred feet away when he operates it in the assassination attempt. Why wasn't he miles away? Another example - after testing this fearsome weapon, he shoots the contractor who he hired to build the mounting for it and blows up his car, leaving a body, a burned-out shell and tyre tracks from his own vehicle as evidence nearby. He bleaches his hair (making him a whole lot more distinctive in a crowd) and fails to recolour it after being recognised, despite making a number of complete disguise changes earlier. He goes to great efforts to make sure he can rapidly change the colour of his minivan at a moment's notice to evade detection and then in a public car park, sprays a doorhandle with quick-acting poison, so that when a baddie touches it they are sure to die within close proximity to his vehicle. Even in a car park, people will stop if someone's is lying in the path of their vehicle. And near the end he just can't resist the opportunity to release a hostage and spend an unnecessarily long time in an attempt to kill the good guy. If he's that cold-blooded, how about shooting the good guy and then the hostage?At no point was this film believable, and at no point did I ever think that $70 million was good value for a man so clearly incompetent at his job. Save youself some cash too and don't bother seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking for the Assassin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day of the Jackal" (1973) was a solid suspense thriller, cleverly scripted by Kenneth Ross from Frederick Forsyth's intriguing best-seller. Universal's modernization takes liberties with the original's premise and goes for broke. We begin by upping the violent action, and teaming Bruce Willis with Richard Gere; as it turns out, this counts for a lot. Adding Sidney Poitier doesn't hurt, either. The film features polished production values, and is capably corralled by director Michael Caton-Jones. While satisfying viewing, "The Jackal" is not quite believable, and all too mechanical.As the film's official synopsis outlines, "A ruthless assassin (Willis) has been hired to eliminate someone at the very top of the U.S. government. Constantly changing his identity and location, he is known only as the 'Jackal'. Everything about this hit man, including his sinister timetable, is a secret."Aware of the Jackal's presence, but uncertain of his purpose, the FBI's Deputy Director (Poitier) faces the biggest challenge of his career. In order to track down this cold-blooded killer, he and a by-the-book Russian intelligence officer (Diane Venora) enlist the aid of an imprisoned Irish terrorist (Gere). These unlikely allies enter a global race against the clock to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his deadly assignment." The climax is okay, but the film's most memorable - and blood-splattering - sequence is definitely Mr. Willis' testing of his assassination equipment, with an annoyingly over-talkative Jack Black (as Ian Lamont) proving to be a sweet target. Although he's not the best role-model around, it's interesting to note that Willis' character is most likely homosexual; it would have been very easy for filmmakers to give him a feminine interest, but they don't. As the film's leading lady is Ms. Venora unconventional, and we develop a romantic interest in her gradually, as does Mr. Gere.****** The Jackal (11/14/97) Michael Caton-Jones ~ Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier, Diane Venora</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jackal - Take 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Day Of The Jackal' is given a modern remake. Oh-dear.Bruce Willis (of all people) plays the titular villain. And to be fair, he does a pretty good job of being a baddie. But then when you saw what kind of a resourceful and homicidal character his 'cop' invariably played, there isn't that much of a personality transition.Fast-fading Sidney Poitier plays some sort of FBI/CIA big-noise, and I don't like to be unkind, but his features seem to have all but ossified since Mr Tibbs woo'd the cinema-goer.Richard Gere - of all people - attempts an Irish something-or-other, with a something-or-other accent.Those are the three main players in a plot that has been ruthlessly chain-sawed out of the charming, mostly French, locations of the original inspiration, and dumped without ceremony in good 'ol US of A, where Hollywood can do its worst. The quiet subtlety of Zinnerman's thoughtful former work has been transmogrified into a typical modern Hollwood 'thriller'. It's so in yer face you can smell its halitosis.Being in the only place that matters to Tinsel-Town, the assassin is going after a comparable victim. It's not some piddling French President with a big nose now, but the 'First Lady', no less. That's the American President's wife, to us foreign oiks.It's got the lot. Special effects, pyrotechnics, swoopy camera angles, close-ups, pans, the works. Helicopters whizzing amongst glitzy tower-blocks? you bet. A thumping soundtrack to beat yer eardrums limp? Get ready! There's a lot of stuff nicked from the original movie. A special gun, an unfortunate homosexual, a spy in the security cabal, cat and house chases. Whereas the original jackal was content with an almost comical little circus-prop of a rifle to kill a French President; to kill an American President's wife requires no less than a perishing computer-operated remote-controlled assault-cannon mounted inside a people-carrier. It's about the same size as the one used by 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot' to access a payroll safe! Over-the-top hardly describes it.It's definitely the Jackal with brass knobs on. The trouble is; you can hardly see the plot for the brass-knobs.Nothing to commend it above any of the other wham-bam-thank-you-Uncle-Sam fodder that we see on a regular basis. They did a similar make-over to that jolly little '60's romp 'The Italian Job'. Likewise the essentially English 'Get Carter'. And they all come out looking the same. In a way, it's like Stalin rewriting history. But there's a generation arisen now who have probably never seen the originals and simply don't know. Watch and forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this film sucked! There was not one moment in this film I could take with any sense of realism. For example, the Jackal played by Bruce Willis is hired by some Russian mob boss to kill the first lady (though they never say that but you know it is) for the very cheap fee of 70,000,000. Hmmm maybe he is being over charged. In any case the Jackal goes way out of his way to have some massive machine gun built that could take down a jumbo jet just so he can kill this woman. I would think just a simple high powered rifle or even a .38 revolver would have done the trick but oh well...this guy means business. Richard Gere plays some Irishman who used to belong to the IRA and claims to be the only man who knows what the Jackal looks like. Richard Gere was mis-cast in this film and does an awful job pulling off the accent of some Irishman. Sidney Poiter must have been hurting for money to be in this nonsense.The Jackal does other things to try and kill this lady that either make him a professional or a great overachiever. No more reviewing this film...watch it for yourself and if you like it I feel sorry for you...***ZERO STARS***</fullReview>

It might not be a brilliant action movie,but it is definitely a movie which you could rent again and get entertained,period. Bruce Willis and Richard Gere give out their best and this very fact helps in not diverting the audience anytime away from the plot. Jackal is a perfect complement to a box of popcorn,so grab some and watch it on blue ray or VHS,it gives a taste of the good old days where people shop for Gatling guns online,chatting with a female recorded voice and get their delivery made.he he,Did it just get better or worse? as Bruce Willis would say!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you have a gunfight in a crowded subway in which no police arrive for ten minutes? lolBut the funniest scene in the movie was when the Russian agent is lying on the couch bleeding to death, paramedics all around, and we get to listen to long speeches while she literally exsanguinates. None of the paramedics starts an IV line, intubates her, raises her legs, applies a pressure suit or does anything whatsoever except gaze in wonder as she gasps out her lines for a few minutes and finally expires.Of course that is all in good fun, and the movie doesn't seem to take itself THAT seriously which is a good thing. Here the FBI is letting a world class terrorist walk around at a military base, in top level FBI meetings, and treated as just one of the gang by most of the agents.Hard not to enjoy the acting, the settings, the gimmickry and the fanciful plot, in spite of its shortcomings. Good entertainment value if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right lead... wrong 'Gere' to fit co-star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a different role for the man Mr. Willis. Forget the happy and wit filled, smirking good-guys of the past films that Bruce has effectively been, this man is a burning yet, dark presence. I liked the bitter pill that had intrigue written all through this picture. There are many I think that have very mixed feelings about this Willis gem. I could agree with some and disagree with still others for various reasons, but I felt that in the darkness was an effective reprieve of the good-guy characters that Bruce has been. So many other actors/actresses, when crossing over from regular 'good' roles seemed to be not fully transferred into character as the 'antag'. Here is Willis as an almost silent killer that has no charm or swift dialog as quite a few of his past roles of the like have been for him, the success brought to him by that m.o. this one is simply a non-emotional 'black hole' of a man looking for revenge for something or someone that has happened to his life. A hole that he himself cannot even fill, so he continues to destroy, trying to reach a place that he will never make it to. Strange but true. Bruce Willis is the top! My biggest problem with this film that is equipped with a brilliant cast, has one main flaw...that being Richard Gere. Don't take me wrong here, which most will, there has been many roles that Gere has done that was right on the money from, 'An Officer and a gentleman'(1982) 'No mercy'(1986) Pretty Woman (1990) right on through "The Mothman Prophecies" (2002) Chicago (2002) Primal Fear, Red Corner, Final Analysis, First Knight, etc. To me he is not fit for this role or especially the accent itself, for me as I watched, he never quite pulled off all the way. He looks Italian for one thing and all the regular 'eye-blinking' blowing air out his nostrils-that is a trade mark of his, that he has done in some many other roles. It just didn't feel as though he owned it outright. The haircut I have to say, for Willis' character was a genuine real convincing look for him, being a cold-blooded hit-man, it was Stauglin-is-tic.Sydney Pointier was a soundly placed character, he played that man to perfection.Without Gere in that place, it could have been a ten but for me it rests at 7/10. Recommended anyway. (**) ~ Thx IMDb.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS:This is the type of movie that has a lot of the type of elements that I don't like in a movie. Long drawn out chases, lots of tension producing moments that go on(and on and on), and the kicker, the one who gets killed who isn't really dead. It's all in here and that's why this movie isn't exactly my thing.I will say the cast does a good job. Willis is so evil, it's pretty chilling. But the movie seems to go on forever and the violence and endless chase scenes does nothing for me and neither does the plot in general. There is a mix of many other movies in this one.The action sequences are pretty well done so if one likes action sequences they may appreciate those. But I didn't find much here that was really enjoyable. Although some might think that the movie's ability to be tension producing is a good thing, I felt it was almost to much so if that makes sense. The Jackal isn't unique with having that quality to it but it isn't the kind of movie where I'd think "wow" at the end. rather at the end I was just glad it was over. I've seen a lot of movies and wouldn't call this one of the worst or dreadful or anything like that. But I have no desire to see it again. I'd rate it around a 5.</fullReview>

Such is the case of The Jackal, a cinematic pile of what can be euphemistically called "doo," a twisted, blood-soaked retelling of Fred Zinnemann's superb The Day of the Jackal.I never thought of the gerund "remake" (a word that can be used as a noun and a verb) as a curse word, but in this case, remake deserves a mouthful of hand-soap.The Jackal is such an egoistically overblown mess that it defies description and begs (that's me begging you) to be ignored. Please avoid this trash and stick with what Hollywood views as a curse-word . . .the "Original." Pass the Palmolive!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a damn remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish that people would quit trying to compare this film to The Day of the Jackal. There is nothing to compare. This is an original that just happens to have a similar name. Yes, the story is similar, but so is the Clint Eastwood/John Malkovich story In the Line of Fire.This movie was campy fun with some favorite and excellent actors. Any chance to see Sidney Poitier is great, even if he really didn't have a meaty role.Bruce Willis as the bad guy was also good. Sure his disguises sucked, but it was fun watching him, especially shooting up Jack Black in his best role. Jack Black getting shot was a hoot as he has done nothing of note to top this.Ricrad Gere was great to watch. I only had one complaint. I thought that he should have had more of a chance to dance with Mathilda May. I mean, when they let Eddie Murphy out of jail to catch a murderer in 48 Hours, all he wanted was some trim. If Gere loved May as much as they made out, I think they could have worked this in the movie. I guess I'll have to wait until Naked Tango comes out on DVD to see more of her.All in all, it was a great action/suspense flick. It was not a remake; it was just good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Acting &amp; Special Effects, Mediocre Plot, Many Loopholes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think "The Jackal" contained some pretty darned good acting for a fairly mediocre cookie-cutter-plot "thriller." Sidney Poitier put in a thoroughly believable role as the FBI field officer in charge of stopping the Jackal in the plot to kill a high government official. Diane Venora was very good as a fierce Russian national police major (who happens to be female) working with Interpol. Bruce Willis brought off his super-villain role quite well, but he hardly fit my mental image of The Jackal, so I never totally believed in him. The best actor in the film was Richard Gere, I think; his Irish accent sounded quite authentic to me! Even Jack Black, as the despicable small-time hood gun-carriage maker, makes you really disgusted with him, which takes great acting ability. I really do get nauseous over gratuitous, intense violence, but I was happy to see "Ian Lamont" buy it so thoroughly in the test of the electric cannon.As a matter of fact, you might say that high-cyclic-rate remotely-controlled automatic rifle, firing huge-caliber depleted-uranium rounds so fast that 100 could exit the muzzle before the first one hit the target, was the true star of the film. I thought so! Yeah, SPALL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the worst casting I have ever seen.Richard Gere was totally wrong for the role of the Irishman. Why get Richard Gere to do a bad Irish accent when there are plenty of good actors who could both look and sound more convincing as an IRA terrorist? It just doesn't make sense.Bruce Willis didn't seem threatening or scary in his role as the cold blooded assassin at all. He phoned this performance in.Sidney Poitier, while undeniably a legend was totally out of place in this movie. His acting style is a little too old fashioned (almost stagy) for the modern feel of this remake. He would probably have fared better in the original "Day of the Jackal." All in all, this movie seemed empty, boring and contrived due, in large part, to the totally inappropriate casting. I didn't feel like the actors were connected at all, either to the script or to each other. What a waste of time and a waste of actors who can do (and have done) much better work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and insulting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm normally a fan of Bruce Willis, and despite him playing the cold-hearted professional killer, I thought him the most appealing character here. That said, his character makes such a mess of his professional activity, it's incredible he hasn't been caught before. The plot is thin to the point of being nonsensical. The end was no less annoying and insulting for the fact that it could have been predicted from about 20 minutes into the movie.** spoilers follow ** In Hollywood morality, the good guys always win, with a few casualties along the way, and the bad guys die, or are at least heading for justice by the end. The breathtaking insult of the film is the way that our IRA terrorist, who has somehow become a cuddly, touchy-feely character, gets to walk off to a new life. As does his former terrorist playmate (who is now a loving wife and mother).Who's the bigger villain? The former (and, so far as we can tell, unrepentant) terrorist, or the hired assassin? I don't see much to choose between them --- in real life, or in the film.This is the poorest film I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an awful waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So lets say you are a producer, you have some money, and you somehow got Richard gear and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a script...but , why bother? see, this movie is really terrible, the acting is pretty good, but the casting is awful gear and Willis did their best to play these characters they simply cant play. now, this movie has no plot, or rather, there's something that tries to pass off as a plot: there's a mean hit-man (Willis) who is cool dangerous and sophisticated (actually he's none of those things, but from some dialog between the other characters, you are supposed to get this impression), so this hit-man is on a mission to kill someone, now there's an ex-IRA prisoner who is kind and nice and very likable (gear) who the FBI release from prison so he will help them. so now the FBI is "investigating" to find this hit-man, the investigation consists of a series of unlikely information - like some random person lost his wallet and someone used his name to buy a car - which is always right on the money. since there's no real plot and the script is so crappy, you cant expect any real character development, or tension, so instead of creating them through the story, they simply add some disconnected dramatic music, which signals you that something very dramatic is going on , instead of actually creating something dramatic..the bottom line is that this is a very bad movie, and a complete waste of time which somehow got an incredibly high score for its level, probably because of the cast - and this is exactly what the producers where counting on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you've seen the original, DO NOT watch this one. Trust me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big mistake was calling this Jackal. One of the other people on this site commented that Fred Zinnemann fought to get them to not call this movie Day of the Jackal, not wanting his movie to be associated with this one. My question would be, why would the producers want to call the movie Day of the Jackal, inviting people to compare it with the vastly superior original. This movie has so little to do with the first that if the assassin weren't called Jackal no one would realize it was supposed to be the same movie. And perhaps if you can watch this without comparing it to the original it would be watchable. After all, it's kind of interesting to see Willis setting up his plan, at least.But the fact that they call it Jackal and then change virtually everything that made the original great just makes this movie difficult to watch. The original was utterly fascinating, letting a fascinating story play out. You were impressed with both Jackal and the investigators and riveted by how they proceeded. Willis's Jackal is a sloppy hitman who leaves evidence everywhere; there's no way he could possibly be this amazing, unstoppable, almost mythical figure. The idea of having the IRA guy in essence leading the investigation is pure hocum. If they'd called it something else, maybe I'd just think, kinda dumb, typical Hollywood picture. Maybe I would have watched it to the end. But about two thirds of the way through, as it began to get increasingly dumb I just couldn't take it anymore. The movie is just a travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White-knuckle action-thriller! *(spoiler alert!)*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>White-knuckle action thriller! Thoughtful screen-play! Bruce Willis did real good in the role of an ice-cold brutal international assassin 'The Jackal' who has been described as never actually seen by anybody. I think that is one of the weak points of the plot. During his missions, the Jackal interacts in person with several 'real' people who he does business with for example to get fake passports, to get guns, whatsoever. Therefore, he actually meets these 'real' people and whenever he feels they may cause trouble he just kills them. It is possible that these murders may leave a series of evidences that eventually can track him down. Another major weak point is his disguises; he was always very much recognizable in these disguises. He could have used rubber masks to change faces as Tom Cruise's character did in 'Mission Impossible', but the Jackal did not or could not use such things (there must be some reason why). The Jackal definitely seemed to become over-confident in this particular mission and got a bit too sloppy for a cunning assassin like him. For example, the mistake he makes with Major Koslova eventually kills him.Richard Gere as IRA terrorist taken out of prison to help catch the Jackal!!! No way! Over-weight over-aged Richard Gere looked really pathetic and ridiculous, with his same mannerism of frequently shifting eye-balls, all-the-time blinking eyes and chuckling (grunting?)through his nose from time to time. Doesn't he do these same three things in all the movies in all types of roles? I really wonder what makes him a big-budget Hollywood hero!!!Richard Gere got so much focus that he became the only one to carry the last scene all alone on his shoulder while the whole army waits somewhere else!A very dramatic suspense has been created every time the Jackal meets Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) eye to eye, a fantastic background tune.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

True, there's too much gore, and a few more plot holes than in an average thriller (can anybody explain to me what the FBI was doing in Moscow?), Richard Gere's accent wavers, and it's very contrived, but really, it was decent entertainment.

		<fullReview>The comment further down this page about 'The Jackal' being totally different to 'The Day of the Jackal' and not a remake, is incorrect. 'The Jackal' IS a remake of 'The Day of the Jackal'! Just look at the writing credits for this film on the main page. 'The Jackal' is a rewritten and updated version based on the screenplay of 'The Day of the Jackal' rather than an entirely new script based on the novel. All the plot elements are the same.Okay, onto the movie. 'The Jackal' is simply stupid! To be honest, I saw this version BEFORE I watched the remake. I'm not a huge fan of the original but I did enjoy it. When I watched 'The Jackal' though, I found it to be completely laughable and this wasn't based on prior knowledge on the original or the novel. The film on it's own was a joke. Bruce Willis was hardly convincing as this cold-blooded assassin known as The Jackal, and the plot became so absurd that I cringed when the target was revealed.Sidney Poitier does his best but seems worn down in this film. Richard Gere tries but fails as IRA hero, his accent was okay and hardly worse than overall plot and weak climax. Stuff comparisons to the original film, 'The Jackal' fails on it's own and is another one of Bruce Willis's failed ventures before he found better territory in 'The Siege' and then 'The Sixth Sense'. He is now picking better projects, but I cannot fathom why he chose to do this ill-fated rewritten script to begin with. If it was supposed to show his versatility in playing a character who disguised himself a lot, it was hardly convincing nor memorable. Jack Black's supporting performance is wasted and annoying, and all Bruce Willis does is attempt to show off his cool, calm collected self without hardly any conviction of the nature of his character. He seems very self-aware that he is a villain in a movie, and this probably partly due to the direction and script. All in all, never bank on remaking something and assuming it will make the new film worthy in it's own right. Those who haven't seen either 'The Day of the Jackal' or 'The Jackal', see the former first and then watch the remake.'The Jackal' gets a *1/2 out of *****!</fullReview>

No one without the aid of constant, and extremely expensive, plastic surgery could use the type of disguises you see in most films. This is real life and if someone is cold blooded dosen't that mean they kill without mercy?

		<shortDescription>An exciting 90's update of the spy/ assassin thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just read a review that mentioned that this film was not true to the story of the real "Jackal" Carlos Sanchez. First of all I would make a few things clear about this film. This film is an update of the 1972 book/ Film DAY OF THE JACKAL which in turn had NOTHING to do with Carlos the Jackal.Carlos was named "the Jackal" by the media after a copy of the Fredrick Forsythe's Day of the Jackal was found in an apartment which was using as a hideout. Carlos had NOTHING to do with the attempted assassination of President De Gaulle in the 60's on which the Forsythe novel was based. Carlos Sanchez was actually a clumsy overweight idiot and not a cold calculating assassin that was portrayed in the book and subsequent films.I just thought I would make it clear for anyone who was confused on whether or not this film was a factual account on Carlos Sanchez.Now back to the film! This update far outshines the 1972 Original and other films of this genre. It shows the painstaking process for a spy or assassin of remaining anonymous through various disguises (some in this film were quite excellent)and using different passports.This film also done away with the old telescopic rifle used constantly in other films of this genre and replaced it with futuristic gadgets such as Remote controlled guns and targeting systems.The film also shone the hollywood spotlight on a new breed of villain for which future films could exploit such as evil Russian crimelords.It was also excellent to see Willis cast as a bad guy. A role in which looks very covincing in. Richard Gere's performance was simply top rate although his accent at times seemed to be travelling from North to the South of Ireland. But despite this he delivers a striking performance as the likeable Irish Hero. Sidney Poitier also delivers as does the rest of the fine cast. The Film does slow down a little in parts as it normally does in most films of this genrebut overall the film has enough twists along with a believable ending to make this film very entertaining. So please ignore the other negative reviews of this film and see it for yourself. You certainly will not be disappointed. And watch out for the opening credits and music which more than adequately set the pace for this thriller.</fullReview>

He plays such a formidable assassin in this, you can't even imagine this is the same hero we all fell in love with in so many other movies. He plays a very convincing role. Whoever choose him did a very smart thing. Another excellent feature in this movie was the music and the intro to the movie, what a score it was. The intro is so exciting I ended up rewinding it several times just to see it over and over again! With these two qualities so high it is a wonder the film didn't turn out too good. Don't get me wrong, the first 30 minutes were bloody interesting and I was under the impression I was going to get a spectacular movie. But the film slowly looses its pace, it basically goes downhill and by the end I was severely disappointed. It's a wonder how such a high budget, well thought out film wasn't able to stick out. Oh well, it is worth a rental fee, but don't expect the package you can't help but expect from a movie with such a good cast and budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's even hard to imagine how shocked I was when I saw the average voting for this movie... It might grow, or decrease in the future, but by this date it's only a poor 5.8 score.I personally think The Jackal was one hell of a movie, and I'll do my best trying to explain why.Many people don't agree with me, but I think Bruce Willis was great, and he did look like a cold blood killer in some of his disguises. Richard Gere also did a good performance, along with Sidney Poitier.I think that this movie has a good script, and no matter how many negative comments it gets, it's still a great story, and these characters made it look almost real.The way Willis (The Jackal) passes all the airports and places where he needs to go using his fake identities it's very creative and interesting. The way he gets his gun, the way he gets rid of the people after him, the way he escapes from places and the way he planned the whole murder are just amazing scenes and it's truely worth watching, and it's not, under ANY circumstances, boring.I'll rate the movie with an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was quite intriguing. While not Bruce Willis' best film, and while I'm not fond of Richard Gere, I really enjoyed it. I have one word that makes this film worth it... LaMont. That guy was hilarious! And when the Jackyl offed him. Hey, it doesn't get any better than that. It had everything, cool weapons, neat characters and a twist here and there. If you like Bruce Willis and I do, then give this movie a shot, if for nothing else just see it for Bruce. This was one of the cooler characters that he's played.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is mildly entertaining if one neglects to acknowledge its numerous incongruities of plot and sheer lack of believability. Bruce Willis as "The Jackal" never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld. Instead, he bumbles about in broad daylight, parading a mishmash of shoddy disguises. Why this man has never been captured before (or even identified) is beyond me. Not once is the audience impressed by his cleverness or daring; considering the price he demands for his services (an exorbitant $70 million), his methods are decidedly low-budget and stupid.As for those in pursuit of him, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. They show no sense of expertise, instead relying on half-baked conjecture which sends them traversing across the country at their whim. Incredibly, these far-fetched guesses (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he's in Chicago, etc etc) invariably lead them straight to the Jackal, who yet again escapes their clumsy grasp.Richard Gere, whose Irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station, plays the inexplicable role of an imprisoned convict who is released from jail to work alongside the FBI. He actually makes a compatible partner, if only because his means are as amateurish and inept as his professional pals. At one point, he actually confronts the infamous Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, although they trust him enough to leave him out of their sight, fail to equip him with a weapon or any means of communication. What kind of operation are they running here?The film also appears overly reliant on gruesome violence, which is entirely superfluous and provides no suspense whatsoever. The supposedly stealthy Jackal acts more like a demented and senseless serial killer, eliminating people for sport and writing on a victim's cheek with blood.The film's action scenes are both predictable and unrealistic, and many moments are ruined with melodrama. This movie is poorly executed on many levels, the one bright spot being the ever consistent Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think as you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly better than that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with the first commentator. I thought it was a very taut and well-made film almost throughout. I certainly thought it was a far better film than The Saint with which the commentator compared this film. (For the record, I rented The Saint and The Jackal the same night. I couldn't watch more than a half hour of The Saint while the Jackal caught my attention and held it quite well.) I then watched The Day of the Jackal, the original film from which this was adapted, and I found it compared favorably as well.The beginning is somewhat slow, and the tired cliches--an evil boss doing in a subordinate simply to show that he rules with an iron hand, Russian Mafiosos, and tight-lipped Russian women--all are poor shorthand in setting up a story, but after the initial 10-15 minutes I was well enthralled. The locations and action were believable. I thought Willis did a fine job as a smooth and suave killer who has a code of conduct he follows closely, and the various elements of the Jackal's circumvention of obstacles were quite ingenious in many ways, further making me wonder why the screenwriter/s couldn't come up with a less-cliched setup.Compared to the little of The Saint that I could stomach, Willis' performance was far more engrossing and far less hokey than that of Kilmer. The Jackal's adoption of various identities were not nearly so corny as the ridiculous guises of the Saint, and the obligatory romantic sublot of The Jackal was far less gratuitous and forced than that of The Saint. And there were no close-ups of The Jackal in situations so obviously shot before a blue screen. Please. Even the original Saint movies were better technically than the modern version.Compared to The Day of the Jackal (TDotJ), the modern incarnation looked quite good to me as well. TDotJ was a fine example of the filmmaking of its day, and The Jackal is a fine example of modern filmmaking. The tension was not nearly so palpable in the original as it was in the newer movie. I was only truly tense once or twice during TDotJ, while I was quite literally on the edge of my seat many times during the newer movie. The addition of the Gere character added a much more human element to the newer movie than was present in the original as well. And it was indeed refreshing to see Poitier in this type of movie, as he lent an different air to the proceedings than the sort of character actor usually cast in such a role. I also was intrigued by the few scenes from the original which were repeated in the newer movie. Good choices all.The ending of the movie delivers well, and I was surprised by the way in which the outcome was delivered.All in all, I was very well entertained.Nate Birkholz Minneapolis, Minnesota USA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pale retread of 1973's DAY OF THE JACKAL, THE JACKAL features three more Americanized leads and considerably different character backstories, but almost none of the subtlety, freshness or charm of the original. Gere's braying horse attempt at an Irish brogue is particularly distressing. Poitier tries hard but basically has nothing to do. Willis is like Cher in concert, changing costumes and wigs every third minute, but to what effect and purpose? However, the biggest Jackal here is ultimately the script, which is not only fragmented and confusing, but finally frustrating and unconvincing.Others have pointed out inconsistencies in Willis' motivations, which are certainly there. A bigger problem, however, is that entire sections of the original intricately woven story have been jettisoned, including the important leak in the police organization which tips off The Jackal. The original version featured a wonderful explanation of how this is pulled off; one of the true highlights of the movie. The newer version completely abandons this clever angle in favor of simply exposing the leak in four seconds, and with none of the wit the original again provided. With few exceptions, everything in the original Jackal's character that was methodical and clever (particularly his ability to improvise on the fly) has been completely eliminated in favor of a fifth Bruce Willis disguise serving no purpose. The beauty of the original was that The Jackals' original plans had to be repeatedly altered (as were the police's tactics as he adapted). In this inferior remake, the self-reflection in character and adaptibility in modus operandi which were so strong in the first have been gutted.Why is this movie, based on such fantastic source material, such an absymal failure storywise? Director Caton-Jones provides the probable answer off-handedly in his commentary on the DVD, saying that the remake script was way too long from the start and they never really bothered to edit it down. The result was a two hour and forty five minute rough cut that had to be trimmed down to two hours. Those forty five minutes obviously ruined whatever chance this movie had to be coherent, though I have my doubts that a "director's cut" would be much better, given the rampantly poor editorial choices and sheer disregard for scripting found at nearly every turn. Track down DAY OF THE JACKAL (or almost anything by Zinneman) instead; this is one of the worst remakes of a great movie ever. 2.5 / 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**some spoilers** Unlike many others out there, I actually thought that "The Jackal" was a quite good movie. Not a classic, but good. I like Bruce Willis as "The Jackal", but I hate Richard Gere, and he is what ruins this movie for me. "The Jackal" is a villain, and as in 99,99% of all action-movies, the villain must die in the end. This movie could`ve been better if Bruce Willis`s character had killed Richard Gere`s character in the end, and then have mysteriously disappeared. Sadly, this is not how it happens in this movie. It seems like "The Jackal"(the character, not the movie) is sloppy just because Richard Gere`s character can stop him. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main reason I went to see The Jackal was Bruce Willis. I wanted to see him as a villian, and I thought he was OK. Unfortunately the rest of the film could've used some fine tuning in a lot of places. I really didn't buy Richard Gere as an Irishman either. Sydney Potier is good in just about anything, and he brought his usual intensity to a underwritten role. Willis' part is a little more interesting, he skulks around, making his plans and killing people. But he wasn't as crafty or as suave as the original Jackal. In the end, Gere and Willis are locked into a showdown and that very old movie cliche raises its ugly head once more.

		<fullReview>Picture this if you can. Somewhere in the LA area, a junior (I mean junior) studio exec stumbles into a local video store to get a copy of Bad Lieutenant. The resident video geek puts him on to Fred Zinneman's masterful ?The Day of the Jackal' instead and faster than Lemmy can sing ?No Class', a remake is in the works.Forget that the political climate in 1973 was far different than today, and that the essence of the tension in the original all emanated from that. Forget that ?The Day of the Jackal' is just too good a movie on its own to be embarrassed with any sort of remake. It's inappropriate, offensive.But we're smart guys, too smart to be easily diffused by anything that resembles judgement. Let's load up a bunch of high tech stuff to diffuse the scintillating psychological drama of the original. Let's throw in a couple of overpaid male leads (into what was essentially a character piece before) including one who the public would absolutely NEVER believe could handle a gun. Add Sidney Poitier for racial balance, Diane Venora for gender balance, and before you know it, you're on to the next.Do yourself a favor and see Fred Zinneman's ?The Day of the Jackal"--enjoy a fine film, and leave The Jackal to the Hollywood jokers.</fullReview>

I think the way Sidney Poitier carried himself as an FBI Deputy Director was good, he knew what to say and how to say it as well as how to make sure his track's were covered when it came to securing a witness.

		<fullReview>What a waste. And here's more evidence that if a screenplay sucks, there's not much a director, an editor, or even a star studded cast can do about it.Based loosely (and for no good reason) on The Day of the Jackal, this one borrows shamelessly from the other - and makes a complete sloppy botch of it. And without wanting to tar and feather anyone in particular, it's obvious from at least this point of view that it's mostly the screen writer's fault.There are those who might think the Bruce Willis character is perversely entertaining - I'm giving nothing away - but honestly: except for the ending, his character is doing the same thing, over and over again, and it's mostly just a camera panning him from afar, with him doing absolutely nothing except just sitting there. Yawn.Then take the Poitier and Gere characters and put them together - and what have you? One guess is as good as another, except for this: the story line makes absolutely no sense at all. We're not talking plot holes here: we're talking entire bridges of logic and common sense that have been bombed to smithereens.What does it take for a director who's working with some of the biggest actors of the day to motivate them to show enthusiasm, all the while suspicions grow this is going to be a horrible turkey? This simply doesn't work, and the actors must have felt this throughout the shooting. The best editor in the world can't make a true winner out of this mess.Was it better when they first read it? Were they paid huge amounts of money? It doesn't work.Worst has got to be the 'fabulous one liners' - which I hope have not made it into the 'memorable quotes' here. When we heard them, we knew they were coming from long off, and we yelped out in pain.If you've read the book on which the original film was based, you'll get it. And if you take our word for it, you'll rent something else.What a waste of money. What a shame you can only rate a movie down to one out of ten. That's not at all enough of a warning to unsuspecting others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most mis-cast movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I'd never say this but Bruce Willis was not right for the role. I felt like he was walking through his lines and didn't care. Richard Gere spent about thirty seconds working on his Irish accent. His portrayal of his Irish militant character was not believable. I'm still trying to figure out what his character was doing in the movie anyway. The film could have survived with-out a reformed Irish terrorist as the hero. The scene where he returns to his ex-girlfriend's home and they meet and hug (she marries and has a husband and kids) was ridiculous. If I were the husband and some guy (ex-lover/ boyfriend) comes over to my house to flirt with my wife I'd....wait a minute maybe that is a good thing! Sidney Poittier confirmed my belief that he is still America's over-rated actor. Through the entire movie it felt like he was trying to stay in the background avoiding any contact with the rest of the cast...maybe that is a good thing. Diane Venora had Gere's dialect coach. After all Irish and Russian are similar. I don't understand how that woman get's a gig ? She must be very friendly. I do have to admit she did pull off the Dyke cop role pretty well. I wonder how she prepared for the role?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw 'The day of the Jackal' on TV and then decided I'd have to see 'The Jackal' with Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sydney Pottier and J.K.Simmons, so I bought the DVD and really enjoyed it. 'The Jackal' is now rated one of my favourite films and this is because Bruce, Richard and Sydney are great as the three main characters. Bruce being the cold hearted murderer, Richard, the surprisingly good irishmen terrorists who was a 'hard' guy, not some pussy guy going after the girl in pretty women, he actually plays even though the goog guy role but still quite tough and 'bad' and I thought even though he wasn't my number one choice for this, he was really good. And, Sydney being the FBI Agent who puts trust into Richard's character to catch and kill the Jackal...I thought Bruce Willis was excellent at playing the straight face no humour guy, I mean it's not easy when acting along side the great Jack Black, :)Overall this is a nice action film where the Bad Guy actually the one playing with the good guys, not the other way round...9/10 Worth the slice of pie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was unimpressed the first time, but with prejudice spent I was more impressed on a second visit. Bruce Willis' Jackal is unlampoonable such is the awfulness of every character he takes on, including the basic one. But Poitier has a gravitas, even at this rather plastic studio level which is matched by Richard Gere's really rather good , grudginly complicit paramilitary jailbird. This is a good departure form the 1973 original, albeit by default; Willis' Jackal inspires no reverence from the viewer for either his callous underworld professionalism or his 'style', so to have a personal vendetta as a sub-plot gives the film an emotional force that the flabby (and flawed) story lacks.Ultimately, one should simply avoid this and watch the mind-chess that Edward Fox and Michael Lonsdale play out to the bitter (strangely bitter-sweet) end. But fans of Gere shouldn't ignore it - and I do remember loving the final, iconic scene first time round too. Were the rest of the film as good. 4/10</fullReview>

And I don't know why they couldn't just cast a real Irish person in Richard Gere's role. Granted, Richard Gere's a good actor (and as far as I've heard, a good guy), but he's not exactly one for accents. I would expect to see Bruce Willis in this kind of movie, but Sidney Poitier? That said, the movie's not a total waste. Jack Black plays the guy who "helps" Bruce Willis with the weapon. In those few minutes, he puts on a performance almost as crazy as his most famous ones. If nothing else, that would be the reason to see "The Jackal".</fullReview>

The film is about a hired killer (Willis) who is a master of disguise, out to eliminate a top government official while Gere is in pursuit, hired as he is the only man who can identify him.

		<fullReview>I didn't really want to see this film because it didn't look anything special, but I just had enough time to watch it with my mate before it was due back at blockbuster. Little did I know what a huge success it really turned out to be! Bruce Willis was perfect for playing the notorious killer simply known as 'The Jackal', this could of been a huge flop it the wrong sort of actor had this crucial main part, but Bruce really brought this character to life and made him extremely believable. I was also pleasantly surprised that even Richard Gere acted really well considering he wasn't in a chick flick like Chicago, he also had a great Irish accent. The thing that's clever about this film is I really liked The Jackal, because of how serious he seems but still delivers a comical attribute in his own unique way. If your lucky enough to see this for the first time look out for The Jackal's huge dominating sniper, this has to be the greatest sniper I've ever seen. It apparently fires 100 bullets before the first bullet even hits its target. Thankfully this tremendous film had a really good ending that really keeps you on the edge of your seat, with great dramatic tension. But overall I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to be entertained from start to finish; it's without a doubt another must-see. By the way if someone wants to try the aim on a huge gun, and they ask you to run around like a headless chicken, don't ever do it because the outcome will be numerous holes all around your body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe this thing received so many positive comments from viewers. The performances struck me as adequate, but that was the only decent thing about it. The story sports more lacunae than a round of Emmenthaler cheese and has so many pointless asides that the narrative is almost impossible to follow and, when that's possible, it's impossible to believe it. I won't duplicate the comments that have already been made about this problem except to mention one that particularly grated on me. This secret assasin, the man of a thousand faces, the guy who's identity is so obscure that the FBI isn't even sure he exists, answers a ringing phone and says, "Jackal." Zinneman's "The Day of the Jackal" was a finely tooled and highly logical piece of craftsmanship, as was Forsythe's novel before it. That earlier jackal carried only three identities and didn't change his hair style or color as often as he changed his socks, the way Willis does. "The Jackal" makes the earlier film look like a masterpiece of subtlety. Frederick Fox in the original lifts a man's passport at a ticket counter but you must watch closely to see it because it's done in an instant and with self-possessed skill. Here, Willis sits at an aiport for God knows how long until a man sitting nearby finally gets up and leaves his seat, leaving his open bag behind, as Willis must intuitively have known he would, which happens to have his passport sticking conveniently out so Willis can saunter over and pick it up. The tiny, easily broken-down, concealable, small caliber rifle with special bullets, in the original, here becomes gargantuized -- Gorgonized -- into a huge, complicated cannon firing (what was it?) 1,000 rounds a minute? (Light machine guns fire about 500 rpm.) Enough armament to stop a Banzai attack, and all for one little Hillary Clinton clone. (Footnote: those especially lethal bullets in the original, which shattered the pumpkin's head, weren't infallible; they were used in the attempted assasination of President Regan in 1982.) But even where the original was subtle, it was at least clear. When Fox sights his rifle in, we can watch him do it and easily understand how it's being done. Here, we see gears and knurled knobs clicking and whirring while Willis twirls a kind of wand and have no idea what's going on. We see a man blasted to bits by the cannon, but we do not see a demonstration after it has been properly sighted in. Instead of a long-distance duel between the bureaucracy and a clever murderer, we get two macho guys who wind up in a shoot out. I won't go on about this. The fact that it's a remake is symptomatic. Remakes have become endemic, like chicken pox in the middle ages. Why do they do it? Why take something that is well done and simply redo it, either shot-by-shot or dumbed down? Psycho, High Noon, The Thing -- all of them inferior copies of the originals. And the copies of TV series keep coming as well. The committees full of MBAs go on and on, driven ravenous by greed, snarling and grasping, hyenas fighting over carcasses. I keep waiting for "Gone With the Wind, Part II." It seems only a matter of time -- and desperation. You want to see a nicely tooled machine? Rent the original. If you want a better actioner than this, rerent "The Terminator" or any one of a hundred other flicks filled with big cannons and vehicular fireballs and shootouts in subways.</fullReview>

Then there's the question of when he comes face to face with the IRA man in broad daylight, about twenty feet apart, both firing some half a dozen times - and, for good measure, so does a Russian major equally 'professional' yet not one bullet finds its mark and the jackal disappears into thin air. Gimme a break. Okay, the movie would be over if logic prevailed but is it too much to ask for just a tad more realism. In my defense I came in late, switched on TV and it was just starting and after a heavy evening I was too lethargic to switch channels.

However thats what really hits the Americanized version hard because The Jackal is a very 'english' villain whose habits are described in great depth but unfortunately this version just seems to lack that passion and that James Bondish like charm which draws you to it. Although again when comes to American re-makes on films we have to bear in mind that these days they are more concerned about making mega-bucks and the box office rather than giving a solid film I mean I was not expecting a great masterpiece but please do pay some respect to the original. In this take we are told that The Jackal is an anonymous assassin for hire by the Russian Mafia to take out someone in the top of the U.S. chain to teach the FBI a lesson and however that felt like a good plot to go along with from the rather funky opening sequence, it never really picks up and as we are introduced to The Jackal him-self we kind of get the feeling that he is only doing it because he has to and does not actually see it as an artistic duty but more of a chore. Also another thing about The Jackal is that he is more of a perfectionist who likes to time everything to perfection and see how he can out-wit everyone and that was not really included in here. Another thing I think you will notice is that our' ultra cool assassin' is perfectly well organised in some places but then recklessly sloppy in other places. However the good points where that the movie did work at a fast pace and I did not have to look away for long as something always seemed to be happening. Richard Gere was okay although his Irish accent was just plain terrible and I also felt that his character was stretched into irrelevant things like a love story and the silly sub-plot between him and The Jackal. Sidney Poiter was good but I felt the stand out performance was Diane Venora as the tough Russian Major. There where parts of this that where nicely done which shows us how The Jackal went about doing his business which almost gave it that James Bondish super cool style to it but then most of the times it just becomes different version of Bruce Willis walking about. To Conclude back 1997 I was still just a teen and I would of loved the movie but now that I am a little bit older and have checked The Day of The Jackal , this version just seems very bland and ordinary. However its still not that bad so I would still say check it out if it is on TV but otherwise don't really go out of your way to see this on although it is based on the novel, the movie only ever crisps elements from it.THE JACKAL:6.8 OUT OF 10How do you stop an assassin who has no identity?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie does not compare the the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new version of "The Day of the Jackal" disappoints. The attraction of the previous version is subtlety and a riveting story. It was brilliantly executed by an astounding Director and movie team. This newer version is overt, lacks the depth of the earlier version and due to the excessive and extreme violence of the film, renders much of the film unwatchable. I could not stomach any more violence and stopped watching 20 minutes before it ended.It is not necessary to go excessive violence to tell a story. The original version was riveting, so it would be hard to make it less interesting. This new version had a huge potential to deliver a very laudable update on the previous version, but Hollywood's penchant to resort to staggering violence killed the story, hid the plot, detracting from the story. Too bad, this film had great actors, a great story, but it was ruined by overkill. In this case less is more should have been the order of the day. We won't even bother to give this video/DVD away; it will go straight into the trash pile!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day of the Jackal = 7.5/10 This pile of S?$T = 0.5/10I hoped this film might be good(considering the cast)but it was good until our hero arrived, non other than Ex IRA terrorist Richard Gere. "im only a shooter im not a bomber" Gere replies when being verbally attacked for killing women and children. His attacker backs off, shooting people is acceptable whereas bombing people isnt. Why did he have to be an IRA terrorist? Why was it written in? Is it another attempt by hollywood to convince Americans that the IRA are actually nice guys? Who are forced to bomb civilians in England and dont really want to do. Why couldnt they have had an all american hero do catch the "Jackal"Another crap part is at the start when the FBI waltze into a bar in Russia with help from the Russian police. Something that just wouldnt happen. The worst part is at the end though when Sidney poitier and Richard gere are drinking together. Well i guess the IRA terrorist deserved his drink though i mean after all he really is a nice guy! No where near as good as the orignal just like the remake of get carter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of an earlier film: "The day of the Jackal," which was far more believable and intense. The weapon used in the 1st film was very small and deadly, yet could be hidden very easily. In the 2nd film, the weapon in question looks like it belongs on a Bradley Fighting Vehicle! Also in the 1st film the detective solves the case; here we have An imprisoned Irish terrorist teaching a highly experienced FBI agent his job! A really "badly written" scene was where the 3 FBI agents have moved a family out of their house and the FBI folks are "cleaning up.(?) You actually have an FBI agent taking out the garbage! Trust me, agents don't have the time for this. Also, as soon as they noticed the 1st agent was missing and probably dead, they would have vacated the house and called for back-up! They should have also cut the speaker wires on the sound system that the Jackal was using to distract them! Yes, entertaining, but no where as good as the original...and remember that "lethal spray" that Willis used on his van to kill a "hijacker?" Nobody knows what it was. Well I'll tell you: it was "Anti-credibility spray" that destroys all credibility in any film that it's in...hooray for Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better-than -average homage to a movie classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was kind of nice to see Bruce Willis shed his "good-guy" image and portray the amoral and evil Jackal of the title. He did a good job as the unrelenting killer. Kudos to the make-up for being able to alter his appearance in almost every other scene, too.Willis' ability to appear emotionless (except during his interactions with Gere's character) was impeccable. Only during the final confrontation on the subway platform, does Willis let slip the appearance of cold calculation and shows that the Jackal is quite insane. I thought it was one of his better performances.This was a film that, for once, I really liked Richard Gere's acting. I must admit that I haven't seen too may of his films but, as Declan Mulqueen, I thought he embodied the IRA sharpshooter very well (I was especially impressed with his accent).Sidney Poitier and Diane Venora, as Mulqueen's "keepers" (Director Preston and Major Koslova) are fill out a excellent cast. Koslova's death near the end is very poignant.Well, as you can probably tell, I enjoyed this flick. Not exactly a remake of "The Day of the Jackal"...but, the, haven't we had enough remakes lately?P.S. It was nice to sea Ontario and Quebec locales used in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis should have received an academy award for this film for the various characters he played as the Jackal. I especially liked the elaborate planning the assassin used...he was extraordinarily calculating and cool. The script was very close to the original story except for the "good guys". I thought it was a superfluous reach to include the Richard Gere character. He added very little to the story and seemed in fact to be a distraction with his petty grievances and mad man terrorist attitude. It was quite unbelievable the investigators would consider someone like him worth the effort just because he had once met the Jackal and lived. the part of the film where Lamont and the Jackal are testing the remote controlled sniper rifle is really interesting and very well written. It demonstrates the Jackal's cold blooded nature...he becomes utterly inhuman. Overall, a thoroughly entertaining use of imagery. Very well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality performances, nicely executed thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood update of 'Day of the Jackal' features a good performance from Bruce Willis in the title role, and two excellent performances from Richard Gere and Diane Venora. All technical aspects of the film hold up well.Alternating between the highly organised antics of the enigmatic assassin and the more desperate methods of the authorities in tracking him down, the story of 'The Jackal', like many good thrillers, is a converging race against time. In this one, both threads are engaging, with the detached Willis having seemingly lost his own personality amidst the innumerable disguises, and the passionate Gere having to face his painful past in order to save his future.Diane Venora, as Soviet liaison Major Koslova, makes a huge impression with her portrayal of a scarred but brave and determined woman: such strong female characters are a delight when given to such quality actresses. Sidney Poitier is also very good as the Deputy FBI Director.Overall, an extremely efficient, entertaining movie that is far removed from the original, proving that a good movie stands alone on its own merits.</fullReview>

And, by taut international thriller, I mean an excuse for Bruce Willis to mug for the camera for about ninety minutes.I think Richard Gere was miscast as a member of the IRA; but, I always feel like Richard Gere has been miscast.

But i must admit that it isn't a good movie, but just because a movie ain't good it doesn't mean it ain't fun!Bruce Willis plays a hit-man called "the jackal" that is wanted by the entire world, he kills in cold blood and the only thing cares about is the mission. Richard Gere plays a captured IRA activist but the FBI needs him because he is the only person that can identify the jackal.It's great to see Willis play different characters and out-smart the FBI the entire time.

I am a big fan of Bruce Willis movies and this remains his third best performance (2.Die Hard. 1.12 Monkeys). He has enough menace to be a totally cool bad guy. A guy sees his face on the TV, being wanted by police. The Jackal shoots him without a second thought. Richard Gere is also good as the imprisoned Irish terrorist enlisted to help find the Jackal. Diane Venora and Sidney Potier are also good as others in the team to find the Jackal. Even Jack Black is good as Lamont however small his role may be.The Jackal: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film from the no so distant past to tell us about the future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the films of the mid-1990s when America had gotten out of its anti-Russian paranoia after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Russians and the Americans are working together against international terror-mongers. A real cocktail. The Russian mafia, slightly Georgian and Caucasian in those days (for the Americans, see Red Heat), the Basque separatist gone underground, the IRA getting little by little out of the closet and back on the political turf, and then the free-lance American adventurers who are doing it for the pleasure of killing in the most visible and gross way possible. But we have to note there is a traitor in the team and the traitor is a Russian of course. The Russians have never been totally redeemed. And now the Georgian mafia has gone back to Georgia and is manipulating the American-trained president, they are less redeemed than ever, though of course the means are scarce in the USA with the new financial crisis and its bailout to find money to support any kind of military adventure or caper anywhere in the world, not even Tibet, not Even Georgia, certainly not Ukraine, especially since the European president proposed in New York at the United Nations General Assembly to re-open negotiations with the Russians at a higher level than those that were frozen because of the Georgian American-trained and American-armed imbroglio. It is true that the tunnel from the Russian Federation to Georgia, dug out some 15 years ago or so became very handy indeed. So this film enabled us in 1997 to see the Irish IRA, the Basque ETA, the American FBI, the Russian SRV (or FSB) and a few others I guess save the day, cut short the plan to kill the First Lady, and finally got rid of this American Jackal. Unluckily things changed later for the worse and luckily we can hope things are going to change again and this time for the better. When the Americans discover after the financial crisis and its bailout what proportion of the banking system of the USA has been bought up directly or indirectly by the Chinese, the Russians, the Europeans, the various oil funds from the Middle East or from Northern Europe, or whatever, then they might finally realize they have to work with the rest of the world against plain criminals, or criminal terrorists if you want, and not send troops everywhere and imprecations against anyone. It is just the film we need to start understanding the world has really changed but the West in general and the USA in particular have NOT followed that change and have embarked on a revival of the old days. That started eight years ago and the "formerly"-CIA financed Ben Laden had enough know-how and connections to invest his own plans into some maneuvers that smelled like good old cold war tactics and manipulations. The actors are great, the suspense is quite well organized though of course we can know what is going to happen always a couple of second ahead of time. That's good for our egos, and we all have at least three egos according to Jacques Lacan, the Ego, the Superego and the Id. Entertaining enough for an averagely long evening.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is truly unique. It shows the world through the life of an assassin who can change his appearance at will. He can steal passports and have them altered to have his picture on it. He gains entry to countries without anyones knowledge.Clearly Bruce Willis is the antagonist and yet personally he was similar to Hannibal Lecter to me. First of all in both cases I wanted them to escape in the end. I wanted them to survive and escape their pursuers. Also, both are the true psychopaths. They are emotionless and cold. They are not crazy guys who run around doing random things and being easily caught by the authorities.Another good thing about the movie was the element of surprise. Throughout most of the movie the audience is meant to believe that the Jackal was hired to kill the Director of the FBI. We do not learn until much further into the movie that we understand that the real target of the Jackal is the First Lady.All in all it was a very entertaining movie with many interesting scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After an excellent original film, it is an underrated action thriller mostly by critics, but overall a great mainstream entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to some including professional critics, The Jackal is a mediocre, banal film. According to some, it is even terrible! Yes, the movie has some minor flaws, but the negative hype is just sad. Fred Zinnemann's Day of the Jackal was excellent, maybe a masterpiece in spy thriller genre. It was much more subtle and stylish, I agree, but as a mainstream action thriller from Hollywood, I think The Jackal is almost perfect. I have not forgotten some scenes since 1997 when I was nearly a kid. The van scene, the weapon test, the surprise raid of the jackal, the subway chase etc. many scenes were remarkable in the movie. At every time, when I go down any subway station, I remember this movie. The director succeeds in delivering the cat and mouse game between two men which is not that easy as it seems, especially if we think about some recent movies fall too short. I don't adore Richard Gere and believe that he is not a good choice for action movies, but he is solid here. As for Bruce Willis, he was amazing! He makes the movie better. In my opinion, The Jackal is one of his best movies, even if it is not a Die Hard. Despite some people say that he was disappointing as The Jackal, I have to disagree. He often disguises himself like The Saint (Willis is much better than Kilmer here) and it does not seem superficial. One of his disguises (glasses, mustache and beer belly) recalls Ernest Menville from Death Becomes Her which is a funny easter egg for me. By the way, Willis looks really cool and intimidating as the villain with yellow hair. The Isabella Zanconia character is totally unnecessary and makes the film mediocre, but the character Valentina was perfect. The Jackal is very entertaining and suspenseful action film and it is much better than those dull, slow paced or noisily empty action movies of today.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis is cold, empty and makes you uncomfortable but not in a way that instills fear or suspense. Opposite him is Richard Gere in a role I can only describe as unforgettable, simply because I can not get his *horrible* Irish accent out of my head. The supporting cast kept me from damaging my TV, including Sydney Poitier, Diane Venora and a pre-fame cameo from Jack Black.I confess to never seeing the 70's version, so I can't specifically place the blame, but I found the entire plot induced eye-rolls, except the plot twists which induced shoulder-shrugging.</fullReview>

Your hands alone are tinted in the blood of millions. There is nothing the IRA could possibly do, to equal the devastation that your nations combined have achieved in history. And always remember!!!It was you that invaded my country, not vice versa. It was you that divided our lands, not vice versa. It was you that wouldn't listen to our people, not vice versa. It was you that prevented my people from voting, not vice versa. It was you that prevented human rights, not vice versa. It was your ignorance that give birth to the IRAWether you accept it or not, I don't careGet off your high horse's</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow and too traditionally scripted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie needs some patience to watch along. The screenplay was not quite well written, it's too loose and too slow and too traditionally directed, edited with bad casting job. The Special Agent on this case was too old and not quite necessary with a role in this movie. The cooperation between the Russian and the American were a bit ridiculous and unconvincing, the sound track, the music came along with the whole movie was so bad and so out of place. The so-called "Jackal" played by Bruce Willis was too pretentious and too clich. Casting a scar-faced Russian Military Intelligence officer was also unnecessary. But the major problem was the lame role of the FBI Special Agent in Charge, Sydney Pottier was too old not to be forced into retirement maybe 10 years late. The whole movie spent a lot of money on locations, but the lame dialog simply failed to comply with the lame screenplay. The most ridiculous thing was the never stop changing hair style and the colors as though the only thing the Jackal good at was changing his hair colors and style. Arranged a IRA terrorist imprisoned in the U.S. territory was also a very lame scenario, Richard Gere in this movie was just like a lame office boy who's so smart that every time he could just cut in during FBI meetings to point out something nobody thought about, the smartest kid in the classroom. This is a very stupid and lame movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Bruce Willis as a BAD guy was excellent. But the most important thing is the music &amp; atmosphere of the movie. And of course, good as old wine, Sidney Poitiers. Diane Venora as a Russian cop - great idea!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jackal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day of the Jackal was a great classic British thriller, and an American remake seemed obvious to be on the cards, from director Michael Caton-Jones (This Boy's Life, Basic Instinct 2). Basically the brother of Russian crime lord Terek Murad (David Hayman) is shot, and to get revenge he hires hit-man and assassin The Jackal (Bruce Willis) to kill the director of the FBI. The authorities have no idea how to catch this anonymous killer, so FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier), with Russain Major Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora) enlist the help of an imprisoned IRA sniper. Originally they wanted the Irish Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) to tell them where a woman is that The Jackal knows, but then he reveals he has seen him, so they make a deal to let him out and help track her down. The Jackal himself is a high tech weaponry specialist, and in many disguises is getting away with travelling from place to place with new identities, and getting all the equipment he needs for his big job. Eventually after a few near misses and closing gaps, Declan and the authorities come to the conclusion that The Jackal is going to try and kill The First Lady (Tess Harper). So it all comes to a head at a big public event, and it all ends with Declan killing The Jackal in the subway, and after a quick thank you from Preston allowed to walk away free. Also starring Mathilda May as Isabella Zanconia, Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons as FBI Agent T. I. Witherspoon, Richard Lineback as FBI Agent McMurphy, John Cunningham as FBI Director Donald Brown, Jack Black as Ian Lamont, Leslie Phillips as Woolburton and Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls' Sophie Okonedo as Jamaican Girl. Gere does pretty well (with an Irish accent too), Willis is quite intense, Poitier as always is good, and there are some explosive moments, so while it's obviously not as good as the original, it's an alright action thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>
