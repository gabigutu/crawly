		<fullReview>Every where Richard Widmark's loser character Harry Fabian turns in this film he finds golden opportunities smothered in bad timing. Widmark utilizes a variation of that smarmy, snickering sinister giggle-chuckle that was memorialized in Kiss of Death.It serves the actor well in this film in its toned-down form but offers up a sort of pathetic body language for Fabian, the character. It may be that this American ex-patriot character is just way out of his depth. His hucksterism is not much appreciated by many of his acquaintances in this seedy London underworld. If Harry Fabian would simply accept that he is destined to be a 3rd rate shill and stooge,he might have fund some small pleasures. However, his mind is a shade too quick and his ambition too pumped. He's a user with not a shread of remorse about stepping on others, ripping them off, keeping one tiny step ahead of exposure. This is a superb film, squalid and sinister in its portrayal of greed, corruption and betrayal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason Night and the City doesn't seem to the credit it deserves; possibly because it was director Jules Dassin's last American film before being blacklisted as a Communist. I wasn't born until the Cold War was winding down, but it seems that with movies like Night and the City to his credit, we could have turned a blind eye even if he really was a Commie.Honestly this film deserves to rank up there with the likes of The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, or Out of the Past. The scenes of our "hero" Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark, at his best) being chased through London's East End are as starkly beautiful as anything you'll ever see on film. For several minutes there isn't a single shade of gray, everything is literally black or white and the camera itself seems to have joined in hunting Harry. Then there's the long, semi-grotesque wrestling scene that took me totally by surprise, it's like something out of Fellini.Widmark is utterly believable as Fabian, a charming two-bit grifter who works as a "club tout" but hatches one ill-fated get-rich-quick scheme after another. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, there isn't a cardboard character in the bunch, except maybe Harry's girl Marry (Gene Tierney) though its really more a flaw in the character than the actress. Mary's saintliness may be the writers' only slip-up though, every other character has the sort of depth that makes the film a joy to watch. They inexorably follow their own motivations, which, of course, rely on those of someone else, who inevitably has a goal of his or her own, which will eventually derail the plan of someone whom someone else is counting on (actually, the film is a little less twisted than this review ;-) Criterion has just (2/05) recently released Night and the City and never has the phrase "filmed in glorious black and white" been more appropriate. Before this film seemed to lurk in the shadows of AMC or TCM, only occasionally showing its face, as if it were one of the genre's minor works. Now, if you haven't seen it you have no excuse, and you're only hurting yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gritty film, exposing the world of small time crooks in London, is a real masterpiece of film noir. The director, Jules Dassin, has captured this dark, dirty world perfectly and the black and white cinematography is superb. Richard Widmark is as despicable here as he was as Tommy Udo in "Kiss of Death"...it is a coup of casting. Francis Sullivan as Phil is great as the nightclub owner for whom Widmark shills and Googie Withers, one of my favorites of British film, is awesome as the unfaithful wife. Gene Tierney is wasted as Widmark's girlfriend...she does not seem to have much to do. Other support players are strong and you get to see Herbert Lom without his toupee! This is one of the best in the film noir genre and the ending pulls no punches. This is not a happy, feel good film. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rise and fall of small-time hustler Harry Fabain is chronicled in this noir thriller by Director Jules Dassin.This was Dassin's American swansong, completed just before being named by fellow director Ed Dmytryk before HUAK as a "communist," thus ending Dassin's American career.He brought to "Night and the City" all the technique he acquired over years of quality movie making. Although born in Connecticut and raised and trained in the US, Dassin's work always had the look and feel of his European counterpart, Carol Reed.The script here is a decent one with surprise turns, avoiding predictability. Franz Waxman's high pitched score adds excitement to the proceedings and Gene Tierney is a creditable second lead.Yet it's Richard Widmark on whose shoulders the success of this film ultimately rests. It's not an easy role, as Fabian's character runs the gamut of emotional range as he struggles to wheel and deal his petty schemes amongst assorted lowlife types.Widmark proves he's well up to the challenge, creating a strong portrait of a small time hood striving for positive payoffs through his callous cleverness. It's a reminder of how talented and resourceful this actor is, and how he and Dassin meshed to create a film of impact.Dassin, of course, went on to France after this to engage in a fabulous European period, while Widmark struggled to find scripts worthy of his formidable talents, which turned out to be few and far between. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widmark Tops Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite Richard Widmark performance on the screen and probably his best work is Night and the City. This was director Jules Dassin's last film before settling in Europe in the wake of the blacklist and it has a first rate cast tuned to a fine pitch, like an orchestra without a bad note in it.Harry Fabian is this smalltime American hustler/conman who's settled in London and always working that middle ground netherworld between the law and outright gangsterism. He really isn't a very likable man and the trick is to keep the audience care what's happening to him. This is the test of a great actor and Widmark is fully up to the challenge.Fabian while working one of his cons overhears a piece of information about the father/son relationship between champion Graeco-Roman wrestler Gregorius the Great and gangster/promoter Cristo who is the London version of Vince McMahon. He cons Gregorius into thinking he wants to promote old style wrestling like Gregorius used to do. That con game sets in motion the events of the film that ultimately end in tragedy.The cast is uniformly fine, but one performance really stands out, that of Stanislaus Zbyzsko as Gregorius. He was a real professional wrestling champion back in the day when it was real. Zbyzsko invests so much of his own life and reality as Gregorius that he's really something special. His scenes with Herbert Lom as his son are so good they go far beyond the plane of mere acting. It's some of the best work Lom has ever done as well.How there weren't a few Oscar nominations from this is a mystery for me. For those who like film noir, this should be required viewing. Especially for you Richard Widmark fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is One Dark &amp; Moody Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a second look for me to enjoy this movie as it didn't really appeal much to me on the first viewing. Perhaps a better picture helped. If I had the Criterion DVD, it would be much better I'm sure but, for now, I'll have to settle for the VHS. This is a very noir-ish with a lot of dark scenes, so a good transfer is a must.Most of the action takes place at night in London alleyways, nightclubs and gymnasiums. The storyline is a downer, that's for sure. It is a rough and sometimes depressing story. Richard Widmark, as "Harry Fabian," has the starring role and plays a real loser, a desperate man who always has a scheme concocted but usually messes up. Some critics think this is Widmark's best performance ever. Francis Sullivan is interesting as the nightclub owner. Gene Tierney gets second billing but doesn't have much of role in here.Some memorable scenes include a wrestling match with big Mike Mazurki and "Gregorious." I'm not much into wrestling but this was an amazing match, extremely intense.This film is a bit different from most American-based film noirs. It's not a pleasant story, it's moody, and it has a certain fascination to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Always Loser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London, the swindler Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark) is an ambitious loser, frequently taking money from his girlfriend Mary Bristol (Gene Tierney). When he meets the famous Greco-Roman wrestler Gregorius the Great (Stanislaus Zbyszko) in the arena of his son and the wrestling lord Kristo (Herbert Lorn), he plans a scheme to become successful. He cheats Greorious, promising clean combats in his own arena, and the old man accepts the partnership. However, without money to promote the fight, he invites his boss and owner of a nightclub Phil Nosseross (Francis L. Sullivan) to be his partner, but is betrayed and his business fails ending in a tragedy."Night and the City" is a great film-noir, with many twists and another excellent performance of Richard Widmark. The story shows the underworld of London, with low-lives, hustlers, beggars, gamblers and other amoral characters through a magnificent black and white cinematography. The direction of Jules Dassin is sharp and the screenplay perfectly develops the characters and the story in an excellent pace. The Brazilian distributor Oregon Filmes / Fox has one of the best collections of movies labeled "Tesouros da Sétima Arte" ("Treasures of the Seventh Art"). Unfortunately, most of their DVDs shamefully have problems while playing the film, maybe because of the lack of quality of the laboratory they use. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Sombras do Mal" ("Shadows of Evil")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS How sublime!This is without a doubt,Jules Dassin's towering achievement.Had he only made this work,his name would deserve to be remembered forever.Richard Widmark will leave you on the edge of your seat!How can an actor be so good?Just compare him to Today's stars.Widmark's performance is one of these you never forget.A washout trying to make it big in the London underworld,he's some kind of mythomaniac,sometimes verging on madness,with an almost Shakespearian grandeur.His fate seems sealed when the story begins.We do know he won't work it out.A nightmarish bunch surrounds him and are like spiders watching a fly:the obese Francis L. Sullivan,a grotesque and fatty caricature who hates Widmark because his wife (Withers) has a crush on Widmark and provides him with funds;this two-bit femme fatale,who thinks she can escape her wealthy fatso.the two wrestlers ,fighting on the ring like animals ;there's nothing human in this fighting :you've never seen a thing like that.Almost every sequence should be studied in detail but I will only mention three of them: -After a bestial -an euphemism-fight,the old wrestler asks his son to close the window because he's cold,so cold..But the window is closed and the son only pretends to obey.He dies in his arms.-Widmark's final run is the most beautiful ever filmed.Close shots ,apocalyptic landscapes,impressive framings.It's the whole underworld against a single man,who cannot rely on anyone.Widmark's despair,hope against hope ,his final fit of anger when he wants his girlfriend to get the reward,are among the best fil m noir scenes.-When Googie returns home and finds her hubby dead ,she thinks she 's free at last.But the horrible shrew is here ,like a spider on her web,she's the sole legatee,and now she's got the prodigal woman under her thumb.There's another world ,but we are only allowed to catch transient glimpses of it.People complain about Gene Tierney's rather small part on the site.She does not enter the underworld,the subcity,she stays away from it.She's Widmark's last chance,but as the movie begins,it's already too late.Only at the end ,Tierney tries to walk across the mirror,only to discover it's a blind alley.Her character is not romantic enough,all she dreamed about was a cosy life in a sweet cottage in the heart of the country.She falls in her neighbor's arms-a neighbor who's got a money-box in the shape of a bank!-After such a peak ,the only way for Jules Dassin was down.And alas that was what happened:"du rififi chez les hommes" has still got a good reputation.The Melina Mercouri era brought at best entertaining works (celui qui doit mourir;Topkapi) at best,dumb and vulgar comedies (la loi;never on Sunday)at worst."Dream of passion" his last one,was pretentious to a fault :trying to link Greek mythology (Medea)with the story of a woman who killed his children.He had not realized that "night and the city" with his monsters and his lonesome hero,whose fate is sealed was already a Greek tragedy ,and so much so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Dark Night of the Soul, London, 1950</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more films I see by Jules Dassin, the more I wonder why he isn't better known or regarded as a director. It's been 56 years since he was blacklisted by the McCarthy-ites, but his reputation never seems to have recovered, at least not in the United States. Hopefully, more DVD releases like the Criterion version of Night and the City will bring deserved attention to his excellent body of work.I want to call Night and the City a classic film noir, which it is, but that seems too limiting. It might be better to say that Dassin uses film noir to dig a little deeper into our human strivings and sufferings. There's a lot of sweat and desperation in the midst of this entertaining and well-paced film, and not just on the part of Harry Fabian, the small-time hustler who dreams of being great. We encounter a typically smooth and dangerous mobster who also happens to have a difficult relationship with his disappointed father. A wealthy but thugish club owner, who might be a caricature in another film noir, can't seem to express his powerful and animalistic feelings for his beautiful wife. She seems like a scheming femme fatale but turns out to have an almost quaint dream of her own. In the end, we're in the muck and mire of human foibles, a kind of low-level Shakespearean tragedy that we all live out to one degree or another. This story just happens to take place in the shadowy underworld of 1950 London.There's a poignancy to this film that separates it from others in the noir genre. Part of this lies in the strong writing, part in the excellent acting ensemble. This is one of those rare and remarkable films where the secondary and minor actors seem like they were all giving the performance of their career. Richard Widmark probably could have done with a bit more subtlety as Harry Fabian; he feels a bit histrionic at times, but his manic energy is important to the pace of the film and the feeling of increasing desperation. Gene Tierney and Hugh Marlowe don't get to do much and seem a bit lost among all the other great roles. In an interview with Dassin included with the DVD, the director says he put Tierney in the film as a favor to producer Daryl Zanuck, adding her role at the last minute, and it feels like that at times. But, hey, it's Gene Tierney.Herbert Lom delivers a chilling performance as Kristo the mobster, and Stanislaus Zbyszko is a miracle as his father, the once-famous wrestler Gregorious who can't stand that his son has helped kill the great tradition of Greco-Roman wrestling with his shoddy wrestling matches. The great Mike Mazurki does well as The Strangler, and the wrestling match he gets into with Gregorious may be the highlight of the film. Zbyszko and Mazurki were both former wrestlers, and the realism of their fight heightens the emotional intensity of the scene. It's the brutal scruff and claw of existence brought to life on screen for a few powerful moments.I had never seen Francis Sullivan before, so I was pleasantly surprised by his masterful work as the club owner Nosseross. Googie Withers also does a great job as his wife Helen, managing to bring some good shading to an underwritten role. And some of the best moments of the film are delivered by minor characters such as Anna, the woman who works down on the docks; Figler, the "King of the Beggars;" and Googin the forger.After a brief voice-over intro, Dassin starts the action with a bang, as one man chases another through the darkness of late-night London, across what looks like the plaza in front of the British Museum (???). The camera angle on this opening is fantastic, the kind of shot you want to turn into a poster and hang on your wall. And the camera work remains excellent throughout the film. The final long sequence of Harry running all over London in the foggy darkness, with the whole world seemingly after him, is an exciting and powerful climax. Quite a memorable ending to this excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jules Dassin no doubt established his reputation with this picture, the best he ever made, a virtually flawless and absorbing film noir with multiple plot twists and a great collection of characters.Richard Widmark, a real-life war hero, always preferred hero roles in movies; but he made his screen reputation playing a sleazy rat in his first movie, and he does an even better job in this film.Although the story is great, I was somewhat distracted by noticing the relentless excellence of the cinematography, lighting, direction, acting, et cetera.Despite the summary, there is very little professional wrestling on screen; but what there is will teach you a lot.Gene Tierney, a true superstar of the 1950's, does not have much screen time in this one; but what she's got is most welcome.Hollywood in 2007 would have no ability to make a movie like this one. What we get now is a silly bloodbath from the Coen Brothers --- posing as excellence. Thank God for the oldies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Fabian begins and ends 'Night and the City' running from somebody in a nightmare nocturnal London, literally ducking and diving, lurching into abandoned warehouses and slums, crouching in doorways, scrabbling up alleys: a hounded man with a desperate febrile face. If the traditional Western is about escape from a fixed identity, than Fabian's quest is, as is appropriate to such an interior, urban genre as the crime film, its opposite - he wants to stop running, to earn a fixed place, a recognisable identity, to be treated with respect, to be somebody.But in the first ten minutes he is a divided man. Scrounging cash from his unbelievably tolerant girlfriend, Mary (oh yes) she shows him a photo of their past, an idyllic picture of harmony on a rowing boat, presumably on some pleasant English river. Harry has fallen from this pastoral paradise, he has moved from this fixed, frozen image to a lift of constant movement, where to stop is to die, assuming and casting off identities as he goes. The film's negative drive is very similar to Godard's 'A Bout De Souffle', and like Michel Poiccard, Harry is a dead man, A Maxwell's Demon of energy and information overloading, hurtling into inertia.Although the film comes within the description of film noir, it's rise and fall narrative more properly belongs to the 30s gangster genre, and Harry is like a man out of time. His bluster, quick-thinking energy, and absurd sense of style (he stops n the middle of life-threatening flight to pick up his fallen buttonhole) would be thoroughly appropriate in the worlds of 'Scarface' or 'The Public Enemy'. But film noir in an interior, subjective genre, the laws are less easily manipulable, everyone's looking out for himself. Harry doesn't even rise very high - although he almost convinces you that he does - he gets as far as the rehearsal stage for the big drama that will be his success.The figures of drama seep through the film, from Mary's singing to an audience, to the extraordinary wrestling rite that sparks off the action climax. This fight is extraordinary, as the film changes registers, changes from one plot to another, with Harry marginalised in his own drama, moved from playwright and actor to impotent observer. Because throughout Harry is the former, willing events, dreams, even people into existence, performing a constant series of roles, adapting for the different audiences; even playacting a crucial narrative plot point (getting Gregorius to fight the Strangler). This further splits the already divided Harry - the man of public performance(s) has nothing left for himself - he is indeed a dead man.'Night' is about 3/4 a masterpiece. Unusually for a noir, which often forsook coherent narrative for 'meaningful' spectacle, it is an exciting action film, full of unbearable suspense and good chases. The filming of London, after the initial jolt of a spiv hero with an American accent, is unparalelled, its seedy underworld given a gothic-Dickenisan intensity, all shadows, Chinese-box-like interiors and grotesques - Francis L. Sullivan as Phil Nosseross, half Satan, half sympathetic cuckold, is outstanding. The mechanics of underworld commerce (club touting, hostesses etc.), is brilliantly done (and more economically than 'Casino'), as well as sociologically important; showing that the film is about much more than a man's downfall.Anyone who knows Jules Dassin from his interminable Melina Mercouri films may be surprised by the level of invention here - the bursting, lurching mise-en-scene, threatening to explode at any moment, full of overspilling wide angles, masses of intrusive decor, brilliant composition in which mise en scene ironically frames and imprisons characters who think they've all the freedom, or the placing of characters in space to reveal their true power. Franz Waxman's score is a neurotic marvel, full of sudden shards of lightening. Best of all is Widmark's astounding performance, a seedy Jerry Maguire, full of talk and promises hiding inner terror and emptiness, charming and cocky at the right times, shockingly, paralysingly brutal when he needs to be.The last quarter is a little disappointing, with its cod-psychological 'explanations' of the end, diluting the hero's potency, (although the 'revelation' of past here mirrors the photo at the beginning), and the Willy Loman/'Angels with Dirty Faces' stretch for redemption is a bit much. But the ending is bravely downbeat - this is a rare Hays Code era film that allows the villain go unpunished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night and the City is directed by Jules Dassin and is adapted by Jo Eisinger from the novel written by Gerald Kersh. Starring are Richard Widmark, Gene Tierney, Googie Withers, Hebert Lom, Francis L. Sullivan, Mike Mazurki &amp; Stanislaus Zbyszko. The score is composed by Franz Waxman and Max Greene is the cinematographer. It's shot on location in London, England.Harry Fabian (Widmark) is a hopeless dreamer, a two-bit hustler who aspires to make it big and never want for money again. Over hearing retired wrestling superstar Gregorius (Zbyszko) bemoaning the fake wrestling bouts put on by his underworld son Kristo (Lom), Fabian hatches a plan to set up his own wrestling empire backed by Gregorius. Thus he be safe from retribution from Kristo and his heavies. That is as long as Fabian does right by Gregorius and doesn't abuse his trust. Things get complicated, tho, as Fabian needs money to back the venture, money he hasn't got. So systematically he drags into the equation his girlfriend Mary Bristol (Tierney), club owner Phil Nosseross (Sullivan) and Sullivan's wife, Helen (Withers). Pretty soon things start to spiral out of control.Night and the City has been called many things, from baroque masterpiece to being a turgid pictorial grotesque! Polar opposite reactions that have now, over time, dovetailed into a majority agreement from film noir purists that it is indeed one special piece of film noir movie making. The film opens in quite an unassuming way as the title sequence brings views of leisurely London, then Dassin does a voice-over telling us that "The night is tonight, tomorrow night or any night. The city is London." We then cut to a man on the run, pursued by a person unknown. The man being chased is Harry Fabian, sharply attired in suit and hat, he has left pictorial London and is now running thru bomb afflicted London, thru murky alleyways. Until sanctuary comes at his girlfriend's tidy flat, the contrast between the two worlds of Harry Fabian neatly marrying American film noir with British kitchen sink-ism.However, that sanctuary is a rare ray of hope in Dassin's movie, a cunning trick by the makers, for Night and the City is ultimately a dark and brooding picture, one that deals in corruption &amp; paranoia, with a pervading sense of doom hanging heavy like a death warrant issued by some heavy underworld crime lord. The characters in this part of London are mainly blank personalities, cold and calculating, crooked and immoral. That Fabian is only a lesser light, on the lower rung of this seamy ladder, is irrelevant, because he aspires to become just the same, only richer. Duplicity and betrayal are things he's happy to jump in bed with, and we the audience are part of it as we view this story thru Fabian's hopeless and oblivious eyes.Yet the movie, in spite of its uncompromising story, is by turns exciting &amp; pacey, even breath taking, driven by one of the finest scores put down in film noir as Waxman prods and probes with pulse beats and deft ear clangers. With Greene's expressionistic and daring photography blending seamlessly with the mood crafted by director and composer alike. The cast are mostly strong, with Widmark, Zbyszko &amp; Withers actually terrific, the latter involved in a superb wrestling sequence with Mazurki. At times heart pounding, at others wince inducing-if you find yourself holding your breath-then that's OK, it has that effect on many. Tierney was cast as a favour to Darryl Zanuck who was worried about Tierney's mental health at the time. She looks radiant and offers up an interesting counterpoint to all the darkness within the story. Dassin spoke very favourably of her work on the film, saying she was no trouble at all and a consummate professional.As for Dassin himself? Well he was, thanks to the HUAC outcry, about to be out of work and on the run. He moved to Europe and never worked in America again, he returned from film making exile five years later where he would make the much revered Rififi in France. A truly excellent director, capable of pacing a film to precision and holding an audience in an atmospheric vice like grip. Night and the City is his masterpiece, and it is also one of film noir's greatest treasures. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very well-named film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a film set among night people in a London still struggling to get on its feet after the war. There's a lot of location shooting and attention to detail in showing the world the characters live in: characters put flowers in their lapels but live in draughty rooms, a nightclub tries to look classy but has beggars and alcoholics buzzing around it, the neon lights are shining again in the West End but it isn't very far to whole city blocks where nearly a decade after the Blitz the rubble has still to be cleared.When the scene is set so well, it's entirely believable to come across characters who are desperate to escape from their lives, and it doesn't take a lot of explicit violence to be aware that there are a lot of people here who would cut your throat for tuppence ha'penny, let alone a thousand quid, or is that a thousand quids (one of the fun parts of the film is listening to American actors use British slang).In fact the milieu is drawn so well that not only does it bring you into the movie but it sometimes becomes more interesting than the movie itself. For example one of the characters is a craggy old-time wrestler who is played by a real-life craggy old-time wrestler in his only acting role. He has a fight whose outcome is essential to the plot but where the irresitible forces and immovable objects in human form are so fascinating that when we see the reaction of the other characters, they're partly reacting as their characters would react and it's partly as if the actors have stepped out of the movie for two minutes and are reacting to the scene with the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten noir that will eventually become a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night and the City" was the final film for Jules Dassin in the U.S. before being blacklisted. He eventually moved to France but didn't make another film until 1955. Though he is best remembered for the films he did with his wife, Melina Mercouri, this is one of his great movies, a very gritty film noir with London as its background.Richard Widmark plays Harry Fabian, a low-life con man who makes money as a tout for a club, i.e., he seeks out male tourists and gets them to spend their money there. The club is owned by Phil Nosseross (Francis L. Sullivan) and his wife Helen, who hates her husband and wants to start her own business. Working there is Fabian's girlfriend (Gene Tierney) who loves him in spite of the fact that he's constantly borrowing or stealing money from her.Harry hits on a scheme to break into wrestling promotion in London. Unfortunately, Kristo (Herbert Lom) has it sewn up. Though his father (Stanislaus Zbyszko, a real-life wrestler) was a great wrestling champion doing Greco-Roman boxing, Kristo does not promote it. This has actually caused a rift between father and son, and Harry moves right in. With the elder Kristo on his side, Harry gets his chance to promote Greco-Roman wrestling. He gets the needed money by promising Helen that he will get her a license to open her business, though the building supposedly can't be licensed for another year. The results of Harry's project lead to tragedy as he brings everybody down with him.Filmed in black and white only adds to the grittiness of "Night and the City" as Harry runs through London. The film moves as swiftly as he does, leading to the inevitable but exciting climax.This was a powerhouse role for Richard Widmark, who is a slimy, desperate, and fast-talking Harry. The problem with Harry is, he's really not that good of a con man. He's sloppy. He can get guys into the club but that's about it. He rubs the wrong people the wrong way, and he makes everyone angry until finally, he's a complete untouchable as Kristo chases after him. Widmark gives us a perfect portrait. Tierney is in the film only at the request of Zanuck, who wanted to distract her from her personal problems; she has a surprisingly small role. Herbert Lom is fantastic as Kristo. Stanislaus Zbyszko, whom Dassin sought out, gives a poignant performance as Gregorius the Great. The wonderfully talented Googie Withers is great as the cold and sophisticated Helen. You totally believes she loathes her husband. And Sullivan's Nesseros is easy to loathe as a wealthy worm who plays both ends against the middle to destroy Fabian. They all end up destroying themselves.Apparently this film did not get appropriate distribution or something, because it's a great film, now out on DVD, and very few people know it. Hopefully, like "Nightmare Alley," another film that was ill-served by Hollywood, it will continue to gain in cult status. It deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a vivid and well acted film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night and the City (1950)A brilliant, gutsy, tightly made and beautifully photographed movie, top to bottom.Richard Widmark is in one his best roles here as the small-time guy on the make who gets in over his head. And around him are character actors (wrestlers) and a very secondary lead, Gene Tierney, all playing vivid, sharply chiseled characters. But it's Widmark's movie, and he is convincing when thrilled and when beaten down. We see how he believes in himself, and how disillusioned he appears to others. And London at night, filled with dead ends and narrow alleys, is ominous and glistening. The plot is interwoven and not at all simple, but thanks to an ongoing logic supplied by American director Jules Dassin, it is never confusing, just increasingly interesting.The photography, and associated lighting, has to be admired even by people used to great noir filming. The shadows here are dark but always with a hint of detail--none of the total inky blackness blanking out large parts of the scene as in some American noirs. It's really a matter of great finesse to pull this off with such consistency, and it makes the movie a visual masterpiece. Cinematographer Mutz Greenbaum (Max Greene) is barely known outside of this film, so perhaps we can give Dassin a lot of the credit for the look, and the really dynamic framing, of so much of it.We don't usually associate British films with great film noir styling, but here is one of the best, though the two leads (Widmark and Tierney) and the director are American, and this was officially a 20th Century Fox production. This comes just a year after that other great British noir of this period, The Third Man, with strong British creds but again American leading actors. If you like Night and the City (and you almost have to, it's really amazing stuff), you'll definitely like Thieve's Highway.And Widmark? My opinion of him only grows over time. It's easy to typecast him in your head the way you might Robert Mitchum, but both actors have extraordinary presence of depth on the screen. Here you might get the best of Widmark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine Charles Dickens had to make a bit of extra money by writing B-movies in Hollywood and you might get close to imagining this haunting, wonderful film. It fuses the best traditions of film noir with a very British atmosphere: a cast of character actors playing vividly drawn and desperate people.There's a mournful tone to the whole film, like a boat's siren drifting across a foggy Thames. All the characters seem to be reaching for their hearts desire, wanting to believe in a dream of a better tomorrow, in something that's real and true for them. But they rip into each other trying to get there. That gives the film a poignant, tragic trajectory.A compelling central performance by Richard Widmark as Harry Fabian, a man with flair and drive and an infectious hope, but a man who lacks something like the moral fibre to be honest. A man always looking for a shortcut. A nearly-great man, an almost classically tragic figure. Googie Withers is a revelation as Helen, a woman who seems cynical but has hopes and dreams just like Fabian (just like all our characters).So much I haven't even mentioned, the sweaty muscular wrestling scenes are are action scenes of the best kind, in that they drive and skew the plot as well as holding our attention. So many good performances. And a film that speaks to our hopes and our flaws and the tragic spaces between the two.Any Londoner or person who loves the atmosphere of that city should check it out too, some lovely old footage of Trafalgar Square and Picadilly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I had seen all the best movies of the 40's and 50's and then I saw this one. Richard Widmark has turned in some great performances but this has to rank as one of his very best, if not the very best. Jules Dassin has some great movies to his credit so I am at a loss to know why this one does not get the publicity of his other masterworks. He is in a category of his own when it comes to making a film that makes use of the city as well as capture the feel of a city. This is black and white film making at its peak. Not a bad performance in it. This was obviously an Anglo-American production from 20th Century Fox so it is a mystery why it has been kept such a well kept secret. It certainly has all the credentials of a film noir classic. I would put this one up there with "Out of the Past", "Odd Man Out", "Third Man", "DOA", "Double Indemnity" and others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night and the City is a gripping psychological crime-drama in the best film-noir tradition. The taut, fast-paced plot takes us to the seedy back streets and dingy night-clubs of post world-war two London, where two-bit street hustler Harry Fabian scrounges for a, "life of ease and plenty." Richard Widmark brings a frenetic energy to his role as Harry. He plays Fabian as a high-strung bundle of nerves, never missing a beat as Harry's mood swings run the gauntlet from giddy hysteria to suicidal despair.Harry impresses with his sharp sports coats and slick banter, but the big score always seems to elude his grasp. He stumbles into a scheme to succeed as a big-time wrestling promoter, but can't swing the deal for lack of cash. Girlfriend Mary (Gene Tierney) is a jaded barmaid still longing for a decent life. She's heard it all before, and refused to help. Double dealing business partner Phil (Francis Sullivan) sees Harry as a foolish but dangerous rival - one who must be stopped. Phil's wife Helen (Googie Withers) plays the seductive vamp, planning to use Harry for her own purposes. Fabian finally meets his nemesis when he runs afoul of Kristo (Herbert Lom), the local wrestling king-pin.While there is no gun-play, we still get plenty of action and suspense. The theme of the film is summed up in a brutal wrestling match, where the "truth and beauty" of Greco-Roman wrestling is pitted against the cheap and phony modern style. The finale sees Harry lurching through the urban landscape, unable to out-run his pursuers or his self-loathing. For one brief moment he teeters on the edge of redemption, but in the end he can't avoid his fated destiny.Night and the City is notable for its wonderful noir mood and atmosphere. Director Jules Dassin sets the tone right from the opening credits, where flickering titles printed in tiny neon lights blink out from the fog-shrouded London night. Shot on location in moody black &amp; white cinematography, the movie exudes a hard and gritty realism. Tilted camera angles and shadowy lighting place us smack in the center of Harry's corrupt and desperate world.A recent DVD release should result in more exposure for this seldom seen gem. Night and the City stands as a fine introduction to the film-noir genre, as well as a must-see for the hard-core fan. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jules Dassin bid American cinema adieu with Night and the City after he was blacklisted by the dreaded HUAC committee and what an adieu that was. A hard-boiled film noir taking place in seedy, morally bankrupt London that deserves a place in the noir pantheon along such gems as The Third Man and Double Indemnity.Night and the City chronicles the life and ambitions of small-time hustler Harry Fabian (played perfectly by Richard Widmark), a man full of plans for breaking big and delusions of grandeur, much to the amusement of his boss and the dismay of his girl-friend. Dassin takes us through the fascinating underworld of London, as Fabian tries to score big in the wrestling ring using his competitor's father to make a name and money for himself. Through a series of encounters and lots of scheming, he will find himself in a very strange position. Like an obese cabaret owner comments, he has it all but he's a dead man.It's near impossible to find flaws with this movie. From the inspired script to the very tight plotting with never a dull moment, to the grim black and white cinematography that uses London's dreary streets as another character that comments on the action and mood, Night and the City is a truly fascinating glimpse in a kind of cinema long gone. A classic film noir gem that excels in both what it presents to the viewer and what it leaves to the imagination. The approaching steps of someone echoing off screen as we watch Fabian's increasing distress (only to discover it's his girl-friend, played by the gorgeous Gene Tierney). The cat and mouse game as Fabian with a reward on his head is being chased by every hoodlum and beggar in London that recalls Fritz Lang's noir godfather M (1931).Apart from technical proficiency and a maddening atmosphere, Night and the City really succeeds in portraying one of the best and most memorable character ensembles in the film noir universe. Everyone is out for themselves, ready to backstab and use each other on the drop of a hat. Yet we know they're doomed from the start. There's no way out for them, caught as they are in a neverending web of betrayal, false hopes and despair. What might appear moralistic (ie the backstabbers get their just deserts in the end) is anything but, since everything is done with delicate irony in the mold of ancient Greek tragedy. There's no deus ex machina but there's plenty of nemesis divina. The gods are laughing at the tragic fate of our heroes and like a Japanese proverb goes, "the gods only laugh when men pray to them for wealth"...The American moral guardians of the time might have cost American cinema a visionary of Dassin's calibre, but we were lucky enough that he found a new home overseas. Night and the City carries all the bittersweet nature of his adios and remains a near flawless movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sordid Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that films noir have such spurious titles? The German title, "Die Ratte von Soho" / "The Rat of Soho" seems a more suitably lurid fit, certainly as a hook. To go with the spurious title there's a spurious introduction on the theme of Night and the City, which is at least easy on the eye, though fortunately brief. What the film is really about is the existential failure of one Harry Fabian, a cheap conman, but full of life. The movie is a very sordid one, an initial lecture is given to a bunch of *ahem* companions in the Silver Fox nightclub about how to fleece the customers, there is however to be no actual theft from them on the premises, although, suggestively, what happens to the customers on leaving the club is of no concern to the management. A friend of my brother has post-traumatic stress from being the victim of such a honey trap whilst drunk in London this year, so I really connected with the cutting edge of nastiness this film provides. Although this movie is set in a moonlit criminal demi-monde, there are about five separate love stories, arranged in a complicated geometry. These are what pull the heartstrings and kept me rapt throughout. The central love story is Mary's love for Harry, who does little more than use her. She sees a vitality in him that attracts her helplessly, as if he's a magnet, and overlooks all his faults for this. He's a hamstrung man, who's damaged heart spills out in a final scene of electrifying intensity. Richard Widmark, who I have rarely appreciated as an actor, here throws everything at his role but the kitchen sink and deserves all the praise he gets.Night and the City is an absolutely heartbreaking film that I realised had really shaken me up after I left the cinema. I had fish and chips to celebrate in Cockney style. Peripherally I think it's worth mentioning that there is more than one version of this movie, and it can look a bit strange because a lot of the build up to the, possibly overwrought, action of the denouement is cut in what I believe is the American version. Would pay to rent out the Criterion DVD of this movie as it apparently has explanatory extras on this subject. I would also like to express my admiration for the seductive qualities of Googie Withers' portrayal of Helen Nosseross, and for the horrid wrestling scene in the movie which actually aroused this hysteric feeling in me, that happens when a fight starts in real life, and which films very rarely manage to achieve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You've got it all, but you're a dead man, Harry Fabian"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is futile. Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark) has lived his whole life in the gutter, wasting his meagre savings on creative money-making schemes that always fall through, dreaming of a life of "ease and plenty," and dragging life-long sweetheart Mary Bristol (Gene Tierney) down into the black abyss with him. Eking out a modest existence through hard work and perseverance is no option for him. No, Harry Fabian dreams big. He reaches for the stars, and, when he falls short, inevitably and painfully comes crashing back to earth. This is film noir, and film noir doesn't look too kindly upon those who dream bigger than is good for them. Jules Dassin's 'Night and the City (1950)' was filmed in the squalid streets of London, and so appropriately represents the flip-side of the American Dream. Films like Sylvester Stallone's 'Rocky (1976)' gained popularity precisely because they showed that dedication and self-belief can make a hero of even the most humble of men. The British don't offer the optimism of their trans-Atlantic cousins ? here, success is reserved only for the corrupt.During the film, one character describes Fabian as "an artist without an art." He certainly possesses the determination to strike it big, but he wields his passion indiscriminately, stepping on the wrong people's toes and so sealing his demise. One gets the sense that he wants to make an honest living, but is nonetheless prepared to take dishonest shortcuts in order to fast-track his success. Yet even among the most powerful underground figures, success is no guarantee of happiness: bulging night-club owner Philip Nosseross (Francis L. Sullivan) loses his discontented wife, whose own impatience to break free from her husband's ownership inadvertently sacrifices any chances of financial stability. The sour wrestling promoter Kristo (Herbert Lom) loses the respect of his father, who is noble at heart but living hopelessly in the past. Only in the sad, betrayed eyes of Gene Tierney ? regrettably underused in this film ? does Dassin appear to find virtue, and so he offers her an alternative to the damned Fabian. Mary fittingly ends the film in the arms of an ordinary but dependable artist (Hugh Marlowe).Filmed on-location in London by cinematographer Max Greene, 'Night and the City' has an incredibly gritty, realistic immediacy. Too often, in American noir, it's only too clear that the characters are tramping through a studio-built set, in which one doesn't expect there to be any unpleasant surprises. Conversely, Dassin's decision to film in the shadowy city streets recreates that uncertain sense of dread one feels when trudging alone through an unfamiliar urban locale, exposed to the elements and whoever might happen to cross your path. The film was shot while Dassin was facing being blacklisted from Hollywood for his alleged affiliations with the Communist Party (he was betrayed to the HUAC by fellow noir directors Edward Dmytryk and Frank Tuttle), leading a nervous Darryl F. Zanuck to urge "shoot the expensive scenes first." The American likely took some stylistic inspiration from Carol Reed's 'Odd Man Out (1947)' and 'The Third Man (1949) ? both of which concern wanted men who are betrayed by those they thought close to them. Reed, in turn, probably took wrestling inspiration for his own 'A Kid for Two Farthings (1955).'Jules Dassin passed away on March 31, 2008, having re-established his directing career in Europe with the stellar heist movie, 'Rififi (1955).' Just one week earlier, star Richard Widmark also checked out, having lived a substantially fuller life than his on-screen persona. Widmark's manic performance is an interesting and multi-faceted one. Perfectly in tune with the character of Harry Fabian, nothing Widmark says sounds entirely convincing. There's always the slightest trace that he's bluffing ? feigning toughness or otherwise stalling for time. He really is like a kid with ADHD, bouncing about with too much energy to spare and no worthwhile endeavour in which to invest it. Fabian's doom is never in any doubt. The spectre of death hovers above him for most of the film, but he stubbornly refuses to relent from his final grab at "being a somebody." Like a dead man walking, he goes through the motions, still trying to convince himself that this time he can win. He doesn't deserve, and doesn't receive, any sense of nobility? even in death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well shot film noir with 1950's London locations - but the book's another story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another great edgy gangster performance from Richard Widmark, good cinematography especially atmospheric location shooting in London and pacy direction by Jules Dassin all make for a very watchable film.Yet as at least one other reviewer has remarked, the script is disappointing. The book on which this is based shares none of the pacyness of the film however what it offers, and is missing in the film, is both the depth of the characters as well as the coherence of the story.The author Kersh's skill was in building the Harry Fabian character - a nasty small time pimp and hustler who lives off the earnings of his trusting and loving "ho" girlfriend yet when he has a sudden need for extra money Harry is prepared to sell her outright for cash to a shadowy trafficker without her knowledge. Also in the book the essential point is that Harry is English not American. He is a low-rent denizen of London's Soho, compulsively making out to stranger and even to those who know him, that he is a big shot from the American Mob come over to look for business opportunities. Harry, the fantasist, derives his fantasies from the American gangster movies of the time - the book is set in 1936, their heyday. In truth he's just a sweaty little man in a coat with shoulders several sizes too big for him like his ideas and his talk. This time the big idea is wrestling promotion and with money he's taken from his woman as well as some blackmailed from one of her vulnerable clients he can, for a short while at least, flash the cash and fool the more gullible.The Harry of the book with his seediness, parasitic way of life, his fantasies and his paper-thin charm did not attract beautiful women (such as Jean Tierney in the film) or sharp worldly-wise gold-digging former hostess (the Googie Withers character). The Harry of the book is forever looking for a new "mark" - woman or man and forever trying to outrun the many hostages to Fortune he has created on the way. He knows and we know that at any moment the roof is bound to crash in.</fullReview>

Everything about the original was so much better and tighter than the remake. The acting, camera work, editing and writing have probably never been better anywhere, but most of all, the 1950 film has a tone of serious purpose and heightened realism that makes it both gripping drama and tragic social statement. The remake, by contrast, seems to be the typical ill-conceived star vehicle that so many failed movies since the 1980's have been, a free-for-all for the big names involved.

		<shortDescription>The city streets were dark with something other than night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent film noir, with Widmark in top form. The film opens with Widmark running down narrow London streets, and from there the film never loses it's frenetic energy. Widmark plays a guy who "wants to be somebody", always dreaming up new schemes to make him rich and a big shot. But he's really doomed from the beginning (lots of foreshadowing makes his eventual fate quite easy to predict) as one of life's losers. He scams his way into gaining a deal to manage a young wrestling star, but things spiral out of control in true noir fashion.Interesting that this archetypal film noir should be shot in the shadowy streets of London, when dark American streets were the movement's ancestral home. But, as with "The Killers" and "Out Of The Past", this is one of the defining noir films. Just look at the title. It pretty much encapsulates noir, with the film taking place predominantly at night and in an urban setting. Director Jules Dassin's London underbelly is a disturbing, fascinating world- in a way, it's almost Dickensian in tone. The cinematography and DVD transfer looks wonderful.While Widmark is awesome, the film is really given it's colour from the great supporting cast. Googie Withers is one woman who Widmark really shouldn't trust or mess with, but he does and with fatal consequences. Her morbidly obese husband, villainous but tragically in love with his no-good wife, is memorably played by Francis L Sullivan. Stanislaus Zbyszko is unforgettable as the proud Greco-Roman wrestling warrior, and Herbert Lom brilliantly underplays as his mafioso son. And, to make things even more noir, throw in Mike Mazurki as Strangler! Tierney unfortunately does not have much to do, with her faithful girlfriend role readily familiar (her role was actually added in by Dassin as a favour to Zanuck).An incredibly moody, sometimes grotesque and tragic noir piece that, while brutal, manages to fit in more than a few moments of touching sensitivity and human tragedy. Who can forget Lom's final scene with Zbyszko?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile film noir set in London.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently out on Criterion DVD, with a restored print, this is a very nice example of 1950s film noir, although when it was made the director, Jules Dassin, didn't even know there was a classification known as film noir. In fact, the DVD extras, which include a fairly recent interview with the aging Dassin is as captivating as is the movie itself. Back in the late 1940s when "blacklisting" was a reality, Dassin was essentially told, go to London quickly, make this movie quickly, it may be your last. He made "Night and the City" without ever reading the source material, the book, and the movie is apparently quite different. Two versions were made simultaneously, using the same source film, but with different musical composers and different film editors. The DVD extras contains excerpts to demonstrate some of the differences, including a drastically different ending. Good movie, worth a viewing for the acting of underrated Richard Widmark who plays Harry Fabian, an American post-war hustler in London. Fabian had big ideas of half-baked schemes and always was hitting up a friend for a hundred quid here, 300 quid there, to finance his latest get rich quick scheme. In the extras we learn that Gene Tierney was requested for the part of Fabian's girl Mary Bristol, because she was in a bad way after a recent romantic breakup, and according to Dassin "was suicidal." This movie helped bring her back to a good state. Googie Withers, an actress I had never heard of, is good as Helen Nosseross, married to the rich but disgusting Phil (Francis Sullivan) and just wanting to get a license for her own night spot and a chance to break away from her husband. She is forced to deal with Fabian, a decision that cost her dearly.Perhaps the most interesting actor is Stanislaus Zbyszko, one time "world's strongest man" from Poland, in 1949 living in New Jersey. Even though he was unexperienced, he gives a super performance as an old retired wrestler Gregorius the Great, who was grooming his son for a wrestling career. Mike Mazurki plays his nemesis, The Strangler.Although the story gets a bit complex in the various relationships, it simply distills into Fabian seeing an opportunity to contract Gregorius to feature a wrestling match that will allow Fabian, at least in his eyes, to "control" wrestling in London. But his various scams catch up with him and all does not turn out well, as is the case in a film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dassin masterfully crafts a dark vision of the London underworld. The film is an amazing snapshot of what post WWII London looked like as it was shot entirely on location. The first half of the movie might seem slow to some, but it picks up speed rapidly as the city seems to close in on the characters. This is the darkness of noir stripped of any romanticism. The film still feels fresh, a sense aided by Dassin's use of unconventional angles, distinctive visual compositions, and provocative lighting. Its technical brilliance combined with strong characters and a spiderweb of a plot make it a must-see.Jules Dassin was born in 1911 and is still alive and living in Greece. He worked in the early days of Hollywood until he was blacklisted and left the United States for work abroad. "Night and the City" is his last film he made before the blacklist. It is informed by the themes of betrayal and constant struggle, both of which were familiar to Dassin. Once you see "Night in the City," which I know you will because there is no good excuse not to, you will want to check out "Rififi," which broke his 5 year forced hiatus from film that followed his blacklisting. The film has similar themes, but less flawed anti-heroes. Both films can hold their own when compared to any noir classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widmark at his love-to-hate-him best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing him in "Kiss of Death" followed by "Road House," I didn't think he could get meaner, sleazier, and bleaker as does Richard Widmark's Harry Fabian character in "Night and the City." But he manages to do so, if only to keep apace with others as repellent in the same movie. In this one, Widmark manages a bit more roguish charm as he cheats just about everyone unfortunate enough to come into contact with him. No, he's not doing anything so sadistic as to push an old lady in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs. But he comes close to it by goading an old wrestler out of retirement where he safely needs to be so as to win a fortune gambling. When Fabian's scheme backfires and the old man dies in the ring, Harry must flee into the night as the old wrestler's gangster son takes revenge. As Harry seeks the help of every type of underworld denizen London has to offer to escape his pursuers, he learns whom his enemies and friends really are."Night and the City" is the fourth of Jules Dassin's Film Noirs after "Brute Force," the superb "Naked City," and the lesser- known "Thieves Highway," (along with this film, now out on DVD).The scene where the gangster's henchmen speed in a car through the night to spread word that Harry is dead meat is chilling and claustrophobic, as Harry's world slowly closes in on him. So very like murderer Ted De Corsia's futile flight up one of the Brooklyn Bridge's towers escaping an army of cops in hot pursuit from Dassin's "Naked City." We know De Corsia's going nowhere as we know the same thing about Harry.But as dawn follows night, Harry has one last trick up his sleeve.One final cheat remaining in his arsenal of weapons, much like the other Harry, surnamed Lime, when even the underground Vienna sewers fail HIM. Perhaps a final try at redemption will cleanse his soul? Widmark fans will eat this one up. Its got that snickering laugh of his that's a cross between a Peter Lorre chuckle and the sound a practical joker makes after giving you a hot foot! If you like this one, try getting hold of "O'Henry's Full House" and Sam Fuller's "Pick-up on South Street" for vintage Widmark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten: Engaging, Stylish, Tragic, Poetic. (The Lost Poem Of Noir)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Film Noir is only as good as its city is corrupt. Night and the City presents the darkest. A Film Noir is only as tender as its women are vicious. A Film Noir is only as poignant as its hero is perilous. Meet Harry Fabian. Many disregard the character as unlikable, but I like to think of him as the most easily accessible protagonist in all of Film Noir. Richard Widmark, in his Kiss Of Death best, gives a bold, honest, engaging and truly sympathetic performance. I think when most watch Film Noir, they forget all about empathy, to truly fall in love with Night and the City, you must first empathize with its hero. Have you ever been so desperate you'd do almost anything? I have. Have you ever been so deep in a hole that it could very well become your grave? I have. Have you ever loved someone so much that you'd do anything to give her world? I have. Have you ever wanted to be somebody. I have. Harry Fabian is the desperate Man immortal. He is the most insecure of all Noir heroes, and the most certain to fail. But we're here, we're with him on his long descent straight to hell. The film's uncanny pacing will make you feel completely helpless, like Fabian ultimately does, and since you are a part of the audience and you are thereby privileged with information kept from Fabian, you become aware of the tragedy that awaits him at the end of his descent, unlike our unfortunate hero, Harry Fabian. Night and the City was directed by the exceptional and overlooked true pioneer of Noir, Jules Dassin. Dassin made a few extremely serene pictures at the very height of Noir, his best was Night and the City. Made shortly before his exile during the Communist Witch Hunts of which he fell victim to in 1952, Night and the City is everything a Film Noir should be, and everything it could have been if the genre's longevity had been harnessed and controlled early on, and if his film wasn't so easily swept aside in its time. And with God as my witness, I profess! Night and the City is better than every movie that has ever been made since then, with the one exception of Alexander Mackendrick's 1957 magnum opus and testament of the cinema Sweet Smell Of Success. Night and the City is one of the greatest films ever made, and also one of the most forgotten. Quite like what we'd expect of Harry Fabian. The way that this film seems lost simply mirrors the themes that made the film so wonderful in the first place, all Harry Fabian wanted to do was to be somebody, to be remembered. Sadly, in both film and history, he never was. And that, that makes Night and the City poetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heck of a film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why the film starred a lot of Americans in a film set in London, I don't know, but I assume that because it was financed by Americans they demanded the likes of Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney in the movie. They were all wrong for the film but despite this miscasting the movie was exceptional from start to finish.Widmark stars as Harry Fabian--a small-time crook who is always scheming and failing. He's a total loser who always has an illegal or semi-legal plan to 'make it big'. The problem, however, is that practically everyone knows he's a two-bit loser--a punk who will never amount to anything. Well, when I say everyone, there actually is one glaring exception--Harry himself! Yet, despite having no chance to make it, Harry keeps trying--hoping against hope to be rich and respected...even though he is just a low-class rat. This character is really exciting to watch, as he's one of the weaseliest characters in film--and very interestingly portrayed.Part-way through the film, Harry hits on a scheme that might actually work this time. But, considering his track record, don't believe it! Through his usual lies and half-truths, he's met and ingratiated himself with an ex-professional wrestler who is looking for a match for his young protégé. Harry convinces them that he loves the sport and can arrange such a match--though he knows absolutely nothing about the business. Along the way towards this match, Harry rubs several people wrong and you assume sooner or later he'll get what's coming to him. What this is and whether or not it will be fatal is anyone's guess.While I don't want to give away any of the plot, the climactic wrestling scene is amazing--brutal, tension-filled and exciting. I found myself moving in my seat and tensing up during the match--it was so expertly done--and one of the best scenes I've watched in recent months in any film.The film, while not strictly film noir, is very, very noir-like due to the lovely direction (by Jules Dassin), cinematography, script and music. Perhaps some might just consider it noir--it has many of the proper elements and style. But, being made in the UK and not focused a on robbery or murder makes it hard to categorize as a prime example of the genre. Still, it was made so well--it would be a great film for young film makers to view to understand more about the basics of a great movie. Top-notch in every way.By the way, here are two final observations. First, Gene Tierney gets second billing but is barely in the film. Second, the old wrestler from Greece who fights the impromptu match near the end was about 71 in the scene!! That's amazing for a guy who should be way too old for that sort of exertion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark) is a small-time hustler with big-time aspirations. All he needs is that one big chance. Fate seems to be smiling his way when he meets a very famous Greek wrestler and his protégé. If he plays it just right, Fabian is convinced he can turn this chance meeting into a wad of cash and make himself the biggest wrestling promoter in England. Just as things are looking up, forces beyond his control and a series of inopportune events conspire to destroy Fabian's dreams. But at what price to Fabian and those around him? One word often used to describe film noir is "dark". Night and the City is as dark as they come. It's as dark and black as midnight. None of the characters comes out of this one unscathed. Not Fabian, not his girl, not his business partners, not his wrestlers, not the competing promoter, not the people he once hustled for ? No one! There is no "happily ever after" Hollywood-style ending to this movie. Every character with more than 30 seconds of screen-time ends up like damaged goods. But it's this nihilistic view that makes Night and the City so compelling. It's akin to watching a train wreck ? impossible to turn away.The acting in Night and the City is, for the most part, outstanding. Widmark, Herbert Lom, Hugh Marlowe, Mike Mazurki, Francis Sullivan, and Googie Withers are all tremendous. But the performance that really caught my eye was that of Stanislaus Zbyszko as the Greek wrestler Gregorius. Zbyszko was a wrestler ? not an actor. And the fact that his performance is as good as the trained and noted members of the cast is no small feat. Not only does he dominate his scenes physically, he more than holds his own when it comes to conveying emotion and feeling. It's truly an awesome performance.But as good as Night and the City is, it is not without faults. Two that standout are Gene Tierney and the film's runtime. Notice I wrote that the acting was good "for the most part". The exception is Tierney. She does absolutely nothing to distinguish herself. She's merely adequate. But, it's not like she had much to work with. I wonder why the money was spent to hire a "name" like Tierney and then so underutilize her talents? As for the runtime, the movie feels a little long. A tighter script that eliminated some of the extraneous "stuff" would have made the film even better to me. But then again, who am I to criticize the editing decisions made on a classic like Night and the City?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passionate Widmark in Choice Role!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his Tommy Udo in KISS OF DEATH (1947), this is Widmark's signature role as Harry Fabian in Post-War London with incredible B/W cinematography directed by Jules Dassin. Googie Withers is creepy and creepy-looking, Francis Sullivan is corrupt, as usual, and bovine. Gene Tierney has had better days, and Hugh Marlowe is a stiff. Herbert Lom is touchy and some one to watch out for, while Mike Mazurki threatens. This '50 Film Noir is incredible, on location in London, with some great low-lifes and left-handed business deals around the wrestling racket and whatever suits them at the time. One of the best of the 50's.A 9 out of 10. Best performance = Mr. Widmark. You won't soon forget this guy..always on the make..looking for the big score. The remake with Lange and DeNiro is tame and predictable, but not awful. If you've never seen Widmark before he played heroes and nice guys in uniforms, check this one. Great stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widmark Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night and the City (1950) *** (out of 4) Hard-hitting crime film has Richard Widmark playing Harry Fabian, a loser who is constantly getting himself in trouble by either owing money or hurting those closest to him like the girl (Gene Tierney) who loves him. Soon Harry comes up with a scheme to try and take over the underworld of wrestling but an accident leaves an entire mob and city after him. Widmark, in an excellent performance, gets top-billing but there's no question that the real star here is the cinematography by Mutz Greenbaum. The B&amp;W images are so incredibly strong here that they pretty much become their own character as the camera perfectly picks up this underworld full of gamblers, mobsters, drunken fools and hopeless dreamers like Harry. The cinematography is so strong here and director Dassin has no trouble at all building up a very rich atmosphere and it's almost as if you can smell the stink of the streets and you'll feel like a shower just to get all the smoke off of you. The story itself is pretty good because I'm sure everyone has come across a guy like Fabian so it's easy to see his tricks and enjoy his charisma but at the same time any sane person could see what a danger he was to himself. Widmark does a terrific job in the role because he's got a certain charm that you just have to fall for and at the same time he can be such a snake where you want to see something bad happen to him. The screenplay does a great job at really building up his character as we see his good and bad qualities and Widmark hits all the right notes with them. Tierney is excellent as well as his tortured girlfriend. Googie Withers, Herbert Lom, Hugh Marlowe and Francis L. Sullivan are all terrific as well. Back to the cinematography, the final scenes with Widmark running around London trying to escape are breathtakingly beautiful. We've seen countless chase scenes before and since this movie but the one here is a prime example of getting it done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Widmark Performance in Atmospheric Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jules Dassin takes to the grimy streets of London for this crime thriller about small-time American shyster Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark) and his attempts to join the ranks of the criminal elite.Harry is small fry, relegated to using his con man finesse to drive business to a local nightclub run by a man with whose wife Harry had a past fling. But he yearns for something bigger and works out a scheme that will enable him to corner the market on the London wrestling syndicate. Trouble is, there are a lot of interested parties who for one reason or another don't want Harry's plans to succeed. The character of Harry reminded me a lot of my ex-brother-in-law. He was always looking out for that next big deal, the one that was going to strike gold. To everyone else, it was obvious that if he put as much effort into plain old honest work as he did into trying to outsmart his way to the top, he would have the comfortable life he wanted. Harry is like that, and Richard Widmark plays him perfectly. There are a couple of interesting interviews with Jules Dassin on the Criterion Collection DVD release of this movie, and in one of them he says that he always thought Widmark was a terrific actor, but that audiences never really got to see that, partly because Widmark was content within the stereotyped confines he was placed in by Hollywood. Maybe the fact that he wasn't a huge star worked to his benefit here. He gets every nuance of Harry just right. It's a performance that expertly balances Harry's cockiness and belief that he truly is smarter than everyone else if he could just get the break, and the pathetic hopelesness of a born loser who's not as clever as he thinks he is and will never know it. Widmark really gets Harry, and is able to play him as a villain and a hero at the same time. As long as Dassin sticks to the male-dominated world of London's underbelly, he's on firm ground. His movies are always dripping in atmosphere, and this one is no exception. London lends itself very well to Dassin's stark black &amp; white compositions. And all of the testosterone comes to a boil in a shockingly violent scene in which two arch rival wrestlers go at each other like two dogs intent on tearing each other's throats out.But it's when Dassin turns his attention (or lack of it) to his female characters that the movie flounders. Googie Withers, playing Harry's old flame, threatens to walk away with the movie until her story comes to an abrupt end just when you think it's going to provide the movie with a juicy twist. She has all the trimmings of a true femme fatale, but Dassin does nothing with her. And one suspects that Gene Tierney is only in the film so that her name could appear on the movie posters. So overall Dassin gives us a clever story but one that feels oddly underdeveloped.One thing I really did appreciate about this movie was its downbeat ending. Any other movie from this time period would have tacked on some completely unrealistic redemption for Widmark in the last seconds, but Dassin refrains from doing that. The violence and pessimism serve to set this movie slightly apart from other Hollywood studio fare of the time, and make "Night and the City" a closer companion to the new wave films beginning to emerge from Europe, and to which Dassin himself would contribute "Rififi" five years later.Solidly crafted and well paced if not necessarily a masterpiece.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen the film?Then read the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asked what he thought of the filmed version of his epic crime novel"L.A.Confidential",James Ellroy commented"The book is mine,The movie is theirs".In fact the film,well made and enjoyable as it is,lacks the scope,the insight and the plain weirdness of the book.it would be imposssible to transfer the essence of "L.A. Confidential" the novel from it's original medium in any meaningful way because the story can only be read,not watched. The same applies to a greater extent to "Night and the city" a multi-layered novel by Gerald Kersh that has been stripped to minimalist noir by Jules Dassin and benefits from a frantically edgy performance as Harry Fabian by the Joe Pesci of his day,Richard Widmark. Kersh created a gallery of grotesques through which Fabian passes without leaving a trail.He is a venal contemptible creature with no redeeming features.He treats women abominably,pimping his way from one terminally stupid girl(the only sort that would have anything to do with him) to another. He is vain,cowardly,cold and cruel.He is not even a real American,he assumes the accent(not very convincingly)because women find it attractive.At the end of the novel you d i scover that his brother is a detective at Savile Row police station. Kersh(who had wrestled professionally himself)knew the seedy milieu where he set his novel and had great compassion for the broken creatures that occupied it. Fabian survives to appear in other works by Kersh. "Night and the city" the novel is a great picaresque masterpiece and was out of print for years until the de Niro movie came out . Kersh wrote other novels and many short stories set in the sub - sub underworld of London.Some,like "The song of the flea" and "Fowler'sEnd" influenced later London chroniclers like Michael Moorcock.Others like "The Angel and the Cuckoo" and "I got references" await rediscovery. Transferred from the medium of the imagination to the medium of the moving image,"Night and the city" stands up well as an entity on its own terms.London was never more threatening yet enticing.It's a damn fine film ,but,please,give the book a try.</fullReview>

I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if, by chance, he had, and did. There is no one in this film who leads a normal life, or for that matter cares for sunlight and fresh air. People live in small walk-ups or sleep in locker rooms. Richard Widmark spends a good deal of time running around London trying to promote fights, fleecing people when he can get away with it, and hollering at them when he can't. Gene Tierney is his girl, but is more drawn to sensitive painter Hugh Marlowe. Nightclubs, back alleys and fight arenas figure prominently in the story. There is an air of dirty foreignness in the picture, as if the real problem with London is that there are too many Americans and Greeks living there, plying their filthy trades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Widmark is my favorite actor but I loved the way every single actor in this film played their characters. Few were nice people but the film makes you understand why. I felt Harry Fabian needed Philip Nosseross's approval. How tragic that Harry's manipulations caused Philip to disapprove, to say the least. My favorite line from Harry was "All my life I've been running. From welfare officers, thugs, my father." I felt frustrated for Helen Nosseross because I think she would have been a successful nightclub owner. "I know how to make a club spin!" But, the ruses these people employ to succeed guarantee, instead, failure. At the end of the film, you even have to wonder how long Molly, the flower seller/cleaning lady, will be happy. Another feature of the film I liked was the noir lighting. I loved the play of the shadows on the ceiling of Nosseross's office when he was calling to Mary and speaking with Helen later. For all his success, he was feeling trapped, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely classic film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This very good and very influential film noir has been issued by Criterion in a remastered edition which well conveys the stark, expressionistic, brooding black and white cinematography. It stars Richard Widmark, in what many consider his best role, as a small-time hustler in London who, in trying to become a big shot in the underworld, weaves a destructive and ironic web around himself like a character in a Greek tragedy by trying to take over London's wrestling promotions. The acting in all supporting roles ranges from good to excellent, but the real star of the film is the London itself -- a bleak, grimy, angular underworld which is the opposite of the elegant or quaint London featured in so many films. Some critics have compared it to the landscape of bombed out Vienna in The Third Man, another expressionistic noir film about an American trapping himself in the decadence of a destroyed Europe. Night and the City also features what is probably the most gripping wrestling match ever put on film. Both great entertainment and a key film in the history of the noir genre, this can be recommended to everyone. Advisories: none in particular, though there are some adult situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was either ahead of its time, or today's copycat films are way behind. Director Jules Dassin, one of the 'born in the USA' crew was hunted out of his homeland by his own contemporaries for 'comunistic' political leanings. Here we see him at work in the UK and angry at everyone.In 'city' he's working with Screenwriter and fellow American Jo Eisinger. Eisinger tends to excel writing about psychologically driven characters and 9 yrs later would co-write the screenplay for the rare (possibly now lost) but worth looking for German film "As The Sea Rages" Berlin born Director of Photography Max Green (Thunder Rock '42 - Hatters Castle '42) has, under direction of Dassin, created what ranks as one of the most visually striking 'Noir' films to date. It would be interesting to know who called what shot as there are many classic Dassin stylistic touches throughout this collaboration.It's just a pity the characters don't hold more interest. Peopled with 98% despots, has beens, and morally bankrupt no-hoper's, there's no-one to identify with unless you fit into the same crowd. The revealing German title: "The Rat of Soho" summed it all up aptly! The only halfway decent character is played by Gene Tierney, then even she works for the super shady 'Silver Fox' establishment. Ms Tierney's role is a token part but she's very good with it and her character is integral to story. This is possibly the role Richard Widmark was born for (even though he may have been wanting better characters to play) as Harry Fabian he is practically the whole show, and unfortunately in Hollywood when you're this good at being bad, your stuck with it!Exeptionaly good also, are the many strong British players that pepper this grueling watch. There seems to be a marked absence of the British 'Bobby on the beat' or other Law officers (even though everyone seems to be constantly running through the cities streets) perhaps, this aspect gives a misrepresentation of Britain at the time.Starting right from the opening of the 20th Century Fox trademark (minus the famous fanfare) the music commands your attention with powerful orchestral statements complete with Bells. This to me sounded like it could have been a remnant of the British version with its score written by Benjamin Frankel (Frankel did a similar thing under the Columbia trade mark of his '55 film "The End Of The Affar" to equally dramatic effect) The score then tends to change to what could be a more up tempo piece by Franze Waxman, composed for the American release. It's fairly obvious the descriptive incidental music by Waxman had set the tone for several other film score composers who followed during the latter 50's - 70's. The British version has been restored by the B.F.I. and would make for interesting viewing at 6mins longer. Much lauded 'modern' film makers such as Scorsese, Tarantino, among others throughout the world, grew up on these films and are constantly copying this, and other similar works, but they too have dumbed down the genre with flashy techniques, ultra gore and crude language to hide the fact they are often working with empty characters, below average scripts and situations, leaving little doubt that their possible intentions are simply to glorify ugliness because they sadly enjoy it.'City' is seductively good to look at, while it may not be completely satisfying to some, 'Moderns' may have more chance of enjoyment because they may have had little else to compare it with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a 1950 film with a title like "Night and the City", I was really expecting more in the way of the noir genre than what the picture delivers. It has some of those elements to be sure, but the story is set in London, and the idea that it veers off into pro wrestling territory seemed a bit bizarre to me. Since it did however, I was genuinely surprised to see an old time wrestling great featured prominently in the picture, Stanislaus Zbyszko. Zbyszko was a genuine mat star in the pre-TV era and a world champion who's name was highly regarded by fans the world over. He doesn't appear that imposing in the movie, but he was seventy one at the time and could still get pretty physical when he had to, as in the wrestling scene with Mike Mazurki. Pretty cool for that reason alone.The role of confidence man seems made to order for someone like Richard Widmark. He revives that sly Tommy Udo cackle from "Kiss of Death" in his characterization of Harry Fabian, the slick talking self-promoter who never misses a chance to hit up anyone in his vicinity for a quick loan on the way to his next big score. In his wake he leaves pretty girlfriend Mary as a bystander in his schemes, notably absent for most of the picture even though Gene Tierney is second billed right behind Widmark.It's the unintended consequences of Harry's haphazard plan to corner the London wrestling scene that keeps this film anchored with one foot in noir territory. It seems Harry's always on the run from one desperate situation to another, and when he crosses Herbert Lom's Kristo character by manipulating the father (Zbyszko), he sets himself up for a final dangerous confrontation. Through it all, Mary remains loyal, even though she had every reason not to be.Say, stay attentive and you'll catch that neat movie marquee that promotes "Escape Me Never" with Errol Flynn, Ida Lupino and Eleanor Parker. I'd be curious how Twentieth Century Fox managed to plug a Warner Brothers flick in one of their pictures but it was probably inadvertent. I think it's neat to catch stuff like that in old films; it makes watching them even more enjoyable.You know, I had a thought about the casting after this was over. Mike Mazurki did a pretty effective job as the Kristo henchman and pro wrestler Strangler in the picture. Back in Stanislaus Zbyszko's heyday there was another champion grappler by the name of Ed 'Strangler' Lewis. I'm not sure if they ever wrestled each other although it would have been likely since they were contemporaries. It would have been cool to see Zbyszko against the 'real' Strangler here; I wonder if anyone thought of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, in my book any guy preferring top-of-the-wrestling-world to, uh well, snuggling up with the luscious Gene Tierney deserves a rotten fate-- which is what Fabian (Widmark) gets, but only after he's seen the error of his ways (at daybreak, no less). Too bad, but then he's had his chance, and this is classic noir. I love all those great faces, hardly the usual Hollywood types?Sullivan, Zybyszko, Mazurki, Reeve. Naturally noir ace Jules Dassin frames them in grotesque close-up whenever he can. There's atmosphere galore and enough iconic camera set-ups to fill a textbook. In fact, it's almost a lunar landscape Fabian must cross in his race against death.No wonder the estimable Dassin got blacklisted. Here, as in Thieves Highway (1949), a slice of capitalism comes across as a twilight jungle where no one can be trusted. Just tick off the number of deceptions among its scheming denizens, all defending their individual turf. We're certainly not rooting for the slimy entrepreneur Fabian to succeed. Sure, as he likes to brag, he's got what it takes?brains, guts, gab. We see that. But he's too clever by half, and it's sort of satisfying to watch the web of machinations finally close around him. In fact, everyone ends up frustrated, defeated, or dead in this, one of the bleaker screenplays of the noir period where no one gets what they want.Nevertheless, whose burst of inspiration was it to sign up the exotic Zybyszko as Gregorius. That bullet head on top a fire-hydrant body is the heart and soul of the movie. For a non- professional actor, his big scene remains uncommonly moving. I suppose it's only logical the movie's one idealist should pay the price of his ideals. But whatever the logic, his epic tussle with the Strangler (Mazurki) remains an oddly memorable one. Anyway, it's to Widmark's credit that he takes on such a sleazy role. I'm just sorry that one of the proved masters of the genre could only continue his art by moving to France. Still and all, the film stands as a classic tribute to everyone involved, regardless of politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Frantic Pursuit Of The Unattainable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night And The City" is an enthralling movie which tells a story of ambition, futility and despair in a manner which is completely uncompromising and unsentimental. Nocturnal London is portrayed as a grim and threatening environment with a labyrinthine underworld which is populated by characters who are almost all preoccupied only with manipulating matters to their own advantage. The depiction of the underworld is incredibly solipsistic and this adds great intensity to everything that happens within its confines and also makes its kingpins seem so powerful that they're totally unconstrained by any concerns about the consequences of their actions.Director Jules Dassin had been a member of the communist party and was subsequently blacklisted in Hollywood. In view of his political sympathies and the obvious analogy between the activities of the underworld and the workings of business generally, it's easy to understand how he would've regarded the levels of corruption and duplicity portrayed in this movie as being entirely appropriate.Richard Widmark gives a remarkable performance as Harry Fabian, a small time hustler who works as a tout for a clip joint but also harbours dreams of making the big time. All his "get rich quick" schemes have previously failed but when he sees an opportunity to become a promoter of major wrestling matches, he starts to feel that his luck has changed and that he's on the brink of being a success at last.His opportunity arose because of a dispute between London's main wrestling promoter, Kristo (Herbert Lom) and his father Gregorious (Stanislaus Zbyszko) who'd been a great champion of the Greco-Roman style of wrestling. Gregorious had criticised the types of bouts that Kristo had been promoting and Fabian had stepped in to offer to stage Greco-Roman matches with Gregorious becoming a partner in his business.Fabian finances his activities by borrowing from his employer Phil Nosseross (Francis L Sullivan) and also, in a separate deal, by borrowing from his employer's wife Helen (Googie Withers). Helen finds her husband repulsive, has designs on Fabian and also wants to make a new start by running her own club.Fabian initially feels able to brush off the threats made against him by Kristo because of his partnership with Gregorious and Kristo's great love and respect for his father. Later however, after being betrayed by Phil and Gregorious dying after a spontaneous and futile wrestling match, Fabian has no trump card left and this leads to his inevitable, tragic and brutal demise.Widmark gives a masterful portrayal as a dreamer who Phil Nosseross describes as having a "highly inflamed imagination coupled with delusions of grandeur". Throughout the story Fabian is always on the move, frantically chasing from one negotiation to the next and looking either hysterically excited when he thinks he's making good progress or seriously agitated and anxious when things become difficult.Gene Tierney brings genuine sadness to her role as Fabian's fiancée Mary Bristol, who conveys her frustration about "waiting for a day when we can marry and lead decent normal lives". She shows Fabian an old photograph of them looking very conventionally dressed and wistfully reminisces about the plans they'd made and the type of life that they were going to live together. Throughout their relationship, she hangs on to her dreams although she knows her perseverance is futile because he's driven solely by his ambition and is regularly ready to steal from her whenever the need arises.The rich array of characters in "Night And The City" are brought to life quite powerfully by the consistently good performances of the rest of the cast and the bleakness and seediness of its locations are stylishly enhanced by the use of some wonderful expressionistic cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many other posts here describe the film and its plot. I would suggest that after you watch this you watch the 1992 remake of this movie with Robert DeNiro and Jessica Lange. They combined the two major women in the film, which made a lot of sense plot-wise, and used boxing instead of wrestling. But Jack Warden's boxer in the remake cannot compare with Stanislaus Zybysko in the original - and Mike Mazurki's Strangler is more of a character than the guy in the remake who I don't think was even named. The black and white original towers over the remake in so many ways including cinematography, depth of characters (compare the two "phils" in the movies), direction, and musical score. This 1950 movie is a classic that will be enjoyed 100 years from now. The only part of the film that didn't ring true for me was leaving Strangler in the gym, drinking, while Gregorio and his son worked out. It would have been more believable if Strangler entered drunk after the contract was signed, was obnoxious, and then the fight began. But that's a minor point of complaint for this great script and great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a searing and gorgeous noir allegory about how little people screw up their lives hopelessly scrounging for money and respectability in the shadow of the big men. You'd figure such themes would prime a director for Edward Dymytryk's pointy little finger; but the rhetoric is so perfectly embedded in the craft that you don't need to think about it to appreciate it. Richard Widmark stars as an explosively energetic, outrageously unsympathetic scam artist, and when he's not on the run he's coiled to the breaking point. After finagling $400 from a high-society blowhard and his conniving wife, he inserts himself into a father-son wrestling league feud, and thinks he's got it made, but as usual he's in over his head. While he is directly undone by the overlings' controlling machinations, it is very clear on the surface that his enterprise would have failed anyway, which makes the outcome even more tragic and pointless. Ex-girlfriend Gene Tierney clings to her dogged trust so far beyond reason that she is even more pathetic than Widmark; she keeps offering him money even after she walks in on him robbing her. Even more moving, though, is young wrestling impresario Herbert Lom at his father's deathbed; the silent, vengeful glower that takes over as he rises from his moment of grief says more than I can convey. This is an amazingly controlled movie, brilliantly cast and composed, demanding and rewarding your rapt attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent noir set amidst a war torn but recovering London in 1950. Fantastic black and white cinematography brings to life the swirling city of light and shade, fog and night. Whole expanses of the city are still recognisable as Richard Widmark scrambles hither and thither to make one more deal, one big one, the last one. With a background of sleazy nightclubs and the even more sleazy world of wrestling a very fast paced tale is told. We never have quite as much confidence as does our hero that all will be well but the film barely pauses and what might have been a rather tedious few minutes in the middle when we have a major wrestle we are instead gob smacked at the ferocity and tension before us. The two main protagonists were apparently once wrestlers for real and it certainly shows in a magnificent brawl of a scene that has you wincing from beginning to end. Everyone performs well and whilst this would be worth it just for the London night scenes, this is much more and as my DVD sleeve notes put it; '?is a baroque masterpiece of corruption, paranoia and doom' and I can't argue with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Riveting, Rare Break of the Mold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the vein of various a film noir, Jules Dassin's potent thriller begins with "night and the city," and a man in a suit running from unseen assailants. However, the most interesting thing about this story is that it has not much in the region of an actual "hero" and a hefty sense of a humor. Some directors of noir capture the gloomy underbelly of life's surface, which to them is flimsy and of no consequence, and some of them are hardly successful because they simply do not see past the surface, which they accept. With Night and the City, Dassin aggregates both the beautiful surface and its subterranean drabness and dishonesty by extracting sincere humor from seedy situations and having no fear of leaving the audience without a gift-wrapped manner of gratification.This is the story of a duplicitous hustler played by Richard Widmark who dreams of the good life only by means of money. He's tried every go-nowhere get-rick-quick scheme but he has what he believes is a chance of a lifetime, planning to take control of the professional wrestling game from a Greek promoter and underworld boss, played by Herbert Lom, by manipulating him through his father, the retired wrestling superstar played by the hulking Stanislaus Zbyszko.Even if this is a film full up with excellent acting, particularly from a knowing, dry performance by Francis L. Sullivan, and stunning moments, the very most memorable of which is one of the greatest fights on film, there are in actuality only three leading lights, and they are Richard Widmark and the title characters, Night and the City. Widmark is all flash and connivance, a lean and ravenous double-dealer, passionate about this lifestyle to which he aspires. Dassin gives the impression of having a parallel appetite, this being his first film upon leaving the US following his victimhood before the House Unamerican Activities Committee. Each setting and site is on location, and hums with it, and it wants you to feel it, and you do, from the overcrowded brick cellar nightclubs to the complex alleys, from the intense illumination of Piccadilly to the river's docks cloaked in a film of fog, this is a long way from the nonspecific urbansville so ordinary in 1940s and '50s gangster pictures and the wax phoniness of film noir's California or Nevada desert or small town sets.At the same time as the story is shifty and the high point drenched in melancholy, this is a long way from a cheerless movie. Stridently written, shot with crystal clear distinctiveness, this is the rare break of the mold that takes home its appreciation not by boasting its impressive ambition but by exacting them with genuine self-assurance, the same means by which Dassin achieved his America-free masterpiece, Rififi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Baroque Mural with Frenetic Energy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night and the city. The city: London. The night is tonight, tomorrow night, any night." This is the opening line from Jules Dassin's "Night and the City" (1950) and, in fact, works as an excellent summary of the film-noir philosophy and the director's desolate yet honest pessimism which shaped the genre. However, as it is an extremely dark film, it's still very nice to look at because it's one of the most stylish film- noirs ever made. It's a perfect place to begin studying the genre since it presents the stylistics of film-noir as seen through a dim glass. The film begins with the protagonist, Harry Fabian, a desperate man who wants to make it big, running in the streets of the night. He is constantly on the run and, as a matter of fact, later on refers to his whole life as "running away" from something. His girlfriend tries to help him to settle down, and his neighbor characterizes him as "an artist without an art." He's a tortured soul who wants to be somebody. Although it seems that Harry ruthlessly exploits other people and is only seeking for a quick way to get rich, one can't blame him for wanting to make it big: since money really is the only form of happiness the world has ever taught him. In such a cold world even love is hard to be accepted as it is. All in all, Harry is in pursuit of a good life -- nothing more.Cynic misanthropy is the word one wants to use to describe Dassin's world view in the film. All the people lie, cheat and only seem to think of their own benefit. This bleak milieu, which is also veritably social, exhales aggressive steam while power -- an abstract force -- strangles its residents in an unforgiving grip. The kings of this world are those who cheat, but not all crooks succeed for one also needs luck. Businessmen sit in their lonely cabinets and don't really differ from common criminals. Nonetheless, they too have their own sorrows to carry: a bored wife or a dying father. Hence, the line between good and evil is never clear to Dassin. In fact, the anti-heroic protagonist isn't really that unpleasant or even bad. He lies to everybody for his own benefit, but we do not hate him. Perhaps Dassin and all of us truly relate to him and his creation of deception which slowly begins to collapse. Perhaps we see that anything that is human can't be completely alien to us.In "Night and the City" Dassin takes the style of his American films to its most perfect and brutal form which emerges to us as an extraordinary combination of strong neo-realism (Visconti) and poetic, dream-like (Hitchcock) atmosphere. The starkly precise composition and the dim lighting create a baroque look which is associated with the film's flamboyant themes of doom, vengeance and deception. Heavy contrasts of light and darkness, reflecting moral ambiguity, are present in each shot relaying a sensation of chaotic chance. How each moment can lead to a disaster; how anyone can turn into a cold-blooded beast at any second. Change is a perpetual flow, but the space remains: circumstances change, but the individual has no power whatsoever. He lies in the hands of others. He can't keep up with the run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't heartily recommend this noir, but what do I know. I'm just a reviewer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to sound pretentious and say that there are two kinds of people who judge and analyze movies: critics and reviewers. A critic is someone highly educated on the matter, an individual who may hold several pertinent degrees and who will judge a film mainly for its artistic value, regardless of having to consider at the same time the possibility that not even 00.1% of the general population may be interested in watching it. A reviewer, on the other hand, is someone with a more or less average degree of film education who'll try to put together both ends, providing a verdict about the general "watch-ability" of a flick while trying at the same time not to neglect its artistic value. I consider myself a reviewer and that's why I usually give a basic 7/10 to movies that I consider entertaining enough to recommend to anyone--like Anchorman for ex., not precisely an art house regular but one which most people will enjoy watching simply because it's funny. Another one that comes to mind is Stalker, about which critics rave but which I don't consider of any interest for the average viewer. Why I'm saying all this? Because NATC provides the best ex. of a great piece of cinema that will never reach a wide audience because, despite its indisputable artistic merits, it contains flaws that will make it forever a film only for the noir aficionado; the first one of these flaws being the lack of what I would call a "hook". And what's a hook?.See, being the noir genre a very formulaic one?-where everyone and their dog end up dead, in prison, broke, on the lam or at least sad &amp; lonely?each noir has to offer something different, original, to make the general viewer forget that deja vu feeling. Two examples illustrate this well, the best one being Panic In The Streets. Here the bad guy is not a human but a lethal germ which some criminals on the lam are carrying and who Dr. Widmark has just 48 hr. to locate and neutralize. Talk about not one but two hooks! Where The Sidewalk Ends has, as a hook, the cop himself being the son of a gangster; and also he having to conceal his killing of a suspect. Again, not one but two hooks. Maybe now you'll understand why NATC is so "underrated" and why has never reached a wider audience: because it got no hook! (even critics recognize that when stating that, from the very first shots we know that Fabian will be dead by the movie's end). One reviewer offered a different POV that leads anyway to the same conclusion, when writing that the problems of these characters do not come from fate, bad luck, but as the logical consequence of their own personal flaws. We can go even further in the deconstruction and say that there is absolutely nobody here, men, woman, who is being forced to stay in their situation. All of them are free to walk at any moment out of their bad relationships, deals, which is the best way to detect a loose plot. Already we got two flaws and that's only the beginning. Fact is, despite NATC being a great piece of cinematography it lacks what's needed to keep you on the edge of your seat: the underlying tension, the expectations for the shocking or the unlikely to happen. For ex. compare the situation of the two good people here, Gregorious and Mary--who could have walked at any time out of their problems--with that of the characters in the noirs I mentioned, none of which had any choice but to face the situation they were in. That's what makes of these pretty exciting movies to watch while NATC is not. As the reviewer said, you cannot relate to people who are in a mess of their own doing--and from which they can extricate at any time, I'll add. NATC has no real pathos, not Damocles' sword hanging over the head of the characters, except of course that put there by their own greed, loyalty or disloyalty, stupidity, etc. Harry is pathetic, yes, but we don't truly care for him and we can sit back and marvel at his capacity to poison everything he touches. The only one nearly producing some kind of pathos is Gregorious, with his undying passion for Greco-Roman wrestling.As I have neglected about the plot, let's simply say that it's about (very) small time hustler Harry Fabian, U.S. expatriate in London in the early 1950s, who's always concocting ways to swindle people and who finally thinks he got the break of his life when a former wrestler?Gregorious-?comes his way, giving him the opportunity to start a career as a promoter. But money is needed and it is trying to get this money that Harry manages to ruin the life of everyone around him, including his own. As I said, the lack of tension comes from the fact of Harry being a highly unlikable character--I don't know where critic(s) got the idea of him being touching or likable--and that we know from the beginning that he won't outlast the movie. So, while the cinematography is very good, there's little meat for those viewers who use to silently whisper to filmmakers, when sitting to watch their flicks: "Surprise me". There are some good scenes, though, the best one showing an intense wrestling match between Zbyszko's Gregorious and Mazurki's Strangler and then the old fighter, who had spent all his energies in winning it, dying on his son's arms. They both make for the most climactic part in the movie. In all, recommend only if you are really into noir. I say 6.5/10, but make it a 7/10 if you really consider Gregorious' passion for traditional wrestling a hook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark) is the character central that fills completely the film, is a typical opportunist who survives as sensor to commission of customers for nightclubs. Accustomed to function in the low funds in London in 1948, his only concern is the money and power with a ambition. The world of underworld that surrounds it is ruthless, being his girlfriend Mary the only character that shows a bit of kindness. In its attempt to achieve a coup fortune, wrapped in a wheel of deception to all around him. This ends with a persecution magnificently filmed, with all its rawness. It is one of the best films of noir cinema, at least of which i have seen. Its director Jeles Dassin performs a masterpiece in this film. The music of Franz Waxman is a great effectiveness that highlights the emotion of many scenes The photography is one of the aspects that i liked, has some frames magnificent, with light and shade of a great beauty, that show in some scenes an entire description visual of the script. The interpretation of Richard Widmark is exceptional, the best of his career without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In NIGHT AND THE CITY, Richard Widmark plays a petty, sulking, sneering, scheming grifter named Harry Fabian who, as Hugh Marlowe points out in the movie, is "an artist without an art." As the very dangerous criminal kingpin Kristo (Herbert Lom) warns: "Born a hustler, you'll DIE a hustler." Fabian proceeds to weasel his way into promoting professional wrestling; not exactly standard fare for your upper-class films noir, but so beautifully directed by Jules Dassin that it doesn't really matter WHAT the storyline's about. Mike Mazurki as "Strangler" comes dangerously close to stealing the show (NIGHT AND THE CITY is nothing if not a showcase for this VERY underrated performer), especially since Widmark often comes across as little more than a petulant child, but, by the end, Widmark's hitting on all four cylinders and the end is absolutely fantastic. (Gene Tierney is also outstanding as Widmark's long-suffering enabler.) One of the Great Ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film with tremendous desperation throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film started and I saw it was based in London I was a little disappointed because I had looked at the cast list and so on and had assumed it was an American noir ? so I wasn't really in the mood to see Britain try to get in on the genre act. Of course anyone who has seen this film will tell you what a foolish statement that is, since this film is fairly brutal and deserves to be held up as a great example of the genre regardless of what city it is set in. The plot revolves around the simple world of wrestling and on the face of it is pretty small beer ? Fabian, like most of the characters, has the sort of aspirations of all lower tier hustlers and while ambitious, his goals are not really those to lift him high from his current status. He believes he can make it though and even as he ducks and dives in the sewer, he convinces himself that if he just keeps doing it then things will work for him. Wrestling may be the backdrop but it is this very grimy stage that the film is really set.This links to what the film does best ? desperation. The sense of characters going beyond frustration into desperation and despair is really well portrayed here. It is of course most evident in Fabien but few characters are at the top of the tree or even within reach of it and most things are a compromise or deal in one form or another. This plays out really well as a theme but also drives the narrative as things unravel and characters all try clutching at the straws for themselves even though it makes things unravel all the quicker. The story is engaging from the exciting start through to the strong ending (the likes of which I always appreciate in these films).The acting is strong and although there is a lead character it is an ensemble piece. Widmark really convinces ? when he is terrified he is great but when he is upbeat and playing his game he still manages to do it with the scene of cheap desperation which is incredibly realistic and engaging. Lom is menacing but humanized and helped by a great turn from Zbyszko. Support from Tierney, Mazurki, Sullivan is all very good and I loved the needy but manipulative turn from Googie Withers as a woman who just about still has it but also knows she won't for long ? again her desperation is in a different form from Widmark's but it is just as well done. The delivery of all this is really good. The sets are compact, dirty and dark but also very clear and well lit so we see what we need but are not on a soundstage. Use of locations also helps set the scene and Dassin' direction of the camera is as good as that of his cast.A very strong film indeed and one I really enjoyed for how convincingly gritty and downbeat it was. I could smell the gym throughout and it matched the sense of desperate grabbing and frustration which oozes from every frame. Really worth seeing ? not just as a genre film but as an all round great package.</fullReview>

You can believe him in the role, it's an oddly likable turn by 'the White Rat' despite playing a low-life amidst other lowlives.Tragedy abounds-Francis L Sullivan kills himself at the end, his ex-leaves him, comes back, finds herself outta prospects, Gene Tierney has lost the love of her life, 'Gregorious' is dead, Lom as his son(!) prob. is going to be nabbed by the bobbies for all this, etc.I really enjoyed the scene in the old mill/factory where Widmark struck the guy w/ the knife, the long wrestling scene-brutal-and the whole noire look of this. Great great stuff.***1/2 outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steppin' out with a spiv</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I met my first "spiv" in NIGHT AND THE CITY, the story of small-time grifter cum "promoter" Harry Fabian and the unfortunate people in his desperate orbit. Richard Widmark's hyper hustler and the shadowy London nightworld are the real stars with excellent support all the way around, from the cinematography to Googie Withers as an old flame who eventually gets burned. I knew nothing about the movie going in and almost immediately felt a profound foreboding, a sense of doom even, but since losers like Harry are inevitably hoisted by their own petard, I didn't see a fatalistic noir universe so much as a very black amour fou; Harry in love with his dream, Gene and Googie wild about Harry, and, of course, Googie's gaga husband were all stung by the blindness love caused. I've always found the dark side of romance very satisfying subject matter and could have done without the Hugh Marlowe character's hope for Gene Tierney's future. That sop is no doubt there to relieve the relentlessness and give hope -but who wants that? 10/10, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here Is That Fame You Wanted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:My favorite Noir and dark as midnight. Want to understand Fabian in one tiny scene? Watch the nameplate he bought for his desk; he is Atlas lifting the earth. Yes, inferiority is driving a nuclear reactor of ambition. From Mary's exasperated expression, we gather that this is another in mountainous pile of failed schemes that transpired before the movie. Yet, this time Harry will be quite famous right before he is killed by the Strangler. Yes, all of London is searching for him to kill him for the bounty Cristo put on his head. His doom is worthy of the Bard; such a series of seemingly disconnected events. The bar owner's evil revenge for Harry fooling around with his wife is to point Fabian at the Strangler. Who will ever forget that prescient curse he pronounces at Harry,"Harry, you have it all but you are a dead man." He knew that Gregorious' gross obesity could never tolerate conflict with The Strangler. It was a piece of pure malevolence on his part to pay, a little too sneaky Harry, for consorting with his wife. Yet, like the Bard, a concatenation of events destroy Harry right before his very eyes. The Strangler hurts Gregorious' sons wrist, mocks Gregorius and the deadly battle ensues. Everyone tries to stop it but once these two titans collide, forget about it, nobody is getting them apart. Watch the horror on Harry's face, he senses his doom coming. His cruelty towards Mary in stealing her money, after knocking her about, is going to get the jackass the fame he craved: Infamy. The movie is very evocative of Stephen Crane's great short story The Blue Hotel where the Swede, having read too much pulp fiction, is convinced that he is going to be killed in this western bar. He acts upon the world until he brings it on himself. Here, Harry plays with dangerous forces like Gregorious' deadly, dangerous gangster son Cristo. Everyone tries to warn Fabian but his inferiority has filled his cranium with delusions of his great Machiavellian genius. Want to see a movie that personifies the phrase: no escape from the fate that you make? This is that movie. In quintessential Noir fashion, Harry brings about his own annihilation. He gets his dream: FAME. Was it everything you hoped for Harry?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're A dead Man Harry Fabian.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.K. kiddies The Monkey has a terrific one for you today. It is a superb late Film Noir from England called Night And The City. Now, part of the reason The Monkey is such a bastard half the time, is because he watches way too much Noir. I mean here is a genre that screams ' it does not matter what you do, because you're screwed anyway' with a super happy fun-time sub-theme of, the harder you try to claw your way out, the further back you will find yourself.Night And The City is directed by the masterful Jules Dassin, who also directed the equally impressive noir The Naked City as well as two of the originators of the heist genre, Riffi and Topkapi. Dassin was blacklisted while he was shooting Night And The City, and let me tell you any person that is held suspect by THE MAN is my kind of people.Night And The City is about a two-bit bar hustler named Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark, my favorite Noir actor), who stumbles upon a plan to corner the market in wrestling. Unlike his numerous other schemes, this one just may work. Arrayed against him are the principal mobster in London Kristo (the appropriately shady Herbert Lom), Fabian's lover Helen Nosseros (Googie Withers), and his business partner (and Helen's husband) Philip Nosseross.One of the highlights of Night And The City is the cinematography. Unlike many Noirs where low-key light is simply a method representative of film noir, and the city is its setting, Night And The City imbues them with a living palpable menace. The darkness is not just a lack of light, but instead comes from the dark souls of those with whom Fabian has surrounded himself. The darkness shrouds the many dangers of Fabians own dark and exploitative nature. It also hides the assassins after Fabian, more than it hides him. It is in the darkness that Harry drags himself, and all those around him, to their inevitable demise.In other Noirs, there is often the false belief that protagonist can get ahead if he just leaves the city. Often they do, and their deeds follow them. In Night And The City, there is no such hope for Fabian. London is his prison, and its tenement's and towers only force him onward, onward, in his mad dash towards his hoped for impossible escape from the city. These hopes of escaping across the Thames by boat or by bridge are thwarted by the opportunistic waterfront thieves and swindlers he had once called his friends, the bridges guarded by thugs in the employ of Kristo.Night And The City also makes a fun drinking game. The rules are easy, every time someone uses a derivative of the phrase "You're a dead man" to Fabian you take a drink. Now The Monkey can't recommend this as you are likely to pass out long before the conclusion of the film. That is unless of course getting blind stinking drunk is your goal. Whatever your plan may be, I urge you to watch this movie as soon as you can. If nothing else, it will make all of your troubles seem trivial compared to those of Harry Fabian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great except for script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widmark gives one of his best performances as a con man trying to survive in the London underworld. Zbyszko, who was an actual professional wrestler, is quite touching as a famous wrestler from yesteryear. In a role far removed from the Pink Panther movies, Lom plays a sinister wrestling promoter. Tierney has a very small role and seems to have been added to the cast as an afterthought for her marquee value. Sullivan and Withers round out the good cast. Dassin creates a terrific film noir atmosphere, greatly aided by a lively score by Franz Waxman. With all this going for it, however, the film is letdown by a lame, uninteresting script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A striking film (as Dassin's work usually is) -- but for whatever reason one that I just don't see myself taking to heart. It tells the story of a greedy ambitions petty criminal (Richard Widmark) well, but not in such a way that it offers much to anyone who might not feel they have anything in common with Widmark's character. It's basically a slice of a life that I'm glad I'm not living.There's some very solid character work here, especially Widmark's. It's a tribute to his great skill that he's able to make such an unappealing person -- a character we first meet rustling through his girlfriend's purse -- interesting and compelling enough to watch for the entire film. Widmark was truly a master at making predictable plot points and character choices seem completely spontaneous and fresh. Lom's work as the established wrestling kingpin of London, Kristo, is also impressive; he must be both a symbol of menace to the protagonist as well as a source of much of the film's emotional core through his relationship with his father (Stanislaus Zbysko, an almost documentary picture of a pro wrestler.... I'd be amazed if I learned he was just an actor and not a real wrestler). Gene Tierney's work however was very underwhelming and forgettable I thought -- not that she was given much of a character to begin with though.When all is said and done this film does little to transcend the genre, but I don't think that was its goal. For what it is it's one of the better examples.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited many years to see this film that had been given new life by a reassessment of the film noir period. "Night and the City" became one of those must-see films which was difficult to catch through normal channels. Luckily, NetFlix recently added it to their list of streaming films and I was overjoyed by the prospect of screening this film. However, as I watched "Night and the City," a gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach told me something was amiss. Did I have the wrong film? Was the hyper overplayed about this little B&amp;W ditty? Was this film as mediocre as I was making it out be? Well, I did have the right film, but my suspicions were correct in the other two areas. "Night and the City" has some redeeming graces such as excellent photography and some very good performances. But the film's story is pure B-picture hokem. Although it has been "revisited" by the film noir crowd, I think the New York Times original review of the film still stands"Bosley Crowther in The New York Times: "Dassin's evident talent has been spent upon a pointless, trashy yarn, and the best that he has accomplished is a turgid pictorial grotesque...he tried to bluff it with a very poor script?and failed...the screenplay is without any real dramatic virtue, reason or valid story-line...little more than a melange of maggoty episodes having to do with the devious endeavors of a cheap London night-club tout to corner the wrestling racket?an ambition in which he fails. And there is only one character in it for whom a decent, respectable person can give a hoot."I agree completely with this assessment, in fact, I labored to sit through the entire film. It's simply a waste of good direction, acting and atmosphere thrown away on a pointless story. I appreciate the efforts of recent critics to restore the prominence of little films important in the development of the cinema, but this little film noir "gem" is in actuality, a faux stone. One is tempted to make comparisions between it and "The Third Man" (for atmospherics) but "The Third Man" was scripted by the brilliant Graham Greene, while "Night and the City" is more reminiscent of a desperate Bowery Boys plot line than Mr. Greene's thoughtful entertainments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some interest, but doesn't really hold up. overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Widmark's character is not easy to like and harder to respect. Why would Gene Tierney be so in love with him? That's a big problem, as is understanding exactly what's going on in the wrestling plot--and caring about it is hard, even with the admirable Gregorius. The son-father relationship of Gregorius with his son and with Widmark are both simply written by the writer, not made credible. On the whole, a rather artificial film, with some nice London atmosphere. You feel like in the world around these characters there might be something interesting going on, but it's not happening at the center of the film. So far, I've seen two good Dassin films, Thieves' Highway and the classic Rififi. Naked City, which some prefer to Thieves' Highway, seems to me thoroughly dated, while TH, despite its faults, remains a pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Widmark's best performances as the loser Harry Fabian, a man obsessed with becoming a big man in the London sports world. Fabian attempts one deal after another in a desperate try at raising money for a big deal while barely managing to stay one step ahead of a ruthless wrestling promoter. Not only did Harry's actions bring about a legion of problems for himself, but he brought endless pain and sorrow to those who dealt with and cared for him. A pathetic character, but I had a hard time holding much sympathy for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry All In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the majority of Hollywood 'stars' who saw England as a chance to revive a flagging career Richard Widmark crossed the pond when he was still a top box-office attraction (and would continue so for the next decade). Director Dassin had his own reasons as one of the discretion is the best part of valour Americans such as Carl Foreman and Joseph Losey who became long-time UK residents, whilst the two above-the-title females, Googie Withers and Gene Tierney had done their best work in the previous decade. Even Hugh 'Redwood' Marlowe, as wooden as always in support had two A-list films either on release or just about to be in All About Eve and 12 O'Clock High. Students or irony will relish the fact that Widmark's Harry Fabian - small-time hustler living on his wits - was the template for Tony Curtis' Sydney Falco in The Sweet Smell of Suucess some five years or so later yet Curtis gets all the kudos whilst Widmark, the better actor by far, is ignored. The plot sees Widmark's Harry Fabian chasing the big score and almost finding it in the seedy world of wrestling only to have it turn to ashes. On the whole it's a slightly bizarre melange with Widmark supported by the likes of Herbert Lom and Francis L. Sullivan, two of the most unrealistic underworld types ever put on film. As curios go it's well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its a noir value ? the sort of things that characters would do in a noir movie ? to be very particular about what it means to be noir. So allow me this deviation from the conventional wisdom. This ain't noir.For some people. Noir is merely dark and "off," either in the photography or the story ? or both. For me, noir is a wholly new, cinematic notion of the world, something invented by cinema, American cinema. Its the notion that there is a world where some sort of designer manipulates things against the interests of the on-screen characters and for our benefit. More: the implication is that story twists and particularly the supernatural coincidences are indeed supernatural: that our own desires as viewers drive the cosmology of the movieworld. Its a very strange feeling, that the very act of watching creates the story, and that the directions of the story reveal something about how our minds are put together. Watching what happens surprises us in revealing what we desire to make happen. Most films made today acknowledge and play with this dynamic in some way, even humor.In contrast is the "old-school" style of drama, where the dynamics happen in front of us, and the reasons for the dynamics are explained and revealed to be completely in the world we see. So in an old-style "Hamlet," the tragedy is motivated by the nature of the actors as revealed; in a noir "Hamlet," there are supernatural forces driven by the ghost as our avatar, and the center of the thing is wonder about how the world works in terms of drama and dreams. Why isn't this noir? Because the characters all bring disaster because of obvious character flaws. Old style. See?I haven't seen the deNiro/Lange version, but I suppose it to be much of the same, deNiro doing his intensity thing instead of the energetic life-hopping thing Widmark does.I'm going to recommend against this. Its only engaging if you like car wrecks for the disaster alone. Or if effective acting by itself is enough to satisfy.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even the acting talents of Richard Widmark can't help this 1950 stinker.Widmark, as always, is terrific. This time he is a conniving character whose plans go awry quite quickly.He plays an American hustler in London who is trying to get a foothold onto the wrestling industry. Trouble is that he goes about it in the wrong way and alienates too many people in the interim.Gene Tierney and Hugh Marlowe are absolutely wasted here. There is a pretty good performance by Francis L. Sullivan as someone willing to bank Widmark until he finds out that Widmark's love interest is his wife, played by Googie Withers. Googie? What kind of name is that? Nowadays, she'd be compared to Google.There is an authentic wrestling scene with Mike Mazurki and some other character really both delivering some blows. Look for a very young and suave Herbert Lom.</fullReview>
