		<shortDescription>Sometimes words aren't enough?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ambulance chasing lawyer decides to become a boxing promoter in NYC. However he comes into conflict with money lenders and the local mob. He finds that his talk and promises are meaningless unless he can back them up and he digs himself into deeper trouble with every word.This is a very low key NY drama in De Niro's career - more typical of the bottom feeders he played in the 70's than the powerful mob figures he has played more recently. This has a depressing feel of inevitability about it - you can see the problems in Fabian's plans long before they happen, giving the film a feel of small time from the very start. This isn't a story about small time making it big, rather a story of a hustler who talks himself into a corner. The story is therefore quite compelling, despite it being very low key, the only weakness being the romance subplot and the fact that it is quite depressing.De Niro is good as Fabian, his best scenes are when he's talking, trying to create something that isn't. However his character isn't totally believable and when it all comes falling down it isn't that well done. Jessica Lange is good but doesn't have that much to do and again her character isn't convincing when the bad times come. Support is good from the likes of Eli Wallach, Jack Warner, Alan King and others.Overall this is a good film with an overall air of realism. Not one of De Niro's best and indeed it has it's weaknesses but it's quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake from a noir classic with an unstoppable acting by Robert De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture deals an ambitious, fast-talking lawyer named Harry Fabian(Robert De Niro, Richard Widmark role) in N.Y.C., he's a hustler with several money-making schemes . Harry concocts a plot as boxing's small-time promoter . But he makes erroneous friends, the old boxer's brother(Alan King), a tough gangster. Harry is the role who fills completely the movie , he survives as person who reports false crime in the trials. Harry becoming involved with mobsters and an affair with his barman's spouse(Jessica Lange). But his plans go awry and he's on the run for his life. The story terminates with a persecution excellently filmed with all its rawness .This noir urban/drama packs good performances though Robert De Niro is overacting. Nice interpretation by Jessica Lange , the only character who shows a bit of kindness on Harry. Supporting casting is frankly well, as Cliff Gorman, Eli Wallach, Jack Warden, Barry Primus, Michael Badalucco, among others , furthermore cameo role by Richard Price, screenplay's author. Dark cinematography by Tak Fujimoto and atmospheric and effective musical score by James Newton Howard. This version about Harry downfall lacks punch and dramatic weight, it results to be much better the classic adaptation (1955), a real masterpiece, set in London with Richard Widmark, Gene Tierney and Herbert Lom. This inferior new version is dedicated to Jules Dassin, the magnificent director of the original picture and adapted from the novel by Gerard Kersh. The motion picture is regularly directed by Irwin Winkler, usual producer of Robert De Niro films and occasionally filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine performance by De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of Night and the City (1950) directed by Jules Dissan, who was blacklisted by Hollywood because of actions by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and for that reason is dedicated to Dissan who had to continue his career in Europe. The original film starred Richard Widmark, Gene Tierney, Francis L. Sullivan and Herbert Lom. I haven't seen that film, but I understand that it is very good.This film from 1992 is not bad; however for some reason its reputation isn't much. The voters at IMDb give it a rather tepid 5.7 stars out of 10 while giving the original 8 out of 10. I'm not sure why, but I think it has to do with: (1) Robert De Niro playing a non-heroic character. It certainly doesn't have anything to do with his acting. He is outstanding as Harry Fabian, flimflam low life lawyer and cheap BS artist who tries desperately to make a big splash as a fight promoter. I think most De Niro fans would prefer to see him in a more two-fisted role. At any rate, those who didn't like the movie almost certainly didn't care for De Niro's performance since his character dominates the action.(2) The ending, which some might see as unfinished and others as disagreeable since, regardless of what transpires, Fabian is still a loser, perhaps bigger than ever.(3) Some rather cheesy plot play. Near the end Fabian and Helen (Jessica Lange looking as fetching as ever) hide in a dead end alley among dumpsters and trash cans. Well, they should have continued running since the guys after them were only walking. Also when Fabian and Helen run out the side door of the restaurant they go the wrong way so that the heavies can see them running across the street. Had they turned left instead of right (as anybody in their situation would have done) they would not even have been seen. Furthermore, Fabian in a flamboyant gesture throws $12,000 into the air that flutters to the ground in the dead end alley. Nobody bothers to pick it up. That could happen.What cannot be faulted is the authentic New York atmosphere created by director Irvin Winkler, who is better know as a producer, most notably of the Sylvester Stallone "Rocky" films, and the fine work by the rest of the cast, especially Alan King (Ira "Boom Boom" Grossman), Eli Wallach (Peck), Cliff Gorman (Phil Nasseros), and Jack Warden (Al Grossman). The story itself, from a novel by Gerald Kersh (script by Richard Price), is a variation on the "lovable, colorful loser makes good" theme, only in this case, like an inept noir anti-hero, he falls on his face--more than once, by the way.No real De Niro fan should miss this. Personally I thought it was one of his best performances. The rapid fire dialogue, the fawning, pathetic, yet somehow uplifting personality were not something most actors could pull off, at least not nearly as well. De Niro became the character he portrayed.Bottom line: definitely worth seeing. You will not be bored.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry, you ever hear of Murphy's Law? Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night and the City is directed by Irwin Winkler and adapted to screenplay by Richard Price from the novel written by Gerald Kersh. It stars Robert De Niro, Jessica Lange, Cliff Gorman, Jack Warden, Alan King, Eli Wallach and Barry Primus. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto. Ambulance chasing lawyer Harry Fabian (De Niro) has grand designs to be a boxing promoter. Unfortunately this ruffles the feathers of a local promoter who is not exactly known for his kindness... It's often unfair to do down a remake of a classic film, with the rule of thumb being we are asked to judge said remake on its own terms. However, Winkler's neo-noir remake of Jules Dassin's brilliant 1950 film noir of the same name just lacks the edginess or urgency to make a mark. It's not down to performances of the cast or the tech production in general, in fact De Niro, Warden and the under written Lange are watchable, while Fujimoto's photography around the New York locations is superlative. Yet the characters as written here, in the shift from postwar London to a thrumming NYC, have no psychological pangs to drive the picture forward. Harry trudges from one slice of idiocy to another, with a big plot development making no sense, and all the time there's ill placed humour hanging over the plot to further compound the feeling we are watching a disjointed attempt at neo-noir nirvana. While the conclusion here is weak and kind of a cheat. The makers dedicated the film to Dassin, that's a nice sentiment, but really they should have honoured him by making a far better movie in the spirit of the great director himself. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Impact Is Not The Same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his career Robert DeNiro has done four remakes of classic films of which Night And The City is one of them. The other three are We're No Angels, Cape Fear, and Frankenstein. In redoing parts made immortal by Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum, Boris Karloff, and in this case Richard Widmark, DeNiro has wisely chosen not to imitate any of these people, instead whatever you think of the final product, he's certainly put out his own interpretation on these roles.From the shadow world of the London underworld scene where American expatriate Richard Widmark operated to the streets of New York in the Nineties, the plot of Night And The City has essentially remained the same except, and this is critical for the ending. DeNiro must have loved the fact that his Tribeca Productions got to film in and around New York, especially in Tribeca. Widmark is a small time hood, DeNiro is a cheap shyster lawyer, the kind that lawyer jokes are made about. He hears them and he's oblivious to them. What he's not oblivious to is the success he sees around him. It's personified by Cliff Gorman who runs a successful bar where DeNiro tells his war stories. It's also even more personified by Alan King who is a boxing promoter with some underworld connections. He's risen to the top in a very tough racket.DeNiro tries to enter King's world and buys King's reluctant acceptance with using King's older brother Jack Warden who is a retired fighter living in an old age home. If you remember what happens in the original Night And The City, you pretty much know what is going to happen here and for the most part it does.The legal profession doesn't necessarily attract guys like DeNiro, he's no Louis Brandeis, he's not about to publish articles in Harvard Law Review. But with him lying and conning is second nature, he does it like he breathes. Even Jessica Lange who is Gorman's wife and who DeNiro is carrying on with, he lies to her and worse because he needs money. He'd do all this if he wasn't a lawyer.The cast is an incredibly select and good one of New Yorkers themselves who can play these parts like second nature. Even Jessica Lange who is a native of Minnesota is New York enough for her part. One role I have to call attention to is that of Margo Winkler. She has one scene as a judge with lawyer DeNiro whom obviously she's dealt with before. She throws him and his put up accident case out of court in a really terrific way.The film would rate a lot higher with me had the original ending from Jules Dassin's classic version been kept. It wasn't and it really cheapens the impact of the film. Other than that this version of Night And The City is a good film with a great cast of players to perform it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NIGHT AND THE CITY (1992) *** Robert De Niro, Jessica Lange, Alan King, Cliff Gorman, Jack Warden, Barry Primus. Slice-of-low-life portrait remake of 1940 Richard Widmark flick casts De Niro as ambulance chasing attorney Harry Fabian trying to score big-time as a boxing promoter with the help of his lady love (Lange in an uncharacteristically unglamourous role) and the ex-fighter brother (Warden) of his chief nemesis (King in a humdinger of chilly malevolence as the corrupt boxing mogul). Feisty and surprisingly funny script courtesy of Richard Price (in a bit role as a doctor) has its moments of ugliness and sudden downshift into tragedy. De Niro, at times over-the-top, is the life-force to this otherwise entertaining melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever get that sense of incompleteness?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If so, and you enjoy it, then perhaps this is the movie for you. The casting people loaded this film with a lot of good, solid character actors, but apparently forgot a cohesive plot and a story to go with all these screen gems.This movie goes to further serve that De Niro can make a vehicle, not matter how rusted and barely running, watchable. The way he develops his characters is always attention-grabbing and this picture is no different.This film starts off in a bunch of different directions, then does the old bait and switch, but doesn't really go anywhere. The ending is possibly one of the worst of all time, it seems like whoever was directing this just went on whatever whim struck him at the time and at the end of two hours, the producers just got bored and stopped the show. Ultimately unfulfilling and unless you are a huge De Niro fan, a complete waste of 2 hours. If you do sit through it, please accept my best wishes that you are able to enjoy it without screaming, "Where is the payoff?" for most of the time it takes for viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night in the City-Another Fade To Black **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Niro proved once again what a good actor he is, even given the poor writing in this 1992 film. As Harry Fabian, an adventurous lawyer on the make for a quick buck, De Niro showed a dimension of a fast talking, aggressive lawyer, who is looking to make a big score as he focuses his attention to the crooked world of boxing.De Niro had a really excellent supporting cast to work with, Jessica Lange and the late Cliff Gorman, as a couple, looking to make it big as well, with Lange romancing DeNiro on the side. The late Jack Warden represents the old-time prize fighter, filled with memories, along with his bad ticker. Alan King shines as his mobster brother, threatening and menacing to the hilt.To me, De Niro represented another midnight urban cowboy, living in a city of decay, searching for an easy buck, and getting a bullet in the back for his efforts in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the single worst ending to a movie I've ever seen. Great acting, great character development, a sense of impending doom, and then the movie inexplicably ends on what is supposed to be a lighthearted moment. Don't believe I've ever felt more cheated by the ending of a movie. The studio and director dropped the ball on what could have been a classic flick. It's like they ran out of money and fell behind schedule at the same time....and were told too bad... end it. Compelling story gone to waste with a bad title (which has nothing to do with the story), a ridiculously insulting ending, poor soundtrack, and an empty feeling in the gut. SPOILER SPOILER . You absolutely want this guy to get it in the end, he doesn't. Now I want revenge on whoever wasted my time with this anticlimactic piece of wasted potential. What a shame for me and Hollywood, and you too, if you watch it.</fullReview>

I stayed as long as I could but I couldn't bear to stay until the end. I like Jessica Lange and Robert DeNiro and consider them both to be good actors. Thus this was a real disappointment. They have both made much better movies than this one. She's a waitress and he is a lawyer. I thought it was depressing and their first sex scene was carried out with wooden acting.

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, But Doesn't Measure Up To The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irwin Winkler's "Night And The City" is a light-hearted story about a shyster lawyer who gets into trouble when he decides to become a boxing promoter. Early on in this movie, Murphy's Law is mentioned and sure enough, when this guy tries to achieve his ambitions, it seems that anything that can go wrong, does go wrong. The plot is based on the Jules Dassin 1950 classic of the same name and features plenty of humour, sharp dialogue and interesting characters.Harry Fabian (Robert DeNiro) is an unscrupulous and fast-talking scam artist. He's strictly small time but is ambitious to become "somebody" and the way that he intends to do this is by promoting a programme of boxing matches featuring young fighters from his own locality in New York. His main problems, however, are that he doesn't have sufficient funds of his own and also that established boxing promoter and gangster Ira "Boom Boom" Grossman (Alan King) doesn't appreciate someone else competing against him and threatening his profits.Harry regularly frequents a bar run by Phil Nasseros (Cliff Gorman) and is having an affair with Phil's wife Helen (Jessica Lange). She wants to get out of her marriage and plans to set up a bar and restaurant of her own. Harry promises to get her the liquor licence that she needs to do this.In order to head off any potential problems, Harry recruits Boom Boom's older brother Al (Jack Warden) who's an ex-prize-fighter who detests his brother. Boom Boom warns Harry of dire consequences if anything untoward should happen to Al. Harry arranges to finance his new enterprise by borrowing money from Phil and a notoriously ruthless loan shark called Peck (Eli Wallach) and predictably, trouble follows when nothing goes according to plan.Robert DeNiro delivers a high energy performance as the hyperactive hustler with a penchant for quick-fire monologues that simultaneously entertain and disgust whoever's listening. His recklessness, appalling lack of good judgement and capacity for betrayal make him a self-destructive character whose actions inevitably get him into hot water.Cliff Gorman, Eli Wallach, Alan King and Jack Warden are excellent in their supporting roles as they're all convincing and add considerable substance and colour to the whole movie. Jessica Lange is also good in a part that doesn't require her to display the full range of her talents.Judged purely on its own merits, "Night And Tha City" (1992) is a thoroughly enjoyable and fast-paced piece of entertainment. However, for those who've previously seen the 1950 version, it will inevitably be seen as a rather anaemic remake of a classic movie that had incredible intensity, power and poignancy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Performances, Poor Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night and the City (1992) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Remake of the 1950 Richard Widmark noir has Robert DeNiro playing Harry Fabian, a real loser who works as an attorney chasing ambulances and various other lowlifes. He finally grows tired of being one of the small guys so he tries raising enough money to start a boxing match but soon he's butting heads with mobsters. If you're looking for a direct remake then you can pretty much forget about it as this Richard Price scripted film is more comedy than anything else. Well, I can't say it's a comedy because I'm not quite certain what it is. Apparently Martin Scorsese was going to direct this but ended up backing out only six years later the picture got started up again by Winkler, who by this time decided to direct the thing himself. Big problem. Winkler's direction is all over the place and it really hurts the film as there's never any real indication that the man behind the camera knows what he's trying to do. Sometimes the overall mood is comical but at other times it turns rather dark (only to be watered down). I'm really not sure what they were going for but you certainly shouldn't expect any of the darkness of the original movie. This baby is pretty much it's own thing and even though the direction is bad there's still enough going on here to make it worth viewing. It seems DeNiro is either love or hate here but I found his performance to be rather refreshing and I found him to be very entertaining in the role. Again, he isn't as dark or as menacing of Widmark as he plays the character more happy-go-lucky and there's constantly a smile on his face as he goes from one bad situation to the next. I found these happy approach to be rather fun to see as we don't often get to see DeNiro in this type of role. It's not a complete masterpiece but if you're a fan I think you'll enjoy seeing it. Jessica Lange plays his love interest and manages to turn in a fine performance even though the screenplay doesn't offer her too much. I thought her and DeNiro, their third film together, did a nice job and I wish their scenes had been written a little better. We do get a nice supporting cast including Jack Warden as a former boxer with a bad heart who is constantly cussing or wanting to fight. He adds a lot of charm to the film each time he's in a scene. Eli Wallach has a brief role and it's always nice to see him. Cliff Gorman nearly steals the film as Lange's husband who doesn't know everything that's going on. We even get a cameo by Regis Philbin who plays himself in a scene that will remind many of the one in THE KING OF COMEDY when DeNiro busts in on Jerry Lewis. Needless to say, it's the performances that make this film worth viewing and we also get a pretty good music score as well as some nice covers of some classic tunes. If a remake should try and be completely different from the original then this movie does just that. This isn't a classic like the original film but there are enough interesting things to make it worth viewing but I'm sure most will agree when it's over that the thing should have been much, much better.</fullReview>

An incompetent lawyer strives to become a boxing promoter. If you're not a De Niro fan but you still find that interesting than you probably have time to catch this movie while you're still deciding on your method of suicide.On the other hand, if you ARE a De Niro fan, the idea of ol' Bobby playing a bullpoop-slinging, sheisty lawyer and ticking everyone off pretty much speaks for itself.

De Niro did his fine job of playing the shyster and his plan to fill a boxing card. This movie was very predictable and waiting for the plot to twist and turn in our stars favor never happens.

		<fullReview>Night and the City is a 1992 remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name.It is an adaptation of Gerald Kersh's novel of the same name. It features Robert De Niro and Jessica Lange. It tells the story of a one Harry Fabian,a two-bit lawyer in New York.He easily becomes fascinated in the world of championship prizefights in the sport of boxing and needs the help of a hardnosed promoter,Alan King.Disaster plagues Fabian as his boxers fail to pass their physicals, and Warden dies while setting up the big event. Pursued by King and his creditors, the terrified Fabian is urged by girlfriend to get of town. But he decides to face up the challenges for the first time in his life and stand his ground up to the final event of the situation.Overall,the movie does not hold up to the original film as it is far from being a classic.In fact,it was borderline average despite the presence of wonderful cast particularly De Niro and Lange. In spite of it,a viewer may enjoy the high spirits of the low life characters involved in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of De Niro's Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did Robert De Niro go from a performance like Max Cady in "Cape Fear" to Harry Fabian in "Night And The City"?? One of his best to one of his worst.Plot In A Paragraph: Harry Fabian is a fast-talking lawyer. He sues and settles, looking to make it big as he carries on an affair with the wife of the owner of his local hang out. While losing a case to a local mobster who fronts as a sports promoter, Fabian senses his future as a boxing promoter. For protection from the mobster, he recruits the boss's older brother as his "judge of talent" he books a hall, he orders posters. Soon he's in debt waiting for the big night to rake in the cash. His sweetheart wants to leave her husband, so she needs Fabian's help to get a liquor license to set up her own bar. All the while the mobster is still making trouble.Jessica Lange and Jack Warden are the best actors on display here, even if you never understand Lange's characters loyalty to Fabian even after he ruined her dream. As for De Niro he seems to be trying far too hard, maybe it was poor directing?? And his acting in the Alley at the end is woeful. The only reason I'm glad I watched this to the end was the fact that I got to hear Freddie Mercury sing 'The Great Pretender' over the closing credits which was a nice surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits and misses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second time I saw this film, and again it was doable. De Niro's role is contradictory; on the one hand Harry Fabian lies and cheats, but the more you get to know him, the bigger his heart turns out to be. He wants to make his big score, more as a personal victory than just making money. Then there's some other sidelines, like his relationship with a waitress (who is actually with the man who becomes key in his new plans...) and a new friend/partnership with a retired boxer (who has a dangerously bad ticker...). It doesn't take a genius to figure that things will not turn out so great for Harry, but predictability isn't always a bad thing.Otherwise, the story is pretty decent, although it takes a while to really get started and some scenes could have easily been cut shorter. But the big disappointment is the finale - lacking any form of suspense, drama or humour it pretends to have. I díd enjoy most of the acting though, beside De Niro I find Lange, Warden and Gorman especially worth mentioning.It's about time I tried the original, I suppose. 6 out of 10 for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glossy remake of the Dassin original...jumpy, nervy, and begging on its knees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manhattan lawyer Harry Fabian (whose clients are mostly lowlifes and prostitutes) sues a professional boxer on behalf of a schnook who got popped and is now in a neck-brace; that case gets thrown out of court, but no matter: Fabian is bitten by the boxing bug, and rallies all his contacts to raise enough cash to promote his own boxing event--much to the dismay of "Boom Boom" Grossman, the promotional kingpin of New York City . Based on Gerald Kersh's novel and the 1950 movie-version directed by Jules Dassin (to whom this remake is dedicated), "Night and the City" gives us yet another colorful character portrait from actor Robert De Niro. Chatting away like a man possessed, De Niro is playing not just a dreamer but a DESPERATE, determined dreamer. Harry is too na?ve to understand that some people never get their shot, never get their piece of the American dream. He wants to be successful, he wants his friends to celebrate with him, and he wants to have fun climbing up the ladder. His semi-reluctant partner, a faded boxing legend (Jack Warden, in a smashing performance) happens to be "Boom Boom"'s brother, while Jessica Lange is the abused wife of Harry's main financier. She's also having an affair with Harry, in a subplot that never quite irons itself out. Several issues, in fact, are left unresolved, and the picture is assembled rather sloppily. Still, De Niro's live-wire performance is something to see; he claws and begs and punches right through this too-glossy milieu, actually making something substantial out of it. Harry Fabian finds himself backed into a corner, and his final plea is marvelously well-played. It's an acting workout for De Niro in a picture that just misses the bull's-eye. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER Many people have said that this is a bad film. I must disagree with them. I think this is a pretty entertaining drama, and it has a good ending. I especially liked the main character, Harry Fabian. If you liked the King of Comedy, then you know what i mean. I loved King of Comedy, and i found certain similarities between the main character Rupert Pupkin, and Harry Fabian. Theres a bit of that funny tragicomic appeal in both of them, they're both hopeless losers, and unlikable. The irony is that the extremely naive Rupert, gets his own comedy show in the end of King of Comedy, but Harry Fabian, the tougher one of these two gets shot and loses all his money. This movie does suffer from many flaws like tepid characterisations, silly plot and mediocre direction, but the main character saves the film from being total trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really liked this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I beg to disagree with Roger Ebert on this one. I think he is too obsessed with comparing this film to the original. Even though I didn't see the original, I can see that this film isn't supposed to be a copy, but only borrows the premise in order to develop an original, realistic and contemporary plot of its own. I can't understand Ebert when he claims that characters in a noir film should not be developed and the plot should not be realistic..?? I suppose you have to be a critic to understand that. This film "feels" like a good old movie from days past when screenplays, characterization and dialog where important, that's why I liked it, and I suppose that may not be "modern" enough for some...I found this to be a good film, with excellent characterizations that work (finally a movie that has 'real' characters we can understand, believe in, sympathize with), a realistic plot and some very good acting (especially De Niro whom I found to be excellent once again). On a lesser note, the photography and soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boxers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I saw this movie was its filming locale, Boxers on West 4th Street in NYC. (Ironically, the bar had nothing to do with "Boxers" as in pugilists). Its not Boxers that I will remember, its the predecessor on this corner, Boxers decor was the same as the lamented JIMMY DAYS that graced this corner from about 1970 until 1989 or 1990. When Jimmy was forced out by escalating rents, Boxers moved in, keeping the exposed brick ceiling decor the same. Soon, this movie may be the only permanent record of a great NY neighborhood bar known as JIMMY DAYS. There is a Margot Kidder independent movie from the 1970s that was filmed here when it was Jimmy Days, called Willie and Phil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Good Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is some good acting in Night and the City, but the movie overall is unremarkable. I picked this movie up at the video store last week, only because Robert De Niro is in it. I have to admit, even though I see a lot of movies, I don't think I had heard of this movie until I picked it up that evening, even though I had probably skimmed across the cover on the box while browsing at the video store. I found this movie pretty hard to watch, mainly because De Niro's character Harry Fabian is not very likeable and I tried very hard to like or respect this character, but I only felt sorry for the guy and I found this depressing. However, De Niro and some of the supporting actors are quite good from an acting perspective in some scenes.I gave this movie a 6 out of 10. I'd only recommend this movie to De Niro fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If It Ain't Broke, Don't Try to Fix It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to approach a film like this with some ambivalence, given that it is a reinterpretation of a classic film noir. The fact that Scorsese pulled out should give one pause too. Did he have second thoughts about despoiling this favorite among film mavens and ending up with a travesty? Surprisingly, there are several good points to recommend the second version: De Niro's acting, the supporting cast, and the New York ambiance principally.Some of the reviewers on here argue that De Niro's unlikeable character diminishes the film, but they are missing the point -- the story is famous in part precisely because none of the characters is likable. More than 20 years into his career, De Niro turns in another fine performance and foreshadows some of the great work he does in this decade. Perspicacious fans will not be disappointed. The film goes wrong when it attempts to update the story and change things like the ending, which tries to redeem Harry and adds a sentimental touch totally out of keeping with the noir impetus of the film. The problem with revisions is knowing when to leave well enough alone. Scorsese went on to make a similar mistake with Cape Fear, which for all its virtues, pales besides the original and showcases De Niro in an over the top performance, which is gripping but flawed precisely because the film tries so hard to outdo its predecessor. Nonetheless, this version of Night and the City merits more attention than it has received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-Time Watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name, 'Night and the City' is an interesting story, which begins well, but, has a lackluster culmination.'Night and the City' is about a cheating and incompetent lawyer played by De Niro, who suddenly gets obsessed on becoming a boxing promoter. The concept is weird, but at the same time, it's interesting. This remake begins well, the first 40-45 minutes, especially, are very interesting. All goes down well, except the final 20 minutes. The culmination doesn't work a bit. It's completely bland.Irwin Winkler's direction is satisfactory. The Screenplay has it's bumps here and there. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is average. Editing isn't anything. Music by James Newton Howard works well.In the acting department, De Niro is efficient, but goes over-the-top at some portions. Jessica Lange is the real show stealer. She's fantastic throughout. Alan King hams to the hilt. Others lend able support.As my summary says, it's strictly a one-time-watch. Not much to rave or rant about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great cast, not a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm the kind of guy that sometimes watches a movie based on its cast or its director, and that was the case with 'Night and The City' with Robert de Niro. Unhappily this movie is not as good as the best ones from de Niro ( Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, King of Comedy, Once Upon a Time in America or The Godfather 2, Jackie Brown ). In this movie, de Niro looks like Jim Carrey with his electric style, but this is not the de Niro we're used to see.The movie is about Harry Fabian ( a second-class lawyer from N.Y. ) that tries to make success in the boxing-promoting market. But the market is dominated by Boom Boom Brossman, a senior promoter of big fights in N.Y. that sees his domain threatened by Fabian. To get the money to promote the fights, Fabian needs to beg money from all his friends, one of them, Phil is the owner of the Boxers pub. Phil's wife, Helen, is in love with Fabian and plans to leave Phil and open her own pub.Night and the City is a remake of the homonym filmed in 1950, that I haven't seen but is much better rated than the 1992's version.It seems that Irwin Winkler works better as a movie producer than as director. One of the movies he promoted are Ranging Bull, New York New York and The Goodfellas, all them starring Robert de Niro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You need to buy some time Harry".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tuned in last night to see "Night and the City" starring Richard Widmark; that's what the TV cable listing showed was playing. It was already a minute or so after the opening credits rolled, and with no hint of a glorious black and white 1940 flick I was ready to change channels. Then DeNiro comes on screen and curiosity got the better of me. It took a while to sort out what was going on with his character, a shyster lawyer by the name of Harry Fabian. Yet at the same time, there was a train-wreck quality to his acting here that made me want to continue the ride. What makes the film memorable is the utter creepiness of his character, a despicable self promoter who's willing to use anyone and anything to get what he wants, as in money and lots of it. He gets the bright idea of becoming a boxing promoter, and almost immediately becomes embroiled in a scheme that's bound to land him in big time trouble with friends and foes alike. Mostly foes, as who would be friends with this guy? Which is why I couldn't figure where the fascination came from for Helen (Jessica Lange) to play Harry along in a convoluted romance. Yeah, he might be able to pull a few strings to get her a state liquor license, but that was a fake, like just about everything else to do with Harry.Depending on your mood, the finale will leave you perplexed or glad that it's over. However if you can appreciate some clever acting, you won't be disappointed by DeNiro's turn as Harry Fabian here. Some might call it over the top, but I didn't get the sense that DeNiro was forcing the characterization. He WAS Harry Fabian. I also liked Alan King's out of character turn as hood Boom Boom Grossman, and Jack Warden as his retired boxing brother Al. Warden reminded me here of Burgess Meredith in the Rocky films, and I tried picturing him in the role of Mickey Goldman. It might have worked with a little more crust.Hard to say whether to recommend this one. The clue seems to be whether you're a DeNiro fan or not. Fans will get a different look at his range as an actor, but with an ending that might leave you frustrated after having sat through Harry's ordeal. At least now I have an incentive to get hold of the Richard Widmark original to see if he fared any better or worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so we all agree that Robert DeNiro and Jessica Lange are among the greatest stars of their generations. Well, even they can play mildly confusing roles. "Night and the City" is an example. DeNiro plays a lawyer who seeks to get into boxing...but what might this lead to? This is one of those movies whose plot might become a blur after you see it. I actually thought that the movie's most interesting aspect was the contrast between Jessica Lange and Jack Warden, and maybe I'm the only one who even saw that. I mean, he's got the look of an acerbic old man, and she still has an aura of her "King Kong" role. But otherwise, I didn't see too much else. I guess that the movie's worth seeing, if only once. Also starring Cliff Gorman, Alan King and Eli Wallach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeNiro Scores Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching Robert DeNiro in "Night in the City." DeNiro's classic role as "loser" wannabe "winner" Harry Fabien is perfect especially when teamed up with the beautiful and talented Jessica Lange. Every time it comes to cable I watch it, and probably always will. DeNiro's potrayal of a lawyer who always ends up last and is determined to make a name for himself is flawless. I read another comment about this movie and was prompted to write this in defence of a movie which I adore. I am so very happy to see that Robert DeNiro has "six" movies coming out in the year 2004.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm afraid I found the movie rather boring but the location had a special meaning for me.

It is a great place with lots of character on West 4th street in Manhattan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only one who constantly sees the microphone at the top of the screen, sometime including the stick that holds it ! People who make such errors shouldn't be allowed to direct movies, especially if they turn out as boring as this one. This movie proves that no mather how good the actor(s) and script or how big the budget, if you have a bad director you get a bad picture. At least Irwin Winkler is a good producer.</fullReview>
