		<fullReview>First -and only- time I saw Der Blaue Engel, I was a boy of about 13-14 years old. Even though this was over 35 years ago, I still remember how this movie blew me away. I came out of the theater with a new understanding of the world and the human condition.The story is in essence about love, and what it can make a person do. It is also about what people will do to each other, a theme this movie takes to it's extreme. The acting is supreme, the atmosphere breathtaking, the music score fabulous. Marlene sings one of the great songs in movie history; German cabaret pur sang.This is a European film in the best sense of the word. It gives the spectator the feeling of being picked up and dropped somewhere in time and place, to witness a dramatic sequence of events in the lives of a small group of people. It starts out jolly enough, but pretty soon you feel that things are going to go terribly wrong. And sure enough, they do.The young boy that was I, left this movie with a weird mixture of feelings. On the one hand the fear of ever being trapped in such a romantic cul-de-sac, and of losing all human dignity. On the other, a deep longing to experience those bitter emotions. Isn't this the greatest accolade for a tragedy: that it moves you to tears, but at the same time makes you want to experience the sad events that caused those tears?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should merit a place in the upper region of the 250 top movies, somewhere in the neighborhood of "Citizen Kane" and "Twelve Angry Men". Apparently it is not very well known in the USA.In Germany and in countries where the German language is rather familiar, it is rightly considered as one of the classics of cinema.Amazing, that Sternberg, only a couple of years after the invention of the "talky" could produce a masterpiece that has seldom been surpassed. It was this movie that launched the carreer of Marlene Dietrich, with her famous song "Ich bin von Kopf bis Fuss auf Liebe eingestellt".I had seen the movie many years ago. When I saw it for the second time about a year ago, I realized that Emile Jennings acting, as the rather silly teacher at the local grammar school who sacrifies his career because of a cabaret girl, was not less impressive than that of Marlene Dietrich. A pity that I did never see another film with this great actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Truly Great Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like THE GODFATHER, CITIZEN KANE, NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and a few others,THE BLUE ANGEL is one of the great films of all time, simply becauseeverything works. Marlene Dietrich is amazing, probably never as good again, as her Lolais the quintessential woman mixed with Circe, Delilah and all things different and apart. As she leads men to their doom she sings honestlythat she "just can't help it," yet men follow her willingly. EmilJannings as Professor Rath gives what, in my estimation, is the greatestperformance by an actor on film, first as a martinet, then a man findingfirst love, then a devoted married man, then a cuckold, a clown and,finally a broken, destroyed man. (The moment where he wakes in Lola'sbed and finds delight in Lola's doll is one of the great miniatures inany film.) To see Kurt Gerron's powerful, nuanced performance as theleader of the rag tag cabaret troop is heartbreaking when you know thatthe perished ina gas chamber only a few years later.) Director Josef VonSternberg leads the proceedings through staid classrooms, down twistingexpressionist streets, to the tawdry inside of "The Blue Angel", andfinally, through the labyrinth of Rath's life leading inexorably to hisdownfall. Symbolism, from a dead canary to the noose like collarsclowns wear, abound. And oh the songs by Freidrich Hollander! (Kanderand Ebb must have watched this film many times before writing CABARET asso many parts of that production...including the gift of apineapple..are seen here.)I have seen this film again and again and every time it is fresh as itwas the first time, and, I would suppose, as it was in 1929. What agreat, great film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got through watching The Blue Angel (1930) for the second time in a month. When I was watching the beginning this time, I thought: oh, this isn't as powerful as I remembered. I even thought Jannings was overdoing it a little -- he couldn't be as good as I remembered. And then it absolutely knocked me for a loop all over again.Bear in mind that I have a tape that cost $3.98. The film looked old and scratchy, the tape quality was bad, and the sound was poor. This is one of the very earliest sound movies and the sound technique was sometimes distracting. After the first 20 minutes, I couldn't have cared less about the technology. The images of this film are burned into my brain. The business at the very beginning with the dead bird and the sugar cube, the caricatures on the blackboards, Lola's reaction to the marriage proposal, the wedding party and, most of all, the entire last half hour of this film -- none of that left me in the three weeks since my first viewing and it lost none of its impact the second time around.Emil Jannings was just absolutely wonderful. His face in the mirror toward the end is heartbreaking. He doesn't have to say a word. This was Dietrich's debut, and she is great too, but it is Jannings' picture.Highly recommended. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is more a commentary on the human condition than it is a movie review. von Sternberg presents Professor Rath as pompous, rather inflexible and naive, and then reduces him gradually to a pitiful, self-debasing wretch - much like Tyrone Power's character in "Nightmare Alley". Rath, appears to me, not so much the victim as a drunken jaywalker who wanders out into traffic and is totally shocked when he is hit by a truck. Emil Jannings, without doubt, delivers everything that von Sternberg could have asked for.I have never been a big Marlene Dietrich fan, but I have to admit that, in this early effort, her utter sexuality and the casual way she dispenses it is hypnotic. Her character is also complex. Between her first encounter with Rath and those final scenes, her attitude toward him changes from amusement and ridicule to concern, pity, and even affection. His return to his home town and his descent into total degradation is painful to watch, yet she chooses this opportunity to humiliate him even further by offering herself to Mazeppa while he watches. I'm baffled.The corruption and hopelessness of the German cafe circuit is a perfect backdrop for this study of the human condition. When one reaches their absolute nadir - like Rath - there are few choices left. Suicide, violent hostility, or if you are lucky - the determination and will to climb out of the cesspool. Rath was a day late and a reichsmark short. I would like to think that if he had more time he would have made it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an entertaining, funny/sad classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost hard for me to picture what I will tell about The Blue Angel to those I recommend it to. It's a very special movie, and not necessarily for the only reason that some remember the film mostly for. Of course, Marlene Dietrich, in her debut, is stunningly sexy, in clothing in some scenes (and the legs of course) that must've caused some turned eyebrows on its first release. But despite her great charisma, and a certain feminine attitude that was unique for the time, there is really another big factor that makes the Blue Angel work a lot more for me than I thought. Hearing about the film, I got the impression it might be more of a vehicle for Dietrich, the inspiration for what would come in Madeline Kahn's equally memorable turn in Blazing Saddles. What I didn't expect was such a well-rounded, bittersweet kind of story going along, not to mention a sublime, powerful lead performance.It's really the story of Professor Rath, played without a cue missed (and with some of his own ingenuity) by Emil Jannings. Here is a teacher with high morals, and little tolerance for his College student's impudence. He finds out from a classmate interrogation that some of the kids are sneaking off to 'the Blue Angel', a club with dancers, music, and singing in half-naked costumes. He meets Lola (Dietrich) and against all his better judgment, he falls in head over heels, loses his job, and then...well, it might be best to leave it there. What then ensues is a sort of collision of an enriching structure from director Josef von Sternberg (in that the unexpected occurs at times, if only in the little behaviors and bits of business with the characters), and Janning's acting.I loved how it sort of went past the barriers that might have stifled other filmmakers at the turn of the start of silent to sound- the musical numbers makes the Blue Angel club seem hypnotic, sensual, and a little crazy. Then the use of the camera, its stillness most times, focusing on the subtleties of the acting, bring forward the remnants of the finely-tuned theatrical acting from the silent era. What Jannings does here is make a character with a total arc, in this sort of downward spiral that soon occurs once he's made his decision in terms of how he feels vs his career. The last twenty minutes or so, when it finally comes back around for the teacher a 180- from respected teacher to, well, you'll see- is rather shocking, and not as light and amusing as during the first forty minutes or so. But it also shows that Jannings, more often than not, is fearless in his timing and expressions. It's not a completely realistic performance here and there, but it sometimes doesn't need to be. Sternberg sets up such a mood that persists, with little touches (i.e. shots of the statues moving as the clock chimes, expressionistic angles), that give Janning's enough room to do what he does. He helps make the character, who at first seems very expectable and usual (a cranky teacher) into someone we care about. Of course, one doesn't discount Dietrich's presence in the film as enough to seek out the film. She doesn't necessarily give a great acting turn, but in terms of just a great screen presence at times, of providing enough airs to make it clear why Janning's character is falling for her like this. That there are good supporting actors all around them is a plus as well. It's one of those rare films you might smile one minute and then get a little sad at the next. It's quite a lovely little movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marlene Dietrich's ticket to Hollywood Stardom!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph von Sternberg 'packaged' his muse, Marlene Dietrich to become a world star with "The Blue Angel". The disturbing story of a revue entertainer (Dietrich) and the middle aged professor(Emil Jannings)who falls madly in love with, and later is destroyed by her, based on the novel "Professor Unrat". Many unforgettable songs by Friedrich Hollander are featured, most noteworthy of course "Ich bin von Kopf bis Fuss auf Liebe eingestellt" ("Falling in Love Again") and "Ich bin die feche Lola" ("They Call Me Naughty Lola"). There is an English language version available (filmed simultaneously for an intended International release), but I recommend the original German with subtitles. Many effects are lost with the former. I can highly recommend this film, a must for fans of either the stars or the director!*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marlene Dietrich at her best in the German language version of Joseph Von Sternbergs THE BLUE ANGEL, unfortuonatly the English language version was rushed and not made very well so the film never really went down well with 1930s English speaking audiences. The film to me is a dark look at self destruction and degradation. My favourite scene in the film is at the end when Lola Lola is sitting almost triumphantly on a bar stool crooning "falling in love again" whilst her lover, the once great professer slips out into the dark street preparing to walk the long road to death. Although visually the film is no longer superior and Dietrich does not appear to have lost any of her plumpness as she would for her American debut she still appears radiant and her on screen persona would never be quite so strong again, maybe it is because this is the only film that Dietrich would make speaking in her Mother tongue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humiliation, Degradation, Despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proper and respectable Emil Jannings, a teacher at a boys high school takes quite an interest in their moral well being. Seems there's this naughty establishment called The Blue Angel in his town where women have been known to entertain in various states of undress. Some of his boys have some postcards of one of the dancers and Jannings catches them with it. After confiscating the material, Jannings decides to go down to the Blue Angel and tell them not to be catering to minors.Of course he takes one look at the subject of those naughty postcards and since it turns out to be Marlene Dietrich, he realizes his own education has been sadly neglected. He's spotted the kids in the establishment, but they've spotted him as well. From an authoritarian figure, Jannings is now a figure of derision and has no authority in or out of the classroom. He marries Marlene and tours with her company as a clown. A return to his hometown proves to be more than he can bear.Though Marlene Dietrich became an international sex symbol from this film and got a Hollywood contract as a result, the film is really the story of Jannings, his downfall, his humiliation, his degradation. Their respective career paths were really meeting halfway in this film. She was going to America on the strength of this film, Jannings was returning to Germany where he became a very big star and leader of Adolph Hitler's amen corner in German cinemaIn the supporting cast is also Kurt Gerron who is a magician and manager of the troupe of entertainers Marlene and Jannings are part of. His life had the worst tragedy of all, as a Jew he met death in Auschwitz, but not after undergoing a lot of humiliation before. Not unlike what Jannings had in the film, but this was real life.The Blue Angel is a milestone film for many people and in an indirect way for Adolph Hitler as well since he got his biggest film star from the cast. Still though it's a stunning bit of cinema with performances that still hold up very well today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally moving portrayal of a sensitive man's downfall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I wasn't sure what to expect ... all I knew about "Blue Angel" before I saw it tonight was that it had Marlene Dietrich in it and it was supposed to be a classic. That's it! I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the story that this movie told. To summarize the plot briefly: A stern, straight-laced professor (movingly portrayed by Emil Jannings, an actor I am not familiar with) falls in love with and marries Lola (Marlene Dietrich), a nightclub/cabaret singer. He is briefly happy, but then his life takes a tragic nose-dive into disrespectability and self-loathing.Although the professor is portrayed as a stern disciplinarian who is feared and hated by his students, we see he actually has a very soft, sweet side underneath his gruff exterior. A particularly well-done, subtle scene at the very beginning of the movie involved the professor at breakfast, whistling for his pet bird. Anticipating the bird's tweeting response, the professor is ready with a lump of sugar in his hand for his beloved bird. When the bird doesn't respond, he walks to the cage and pulls out a stiff, obviously dead bird. The professor just stands there, dumbfounded, while his housekeeper walks over to him, takes the bird corpse from his hand, and tosses it into the fire. The professor walks back to his table and sadly drops the lump of sugar into his coffee. A simple scene, but terribly moving, and terribly telling of the sweet, sensitive soul that lies within this man.Upon marrying Lola, the professor is shunned by his colleagues and loses his college job. He is reduced to hawking sexy postcards of his wife at her nightclub shows and, even more pathetically, to performing as a clown in her nightclub act.The end of the movie finds the professor returning to The Blue Angel, the nightclub in his hometown where he first met Lola. He adamantly refuses to go on stage as a clown in front of his former colleagues and students, but the manager and his wife coerce him into it. This scene brought me to tears as the professor stood on stage in clown make-up and costume, while the manager/magician poked fun at him and made him the butt of jokes -- calling him empty-headed, breaking eggs on his forehead, and forcing him to cluck like a chicken, all the while his wife is offstage making out with some handsome stranger who showed up at the show. So sad, and so tragic.Emil Jannings did an amazingly wonderful job of portraying this multidimensional professor. The movie was in German with English subtitles, so for me it wasn't so much the words that he said, but his facial expressions that conveyed the emotions to me.The pacing of this movie might feel slow to viewers of modern-day go-go-go movies, but I feel the pace was exactly right for exploring the characters and emotions of both the professor and Lola.If you have the patience for subtitled, slowly-developing movies, I do highly recommend this one.My rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First great sound film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today, most people know this film as featuring Marlene Dietrich's signature tune "Falling in Love Again." But it was the first sound film to be made in Germany; and is the first great sound film to be made anywhere. Although it exists also in an English version that was made at the same time, both Dietrich and Jannings give better performances in their native language; and, as the sound is rather poor, it is easier to follow in German with the English sub-titles. Jannings was the first actor to win an Academy Award (though not for this film) and his performance as the professor who is lead to ruin by a femme fatale remains one of the memorable film performances. Fans of Dietrich should not miss this film which brought her international success. This is one of those films that only grows with continued viewing. If you were fond of Cabaret, then this is the real Germany between the World Wars. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...And God Created a Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film which was released in 1930 had propelled Marlene Dietrich (and her singing and her legs) to the international stardom. But the film belongs to Emil Jannings in the role of the respected, straight-laced, balding, aging, and portly High School English Professor who became absolutely obsessed by Dietrich's Lola - a cabaret's singer and dancer. His first step toward cabaret "The Blue Angel" was his first step to humiliation, madness, ruin, and ultimately, death. It is not the first time in the history or in Art when a man falls for a wrong (for him) woman ("Carmen", anyone?) and loses his mind, his status, and his life because of her but it is certainly one of the most heartbreaking stories that started as a light musical comedy and came to the sad but inevitable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw the very recent re-lease at the Detroit Institute of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The print was excellent, sound re-mastered as well as possible, and with new and (one of the convenors said) better sub-titles. Yes, it was well worth trip, especially since there is a prologue: the screen test Dietrich did in 1929 which she really hams up, one of the best parts of the whole presentation.Being not a Jannings or Dietrich maven, I am not in a good position to comment on their performances, nor am I in like position to address Sternberg's direction. It is simply worth seeing as a mile-post in film history since it was Germany's first full length talkie and it sent its female lead to America. (No Dietrich did not "flee the Nazis." She left too early.) I was fascinated by the opportunity to see Dietrich, believe it or not, whom I had never seen in a film. My mother (86) did not have much good to say before I went, dismissing her as a "lousy singer" as well as "ugly." Mom was an old show girl herself, and a looker, so I suspect a touch of envy.The story of THE BLUE ANGEL does share certain elements with CABARET -- and was decidedly racy in its age -- without the political overtones. It is sad, and as I say, "not for a first date." To repeat: A must for students of European inter-war film, as well as those who want to see just how far they pushed the new technology in the late '20s. As for star appeal, this was not her first film as is sometimes believed, so BLUE ANGEL was not where "it" all stated, but shows how Dietrich hit her stride at thirty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get this DVD and don't miss the film test in the extras!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie probably ten times over the years, and it always gives me goose bumps. You definitely want the German version, though the subtitles miss the puns ("ein vogel I'm kopf" in the scene near the end) and even the basic translation, sometimes. The worst was when they took the English film's song text as the subtitle for the German version. "Falling in love again" is not a particularly good translation of "From head to toe made of nothing but love." When it has to be sung, you could kind of forgive the movie makers, since they needed to keep the score the same.But, anyway, the two DVD version has a bunch of extras including the screen test that IMDb mentions on the main page. What a scream! The piano player is a really incompetent accompanist, and Dietrich continually breaks from singing in English to tell me what an a-hole he is! I laughed so hard I cried. If you don't have two disc Kino DVD, though, you're really missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jannings as much as Dietrich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible Spoiler* Although this was not Dietrich's first film it was the one that seems to have got everyone's attention. She does quite well in this role and has her moments of charm but for this viewer she's more of an acquired taste. What really makes this film powerful is the performance by Emil Jannings as Prof. Immanuel Rath and the profound descent in his state of mind that is so well played out through the course of the movie. The somewhat comical, pompous professor that starts out the story is hardly even recognizable in the broken man who in the end, pathetically tries to be apart of the vaudeville act of his lost love. The dark air and mood of where this film ends up is made all the more powerful by the light and amusing place it begins. Director von Sternberg pulls of this trick as well as any movie that has tried, from any period and is what makes this an enduring classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downfall of an Arrogant Academic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blue Angel features a simple but effective narrative, showing the fall of a man into degradation and squalor. As such, it echoes the themes in early Weimar cinema such as Pandora's Box. The narrative is, indeed, so simple, that this early "talkie" could just as easily have been a silent film. Only rarely is the new sound technology explored to good effect, such as when songs can be heard when the doors from Lola's room to the stage are periodically opened and closed by characters. There is also, of course, the use of song, with Dietrich's voice showcased to good affect.Emil Jannings portrays the stereotype of an academic perfectly: arrogant, insular and with some minor eccentricities, he is unable to cope with life in the "real world" and this leads to his fall from grace. Initially, we in the audience, like his students, see him as a clown, a laughable, pompous yet bumbling figure. His ultimate fate is to be exposed to the whole town as a fool when, stripped of his power, he literally becomes a clown before seeking to return to the insularity of his old post.However, the Professor is not the only loathsome character in this film. The attitude of the students is as despicable as that of their tutor: with their arrogant and bullying behaviour, whilst they are his nemesis, they are also his mirror. They are growing into his image and, with his growing captivation with Lola, he is growing into theirs.Lola is an equally unlikable character and perhaps, once again, reflects concern amongst conservatives in Weimar society about the growing power of women. She is far smarter than the "learned" professor in terms of her ability to understand and manipulate people. Going out on the stage each night is the opposite to his insular world yet it his "act" of appearing respectable in society that this actress is able to quickly pull apart, exposing the shallow man inside.The bird motif used throughout the film is strikingly effective. At the start, the bird who can no longer sing is callously discarded by the housekeeper, just as the worn-out, useless Professor will be discarded, first by the school and then by society. The doomed bird motif is also prefigured by the birds near the clock as the procession of ghoulish statues marches past with each hour. Finally, the Professor himself is humiliated during the clown and magician routine, forced to have doves fly out from under his top hat and to crow like a rooster.Ultimately, this is a brilliant film and, like much late Weimar cinema, reflects themes of moral decline and degradation. This time, however, the character is deeply unlikable from the outset and his humiliation is really an increasing expose to the world of his pre-existing inner nature. He does not grow or transform as a character; rather, as his power is stripped, his true nature is revealed. The learned academic is the biggest fool of all. Stripped of his position and prestige, the academic is nothing more than a clown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No fool like an old fool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we are fortunate, we all grow old, and we see the bright spark of youth all around us and we can't participate. Sometimes there are moments when one doesn't see what is happening around him or her. Signals are sent and received, and because of our longing for a past time, we can become victimized by our own longings. This is a film about a man who is as respected as one can be. College professors in Germany at this time were a little like rock stars. Unfortunately, the students weren't always the ones to show the respect and they could become a little nasty. The professor makes a fatal mistake. Because of his seriousness in his long life, he has not stopped to smell the archetypal roses. When he becomes infatuated with the leggy Marlene Dietrich, it's all over. She is a consummate flirt. She is not an unkind person. She flirts with all men. After all she works in a music hall. How the professor could be so shortsighted is not known, but there are thousands of such cases where old men have sold their lives for a few moments of affection. He wakes up when it is too late. I remember this movie fondly. Our local public television station picked up the Janus film festival. And some of my TA friends from grad school would meet on Wednesady nights to watch these. It was my introduction into the viewing of significant films. Renoir, Trauffaut, Lang, etc. It was a marvelous time and we learned a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was younger I found this film in its English-translated version amusing and vaguely disturbing. Now that I am older, I no longer find it amusing, but it still unsettles me. I just finished watching the original German version, and must say this film remains haunting. The cinematography is very good. Details that escaped me as a young man now seem so obvious. The director had certain elements of the human condition down pat. I particucularly appreciate how "Dr. Rath" comes to assume the role of the clown as the film progresses, his appreciation of the role, and his colleagues' cluelessness. The heartless cruelty of his students earlier (&amp; later?) in the film resonates as well. The more things change the more they remain the same. Von Sternberg certainly knew how to construct a film. Miss Dietrich delivers an amazing performance for such a young actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here 3 fine examples how director Josef von Sternberg has used the new medium sound:1) At the beginning Professor Rath's landlady (an older woman) calls him with the words ?Herr Professor, breakfast!". He appears and takes his seat. Then he whistles to stimulate his canary to sing, but soon he finds out that the bird is dead. A few days later when he wakes up in Lola's room (at the Blue Angel) after a night of drinking, her canary sings very intensely. Then the young and beautiful Lola says: ?Breakfast, Herr Professor!"2) At school Rath gets annoyed and asks his pupils a difficult literary question. While they try to write down the answer, he opens the window and one hears a female class sing the German folk song ?Aennchen von Tharau". He walks through the class room and seemingly enjoys the situation. Then he catches one pupil with a special postcard of Lola. He confiscates the postcard and immediately closes the window. The singing of those innocent school girls and the shameless picture of night-club singer Lola - that goes not together for him.3) Whenever Rath walks through that narrow street which leads to the Blue Angel, a long melancholic sound of a ship's hooter is to hear. When he goes to the night-club for the first time to ?rescue" his pupils, he is dressed like a gentleman and moves from right to left. His second visit indicates that he has already left the straight right path. And at the end he looks like a tramp and staggers from left to right, but it's too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When love doesn't conquer all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a majestic film (despite the appalling sound of the English version - I still have to seek out the German one). Marlene Dietrich is magnificent - she would be better in Morocco, Destry Rides Again, etc. but this is a good indication of what she would achieve later. Enigmatic, cynical, manipulative, beautiful. But it is Emil Jannings who is the class act in this film - a funny, disturbing, sensitive and moving performance of the fuddy-duddy professor who falls from a position of high respect to despair and ridicule. Interesting to compare with his performance as the devious Devil in Murnau's Faust a few years earlier. A wholly enjoyable cinema experience which is beautifully shot (notice the figures on the clock or the seedy interior of the Blue Angel) and which lingers long in the memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often referenced as one of the highlights of the golden age of German cinema, and being based upon a strong story by one of the great German authors, the Blue Angel is nevertheless most significant for giving birth to a Hollywood legend ? the screen persona of Marlene Dietrich.The coming of sound was dealt with differently in different countries. In Europe they tended to be a little less keen to ditch the qualities of silent pictures, and their early talkies are generally low on dialogue and use sound more as an embellishment than a means of imparting information. Although Austrian-born Josef von Sternberg was a Hollywood director, even in his US talkies he focused largely on the imagery and made the dialogue almost superfluous. The German studio was therefore perhaps a little more suited to von Sternberg's method than those back in the states. In the Blue Angel the sound is simply another layer on top of all the shadows and clutter of the von Sternberg visual style. For example, he uses abrupt sounds to punctuate a scene, such as the door shutting and cutting off the music. This auditory punctuation would be explored further in his next film, Morocco.The music of the Blue Angel is also effectively employed as a backdrop to the action. You can see what I call von Sternberg's "eyes across a crowded room" technique (where the romantic leads make eye contact, and we cut from crowd shots to increasingly close shots of their faces) in his silent pictures. Now that it's done while a song plays out it has much more weight, much more rhythm, and the wordlessness of that eye contact is emphasised. The "eyes" moment in the Blue Angel is actually a little lacklustre compared to the brilliantly intense equivalent in Morocco, but this is understandable as the resulting relationship is less fiery.As with all the Dietrich/Sternberg collaborations, the centre of the Blue Angel is of course Marlene. A relatively inexperienced performer, in her first sound film, and coming from the German tradition of screen acting which tended to be exaggerated and theatrical, and yet she delivers such a natural, believable performance. With her singing voice and good vocal delivery the sound revolution is also a boon for her. The authenticity of Marlene's acting is in fact somewhat out of kilter with the heavy stylisation of von Sternberg's direction, and many of their films together were in fact saved by her performance. It's a shame though that in all these pictures she plays essentially the same character, because (unlike von Sternberg) she had a fantastic range.It's a pity too that, in contrast to Marlene, Emil Jannings is seemingly incapable of playing any role without some degree of comical overstatement. Fine, if that's what you need (as in, say, Faust), but here it doesn't quite fit in, particularly in the earliest scenes. Of course, it's important that Professor Rath is a bit of a buffoon so that we see a hint of the clown in the schoolteacher, but the effect would have been so much stronger had Jannings given a realistic portrayal of stuffiness and pomposity, rather than this caricature.It's funny how, as well as this being the launch pad for Dietrich's career, it meant that Marlene herself would give a few more years of life to Sternberg's. It wasn't just Sternberg's irascibility and desire for creative control that cut short his career (after all look how far John Ford got on much the same reputation) ? it was also the fact that he cared far more about playing about with lights than he did about bringing out the storyline or the quality of acting ? and that was a problem for producers (not to mention the audience!). But, for the time being, he had established a star/director partnership which meant his pictures would be a success. As soon as that partnership was ended in the mid-1930s, it would be all downhill for von Sternberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, the only other Josef von Sternberg film I've seen before this was "The Last Command" also starring Emil Jannings (as a matter of fact, he won the first best actor oscar for it). The parallels between the two films are striking (and I won't ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it yet). It seems evident that Von Sternberg is fascinated with the theme of a return to a period of stability and happiness enjoyed earlier in one's life. And why shouldn't he be? He pulls it off brilliantly in both films. His direction is dead-on. The way he subtlely draws significance to the clock a few times throughout the film, and slowly tracks backwards revealing the empty classroom prepares the viewer for the brilliant ending he has in store. Also, I need to add a few words about Emil Jannings, who is easily one of the greatest screen actors of all time. I loved his performances in Murnau's "The Last Laugh" and "Faust", but this was the first "talkie" I've seen of his, and he was just as brilliant, you'll never forget the expression on his face as he stares in the mirror with clown makeup on.</fullReview>

After she sweeps him off his feet, the bloom comes off the rose and he realizes she no longer loves him.

		<fullReview>I found many interesting points in Der Blaue Engel. Which means I had time to think it over while the film was running (well not so fast indeed). The problem is I felt nothing: no sympathy for Emil Jannings' character and no enthusiasm for Marlene's Lola Lola either.It is well written, the settings are accurate and the story is simple but not compelling. That Blue Angel is far too mundane a den of vice and it results too linear a tragedy compared with all that I was expecting. Still it's perhaps the first step towards noir film.So I might say good job but I won't shortlist it among the greatest movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You remember when Melanie sang 'I've got a brand new pair of roller skates, you've got a brand new key"? The subliminal subtext was more than palpable, and it's what I immediately thought of when Lola Lola sang "But I don't let any man lay a paw on my keys". When Melanie Safka wrote her song there wasn't any hidden agenda there, she said "I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune", while people hearing it read their own ideas into the lyrics. Well, so much for that.This film just struck me the wrong way on all kinds of levels. There's no way I could rationalize the attraction Lola (Marlene Dietrich) could have had for Professor Rath (Emil Jannings). I could see it going the other way of course, who wouldn't, but at the same time, the Professor would not have had a realistic view of himself to have fallen for a cabaret singer like Lola. Sure, the physical attraction was there, but throwing one's own life away for an unattainable goal seemed quite unrealistic. And yet, she married him anyway. Wow, I don't get it.It's difficult for me to figure out what director von Sternburg was trying to convey here. Throughout, I never got the impression that Lola loved Rath, and after four years of married life she threw him over for the Maestro Mazeppa (Hans Albers), another man for whom there didn't seem to be any attraction. Rath going berserk and getting the strait jacket treatment was probably the most realistic aspect of the story for me, otherwise most of the film just didn't resonate with this viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Der blaue Engel has funny and comic elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Der blaue Engel is the story about a totally dysfunctional marriage. When I saw the film for the first time, many years ago, I found it a depressing and nasty sight. For professor Rath, the spindle in the plot, is attached to love in the same way as an addict to hard drugs. He may not be the brightest person in the room, but at first he is a well respected member of his small community, and reasonably happy. But at the end, a few years later, he is just a wreck, and probably dead. My love for you, it came and went, so your feet are now in wet cement. I found it hard to believe that passion could completely destroy a sound character. It looked like a melodrama - which I detest. Nevertheless, Der blaue Engel deserves a second chance. For recently I saw the film again, and this time the narrative impressed me. The events are quite symbolic. In the first scene Rath whistles for his parakeet, but it has died. Rath is socially less clever than his pupils, with the exception of one, who is therefore nagged by his comrades. It is a tough school, they have their own coroner (joking). Rath is myopic and can not control his pupils. Later Rath meets the singer Lola, when he tries to withdraw his pupils from her bad influence. Lola makes cluck-cluck sounds, and Rat crows, indicating that there is an immediate and intuitive understanding. Naturally they marry. But Rath can not find his place in this troupe of performers. He ends as an unsound clown, who is only funny when eggs are smashed on his scull. It is understandable that Rat is soon a broken man. With a last effort he stumbles back to his school, and collapses into his old chair. His hand seize the writing desk, with such a strength, that the passing janitor is unable to remove Rath. Is he dead? Has he joined his parakeet? So, on second thoughts, Der blaue Engel has funny and comic elements. Rath is a born loser, with a resemblance with Laurel and Hardy, or Chaplin. If you are able to abstract from the melodrama, then Der blaue Engel is definitely recommendable. Don't forget to leave comments. I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Blue Angel" from 1930 made a star out of Marlene Dietrich and has a great performance by Emil Jannings. It's a very dark tale of obsession leading to degradation.The film is based on a novel by Heinrich Mann directed by Josef von Sternberg. It concerns a professor (Jannings) who goes to a club, The Blue Angel, where he learns his students go, and meets the hypnotic Lola (Dietrich). He falls in love with her, marries her, and starts down a road that leads to hell.This is a movie about images -- a dead bird, the magnificent Lola, Jannings as a clown, his descent into madness, his image in a mirror, and the final shot of him, utterly destroyed, at his old professor desk.This is German filmmaking at its best. Von Sternberg and Dietrich would head for America; Jannings, a Nazi collaborator, would stay put. Later Dietrich called him a "ham." He does give a big performance, but somehow, it isn't over the top. On a side note - Jannings was the winner of the first Academy Award, but in reality, he placed second. The winner? Rin Tin Tin. The Academy believed it wouldn't put them in a good light to give the award to a dog, so they denied Rin his award and gave it to Jannings instead. It's said he used to carry it with him.</fullReview>

When you look at how Prof. Immanuel Rath (Emil Jannings) lets his infatuation with nightclub singer Lola Lola (Marlene Dietrich) come to dominate his life, it seems very much like what happens to Humbert Humbert.Of course, the movie is best known for Dietrich's sexy performance as the liberated chanteuse (on which Madeline Kahn's character in "Blazing Saddles" was based). Dietrich must have been every man's dream after the movie came out. Still, the change in Prof. Rath's life caused by his obsession with her certainly stands out as well. All in all, Josef von Sternberg created a real masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems like director Von Sternberg had an axe to grind with men or the middle class. Emil Janning's Professor is staid and repressed but seems like a decent person and I don't know why he must be seen to lose it so much, if, as the director said, this was not a political allegory. That is either disingenuous or the Professor is not the stable person he seems the first 2/3 of the film. The only other explanation is that Von Sternberg sees Lola (the amazing Marlene Dietrich) as a very destructive person. I found this an overly melodramatic film which makes a cartoonish depiction of a middle-class German. The acting is fantastic from Dietrich and Jannings but I found this a baffling film. I had expected that the Professor would fall in love and they would have a more stable relationship, but their relationship falls apart when the Professor is completely irrational at the attention his wife is getting. While this isn't unreasonable, that he becomes SO unhinged seems really unlikely. I don't understand why his seemingly sweet wife and also someone who seemed deeply in love with him turns away from him so quickly. If Von Sternberg wanted to make that storyline, they should have made the Professor a bit more unlikable. This was really a disappointing film. I hoped for a more nuanced, thoughtful depiction of a man learning to see the beauty in things he had previously looked down on. Von Sternberg makes the Professor a baffling character through which there is no throughline from his character before and after marrying Lola.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Carmen" who got away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just caught the Metropolitan's 2010 production of "Carmen" on film during the opera company's outdoor HD Live festival, I expected this film would end with Lola's comeuppance, if not murder. It was a little chilling, and, I have to admit, disappointing, to see her sitting pretty on-stage as her discarded, humiliated husband shuffles away into hopeless oblivion.This film, which I had taped from the City University of New York's excellent TV channel, suffered from horrible visual and sound quality but it managed to keep my attention throughout. It seems a case study in the follies of trying to live without the benefit of self-knowledge. Professor Rath -- was he supposed to be Jewish in this film made as Naziism was on the rise in Germany? -- was a misfit and a clod, a man who found his place in life through his book knowledge. What was missing in him was any sense of who he was as a man. Rath demonstrated his ineptness outside of the ivory tower by blundering into Lola's dressing room, a fateful breaking of social boundaries. Lola treats Rath as one might an old teddy bear. When he proposes marriage, gorgeous Lola cackles hysterically, but it wouldn't occur to Rath to wonder what this might mean. Lola accepts the offer, though one would have to assume the union will never be consummated. (Rather than gaining a love partner, she takes in the father she probably never knew.)Rath's eventual rejection is inevitable. The only surprise here is Lola's getting off scot free. Maybe she thinks about her actions a little; she does seem to darken somewhat during the course of the film. However, she's ultimately left pretty much unscathed by the final credits. Interestingly, Dietrich goes on from this film to become a success in Hollywood, whereas the actor who played Rath remained in Germany to participate in Nazi-propaganda films from which which his career never recovered -- an outcome that pretty much parallels the movie's plot line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of Cads, Clowns, And Conjurers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh what a depressing movie! I don't know which is bleaker: the story or the production design. In one of Germany's first films using sound, Emil Jannings plays a dignified professor whose morality is such that he gets upset when his young, male pupils visit a local cabaret, called "The Blue Angel". Here, Lola Lola (Marlene Dietrich) is the main attraction, a young woman with a come-hither appeal, who sings, amid a backdrop of cads, clowns, and conjurers. The shabby stage looks like it's straight out of a cheap vaudeville show.As the plot moves along, the professor investigates the seedy nightclub, and sees the tawdry performances and dingy atmosphere. Yet Lola Lola has an effect on the professor, and he is never quite the same again. It's a story of pretense, trickery, deception, and flimflam.The B&amp;W visuals are incredible for their bleakness. I don't recall a film where the interiors were so drab: ugly wooden floors, small cramped rooms, cheap furniture, dirty windows, distracting clutter, a naked light bulb dangling from the ceiling. Costumes are just as cheerless.Characters' surroundings are so dreary that they reek of grinding poverty. And I wonder if this film might perhaps reflect on the dire financial condition of Germany in the years immediately following WWI. One might speculate that the professor represents the German middle class, impoverished, put-upon, and humiliated as a result of Germany's defeat.The Nazis banned "The Blue Angel" in 1933, and some of the cast members ended their lives tragically. The film thus has considerable historical significance. Whatever one may think about this film, it is sure to leave an impression on the viewer. For me, that impression mostly was a heightened sense of gloom and sadness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jannings, as the professor lost in a different world, is sad and brilliant, and Dietrich glows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The crowning achievement of Weimar cinema," the blurb on the DVD box says. Yes. The photography is brilliant, with crooked German streets, rooftops and smoking chimneys, and the stage-backstage world, fake and glamorous and intense and langorous all at once. Professor Dr. Rath (Emil Jannings) is not so much repressed, as so many overly Freudian commentators would have it, as set in his ways inside a quiet, limited world. That is, he is not a figure of fun per se, until he wanders out of his world, which he does both literally and figuratively. Lola-Lola (Marlene Dietrich) is wonderfully fresh and petulant and (against type) sweet, though later she grows colder. Actually, the already clichéd femme-fatale plot is the weakest part of the film, though if you're going to hire a siren, you might as well get the best. The notion that the cabaret is decadent is undercut by its glamour, though there is room for pitiful degradation, too. Von Sternberg lighting prevails, and the film is always a delight to look at, with the clean digital remastering from the original negative. The DVD includes Dietrich's screen test, which is cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films that revolve around performance are essentially about cinema, I'm always on the lookout for these. But unlike the more traditional films about the making of films - Day for Night, Contempt, The Stunt Man, Shadow of the Vampire, etc - those about performance have the extra allure that we have to participate in staging the illusion; it falls on us to imagine the cinematic scenario, and thus complete the notion, actually see in our minds how it completes. It is the best kind of in-sight into creative life - which is every life on the planet, a long series of invention, deception, connection.In The Red Shoes for example, it was a dance between us from the position of the camera and the stage where the story is being danced out. A more intriguing vision we find in the silent Dr. Mabuse, with us looking to apprehend the criminal mastermind who under various guises manipulates the narrative we see. Or the continuation of this in The American Friend, another German film; a 'frame' artist who becomes framed in an illusion that unfolds, this is the film within, as gangster stuff around Europe.This second group is more competent because the film-within, in whatever form, is better integrated inside the outer film. But in all these cases the main subject remains the same; the effort to discern boundaries between a life we control, and so a narrative we are free to improvise as best we can, and a life that is framed, scripted and storyboarded around us from outside.(the truly wise filmmakers understand how these are the same; how, in other terms, the best actors in life are those who are completely clueless about the narrative and therefore effortlessly natural, and those who have studied it and can exercise volition to reshape themselves into what the role requires).Sternberg had made a film about film before this, a more explicit but astounding vision of a filmed reality that prophesied New Wave thirty years before. This is more inconspicuous, less singlemindedly about self-reference, with interesting crowds and rooms around the stage that we can loose ourselves into. It is just endearing to watch on a very basic level, occasionally pretty funny; and in the end thoroughly gut-wrenching.Yet it is still very much about a man losing himself into a performance. What entices him and us is the woman; in fact, we are made to share the male point-of-view so adeptly, the camera always strategically placed where it can be teased and seduced by long legs in stockings, by large eye-lashes making promises, that it is not just the professor, but us as well, more importantly us, that want to let go and be absorbed in the sexual fantasy. It's no wonder she is so captivating, we know after all how Sternberg would grow to worship her, and bind, fully devote his craft to images of her.The second part is where it's truly grueling to watch, where the professor, a pillar of morals and ethos at the start, is completely subsumed inside the fantasy and loses all. Again Emil Jannings puts on a costume. So many fascinating things then happen so quickly, I was left with jaw open.We revisit the cabaret stage from before, only now, quite literally, from inside the mirror looking out; now we are the spectacle, the show being looked on, with being made to perform as the price exacted for having fully invested in the feverish, sultry dream in the first place. Now we are what is being dreamed - this trope is what Lynch has worked and innovated from.And again the distinction between the performance as perceived from outside, with jeers and catcalls, and the human being inside as we know it to suffer. As with all those silent films before about clowns suffering from behind painted smiles, it is a tragic sight of humiliation and despair. When he bellows inordinately, the audience laughs, but we know it's the sound of a soul being torn apart.My only minor gripe, is with how forceful is this part, how emotional. Then again it makes sense; we are again so adeptly placed inside the character, and made to feel as broken as he is.The film ends with the woman performing again her number that captivated the audience so much, only now we understand what's behind the notes. "I'm programmed for love" sings Dietrich, the femme fatale - and so desire, sexual danger personified - who operated the performance from behind the stage. We have mostly come to know film noir from American film. But it was born in Germany, between Dr. Mabuse and this.It's a compelling moral, as in noir later: we are reminded again how dangerous it is to indulge the chimeras of the mind, ego and desire, and how the social fabric has its ways of eventually restoring us in the common, harmless delusions. It's okay to watch, anything more is at our spiritual peril.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Upright Man of Respect to Upset Puppet of Mockery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DER BLAUE ENGEL, one of the most famous German movies of the early sound era, has been analyzed by the majority of movie buffs as the vehicle for Marlene Dietrich, as the supreme movie of her career which opened to her the gates of Hollywood. Other aspects have usually tended to be put aside, skipped or just considered inferior. If critics did not agree with the 'praise' of Ms Dietrich, they highlighted the male lead, Emil Jannings. Yet...although the movie meant much to the two, what would the film mean nowadays? What would it offer us today if it were just a memory of one moment in the history of screen actors? Therefore, being fresh after viewing the film for the second time, I have decided to focus my comment on something that is perhaps less popular among film historians but much more convincing for today's viewers.DER BLAUE ENGEL is foremost a greatly human movie. It is a story of a way of life, the tragic way life from intellectual freedom and good reputation to entire dependence and mockery. What captivates and provokes all sorts of thoughts is the situation of the main character, Professor Immanuel Rath (Emil Jannings) who experiences dreams of loneliness, trust of naiveness, bliss of lure, arousal of lust, sweetness of affection, shock of disillusion, bitterness of misunderstanding, helplessness of mockery and trauma of despair. It is in no way the movie about the manipulative femme fatale, Lola Lola (Marlene Dietrich), but about the professor whose unreasonable deeds lead him not only to the end of his professional career but also to his personal tragedy. It is one of the very few movies which executes its story with the reference to human states of mind. In this respect, lots of effort has been taken to appeal to the viewers of the 1930s and, unpredictably, to the viewers of the 21st century. It still touches us, shocks, makes us think, laugh a little bit, cry. Why? Because of its potential for psychology developed by the producers and certain viewers who can notice deeper aspects. Therefore, I don't hesitate to say that DER BLAUE ENGEL is one of the most thought provoking movies ever made.SCENES: Through its particular execution of Mise-en-scene, the director Joseph Von Sternberg attempts to show the inner experience of the main hero through characteristic setting of scenes. In this way, every detail pays off since it is there to represent something concrete: a feeling or experience, perhaps. The stillness of camera which constitutes one of typically theatrical features of the movie still influenced by the silent era (don;t forget it was made in 1930) leads viewers to pay attention to these details of images. Consider, for instance, the professor kneeling before Lola Lola and taking on the stockings on her legs as, ironically, a good husband. What does it represent if not sheer lust making man a servant to the extend of "slave." Another perfect moment is the close up of the calender days being burned by lack of sense filled with bitterness of disillusion. I would add, among many other moments, the scene when professor wakes up in Lola's room with a doll in his hand and he hears the chirping of the bird - here, illusively, it seems he has found what was lost in his life, it seems he has been "blessed" by an angel who would fulfill all his desires. Yet, it occurs later that this alleged blessing turns to a real curse...EXECUTION OF CONTENT: The professor's way from respect to mockery is presented in the brutal way, sometimes extremely powerful scenes that may still shock but have not lost anything after all these years. Yet, isn't that the bitter experience that life appears to deliver us in such circumstances? People laugh at him, this time not at the manner he blows his nose but something much more serious... they laugh at him as at the entire human being no longer being accepted by the society: a learned man conquered by a harlot, a laughter at the human being subjected to mockery, forced to do tricks and crow like a cock in order to amuse... Indeed, a shameful image of man deprived of respect, dignity, deprived of fundamental happiness! Do you find enough courage to laugh at him, too? Or, perhaps, these are the inhabitants of professor's hometown that should be laughed at since they know nothing about life and its complications...That is how I watched this movie being filled with reflections I would like to share with you. Thoughts...just ones among many but the ones I hope you'll find helpful. DER BLAUE ENGEL is really worth seeking out but not worth being seen only with the emphasis on Dietrich's dawn of career or Jannings' yet another dramatic role. There is much more about it... As a matter of fact, a beautiful woman does not give all or at least shouldn't... 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong emotional portrayal of the downfall of a man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one great and effectively powerful movie, that focuses all around the mental breakdown of a man, who has given up basically everything for the woman he falls in love with. Love, like always, makes blind, causing things to go from bad till worse for the main character Prof. Immanuel Rath, played by the always impressive Emil Jannings.The movie is a good looking one with these sort of beautiful fake looking German expressionistic backgrounds and sets, that were mostly popular in the '20's and also part of the early '30's, such as this movie is from. It also at times has got some good cinematography. The sound quality and editing of it isn't always great but who can blame them, considering that this movie is from the period when 'talkies' were still in its baby shoes.It has a story that sort of slowly progresses and has a couple of overlong sequences. All reasons to not regard this movie as one of the best ever made but that doesn't take away that this is a real good movie from Josef von Sternberg.Things really start to start off after the movie is about halve way though, when Prof. Immanuel Rath's life and career starts to go in a downward spiral.Who ever said movies are made only to entertain? I'm sorry by I'm just sort of getting sick and tired of people constantly commenting negatively on movies just because they make them depressed. In that regard "Schindler's List" would be the worst movie ever made. Often these sort of depressing movies are among the best since it means they influence your emotions and touch you therefor are effective and also simply really well crafted ones.Even though it's an heavy movie with a dramatic story, it also has got plenty of entertainment in it. Lots of moments are really fun and just downward comical like, with also some weird and fun characters in it.With a great role from Emil Jannings, who was perhaps the very best actor of the '20's and even was the first person to receive an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. What made Emil Jannings mostly so great was that he could both play convincingly in a dramatic and comical way, often also in one and the same movie. This is also one of those movies, in which he plays a very serious character who in this movie also gets in some odd and comical situations. Jannings handles these comical moments extremely well, through minimalistic acting. The movie also features Marlene Dietrich in an early role before her real stardom. This movie was really the one that launched her career. Besided her acting skills, she also gets the chance to show of her singing skills in this movie. Though it's a bit funny that she is supposedly a native English speaker in this movie, even though she has a clear fat thick German accent.A real powerful and effective quality film, from the early days of sound cinema.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overrated films I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a myth but I really can not understand why. The story itself is relatively absurd but that alone would not have made it impossible to make a good movie out of it. But the actions of Professor UnRath and Lola are never really motivated. He changes from being infuriated to being fallen in love from one moment to the other, she becomes a vamp without really showing the reason for it. Moreover to my opinion the acting is not too good: the characters move around relatively uncoordinated.Nevertheless the film was deeply influential. Even in the Nazi periods films like "Zu neuen Ufern" by the later emigre Detlef Sierck/ Douglas Sirk or "Feuerzangenbowle" took some elements from it, although it was forbidden. Fassbinder's outstanding "Lola" draws heavily on it.The film itself is inspired by master works of German expressionism, especially "Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari" but it does not succeed in creating a dense atmosphere.Therefore: interesting as a document of film and general history.

		<fullReview>The Blue Angel is one magical movie. A story about people and human feelings. A love story about two different people. What people do for love? What all people permit themselves because of love? I do not intend to generalize, but it is quite interesting. The film, which is in his early comedy, after troubles becomes severe human drama. Josef Von Sternberg is only good tease, and he may have hit the target substance. The entire film is imbued with a strong erotic charge and works quite refreshing. Marlene sings one of the great songs in movie history. I maintain that without any pathos.This movie in man awakens different feelings. Emotions are not superficial and often leads man to the brink of the abyss. This is a little strange mix of comedy and tragedy that few people indifferent.Marlene Dietrich (Lola-Lola)has offered us her best performance. A man is hard to understand this character. Sincere only while singing. Playful and seductive, cold and repulsive. Hypnosis at any time without any shame.Emil Jannings as Professor Rath in its best performance. A respected educator, head over heels, devoted husband, henpecked, clown and eventually broken and destroyed the old man. All this in one film. This is the story of a professor Unrat. I wonder what the professor did not notice the clown in the first part of the film. Love can be blind if you Marlene plays before your eyes. I'm kidding of course.This is the best European film of the year.A small film that you in one part elicits a constant smile on your face. In the second part of the movie you gently removed the smile from your face</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tragic fall of Professor (Un-)Rath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a play on words that you will only be able to understand if you understand the German language. "Der blaue Engel" or "The Blue Angel" is a German black-and-white film from over 85 years ago that is considered one of the early sound classics. This was written and directed 3 years before the Nazis' rise to power by filmmaker Josef von Sternberg, briefly before he directed "Morocco", the movie that brought him and lead actress Marlene Dietrich also their first/only Oscar nominations. Emil Janning, however, was already an Academy Award winner when "The Blue Angel" was made. And looking at this film, it is not difficult to believe that he was one of the finest actors of this era. Of course, his character is not as epic and memorable as Dietrich's, but in my opinion he gives the better performance. Lola Lola profits a lot from how perfect Dietrich is for the part and also from how she is written. Today she is considered among the most significant femmes fatales in film history. Poor professor.There exist quite a few versions of this film, but the one I saw runs for 107 minutes roughly and thus is neither among the shortest nor the longest existing. Apart from the famous lead duo, this film also includes a supporting performance by Hans Albers, who later became a star in his own right. I must say there are not that many early films that I liked or even loved, but this one here made for a good watch mostly for Jannings' great portrayal. It is interesting to see how skeptical Dietrich was about her probably most iconic performance when she was considerably older and also how skeptical she was about herself for accepting to play the character, even if it was her big breakthrough role. And finally there is also Kurt Gerron playing a magician in here, an actor and filmmaker who faced a tragic fate a decade later and his film "Theresienstadt" tells us a unique story about his later years.But back to this film here. People who don't mind old black-and-white films with subtitles (unless they are German of course) will have a good time watching this one here, of course they could also go for the English-language version, even if that one is probably more difficult to get a hand on. Some really memorable scenes in this under-2-hour film and I recommend checking it out. It also reminded me of a "real" version of Bob Fosse's "Cabaret" and I would not be too surprised if Minnelli's character was inspired by Dietrich's and both male protagonists are teachers. Can't be a coincidence, even if this one here takes place before the Nazi years. I cannot say I enjoyed "Der blaue Engel" as much as "Cabaret", but this is only because I really love the latter and there's no denying "Der blaue Engel" has a couple truly memorable music sequences too from start to finish. However, it starts as a comedy, but becomes pretty dramatic and dark the longer it runs. I recommend checking it out. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jannings and Dietrich Together!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elderly professor (Emil Jannings)'s ordered life spins dangerously out of control when he falls for a nightclub singer (Marlene Dietrich).How do you beat the combination of Emil Jannings, one of the greatest actors of German cinema, and Marlene Dietrich, who is something of a legend? I mean, is any other German-American actress of her generation even close to being as famous? (I could say Lil Dagover, but many would say "who?") The film was released in both German and English versions. I only watched the English one (so far), so the difference is unclear. One thing can be said: Dietrich was much more natural in English than Jannings, who seems out of place. When she tells him to speak "in her language", it is quite believable that English is her native tongue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic for Different reasons than being a Great Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blue Angel is essentially about a cuckolded relationship and how it leads to one man's ruin.This movie put Dietrich on the map and was filmed simultaneously in both German and English. But there isn't a lot of dialog. Sound was still new and it's made almost as a silent movie would be made. It only runs 60 minutes.One of the funny things in this movie is that the students all look like they are 30 years old. Nothing has changed in nearly 100 years!Very well filmed and even tho it is clearly set a long time ago, the movie doesn't feel overly dated, although the story itself is. I guess that's the sign of a classic. I cannot say it's a great movie. But the cinematography and direction make it really compelling to watch. Within the movie, you can also realize why Sternberg had such problems in Hollywood. The pacing is rather slow and the 60 minutes feels much longer.The Plot Immanuel Rath, an old bachelor, is a professor at the town's university. When he discovers that some of his pupils often go into a speakeasy, The Blue Angel, to visit a dancer, Lola Lola, he comes there to confront them. But he is attracted to Lola. The next night he comes again--and does not sleep at home. This causes trouble at work and his life takes a downward spiral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three German actors with different destinies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Blue Angel" has a unique distinction among films that gives it historical significance. To my knowledge, it's the only movie made with three major actors from Germany who had such strikingly different destinies. Emil Jannings was a Nazi supporter, Marlene Dietrich fled the Nazis to America, and Kurt Gerron was killed by the Nazis in a concentration camp. In this film, Jannings plays Professor Rath, Dietrich plays Lola Lola, and Gerron plays the magician. The year before this film came out, Jannings became the first actor to win the best actor Oscar in the Academy Awards. He was an outstanding actor who befriended Nazi leaders and stayed in Germany during World War II. He continued to star in movies and made several propaganda films for the Nazis. With the end of the war, Jannings' career in films also came to an end. He died five years later at age 65 in Salzburg, Austria. This is the earliest look we have of the young starlet, Marlene Dietrich. She was 29 years when she broke into films. Unlike Jannings, Dietrich was one of many German stars who fled Germany and the Nazis in the 1930s. She would star in and make many movies in the U.S., and was a big supporter of the American troops and war effort. Kurt Gerron was a supporting actor on stage and in silent German films, and then a prominent performer and director in sound films through 1933. He was the first person to sing "Mack the Knife" by its original German title in the 1928 Berlin production of "The Threepenny Opera." Gerron was Jewish and fled Germany in 1933, first to France and then Holland. After the Nazis took The Netherlands, Gerron was sent to concentration camps. He wound up at Theresienstadt, the Nazi "show camp" in Czechoslovakia. After the phony-front camp passed an International Red Cross inspection that year, Gerron was forced to direct a documentary film of the camp for Nazi propaganda. When he finished work on "The Führer Gives the Jews a City," Gerron was sent to Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland where he was killed. He was just 47 years old. The war ended before the Nazis could use the film and it was destroyed in 1945. A small segment of the movie was discovered in Czechoslovakia in the mid- 1960s. I don't know how well "The Blue Angel" follows the German novel it is based on ("Professor Unrat" by Heinrich Mann), but this movie was puzzling in a number of places. A nagging question that I had at the end was "Why did Marlene Dietrich's character, Lola Lola, marry the professor? I suspect that the novel answered that question and that it added more to the pathos of the professor. Jannings plays the role well and is excellent as the forlorn lover. Even in this early German 'talkie,' Jannings' character is one of few words. So, we see more the facial expressions and the display of emotions that led to his receiving the first best actor Oscar in 1929. Jannings was one of the silent stars who had a huge persona in film that carried over into talking pictures. Many other actors were unable to make that transition. Some couldn't get away from the overacting that the silent films used in place of audio. Others didn't have good voices. In this film, the professor "falls for" Lola Lola when he sees her in the Blue Angel night club. The best word to describe his reaction is infatuation, because he is blinded to reality and circumstances. So, we see this man slip into the role of a lapdog and ridiculed, then fall into a man of hatred and despair. Dietrich's Lola Lola is what must have been typical of night club performers for that day, time and place. She obviously cared little about the professor, or anyone but herself, although she showed sweetness for the professor in the early scenes. The acting is mostly good all around, and the cinematography and scenes are excellent. But the film seems choppy in places. Other technical aspects suffer some. This is a good drama, but not a great film by any means. Still, it is a good look at the first best actor Oscar winner, the German starlet who would do well in the U.S., and a talented German performer and director who's career and life ended abruptly by death at the hands of the Nazis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succulent, Mellifluous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Von Sternberg's film is a wonderfully constructed piece of succulent and mellifluous tragicomedy. The fluently moving camera offers a beautiful sense of place, and especially the crooked pebble-stoned streets and leaning houses are the unforgettable epitomes of this film in my memory.Just as with Vigo's "L'Atalante" (1934), much of the film's power depends on us, as the audience, being able to fall in love with the lead actress. It certainly helps that the director did, and for once some knowledge of production enhances the experience: Umrat/Jennings as the jealous and passionate star, Dietrich as the object of desire not only of the boys but of the camera. I also really like the use of stairs, which clearly separate the differing worlds. I could definitely see this influencing "Zéro de conduite" (1933) and "Hets" (1944). The slow movement of the camera in the empty classroom after the crucial confrontation reveals one of the most touching visual moments I can think of (this is repeated later in an equally heart-breaking scene).I remember I was very young when I saw this for the first time. It made a lasting impression then, and I count it as one of the three films that ultimately made me fall in love with films to the extent that my thirst will never be quenched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blue Angel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They released this film filmed in two versions, they acted all the scenes in both German and English, but when I decided to watch this film from the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, I was going to watch the original German language version. Basically Professor Immanuel Rath (Emil Jannings) is the esteemed college preparatory high school educator who has punished many of his male students for spreading around the image of beautiful stage performer Lola Lola (Destry Rides Again's Marlene Dietrich). He hopes to catch the school boys in the cabaret club The Blue Angel, where she is the headlining act, and after her for himself he grows slowly passionate for her, and with a pair of panties snatched by a student he has a good reason to return there the following night. Having had a night of desire and such, Rath returns to class next day, with the Principal (Eduard Von Winterstein) furious to see the students running riot, and he is aware of the teacher's behaviour recently as well. He decides it is best to retire from the school, and with his newfound freedom he can marry Lola, but they cannot stay happy for long as their money problems grow, and to earn he is forced to become a stage clown in the cabaret troupe. Rath is often filled with jealousy and lust for his wife and her profession, she leaves herself open as a "shared woman", and he is being ridiculed for his past while performing as a clown. He performs his last act at The Blue Angel, and he is shocked to see Lola kissing her new love interest strongman Mazeppa (Hans Albers), and his rage turns into insanity, where he starts strangles his wife and is forced into a straitjacket. In the end, having been released from prison, Rath is not able to resolve his position as a school teacher, and he has obviously lost wife Lola, so he dies from extreme self pity clutching the school desks that once sat his loyal students. Also starring Kurt Gerron as Kiepert the Magician, Rosa Valetti as Guste the Magician's Wife, Reinhold Bernt as The Clown, Hans Roth as Beadle the Caretaker of the Secondary School, Rolf Müller as Pupil Angst and Robert Klein-Lörk as Pupil Goldstaub. Jannings - in his first talking picture - gives a mixed but equally interesting performance as the teacher turned performer with a troubled passion, and Dietrich is wonderful in her iconic top hat and black stockings as the seductive stage performer with a cruel streak, it is a film with some memorable sequences and moments that stand out, especially of course the cabaret stuff, making it a most watchable drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falling From Grace Over "Show Girl" or There's No Fool Like An Old Fool!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WE CAN WELL recall viewing this film for the very first time on a PBS Friday evening show. This was circa 1971 and we needed to go to such Public Television stations as our own WTTW, Channel 11 in Chicago in order to see many films which weren't shown on commercial TV Statiobs.WELL, HOW THINGS have changed. Just this passed Monday (2 days ago), Turner Classic Movies ran THE BLUE ANGEL in prime-time. It had been about 40 years (yes, count 'em, folks!) since our initial contact with Herr Josef Von Sternberg's dark, tragic drama. We had seen it once or twice during that period, but had never given it my undivided attention.ALTHOUGH IT IS a German language film, there was at least one of these showings was in a recently rediscovered English language version. We also remember a showing which was in German; but featured Miss Dietrich's performance of "Falling In Lov Again" in English.VIEWING A FILM SUCH as this very talky drama, while at the same time being compelled to read Subtutles, in order to follow the story can really prove to be a pain right where one sits. Yet, it does seem to become easier as the story progresses; as we become engrossed with the scenario unfolding, the dark yet starkly penetrating images, moody and highly atmospheric songs &amp; music and the virtuoso acting performances.THE STORY MAY seem somewhat complex; yet it is probably the very universal themes and connection with the lives and needs of all people that make this such a powerful and compelling of a story with such a long life as an all time favourite.IN SHORT, WE have a story of loneliness, the need to love and be loved, the falling from grace of a highly regarded and most straight laced of a member of academia. From perhaps a most distinguished position and and outstanding of a reputation as a Professor of Literature at the unnamed university, the professor (Mr. Emil Jannings) falls in love with a common, vulgar cabaret singer and exponent of sex, Lola Lola (Miss Marlena Dietrich).THE STORY COVERS a period of over five years, in which the middle aged, clearly un-handsome man discovers that he has fallen to such a degree of degradation as to not only being a minor entertainer; but also participating in selling his own wife. During appearances following Lola's doing her song, professor Roth's duties included peddling some rather pornographic type of postcards to the bawdy male patrons of the show.WE MUST CONFESS that even being a grown man, married with two children, there was an awful lot of obvious seedy goings on that I missed on previous viewings. Certainly, there were no examples of explicit on screen sex (such as have become so commonplace); and yet, with all of the occurrences we surely are forced to ask a few questions.IN ADDITION TO the setting of a night club with rather risqué programming, what is it that all of these college boys find so fascinating? Why do the young men hide from the Professor in secret rooms that are below the floors? What is the purpose of these rooms? Why does the proprietor worry about the presence of a police officer; for, isn't this a legal and licensed establishment? Do you think that there is sex for sale here? We do.THE AMAZING FEAT that is accomplished here is making such an interesting story out of such a sordid and low life segment of society.WE GIVE THIS five stars as our rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stuffy, lonely German college professor, laughed at by his immature pupils, ventures out to a cabaret in the village to berate his students for ogling the female entertainment; instead, he becomes infatuated with the star of the show, chanteuse Lola Lola, and apparently she to him. After marrying the flashy girl, the teacher leaves his profession to travel with the theatrical troupe, but life on the road immediately wears him down. An ugly little story, adapted from Heinrich Mann's novel "Professor Unrath", has a winking-nudging overlay of sexual byplay and was released to great acclaim in both German and English-language versions (this review pertains to the German version with subtitles). Director Josef von Sternberg was already a 15-year veteran of Hollywood movie-making by the time "The Blue Angel" arrived, and yet several sequences (most notably in the first reel and the last) are sloppily constructed and uncertainly paced. Emil Jannings is wonderful as the unloved professor who initially blossoms in the company of streetwise Marlene Dietrich, but his emotional unraveling is awfully quick in coming. Josef von Sternberg is far too sluggish in the beginning, but by the midway point he rushes the narrative...and the audience isn't allowed to get their bearings. As a result, the plot feels like a sadistic series of screw-turns, with no hope (or heart) in sight. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark side of romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set at the unlikely intersection of academia and the cabaret, The Blue Angel takes the familiar tale of boy meets girl/falls in love into a strange and wonderful cinematic territory. It foreshadows both Fellini's La Strada and Kubrick's Lolita, but I feel it is a better movie than either. Sternberg's most important accomplishment with The Blue Angel may have been simply the discovery of the theretofore unknown Marlene Dietrich, who does (not surprisingly) a superb job in the role of the provocative entertainer Lola Lola. Indeed, her performances alone are worth the viewing of the film, but the director goes far beyond a reliance on a few titillating song and dance numbers from the young starlet and (along with the writers) rewards the viewer with what are truly some of the most richly poignant moments one is likely to encounter in viewing a lifetime's worth of films. At least they were for me.It seems odd, viewing the film today, that Dietrich's performance on the stage begins so abruptly -- that is, with no fanfare or opening act to help launch the moment, but romance (in life, if rarely on celluloid) rises from such mundane beginnings. As the characters' feelings toward each other and toward their relationship evolve from this scene onward it seems, without exception, that the movie becomes better with each passing scene. Mind you, it's already pretty good by about 15 minutes in, but an hour later it's an absolute masterpiece. This can be attributed to two things -- first, the sublime use of allusions in later scenes to dialogue and imagery in earlier scenes and second (but no less importantly) the inspired performance of Emil Jannings as Professor Rath...and the man he becomes.If there is any fault to note at all it is that the broad elements of the plot line border on implausible, but there is of course no rule requiring filmmakers to limit themselves to ordinary cases in telling tales of love. Moreover, the important content here is not to be found in the plot synopsis but in the characters' portrayal of basic emotions, and in that respect the film is an unmitigated success.</fullReview>

I saw the German version so the language barrier kept me from fully enjoying the film. It was the very first Marlene Dietrich picture I ever saw and she was true to every complimentary description I had read of her. She was at the height of her raw, sensuous, lustrous beauty, before standardized by the Hollywood grooming machine. She looked sexy even with some baby fat. I personally enjoy her 30s work because she was in her prime (she started out a little late so by the time she made The Blue Angel she was already around 30). In fact my memory of the film blurs in general but Marlene is just too sensational to be forgotten?just look out for the numbers she crooned with her extraordinary husky voice. You'll fall in love with her right away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amongst movie audiences are those who have decided to become avid movie fans. Others press on, becoming studious and seek to know what the formula of a genuine Classic is. Indeed, a few dedicate their lives to discover a truly Classic film and realize one when they see it. Here is one you should have in your own collection of movies. A real classic shows you something rare or at least missing in so many which do not possess the power and magic. The film is called " The Blue Angel " a 1930 film which ranks among the greatest. Emil Jannings plays Prof. Immanuel Rath a collegial educator and die hard professor who teaches Fine Arts. He is a strict disciplinarian who commands respect in the college where he teaches. Marlene Dietrich is Lola Lola a nightclub singer, showgirl and entertainer who works with a traveling troop. Never having had a love life, Rath becomes easy prey for Lola who takes him for the ride of his life. What he won't do for love becomes only too obvious, yet he will pay and that makes for tragedy. Look closely, if you seek the secret formula and you'll find the obvious trademark of a true Classic. Highly recommended. ****</fullReview>

The sequence where the calendar is used to clean the curling iron is the first instance of showing the turning of a calendar's pages to indicate the passage of time. Now it's a cliché' - then it was near-genius. When Rath returns to his town, the students chant "Unrat!", which is a pun on his name, and means "rubbish". In the final scene, the bells are playing Papageno's aria from Die Zauberflote, "Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen". Papegeno is a comic character who dresses up like a bird, and is singing about his simple desire to find a wife. It's a perfect reference to Rath, but in total innocence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming story of an ordinary man who crossed all limits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blue Angel is not only an essential German film to be watched with attention but also a great world cinema classic which must be presented to all genuine film lovers.In simpler terms,it can be described as a poignant tale of an ordinary man who went overboard by marrying a Femme Fatale.In this film Professor Unrat digs his own grave by falling in love with a woman who represented beauty whereas he was aptly qualified to be called a beast.The film shows that in front of beauty even highly sensible men go crazy and lose everything.As both Prof and his students are mad about Lola Lola,it can be said that both old and young yearn for beauty.Although it was made in 1930s,a time when the concept of eroticism had not yet been fully developed by filmmakers,Der Blaue Angel remains a highly erotic film in its own manner as it relies heavily on its sparse dialogs as much as on its beautiful photography. The best lesson that can be learned from this film is that it is a good indicator of how show business looked in the era of black and white films.Watching Emil Jannings and Marlene Dietrich act marvelously,one is at utter loss to describe who the hunter is and who is being hunted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a choice between watching the German version and the English version and i chose the German version. It stars out with a college professor finding his students with a photo of girls from a nightclub. He goes there to look for his students but falls in love with a singer played by Marlene Dietrich. He becomes obsessed with her and is always there. All his students are laughing at him and he is fired. He asks her to marry him and he eventually becomes a clown in her act. I know that was Marlene Dietrich as the dancer but i could hardly even tell that was her. This is the first film I've seen of Josef Von Sternberg and Emil Jannings. Both Jannings and Dietrich are great in here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the masterpiece I expected, but still a good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watch, quietly sitting in our sofa, the slow forfeiture of a man, ready to loose everything for a women.Let's say it: the film hasn't an astonishing realization. "der letzte Mann" tells a similar story but looks much more modern and dynamic, six years before "das Blaue Engel". Murnau's silent movie (also starring Emil Jannings) stays sober and deep, but J. von Sternberg just annoys a little bit the viewer, at least during the first part. Besides, the acting of M.Dietrich is simply common.Besides those negative considerations, I really enjoyed the global atmosphere of the film (mostly confined spaces).**SPOILER**At the opposite, the big final, can be considered as an almost total success. The mix of despair, shame, broken heart feeling and humiliation that Prof.Rath undergoes is thrown at the viewer during ten breathtaking minutes. The contrast Between a boring beginning and this astonishing end increases the impact.**SPOILER**Overall, it is a film that is interesting to see, but not necessarily twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>early German sound introducing Marlene Dietrich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immanuel Rath is an older bachelor strict professor at the local college. He finds a student with a picture Lola-Lola (Marlene Dietrich) who is singing at local cabaret "The Blue Angel". He goes to the club to stop the corruption of his pupils. Instead he falls for the enticing entertainer. He resigns from the school to marry Lola. His limited savings are wasted and he's forced to perform as the clown. His dignity is lost. He grows jealous. He is ridiculed by everybody as he becomes a pathetic shadow of what he once was.It's one of the first sound German movies. It's most notable for introducing Marlene Dietrich to the world. She catches the attention of the modern world and would become an international star. Lola is an icon of uninhibited sexuality. This is a little slow compared to modern movies in spots around the middle after Rath's decline sets in. His destruction is inevitable. It is still compelling and Dietrich is magnetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sexy, Mildly Disturbing Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film a lot. It had good character establishment/development, good acting besides some over-obviousness at some points (which was characteristic of films in this era, so can't knock it too much). There was a multitude of great shots, creative angles, and innovative choices in editing- far more than I expected in a film from this time. The sound was clear and the lighting was impeccable. It was the most clean/professional-looking film thus far on my watchlist. The characters were very, very interesting. Lola Lola was hot and so was her attitude. Great performance by her, for sure, but the professor was truly outstanding. The range of emotions his character went through was so expansive, and so excellently portrayed. Great performances all around. The story was good, absolutely. Interesting, sexy, exciting, scary, tragic, and imperfect, of course. One thing I'm still adjusting to with watching old films is how insanely fast people fall in love??? It's like they have one good exchange and then they're embracing each other, grasping each other's biceps firmly with this abrupt burst of passion and commitment, touching noses. No one falls in love that fast. I don't know if their standards were different in real life back then or if they just hadn't worked out how to tell a story where love grows gradually instead of shooting up into the sky. It felt a little bit like lazy story-telling, but only on the romance level. The rest of it had normal pacing, for the most parts. It had its slow, boring moments, but it wasn't too bad. I guess the pacing was kinda weird, rather uneven. The professor's change in character was gradual, foreshadowed, and it made sense- but other developments I found were much too abrupt, without explanation. Anyway, I liked this film a lot. I do recommend it for a viewing. The conclusion was great, mildly disturbing. I wouldn't mind watching it again someday but I don't feel a need to include it in my collection anytime soon. 8/10 Bye love you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That is Quite Simply Unremakable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BLUE ANGEL may have a hackneyed, quasi-melodramatic plot, but it is quite simply brilliant nonetheless. In her debut feature, Marlene Dietrich is both sexy and dominant; photographed in a variety of states of déshabillée by Von Sternberg, she come across as someone with an instinctive feel for the camera. Her songs are beautifully delivered, and her sheer presence within the frame is a delight. Emil Jannings is equally memorable as the gulled professor; in a film showing its origins in silent movies, he has a range of gestures and eye-work that are tremendously funny, especially in those sequences where he tries to keep his class of unruly students quiet, or when he tries yet fails to suppress his amorous feelings for Lola (Dietrich). The film's ending is both shocking and yet poignant, showing the depths to which humankind can be reduced once love gets in the way. When the Professor chases Lola for the final time, uttering the unearthly screams of a cockerel, we feel genuinely concerned for her safety. As with most UFA films of this period, THE BLUE ANGEL is distinguished by atmospheric lighting and use of shadows, especially in its portrayal of the seedy back-streets where the Blue Angel club is situated. Definitely a classic of its kind that stands up really well after eight decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps it was startling at its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say much about this film, having just seen it for the first time, but while I was impressed with Von Sternberg's direction, as usual, I felt that this film lacked substance and drive. The story is too predictable; maybe at its time, it had some novelty. I hoped that the road would twist in some unpredictable direction, but it simply loped along to its predictably depressing conclusion.Jannings and Dietrich are wonderfully cast and carry off their roles with perfection. Less convincing is Kurt Gerron's magician -- he seems like he would belong more as a bar-tender than as an impresario. The touches of humor are odd.... I found myself uncertain at times whether it was a comedy or a drama. Certainly, the film makes Jannings' imperious school professor a subject of so much ridicule that his fall from grace comes more as a relief than a tragedy.One would hope to find minor characters with some flash to add some interest to a simple story, but only Hans Albers' strongman can really make much of an impression next to Jannings and Dietrich.It's a pleasing film to watch, I enjoyed much of the atmosphere and so forth, but it didn't make much of a lasting impression on me I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The strength of this film well it takes its time getting there, but the professor's breakdown, and what follows, is the highlight of this early German talkie.Giving the devil his due, Emil Jannings' performance of the wuss prof is remarkable and, as the years passed, others tried some of the same tricks.Jannings, who was part American, was a Joseph Goebbels pet having been part of several vicious pro-Nazi productions. Before filming in the USA he worked in Hollywood and won an Oscar, holding it in his grubby paw at war's end to show the Americans that he was one of them. It didn't work.Conversely, Dietrich was asked some say begged to stay in Germany, but she was an ardent anti-Nazi and, during the war, helped sell bonds, and visited the troops.She and director Josef von Sternberg worked together and, of course, she became a giant-sized star.This picture shot her in that direction. As Lola-Lola she was she was the epitome of the sexy cabaret singer followed, I guess, by Liza with a Z."The Blue Angel" (I have the German version) was an impressive groundbreaking movie with Jannings in the core, transforming from a goody-goody type to Mr. Lust and again it was those final scenes that just about put this movie in the masterpiece category.Heil, Emil (not e-mail).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Town University Professor Imanuel Rath is a paragon of no nonsense solid citizen virtue who saves his affections for a chirping bird. A humorless man he is naturally the bane of his mischievous students whose studies are being interrupted by a visiting cabaret act at the Blue Angel. When he visits this den of iniquity to press his righteous indignation he succumbs like his students almost immediately to the ineluctable allure of Lola Lola.The Blue Angel is tour de force film-making in the early era of sound. In the most claustrophobic of settings director Josef Von Sternberg delivers heavy doses of pathos and tragedy with a dark comic edge in scene after scene of busy energy and graphic German expressionism. His canvases spill over with caricature, irony and sober metaphors as Rath tragically spirals downward.Emil Jannings as Rath displays his formidable silent acting chops as he deconstructs from respected member of the community to love struck fool. He does occasionally slice the ham a little thick but his climactic downfall is agonizingly powerful. As Lola Lola ,Marlene Dietrich simply creates a cinema icon. To this day I have yet to see any film actress so casually natural, aware and in charge of her seductive powers as Ms. Dietrich's Lola. Whether disassembling Rath or dominating her audience she calls the shots. She can't sing a lick but your transfixed as she bellows Falling in Love Again with an exhausted resignation to a rowdy but tamed crowd. Von Sternberg and Dietrich(more glamorous and glacial) would move on to the US and Paramount with (Morroco, Dishonored) greater success and glossier productions before Von Sternberg's career nosedived and Dietrich took Lola on the road from Paris to Vegas into retirement age but they would never fly as high as they do in The Blue Angel.</fullReview>

This gets a certain genius touch on the screenplay with Lola Lola, the femme fatale who leads professor Rath (or Unrath according to the students) to self destruction. The symbols are all there with the dead bird in the cage, for instance. Jannings is simply brilliant in his part. No wonder the nazis made him the actor of the nazi fatherland. Marlene created the myth, singing `Falling In Love Again' in german preparing her way to the America. Old Hitler himself loved her!

		<shortDescription>A very important film, yes, but I didn't enjoy it one iota</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Von Sternberg's "Blue Angel" is a very important film on a stylistic level. For those wanting to explore German Expressionism, this is an excellent film to start with. But it's far too depressing and mundane for me to recommend it as a film to enjoy on any other level. Jannings gives a melodramatic, yet effective, performance as the school teacher who is held in sexual thrall by Dietrich's Lola Lola, a man-eater if there ever was one. Dietrich is convincing in her role. The acting and Von Sternberg's directing is interesting and affecting but, for me, the film was just utterly moribund. I'm not suggesting that great films have to be uplifting, not at all (many of my favourite classics are very cynical), but this one just left a bad taste in my mouth.</fullReview>

Dietrich, while not at the height of her beauty in this film, was sensational nevertheless. One one my favorite scenes is when Dietrich is leaving her dressing room to perform and, as she exits, she brazenly adjusts her panties and gives a provocative look backwards. Sternberg's scenes and settings are unique and extraordinary. You don't know what to expect next when watching it for the first time.

		<shortDescription>Powerful Performances Make the Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blue Angel, The (1930) *** 1/2 (out of 4) German classic about a strict Professor Rath (Emil Jennings) who learns that many of his students are spending their nights at a speak easy instead of doing their homework. The Professor decides to go there and put an end to it but he meets the beautiful Lola Lola (Marlene Dietrich). Against his better judgment the Professor falls in love with the woman and before long she ruins his life. THE BLUE ANGEL will probably strike a lot of people as being old-fashioned and out of date. I think that would be a fair thing to say as I'm sure many people are going to find the Professor to be a complete idiot. Not for falling in love with this woman but because of how he acts when he finds out that his adult students are going to a speak easy. There's a scene where he slaps a cigarette out of the mouth of his student and you have to wonder why anyone would have allowed him to do such a thing. The film certainly isn't flawless as there are a few pacing issues as well as it following a rather predictable script but at the same time the performances are so strong and the direction so tight that you can't help but fall into its traps. I think the greatest thing the film has going for it are the leads who turn in marvelous performances. I really loved the way Jennings played the part because of how stern, strong and at times over baring he is at the start of the movie. The sequence where he watches Dietrich sing and basically falls in love was a brilliant scene to watch and you can see in Jennings' eyes that he has fallen. When the eventual breakdown finally happens the actor pulls it off without a hitch and makes you feel incredibly sorry for him. Dietrich became a star with this film and it's easy to see why. She's so incredibly charming in the part and at times so cold you can't help but see people lining up to get into this movie. Needless to say, she's very beautiful and all the skin they were allowed to show certainly helps things and her music numbers are quite good as well. The strong Jennings mixed with the charming Dietrich made for a rather interesting couple and I thought the actors did a terrific job together. von Sternberg's direction is very good from start to finish as he does a terrific job with the atmosphere of this run-down theater hall where all this stuff is going on. The cinematography is perfect and it also adds a lot as it becomes its own character. As I said, the film is pretty predictable but perhaps the director and cast weren't trying to tell something original or make the film shocking. Instead they were simply telling the story of a lonely man who had everything but threw it all away for what turned out to be nothing. Perhaps their goal was to tell a rather predictable story but do it in their own way. Either way, THE BLUE ANGEL is certainly a very good film that remains a must-see due to the terrific leads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent &amp; Obscure Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emil Jannings plays the rigid Professor Immanuel Rath, a man of powerful presence who imposes order in his classes but he's hated by all of his students except for one. These students try to provoke the teacher by calling him a rat (if you noticed his last name sounds like "rat") and making funny and disrespectful drawings of him in the blackboard. One day the teacher follows these boys in order to know what they're doing after classes. They go to a nightclub called "The Blue Angel" where they see the performances of the beautiful dancers and among them there's the hypnotizing Lola Lola (Marlene Dietrich), a character that works like a oracle, because through her songs you'll know that everything she says is true, she's beautiful, and she's not a good person. But the Professor gets involved with her and for obscure reasons she's involved with him too and they both marry. Happily ever after? Not at all! In Josef von Sternberg's film the story isn't beautiful and the teacher was teached in the worst kind of way: through humiliation in front of the same society whose values couldn't have been corrupted since he was the preparer of the future generations. Perhaps a lesson of hypocrisy to the absent fathers of the rebel students of this film (or they might be part of the audience of the nightclub) that couldn't control their sons actions but they laughed hysterically when the teacher was forced to perform a humiliating magic number. Okay I played the difficult in this review but I'll try to locate you without spoil much the view of this classic. The movie doesn't explain much of the actions of the main characters especially the sudden reason of include the teacher as part of the performers of the club. All we know is that a powerful man was deluded for the beauty of Lola, fell in love with her and married her, and the most important of all he turned his back to the society when he made all the previous choices quoted (by that I mean he quit his important job to be a nothing). I must say that while watching this classic I felt uncomfortable with all the situations presented, finding almost nothing special about it but then the ending says it all even though was something lacking in the middle, reasons to be explained to the viewer. But when you see the whole picture you understand these reasons. I even dare to say that this film was ahead of its time with this idea that a movie doesn't need to explain all and that audiences must think of something else. Those who love classics and/or are taking film classes must watch Sternberg's film and see all the dark and interesting elements of the German Expressionist movement (some of the sets reminds of the ones used in "Nosferatu" (1922) directed by Murnau). And of course see the first sound experience of the German cinema. And the great performance of Marlene Dietrich in the movie who made her famous; and at last but not least one of the most incredible and complete performance ever captured on film by Emil Jannings. Despite everything you might have heard about "The Blue Angel" this movie is not about the dancer, it is about the teacher and his decadence in front of a society one time very similar to his controlling and restrict ideas. And Jennings was the perfect actor for such a role. A movie that grows in the viewer's memory. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I'm just guessing here - But judging by The Blue Angel's decidedly wacky, off-kilter storyline, I'm pretty convinced that this German import from 1930 was supposed to be director Josef Von Sternberg's idea (as lame as it was) of a Hollywood-style "Screwball" comedy.I mean, being a "Screwball" comedy is the only thing that explains so much about this film's nonsensical idiocy. 'Cause I could never, ever take the utter inanity that went on in The Blue Angel's story at all seriously.If this film was intended as a dead-serious drama, it sure came across as being downright laughable to me. And I'd say that anybody who does take this film with a straight face is setting themselves up for a major disappointment, if you ask me.At first I actually thought I was in for a real cinematic treat with The Blue Angel - But, alas, even the sluttified, 29-year-old Marlene Dietrich with her plump butt and chubby legs lost their overall appeal even before I realized what was happening.... And, what would I say about Dietrich's singing!!??.... Oh, man, I don't even wanna get started on that! In many ways, The Blue Angel reminded me, more than anything else, of a poorly-choreographed, live-action cartoon. And actor Emil Jannings (the future Nazi-lover) was absolutely despicable in this film as the lecherous, old fart, Professor Rath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Jannings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This expressionist early talkie, known mainly as a tale of degradation like Jannings' previous roles, is often hilariously funny. Jannings, one of the best actors of his day, is straight man here, and he's the funniest thing in the movie. This film is remembered mainly for Dietrich, because of Jannings' and Dietrich's subsequent political lives; it basically gave Dietrich the role she'd lost out to Louise Brooks in PANDORA'S BOX. At face value, though, the movie ought to be remembered mostly for Jannings. His hapless high-school teacher is brilliantly underplayed-- pathetic and hilarious in the same moments, even in the final scene. What's special about this movie is how Von Sternberg and Jannings keep the black comedy in the air all the way through, even in the scenes of tearjerking pathos.Most of the cast in the English version are obviously reading their lines phonetically. However, this version is not really so bad as is sometimes claimed. Dietrich and Jannings both spoke English well. The cast's Bad English actually adds to the comedy in some scenes. And Lola Lola is English, so the club would have picked up the slang from her.This Dietrich is somehow more appealing than the more stylized, streamlined one of her Hollywood films, where she got turned into another Exotic Foreigner-- a tramp version of Garbo. Here she's less serious and more fun. She can't sing, can't dance, and can barely even act (e.g., her reaction shots in the final fracas). Yet when she had a good role, like Frenchy in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN or this one, her nonchalant screen personality could make her more appealing than the usual glamour puss. How she became famous as a singer does remain a mystery. Maybe it's the unique poses-- the way she puts one ankle over one knee for "Falling in Love Again". No one else would sing it quite that way-- not even a man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Blue Angel' remains to me up to this day one of the most memorable and wonderful movies of my life.It is also for those who love the movies a great entrance door to the world of one of the masters of its universe, Josef Von Sternberg and of course the creation of the first and most remarkable of Marlene Dietrich's movie's persona,a sort of femme fatale,imprisoned between her rise and fall,her victory and tragedy.Sternberg introduces us finally,surely inspired by the wonderful presence of Dietrich,into his world of surprisingly (since it's a black and white movie), colourful tones,the world of light/dark contrasts,the use of lighting to create different shades and attitudes in the movie-making industry.This film remains also Marlene's grand entrance into the movie business and it keeps reminding us - taking into account her subsequent work and latter 'persona' in the industry - how wonderful and powerful an actress she was.It also reveals her talents as a singer and entertainer, which she would so powerfully use in the latter part of her career.It also brings us the talent and figure of one of Germany's greatest actors of his time, Emil Jannings,a tragic figure in the end,encompassing in his soul all of human perditions and melancholy,lost in his love for an aloof and distant figure of a woman.Together, they gave wonderfully convincing and unforgettable performances, and the presence of Marlene brought to the screen the birth of a kind of woman unabashedly firm in her struggle for life which would represent her own advantage and fault, her rise and fall, her virtues and sins, together with the beautiful songs she sang in the movie, that would be later on incorporated in her concert tours, like the extraordinary 'Falling in Love Again/Ich bin won köpf bis füss auf liebe eingesteldt'.But what markedly remains in my spirit is the beginning of the powerful and unforgettable collaboration between the master and his feminine creation, Von Sternberg and Dietrich, which would remain in both their careers, their most distinctive and unforgettable period and their career's milestone, until they exhausted that collaboration in the 6 more movies they would make together until 1935.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile For Fine Performances From Jannings &amp; Dietrich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good performances by Emil Jannings and Marlene Dietrich make this a worthwhile classic despite some weaknesses in the rest of the film. Jannings convincingly portrays Professor Rath's downward spiral, showing it to be unnecessary but entirely voluntary. Dietrich's part may have been less of a challenge for her, but as Lola Lola she has quite a screen presence, and makes the character come alive. These two stars and their characters are memorable enough to carry a good, but not great, production, and a sometimes unimpressive story.The story of the relationship between Rath and Lola offers many possibilities, and it is interesting, but it does not fully realize its potential. Fortunately, the two stars make it worth watching anyway, and mask some defects that would have been more obvious with lesser performers. The first meeting between the two, in Lola's dressing room, does make very good use of the situation and of the setting, but many of the subsequent events are rather less satisfying. Some of the developments and character changes seem too abrupt, and would have benefited from more setup or motivation beforehand. Some of this may well have been deliberate, as a statement on Rath's psychological condition, but it does not always work as well as it could have."The Blue Angel" is, of course, remembered not for the story itself but as one of Dietrich's signature roles. She does deserve the recognition, but Jannings is just as good himself, and it's the two of them together that make it worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do I start off with this review? Well, lets start with what's right about this film. First, it has motion. That's about it. The story behind "The Blue Angel" lacks the necessary connection to make the audience care about what happens, not to mention the fact that when the story does progress it makes an improbable progression. For example, the way in which the love between Prof. Rath and Lola seems too forced to be realistic. They meet, they talk briefly, they (for unexplained reasons) get married. I hoped that through all the improbability that the film would come to an entertaining and/or logical ending. Sadly I was mistaken, the ending leaves me hating this film even more. If you are studying early cinema or German cinema or the even more popular early German cinema, then you may have to sit through this movie. I feel sorry for you. However, if you are out looking through old German videos to fill some empty German cinema void in your life, then rent "Metropolis" or "Nosferatu" or "The Cabinent of Dr. Caligari" or "M" or anything but "The Blue Angel".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me join the ranks that herald this film as one of the great ones, an unforgettable all-time world cinema masterpiece that should be way higher in the IMDb scores, still relevant, powerful, not dated, with not one but two landmark performances. In the first half the film is very funny, but when Lola Lola starts clucking in the wedding reception the horror begins. This is my favorite Marlene Dietrich role, and for my taste the only sexy one, with baby fat and a rounder, younger, nubile face and body(before she turned into the more stern and severe deep-voiced German femme fatale). I find it amazing that her character in this 1930 film still turns me on. Jannings overacts grandiosely to match the extremely melodramatic, denigrating, tragic story, and gives one of the great acting performances of movie history (along with his performance in the silent The Last Laugh). The magician is perfectly sleazy yet human in his ignorance. The film piles it up towards its cringing climax, culminating in action not actually shown, an extremely intelligent move on Sternberg's part. And I dare anyone to come up with more horrible and painful sounds in film history than the professor's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic Dietrich and Prototype Establishment Make This Poorly Written Story A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler Included)One reason that The Blue Angel remains as a classic may be the iconic posture of Marlene Dietrich: wearing a silk hat, sitting on a barrel, crossing her legs, and casting an upward glance. The other may be that the film has established a prototype of a middle-aged male obsessed with a young female to ruin his life (inherited to Lolita), and male's fantasy to be involved with a showgirl/prostitute (inherited to Pretty Woman and Mighty Aphrodite, among many others). The story is poorly written with very little character development--a professor and a showgirl impulsively get married, he becomes a clown in her troop, they go back to his hometown, and then he feels shame and commits suicide--can we call it a story?On a technical side, editing is terrible: Even in the 1930s, cutting between the shots with the same angles and compositions can't have any excuse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dietrich acts!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blue Angel (also Der Blaue Engel) Under discussion:The Blue Angel (1930)This is a film that gets great word of mouth but isn't really all that great. The plot is that Professor Rath (Emil Jannings) gets all stirred up when he discovers his students are going to a local pub to drink, carouse, and get corrupted by the girls. He goes there to have the students thrown out and ends up corrupted himself by Lola (Marlene Dietrich).Jannings is superb in this movie. His succumbing to flattery is endearing, and his fall from esteem to complete degradation is totally credible. And I think this is the only film I've seen where Dietrich acted. In her American films, she played Dietrich instead of her role. But Dietrich's role as Lola is truly iconic. _Everyone_ knows the photo of her in her silver top hat, shorts, and garter belt and stockings, looking over her bare shoulder. It's copied everywhere. It's not a major theme in the movie (directed by Josef von Sternberg) - it's just one scene.The film was supposed to be about Professor Rath, and Emil Jennings was the star. But somehow Dietrich stole the show. Well, not really "somehow" - we know how she did it. Her sex appeal is real, and it makes Rath's humiliating downfall believable. On the whole, the film is a minor German movie supposed to showcase Emil Jannings, and it would have no life at all beyond the early 30s, when it was made. But for Lola Lola.For an interesting comparison, watch the incomparably beautiful Louise Brooks play Lulu in "Pandora's Box" (Die Buchse der Pandora), a silent film with a similar theme.Classic Greek tragedy had a hero whose flaw was a character trait that was good, but he took it too far. Oedipus, for example, was curious. He was warned several times to stop asking questions, but he went too far and learned too much. Hubris was one of the favorite flaws; Antigone, for example, challenged to gods to his great loss. After the Greek hero got his comeuppance, the play would wind down pretty quickly. The audience was supposed to feel pity for the hero's tragedy and to feel fear lest we come to the same end ourselves: catharsis."The Blue Angel" has some of the characteristics of ancient Greek tragedy, but with interesting twists. Our hero, Professor Rath thinks he has morals, but he's wrong. Instead of going too far with a good trait, Herr Professor fails to go at all. He meets Lola Lola and falls for her right off the bat of an eye. We spend rather more time with our failed hero after his fall than was the custom in Greek antiquity. Von Sternberg dwells on Rath's depths as Lola ceases to be amused by her formerly highbrow husband. She eventually loses all interest and starts an affair with another, younger, stronger man. Rath finds that the depths of hell have no bottom. "The Blue Angel" should have been great, but something failed. My current thinking is that Rath was not heroic; his fatal flaw is not too much of a good thing but rather his lack of real morals behind his facade of righteousness. Perhaps he got what he deserved, leaving me with some pity but no emotional release. Professor Rath does not go down with the honor necessary for a Greek tragic hero, and I think this takes away from the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #040: The Blue Angel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>040: The Blue Angel (1930) - released in Germany 4/1/30; viewed 3/23/06.In India, Mohandas Gandhi begins his 200-mile civil disobedience march to protest the British salt monopoly. The Motion Picture Production Code is established, though it would be several years before it is enforced.BIRTHS: Joanne Woodward, Steve McQueen, Sandra Day O'Conner. DEATHS: D.H. Lawrence, William Howard Taft.KEVIN: We come now to the first sound film by German film conglomerate UFA, The Blue Angel. We chose to watch the English version only because it's in English. It took us a lot of rewinding and re-watching to get through this one, and by the time it was over, I was surprised at how much of the movie I understood, even though the sound was less than ideal and the accents of many of the actors were so thick that it was hard sometimes to tell if they were speaking German or English. But I shouldn't be surprised, as the filmmakers at UFA have been able to communicate story without dialogue for years before this film. So, naturally, the film is full of some interesting imagery from director Josef von Sternberg and cinematographer Gunther Rittau. The scenes at the nightclub were unusual in the way the camera doesn't get a front-and-center view of the show, but is off to one side or the other with some obstruction cutting the picture in half. This easily contrasts the straight-on and dull scenes within the Professor's classroom. It was also fun to see what they could get away with before the Production Code became active, like Rath mistaking Lola's panties for his handkerchief. I'm sure a lot more can be said about this film than what I can say, like about the story involving Rath's decent into depression or Lola's evocative musical numbers, but right now, I'm ready to move on through the early sound era.DOUG: We watched the English version of the film, though the German-language version may have been more popular, and would have come with subtitles (here it was hard to tell if the characters are speaking German or German-accented English). Von Sternberg sure was one for mise en scene and symbolism, as this movie is packed with it. It's easy to see the contrast between Rath's stiflingly clean classroom and Lola's down-and-dirty dance hall, and exterior shots of the street look very surreal. It was interesting to watch Rath's downward spiral, as he goes from a staunch, strict and poised teacher to a depressed, lifeless husk. At the beginning, we see a clown hanging backstage who looks all depressed and disheveled, and eventually its Rath who becomes this clown. If we were to trace Lola's path, we would probably find a trail of depressed, lifeless clowns in her wake. I was a little concerned about where the film went; Rath starts off as an uptight jerk, openly hated by his students; when he meets Lola, he starts to have more fun, but then later ends up dying of depression and humiliation. So if he had never met Lola, then he would have remained a living, uptight jerk? NOTE: I got to watch the film a second time when I wrote an essay about it for Film History class, this time in German. In my paper, I talked about the early sound era, the German film industry, the end of Emil Jannings' career, the beginning of Dietrich's collaboration with Sternberg, and the crop of dark and disturbing films coming out of Germany leading up to the Nazi takeover.Last film: Anna Christie (1930). Next film viewed: Hell's Angels (1930). Next film chronologically: The Divorcée (1930).</fullReview>

She marries him, but is soon bored and contemptuous; humiliated, he leaves her and dies in his old classroom.The Blue Angel is a masterwork of late 1920s German grotesquerie, and after a slowish beginning an emotional powerhouse, set in a dark nightmare world which could be created only in a studio. Shot also in English, it was highly popular and influential in Britain and America. The film instantly catapulted Dietrich to international stardom. In addition, it introduced her signature song, Friedrich Hollaender's "Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)"."At the time I thought the film was awful and vulgar and I was shocked by the whole thing. Remember, I was a well brought-up German girl." - Marlene Dietrich</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stuffy high school professor Emil Jannings (as Immanuel Rath) is disgusted when he discovers his students are lascivious postcard-collecting fans of fleshly cabaret singer Marlene Dietrich (as Lola Lola). After visiting Ms. Dietrich in her dressing room, Mr. Jannings succumbs to her charms. He sacrifices his respectable job for a chance to kneel down and help Dietrich put on her stockings. Jannings' former students laugh at his spiraling degradation? Not bad for an early "talkie", thanks to director Josef von Sternberg and the performances of two very important film stars. Jannings was a highly respected actor, making a good transition to sound. Unfortunately, he returned to Germany for the duration of the Nazi era. Dietrich was an instant classic, with her sultry rendering of "Falling in Love Again" at "Der Blaue Engel" (or "The Blue Angel") becoming a signature song. After this, the Von Sternberg / Dietrich team made several successful Hollywood films. In all, Dietrich is bewitching.******** Der Blaue Engel (4/1/30) Josef von Sternberg ~ Emil Jannings, Marlene Dietrich, Kurt Gerron</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was fur eine movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not so sure that the peoples of the English-speaking world can quite "get" this film. Being a professor in, say, the United States just doesn't carry the kind of Weberian rational/legal authority that it does in countries like Germany. And if you take away Professor Rath's initial status, you take away the distance that he falls. When I was a substitute teacher, my recently arrived Mexican students addressed me as "maestro." In Vienna, I would be known as "Herr Professor Doktor Doktor." Here, my students called me "Max." My point is that the difference between a professor and a clown in the United States is less than it was in 1930 Germany. Without this understanding, a viewing of the film doesn't pack quite the same punch. There are, nevertheless, interesting things going on here, whether or not the movie is a masterpiece. Expressionism abounds in the art direction. John Ford simply MUST have seen this before he made "The Informer." Set-bound cobblestone streets, overhanging floors, street lamps at impossibly drunken angles, it's all here. Plus a youthful and pretty and almost unrecognizable Marlene Dietrich (mit zwei schöne Beine) carelessly throwing her stocking-clad knees around and singing, "Falling in Love again," in a scene that prefigures everything Bob Fosse did in cabaret, but without the derbies. Poor Emil Jannings. Reminded me, the way he tilted his head back in order to see over his scraggly mustache, of my German grandfather. Unlike Marlene, Jannings didn't make it in Hollywood and went back to Germany in time to play footsies with the Nazis. If he overacted any more than he does, he could consume the furniture in this flick. No, it's not a landmark of the cinema. But, good grief, does she have pretty legs -- landmark enough perhaps -- and her splendid rear encased in ruffled bloomers! The Germans were known for their appreciation of those kinds of things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just a so-so picture. Now I am NOT saying it wasn't an excellent film in 1930--the story must have seemed rather fresh and a bit risqué back then. But, now in 2005, it just seems rather average--period. It's rather reminiscent of the movie, Chicago, except that there's no killing and there are far less musical numbers (some will appreciate that).Plus, the real disappointment for me was Marlena Deitrich's performance. It wasn't BAD, but this movie reportedly brought her to America--and I just can't see why. She looks very little like the Hollywood version of Marlena (I actually preferred her in The Blue Angel--not nearly so made-up looking) but you've got to admire her for being in BOTH the original German and English-speaking versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prof. Rath (Emil Jannings) is a teacher who discovers that his pupils are visiting "The Blue Angel" cabaret club to see the girls there - and one girl in particular - Lola Lola (Marlene Dietrich). He goes there to catch the boys and throw them out but he ends up falling in love with Lola. His obsession with her leads to their marriage and he quits his teaching job and joins her troupe, at first selling postcards to customers. The show goes on tour and eventually returns to perform at "The Blue Angel" but the once respected Prof Rath is now playing a clown as part of an act. His humiliation is further increased by the arrival of Mazeppa, the "strong man" (Hans Albers). How will Prof. Rath cope on his return to his old town.....?........The film starts very slowly and just gets slower and slower! Emil Jannings gives a totally unbelievable portrayal of a pompous, superior school-type who falls in love. His character is an idiot. Nothing happens for long periods and we also have long drawn out silences to sit through. Dietrich appears looking slightly chunky and singing terribly. She is also unbelievable as someone who falls in love. She is meant to be streetwise and so there is no way that she would not be able to find a better suitor than Jannings. Its a complete joke that she agrees to marry him. A couple of the songs are repeated and they are all terrible.The film is a waste of time and it seems to go on for 3 million hours. It has the iconic Marlene Dietrich imagery but nothing else - this film is sh*t.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absurd, prudish, pre-sexual, schoolgirlish professor is taken with the tramp that performs at a local cabaret, to the point that he destroys himself over her. Big surprise. That scenario was supposed to end in happiness? An extraordinarily twee, creepy clown (is there some other types) observes like a silent Greek chorus, until Jannings takes that role.A classic movie is one that overcomes it's age, not one that creaks with it. This rather unlikely, facile story takes forever to proceed. I was desperate for it to get moving or to provide me with something substantial to consider. Even with my interest in the Weimar Republic, I was bored stiff watching this. The scenes vary between obvious and tedious. I can go all the way back to about 1940 with movies, and love to do so (I prefer older movies) but once I get to the thirties just about all of them are too dated for my taste. In the sense that, not only do I not recognize myself in the characters, I don't even recognize the value of such desperately obvious material and film-making. Context is lovely, but it's not going to make us sit through 'Patch Adams' in 60 years. I'm stunned to see that this movie lingers on some critics top ten lists. That's just belaboring pretensions that this is somehow still relevant or meritorious.Rent Carrie with Lurence Oliver to view a man's descent into degradation (again, over a woman) executed better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On account of us only owning a version of this in the original German(sans subtitles, mind you), I watched this with my father translating along the way. It was the first viewing for me, but not for him. We both found it hilarious; the jokes and gags are typically goofy and silly, but at its core, the material holds a lot of truth. The acting is great, though there are numerous intentionally overdone performances. This was very risqué for its time, dealing with the 20's in that part of the world, where people let themselves relax after the First World War had ended, and the many women who were widowed or had never gotten a chance to marry, not being allowed many jobs that they could support themselves on, with that as their only income, were forced to turn to dancing or even prostitution. The plot isn't bad, and the pacing is fairly solid. However, an hour and twenty minutes or so into it, it suddenly completely gave up on character logic, and ceased to be funny at all. I don't necessarily mind the moralistic preaching that it then embraces, it simply doesn't feel natural or consistent in the least. With that said, the ending is poignant. There is sensuality in this. I recommend it to fans of crude comedies and films from this period. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marlena Dietrich was truly one of the finest actresses around of her generation. Her performance in this film especially when she kisses a woman as if she was a man is unforgettable and controversial in a time of German decadence and liberty before Hitler's rise and World War II. This film depicts the loves and lives of the people who visit the Berlin club. It shows how cruel love can be to each other and how destructive people are to themselves and others. That kiss may have started a controversy but the real one is the poor treatment of ourselves and others. Love can be the cruelest gift and the most wonderful gift if we know how to do it properly. So Marlene kisses a woman in the film while wearing a masculine costume, it's not the end of the world. In real life, Marlene pretty much died alone in her Paris apartment. She too have experienced the cruelty and heartache of love and the joy of being a mother and grandmother too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remarkable a film as it is, the English version is actually better. This is by no means a statement made because it's my native language. Somehow, the English language version (which was shot simultaneous with the German, scene for scene)has even better acting (if possible) from the already perfect Emil Jannings. Dietrich seems sexier, even more licentious and heartless as she tortures the school teacher in another language. It's almost as if the actors felt more comfortable to indulge in the depths when they were speaking in a foreign language. I might also add that the film, as far as I know, only exists in a few nitrate prints (one of which is owned by the UCLA Film Archives)and it's virtually impossible to see. Until the day may come when some preservationist convinces someone to make a DVD copy from one of these old prints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dietrich 'Torments' Another Admirer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is done in English, there were many German actors in this early Marlene Dietrich "talkie." The first third of this film is so boring, I wonder how many first-time viewers would stick around to watch the whole thing? It's not easy. Don't expect a lot of dialog, either, because there are a lot of scenes of long silent pauses.Dietrich ("Lola") looked heavy to me, not the sexy Marlene I know from subsequent '30s films, especially "Blonde Venus" which was done just two years later. Emil Jennings plays a stuffy teacher who becomes enamored with this cabaret singer (Dietrich loved those roles!) and gets his heart broken (she liked to do that to men, too!). All in all, too depressing a story to recommend, except to those sadistic viewers - and there are number of them out there - who enjoy seeing a person (particularly a man) mentally tortured. For them, this movie is worth checking out.</fullReview>
