		<shortDescription>Great movie - stop giving it such a hard time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant "Bruck-buster" action at its best. Fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect casting and an precise sense of excitement make this flawed film successful. *** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, slick, stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles. If you are a viewer interested in cars this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air," "The Rock"), is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. Although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride. The film stars Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as a young crook named Kip Raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened because of such, his older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars-specified by model, color, year, and make-in only four days. Memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing Memphis through previous business, a fellow named Mirror Man (T.J. Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde).  Contributing to the film's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them.There is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core, stylish atmosphere. To make matters even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone. I am not stating I think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish; I actually honor the director's decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an R-rating. However, I do believe in a movie such as "Gone in 60 Seconds," to strongly develop the character's enlightenment, dialogue needs to be believable and authentic.  In spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch, perfectly cast performers responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles. The film contains standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. In the second act we run into a few more problems: the story wastes time during much of this segment, never really building up for the third act. While the middle of the movie occupies much time, and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot, not a whole lot happens. The third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed. The soundtrack to "Gone in 60 Seconds" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. It is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. Dominic Sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitement?but not much more.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy film that made over $100 million but got blasted by most critics. I personally thought this was a great film. The story was believable and has probobly the greatest cast ever for this type of movie including 3 academy award winners nicolas cage, robert duvall and the very hot anjolina jolie. other than the lame stunt at the end this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, But Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films I liked quite a bit the first time, but didn't think that much of it on the second viewing. I guess enough of it was just good for one look. Maybe it was the immature attitude that prevailed throughout the film that wore thin. But I am not going to knock the movie: it's entertaining and definitely worth a look if you have not seen it.If you like cars and chase scenes. t's worth multiple looks. In fact, the car chase scene at the end is one of the best you'll ever see. Nice soundtrack in here, too, and a pretty good cast with Nicholas Cage leading the way.The bad news? Well, here's yet another case of Hollywood making "bad guys" into heroes. We're supposed to root for people that steal cars? Hello??!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action packed film taking your typical car chase to new levels of excitement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action.In producer Bruckheimer's latest film, Gone in 60 Seconds, its all about the nomenclature. With character monikers like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and cars idealized with names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's only the non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game.Not a deep script by any means, but it is a great vehicle for action as Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of car-thievery retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of the 1974 cult hit, this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining.Surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting. Although loaded with stars, none of them have standout performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, coming off her recent Oscar win, is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time.Can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film? I think so. The film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity, the action is non-stop and the suspense is compelling. Just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre.3 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not trying to be an epic: just a fun, simple B-movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I like big epic pictures - I'll spare you the namedropping - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes. Films where the plot takes a backseat to the set-pieces. Films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose. There are HUNDREDS of films that fit the bill... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones.It's an update of the movie that shares its name. It also shares that picture's ethos, but not quite it's execution. Whatever was great about the original has been streamlined. Whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget. Often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster - see the pug-ugly remake of The Italian Job for one that blew it - but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, Sixty succeeds.The plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write IMDb about. Often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors, each of whom will voice it with different inflections. A lot of people found this annoying; I find it raises a smile. Each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the pack of course (and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see Mrs Pitt not given first billing here). The chemistry between good ol' Saint Nick the stalwart (see date of review) and Angelina leads to a couple of nice moments.The villain is not even a little scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston play tough-guy roles before so I know he can handle them, but I think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action. We know the heroes are going to succeed, somehow; we're just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. I think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in-cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating. In fact, I wouldn't have minded some fourth-wall breaking winks at the camera: it's just that kind of movie.All this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed *just* so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there. And for the most part, it is. Wonderfully so. I've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast-cut extreme close-up shots to direct action these days. I personally find this kind of thing exhausting. I prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time. I've been told that Cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character clearly doesn't care) and it shows. The man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow-burning climatic finale where he drives a Mustang into the ground in the most outlandish - and FUN - way possible.So yes, this movie isn't an "epic, life-affirming post-9/11 picture with obligatory social commentary" effort. The pacing is uneven, some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line. But car movies rarely come better than this. So if you hate cars... why are you even reading these comments?!I'd take it over the numerous iterations of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" (guess the franchise) any day. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GONE IN 60 SECONDS was one of the most fun experiences I've had at the theater in the last couple of years. Though a little too long and not really full of action until the final twenty minutes, it moves well and has a good cast: Nicolas Cage, Will Patton, Robert Duvall, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo, Christopher Eccleston, and others. Angelina Jolie is the only weak point. She's in desperate need of a talented hairstylist, and while she's hardly a good actress, she really doesn't do much in the film when you look at it, which is a good thing. But the film has style and a good pace, with some great theft scenes, well-spotted humor, and a final chase that (while not among the greatest ever filmed) is certainly a wild ride. GONE IN 60 SECONDS isn't a great film, but it sure as hell is fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old fashioned cat and mouse chase with a charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie doesn't tell you any new truth or treat your refined taste with amazing characters. It is just an old-fashioned chase movie of the good and the bad guys. The circumstances and the grand theft of 50 cars over one night is of course out of this world but it doesn't matter because Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie charm us out of it. After watching hundreds of car chase movies in my lifetime I didn't think yet another one would lighten my eyebrow. I was wrong. The smart and humorous execution of the car and car/helicopter chases was a great fun to watch; a good honest adrenalin booster. Perhaps I am little generous but I give it 8/10 for all the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gone in Sixty Seconds: A Gearhead's Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that many of those who have reviewed "Gone in Sixty Seconds" have essentially missed the point of the movie. This is only peripherally a movie about car thieves. At its heart, this film is about cars. Many reviewers have criticized the film's characterizations and character development. Let's check the credits... uh huh, yeah, executive producer, Jerry Bruckheimer. I think it's a little unrealistic to walk into a Jerry Bruckheimer film and expect "Citizen Kane." That said, I thought the characters were certainly adequate. The villain was suitably unhinged and nefarious, and I thought Nic Cage did a great job as Memphis Raines. He is one of my favorite action stars; unlike Arnie, Sly, or Jackie, he can actually act, and this adds a whole new dimension to his characters that none of the other big action stars have. The closest comparison I can come up with is to the epitome of cool himself, Steve McQueen. The supporting cast was solid. Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duvall and Angelina Jolie are all capable of far more than they are given here; all three of them could sleepwalk through their roles, but they do a solid job with what they're given. Angelina Jolie's character Sway was essentially throwaway eye candy; I would like to have seen the Memphis-Sway story developed further and made an actual part of the movie or scrapped altogether. Mirror Man is a wonderful character, and Scott Caan, one of my favorite young actors from his performances in "Boiler Room" and "Varsity Blues," did a good job in his all-too-brief role as Tumbler.Enough with the characters, let's move on to the real stars, the cars. Many reviewers seem to have been disappointed with the car chases, faulting them for failing to turn sufficient numbers of exotic cars into flaming, cartwheeling wreckage. I say, HALLELUJAH!!!! The cars Memphis's gang steals are not just transportation. These cars (especially the '67 Mustang "Eleanor," the '70 Hemi 'Cuda, the '70 Plymouth Roadrunner Superbird and that flamethrowing Merc,) are breathtaking, agonizingly beautiful. They are truly works of art on wheels. Would viewers have been up in arms if filmmakers had destroyed a Van Gogh on film for sheer dramatic effect? Hell yeah. That's how gearheads feel when watching priceless, historic automobiles meet ugly ends simply because a movie studio can afford to trash them to make a profit. That said, I was glad to see "Gone" avoid the destruction of any truly cool cars, other than Eleanor, and gearheads will be pleased to note that the Eleanor crushed in the junkyard was a junk '67, stripped of all useful parts and given a good paint job. While on the subject of Eleanor, many reviewers have said that it was a replica '67 Shelby, and was a bad replica. Well, yes, technically it was meant to be a '67 Shelby. A tricked-out, customized, bad@$$ Shelby. It's not a bad replica, it's a spectacular custom. No, no Shelbys left the plant looking like Eleanor. If only they had. Aftermarket lighting, ground effects, hood, wheels, nitrous, roll cage... the list of modifications that have been clearly made to the car goes on and on, and the end result is one of the most beautiful cars the world has ever seen. The chase with Eleanor was very well done, except for that horribly fake-looking jump (honestly, with 90 mil to blow, couldn't you make that look better?) and the activation of nitrous at 7000 RPMs (I know all car guys got a laugh out of that.)In the final assessment, this was a fun movie. If you want character development, get "Citizen Kane." If you want to see scads of cars trashed for no reason whatsoever, get the original "GI60S" or "Ronin" (home of the most overrated car chases in movie history.) If you want to see true-to-life, absolutely realistic car chase action, watch Steve McQueen's green '68 Mustang GT390 duke it out with the black Charger R/T in "Bullitt," or better yet, switch on NASCAR Winston Cup racing next Sunday. If you want to have a good time, enjoy a movie, watch some cool cars and some sweet driving, get "Gone in Sixty Seconds."Postscript- if you liked this, you definitely need to check out the James Bond film, "Diamonds Are Forever," home of another amazing Ford Mustang chase sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got through watching "Gone in Sixty Seconds" and I have to say I really enjoyed it! You know, for what could probably be best described as an action movie, "Gone in Sixty Seconds" actually features some well-developed characters, a refreshing change of pace from what we're used to seeing in films of this genre. Simply put, when watching this movie you feel for the characters, are genuinely concerned for their well-being and root for them to succeed. The movie just works! I think Nicolas Cage does a great job in this movie. What's kind of weird, though, is how my feelings for Nic Cage change depending on what movie I watch him in. Sometimes I think he's a genius (in roles like "Matchstick Men" and "Adaptation") and sometimes I think he's a hack (in roles like "Drive Angry" and "The Wicker Man").Overall, I think the most exciting part of this movie is the big chase at the end, as I'm sure it was intended to be -- that's why they saved it for the finale. That being said, though, I also think the whole movie leading up to that is good, too. You wouldn't be so into the ending if you weren't interested in the circumstances that brought it about.I would definitely recommend checking this movie out, it's just a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in Sixty Seconds came on TV the other night and proved me right in avoiding it in theaters back in the day. Nicolas Cage offers his standard performance, Angelina Jolie gives a lesson in "wooden acting", while the rest of the crew duly follows.There is nothing essentially new or wrong in this movie. It introduces us to a world of small time crooks, car thieves and semi-competent police officers. Since the story revolves around cars, you might even enjoy it if you're into cars yourself.I'm always impressed how such mess of a movie gets funding and then even earns money at the box office.</fullReview>

I mean dang, what about when Nic Cage is all "Don't kill my brother," and the bad guy is all "Get these cars or I'll kill your brother." Filmmaking at it's finest right there. Director Dominic Sena really puts the pedal to the floor (LOL). I especially enjoy the Enlightenment era symbolism. It's crazy to think that Giovanni Ribisis' character echoes a young John Locke, while Angelina Jolie's character "Sway" ,in a very progressive role I must say, portrays Rene Descartes fresh, witty idiosyncrasies. As I sit here pondering whether or not NASCAR was truly inspired by the events that take place in this film, I find myself wondering, could Delroy Lindo be any more scrumtrillescent.</fullReview>

Jolie is wasted, of course, as she was in THE BONE COLLECTOR, and Robert Duvall was worse here than he was in THE SCARLET LETTER. About the action? Who cares. Seen it all before.

		<shortDescription>Not great, but this underrated car chase movie passes the time well enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A flashy, high-octane blockbuster movie with a big budget, big cast, and lots of adrenaline-pumping action, including a spectacular dramatic car chase which is very exciting to watch. One thing confuses me: why all the negative reviews? It seems that few if any people actually admit to liking this film, most of them slagging it off for being lame brained, over-the-top entertainment. That may be so, but I'm a sucker for action movies and this one hit the mark as far as I'm concerned. It may not be the best film ever made, it may not even be a very good one, but it packs in the excitement where it counts.Coming from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable, the film is packed full of the quick editing and noisy music we've come to expect from the producer of movies like CON AIR and Armageddon. Although the movie is quite slow to begin with, and it seems to take an age for the car-stealing to actually begin, once it does you won't be disappointed. Bruckheimer has assembled an all-star cast for his movie and although many of the actors and actresses are wasted, it's nice to have their presence felt nonetheless. A case in point is Robert Duvall: he has about fifteen minutes max screen time as the wise old man. A blond-haired Nicolas Cage takes the lead and puts in a rather subdued and forgettable performance, whilst in comparison Christopher Eccleston goes way over the top as the manic bad guy. Angelina Jolie lends the film some glamour but, in a film about expensive, beautiful sports cars, her presence is rather unnecessary. Giovanni Ribisi plays another brain dead moron to a realistic effect, while faces like those of Will Patton and Vinnie Jones fill out minor roles, the latter to great effect as a mute hard man.Okay, okay, I can see this film's flaws. The cheesy sentimentalising creeps in a bit too often for my liking, and all of the action is concentrated near the end instead of being spread out. However, I still stand by my words that the finale is a fantastic piece of work and that this is a great, easy viewing popcorn experience which doesn't disappoint. Just watch it expecting a movie with cool action AND wit, like THE MATRIX.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's entertaining but mostly the last half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing actors early on in their transition stage moving from different genres sure can be surreal sometimes. Perhaps for some, their actual screen presence is not as prevalent as it use to be, but the name itself carries a lot of weight when it comes to how successful a film could be (most of the time). Now a days, when the names Angelina Jolie, Nicolas Cage, Scott Caan, Chi McBride and Robert Duvall are mentioned, all have their names connected to some well-known movie. However, when seeing actors in a transition state where their not the main lead or are but are not given the liberties to do what they did in later films, it just feels strange. The title to this film actually sounds like a knock-off of The Fast and the Furious (2001) franchise that started after that. Pricey, shiny cars, looking to be stolen in a heist film? Sure sounds aggressive enough to be one. But does it turn out like it sounds? Ehh,...kind of but it is a bit misguided in areas. Compared to its 1974 original, the story is more of a soft remake than anything else.Written mainly by Scott Rosenberg who also wrote for High Fidelity (2000) and with uncredited rewrites by J.J. Abrams and Jonathan Hensleigh, the plot is about retired car thief Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) who is brought back to his old profession in order to save his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) after a major screw up with car trafficker Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). The job Raines has to complete is stealing 50 high-end cars and have them ready to ship out, otherwise, Raines' brother dies. So in order to complete this task, Raines gets the help from his old crew played by actors, Angelina Jolie, Scott Caan, Chi McBride, Will Patton, Robert Duvall, Vinnie Jones and some others. All the while, police officers Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) are on Raines' tail trying to figure out if the retired thief has re-entered his old profession. Directed by Dominic Sena who's only done a handful of films heads this production. Unfortunately, both the writing and direction have their issues.Going back to what was mentioned before, one would think if the title suggests something will be gone in sixty seconds, then the end result will be a fast paced, action film. The thing is, there is action and fast cars, but the build up to this is slower than necessary. Half of this film is Memphis Raines getting his posse together and over time removing the respective cars from their location. However, when this happens very few times is anybody speeding. It's more like nonchalantly cruising off. That doesn't sound that exciting, especially when considering the padding. For almost two hours, there are definitely some scenes that either could've been trimmed or removed completely. This is in due part with the writing, which has a minor subplot about Memphis Raines and Sway (Angelina Jolie) being in love once. It's brought up at one point, then put on hold before having the cliché of "being back together" later for no real reason. What's the point? Audiences aren't exactly given the clearest of backstory to their relationship therefor so what?Another problem is the lighting and coloring. According to sources, Sena's trademark look are sepia tone / yellowish colors in his film. However, this practically the only color available because there isn't a whole lot of other things that stand out. It doesn't make the viewing experience that interesting. With that though, there are still some nice highlights. The main leads to this film do have their moments together as a crew. Nicolas Cage plays the fence in his acting changing between calm and ready beat anyone who comes to take him out. Angelina Jolie may not be as active in this feature as her later roles would be but she still has a presence that can't be ignored. Vinnie Jones is a character that never talks and isn't explained as to why but he too has some moments that showcase he's not to be messed with. On the other hand, Chi McBride and Delroy Lindo are probably the most vocal, being that they add some kind energy to their roles. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast aren't engaging because there's too many and not enough development. There are however some nice deadpan comical moments delivered by Cage and that deals with his car named Eleanor who sort of has a mind of its own for some reason. It's dumb but funny. The cinematography by Paul Cameron (Man on Fire (2004) and Deja Vu (2006)) are well shot and work well the action scenes that do occur. Since it's wide screen, the look gives a broad range of view to see what surrounds the characters. The car chases that Nicolas Cage performs are decently exciting and are nicely edited. That's the way the rest of the film should have been executed. The music composed by synth enthusiast Trevor Rabin is a mixed bag. The score itself is pretty short surprisingly, clocking in only at a half-hour. Rabin does compose a main theme to Raines and Eleanor with a synth choir that pops up from time to time, but the rest of the tracks are somewhat muddled. There are some exciting cues that involve deep scratchy synth bases but they don't show up all that often because much of the tracks run on average about a minute. It's okay but could've been better.The electronic synth musical score, cinematography and main leads make the viewing experience watchable but the premise itself is squandered by slow pacing and infrequent action. To be gone in sixty seconds, the momentum this feature creates takes much longer than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It never Raines it pours.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.........A line delivered with as much ferocity as a child whom has just been given the keys to a sweet shop.Kip Raines was contracted to steal 50 specific cars, but he got a little too too cocky, and something went wrong. Now the man who hired him, Raymond Calitri, wants him dead. When his brother, Memphis, once a great car thief, learns of this, he comes back to town to see if he can help his brother. The only thing that will reason Calitri is if the order is fulfilled. So Memphis assembles his old crew, but has to do the job in a few days. A cop who hounded him for years, learning of his return, is keeping an eye on him......With the Advent of The Rock, and the fact that he won an Academy Award for LLV, Cage was a big draw for crowds for around four years. But then like Travolta, his choices became a little more silly, and this movie marks one of the last appearances where his star power really brought in the money.And he clearly does have screen presence here, especially when the script isn't really up to scratch, and he has to deal with an absolute plethora of characters, all with different traits, wanting the set to chew.I guarantee, if someone were to say to you 'Name ten people who appear in GISS' you would not have any trouble in doing so.But it's fun, Cage is as good as he ever was, and has a wonderful camaraderie with the rest of the cast. But the rest of the cast are your atypical cliché riddled characters.Jolie is the hardened to him jilted ex, but she warms to him. Duvall is the seasoned wisdom spouting fountain of knowledge. Lindo is the man after him, but he secretly really like him. Jones is the silent hard man. McBride is the loud mouth, what do you want from me sidekick.Patton is exactly the same character he played in Armageddon (it works though).And then there's Eccleston, even though the man is a fantastic actor, he is one of Bruckhiemers most forgettable villains. He has a thing for wood which never gets elaborated on, and he does nothing but be sarcastic and be in the grand finale which seems to be in the same place where T2 had its finale.Now if they did a cross over where he found a piece of the T800, and designed some sort of Terminator car, that would have been a bonkers film.It's not terrible by any means. It's funny, has the Bruckhiemer sheen, and it all ends how you would expect it too in film featuring fast cars...........a great big barbecue.Fun while it lasts, but you will forget about it........in sixty seconds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A retired master car thief (Nicolas Cage) must come back to the industry and steal fifty cars with his crew in one night to save his brother's life.I may not know much about cars and I know probably even less about stealing them, but this is a fun movie. A bit implausible, especially one scene with a car jumping a ramp and going like a quarter mile... but what fun, and what a great cast. Even Angelina Jolie, who is far from my favorite actress, is somewhat interesting here.This must have been around the tail end of Cage's golden age of roles. I think he did a few more that were decent since then (both "Lord of War" and "Weather Man" are great), but this was probably the last big film he did before his downfall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good decent Action heist Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone in 60 seconds (2000) is my favorite Action heist film of a cars and a car thief. Angelina Jolie in this film is fantastic, I seriously love her so much! I love her character. This is one of my favorite Nicolas Cage films and my favorite films about cars alongside with The Fast and the Furious.Don't expect a bullet-proof plot, but the cars and the action complement a surprisingly captivating storyline. Nicolas Cage gives a great performance as Memphis Raines, trying to help younger brother Kip Raines (also played well by Giovanni Ribisi) out of trouble. The supporting cast provides some great comedy as well. All in all, this is a movie you'll be able to watch over and over.This movie is downright one of the best movies I have ever seen. If you like fast cars you will love this awesome movie. A lot of people hate this film, I don't. I love it. I have enjoy watching this movie, when it come out and I think Nicholas Cage did a great job portraying Randall "Memphis" Raines a legendary car thief who has to back in action and steal 50. cars in one night for saving his brother. The action scenes and chase scenes are fantastic. This film is more about fast cars, been an auto mechanic, I was surprised that Angelina Jolie was an car mechanic in here, and she did a wonderful job as cast supporter. Delroy Lindo as Det. Roland Castlebeck was outstanding as a smart cop who will stop at nothing to bust "Memphis" at all cost.The pros try to steal the 50 cars. Delroy Lindo, as the cop, knows who they are and what they plan to do, but wants to catch them at it. He intuits that the key theft will be of a 1967 Shelby GT 350 Mustang, a car Memphis both loves and fears. "He'll save that for the last," says Lindo, planning to nab him in the act. This decision means that 49 cars will already have been stolen before Memphis moves on the Mustang I love this film to death It is my favorite car flick alongside with The Fast and The Furious (2001)! I don't care what anyone says I will always love this film no matter what! Gone in 60 Seconds is like a practice game between the varsity and the reserves. Everybody plays pretty well, but they're saving up for Saturday. First team is Nicolas Cage, Delroy Lindo and Robert Duvall. Second team is Giovanni Ribisi, Will Patton and Angelina Jolie, who gets second billing but not much playing time. There are lots of subs who come off the bench for a play or two. This is the kind of movie that ends up playing on the TV set over the bar in a better movie.A legendary car booster thinks he left the fast lane behind him until he's forced out of retirement to save his kid brother from the wrath of an evil mobster. It is nothing less than a full throttle race to pull off the ultimate car heist: 50 exotic beauties in 24 hours -- and the cops are already onto them! Randall "Memphis" Raines long ago abandoned his life of crime, but after an ominous visit from an old friend, he finds he has no choice but to return to what he does best - stealing cars - in order to save his brother's life. It all comes down to one night, 50 cars and a contract. A true automobile aficionado, Memphis has a burning passion for cars. Fuel-injected, high-performance, v-8, v-12, turbo-charged, loaded or stripped to the bare essentials, he knows and loves every nut and bolt, every gleaming piece of chrome. Memphis is a car thief of legendary proportion. No fancy lock or alarm can stop him; your car will be there and gone in 60 seconds. For years, Memphis eluded the law while boosting every make and model imaginable, with the exception of one elusive car, his beloved Eleanor, a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500. When the heat became too intense, he left everything and everyone he loved to find a different life. But when his kid brother tries to follow in his footsteps only to become dangerously embroiled in a high-stakes caper, Memphis is sucked back into his old life, tearing up the streets for one last death-defying heist.Gone in 60 Seconds is a 2000 American action heist film, starring Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Eccleston, Robert Duvall, Vinnie Jones, and Will Patton. The film was directed by Dominic Sena, written by Scott Rosenberg, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of The Rock and Con Air (both of which starred Cage) and Armageddon (which starred Patton), and is a loose remake of the 1974 H.B. Halicki film of the same name.10/10 Grade: A Studio: Touchstone Pictures, Jerry Bruckheimer Films Starring: Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo Director: Dominic Sena Producers: Jerry Bruckheimer, Mike Stenson, Denice Shakarian Halicki Screenplay: H.B.

		<shortDescription>needs more fun car chases and more Jolie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) is a brash car thief. His brother Memphis (Nicolas Cage) retired from the business to run a kiddie go-cart business. After a Kip screw up, Atley Jackson (Will Patton) forces Memphis to take over the job as the villain Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) keeps Kip hostage. Memphis has to steal 50 specific cars in 4 days. He reassembles some of his old crew with Kip's new crew. Detectives Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) are hot on his trail.Ribisi is his usual jittery hopeless loser character. Cage is toned down in this one. In a sense, that's indicative of a missed opportunity. It tries to be serious a little and that's the wrong path. This needs to be silly and fun. It also needs more Jolie who is really only tied for the third lead with a dozen other actors. This really needs to be fun wall-to-wall car chases. There is not enough of them and after an initial chase, it takes too long to get to the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in 60 Seconds (2000): Dir: Dominic Sena / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo, Robert Duvall: Big budget noise with as much nonsense as it can acquire. Title refers not just to the physical but also the mental duration with former car thief Nicolas Cage returning to his home town. His brother attempted to pull a boost and was caught. Cage is ordered to steal 50 cars in one night or his brother will be terminated. He enlists the help of old players who consists of the usual rat pack. Last twenty minutes are a constant car chase where Cage hurls a car over a ramp. There is also unnecessary footage of a neighborhood gang. Directed by Dominic Sena who previously made Kalifornia. While Cage plays a guy who can think on the spot and act fast, he certainly didn't use this ability to leave the set. Angelina Jolie is wasted as a waitress who does nothing more than don weird hair styles. Giovanni Ribisi is totally cardboard as Cage's brother although being in this film seems to be enough of a punishment. Delroy Lindo plays a cop. That pretty much sums up his role. Robert Duvall is a terrific actor but caught up in limited screen time and a plot undeserving of his talent. Nothing new and who cares. Technically well made but hardly passes as a screenplay or even entertainment. It calls for squealing tires and wreckage in its most pointless state. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>60 seconds, 60 seconds, 60 seconds? you missed the point, really. This isn't about stars, characters, plot. The cars are your stars. I watched this version back to back with the original, and wow, there is really no comparison. This loose remake tried way too hard to re-think such a basic concept that didn't need so much re-thinking. The original was low-budget and high-speed, which worked. That's the movie it was. For this version to share a name with that version is akin to false advertising. This one was without a doubt low-speed and certain more high-budget than the original. Attempts at humor? Forced. Excitement about the illicit behavior of stealing cars? Not there. It is derivative, not of its source material, but of various other heist-style films, by trying to find suspense in the behind-the-scenes drama of who ordered the car thefts and why and what was going to happen if the team didn't come through. Whatever. Let's just get some cars on the road and see 'em wreck! Check the original for a movie that lives up to its premise. This one is a vehicle for anything other than cars. (Yes, that's deliberately pointing to irony that wasn't intended by the filmmakers.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go.Now I have been meaning to review this movie for some time now I'll do it while it may not be one of the best films ever made I'm one of those movie fans who looks past the junk and see the treasure. But this film is pretty fun to watch if you are into Cars like I am.The films centers around Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) trying to help his brother Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) by coming out of retirement after he was a master car thief to steal 50 cars for Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) or Kip will be killed. With Detective Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and his partner Detective Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) So Memphis turns to his old friends Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall), Donny Astricky (Chi McBride) The Sphinx (Vinnie Jones), Sara 'Sway' Wayland (Angelina Jolie) while Kip turns to his friends Mirror Man (T.J. Cross), Tumbler (Scott Caan) Freb (James Duval) Toby (William Lee Scott). Now the plot is interesting to make you want to watch the film if you are into cars and action films The film is written clearly to be a film about action and it does have those moments and they actually have some knowledge on the cars they used in the film which is actually surprising. And they pick some very good cars to use in the film. There are some tense moments in the film that make you go did they just do that ? you have to watch and see what happens in the film to know what I'm talking about. The film was done to please car and action fans it actually did well for a change.My advice is to check it out you might be reward for watching a film with good car stunts.I give Gone In Sixty Seconds a 8 out of 10</fullReview>

And Nicolas Cage does fantastically as the lead in this movie.This movie is about a car thief, Memphis Raines. He's a former thief, actually. But when his brother gets into some trouble with other thieves, Memphis must get his crew back together to pull off the greatest car heist in history. He needs to get fifty specific, high end cars and transport them to the big boss in only a matter of days. Memphis doesn't really want to be risking it, but for his brother, he does. With the cops on their trail, and only a few hours left, Memphis must get that very last car.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As remakes go, "Gone in Sixty Seconds" isn't as bad as say, the made-for-TV "Vanishing Point", but it's certainly no improvement on the original movie. They added a police subplot, huge cast and turned it into a Nicolas Cage vehicle. What's funny about this movie is that, it's stylistically very similar to "The Fast and the Furious" (with a scoop of "Ocean's Eleven" thrown in). It's shot like a music video, lots of whip pans, green lighting and fast cuts.Yet it's disappointingly lifeless. Even the frenetic car chases don't help here (dizzying doesn't equal exciting). And as for that cast (high-profile as it is) Chi McBride is easily at the head of class, while Giovanni Ribisi is . . . well, the less said about him, the better. At the very least, they stayed fairly true to the prized Mustang of the '70s movie (this time, it's a '67 Shelby), and made her the star of the show. If that car can't sell tickets, I dunno what could. Oddly, such an attraction was blurred out on the poster, in favor of floating heads Cage and Jolie (ugh, that hair).But get that original movie out of your head, because such a comparison does this remake no favors.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of the classic Gone In 60 Seconds (1974). looked promising but for me this wasn't a good flick. The first hour is talking and talking and a bit of act and mouse with the police who know something is going on. After one hour this flick slowly moves into a bit of action but it's waiting until the end to see the best, The Ford Mustang Shelby GT-500. that chase is worth seeing as are the other cars throughout this flick. The problem was that I was more into the expensive Italian cars and the muscle cars then into the actual story itself. Not really my thing storywise although I always liked the acting of Cage. For me Need For Speed (2014)was much better with a better story and directing. Still, if you are into flicks with cars then this is it, but if you dig action like Fast and Furious franchise you won't get it here, sadly.Gore 0/5 Nuidty 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage for all leading roles in a variety of films he played. The Gone in Sixty Seconds production was very unique in terms of exotic cars, stunts performed and off course the story. I remember when i was 18, I'd watch this movie almost few times a week and simply never get tired. I'm assuming, the reason why i'd be so into it, is because of the exotic cars and the speed that Nicolas character Memphis would accelerate from zero to 60. And I'll be honest, when i came across Shelby GT-500 on zeroto60.co stats, i wanted to watch this movie instantaneously but watching at the age of 18 was much more exiting. Even though so many years passed, the movies is still good, but hopefully they'll make the second one with Nicolas Cage and co-star Angelina Jolie.</fullReview>

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has this formula down cold: top acting talent (Oscar-winners Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Robert Duvall, along with rising star Ribisi and the sensationally talented Lindo), some snappy dialogue, a cool and clever hero, and lots and lots of chases, all done with such panache that even a "my dog ate it" plot twist doesn't derail things. Memphis and the cop both long to capture one elusive prize. For Memphis, it is "Eleanor," the '67 Mustang he never managed to steal successfully. For the cop, it is Memphis himself, the one thief he never managed to catch. Check your brain at the door, enjoy with popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of H.B. Halicki's 1974 cellar-dweller stars Nicolas Cage as a notorious former car thief whose criminal abstinence is broken when his kid brother (Giovanni Ribisi) is threatened by mobsters after failing to repay gambling debts. Cage must assemble a crew that can steal 50 of the most sought-after cars in just five days or risk his brother's life. Detective (Lindo) is on the case, the capture of his long-time nemesis Cage potentially a career-maker, but catching him in the act proves to be a difficult proposition.Blending high octane stunt-work with witty dialogue and light humour ("are you okay? are you sure? because you just went through a wall"), it's a fast-paced nonsense that defies logic and realism, but delivers adequate entertainment for little investment. Apart from Robert Duvall, the cast while somewhat shallow, all execute likable characters, with junior Caan one of Cage's motley crew, and Angelina Jolie on the cusp of fame proving that looks can be deceiving in the underground world of professional grand larceny. Christopher Eccleston (one of the recent "Doctor Who" incarnations) and Will Patton also star, while former soccer player Vinnie Jones features in a supporting role as a silent stand-over man.Your standard, garden variety Cage vehicle comprises a few chuckles (the scene in which TJ Cross' character is 'interrogated' by a snake after stealing a car) and probably garners more for the auto enthusiast with its car collectibles on display, though it's not quite as obsessed with the hot-wheels theme as "Fast and Furious". Modest thrills, light entertainment, only the epic two hour run-time slows the pace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In theory, this premise (remake or not) might seem like something exciting, but the movie is not well-executed. It may look good, and it may be well-made, but there's a big difference between a well-made movie and a good movie. The characters are paper thin (there's no real acting here), which obviously means there's nobody to care about or worth caring about, and the story (except for the big chase scene &amp; final confrontation) is flat. And the movie goes on forever. Even Cage can't save it, despite being the only interesting character. Robert Duvall and Angelina Jolie are also underused here. And aside from all these characters being car thieves, the movie doesn't give us any reason to care abut its characters. It's probably a movie better suited for watching on a plane.** out of ****</fullReview>

Though I do wish the end car chase would have been longer, it was appropriate and well done. This movie is 100 times better than Fast and the Furious. Why? Because it actually had a storyline and not just a bunch of cars going really fast. It is definatly more suspensful seeing the cops chase someone through crowded city streets than seeing a bunch of cars racing on a straight quarter-mile streach.

Be gone in 60 seconds.The is the story about Randy Raines, Played by (in a vain effort to cling to his youth the same way he's clinning to his hairline) Nicholas Cage. Rains is a retired car-jacker. He forced to come out of retirement after his brother ,played by Giovanni Rabisi, falls out of favor with his chop-shop boss. There ins't anymore to be explained about the plot, becuse it's that thin and thoughtless. If it isn't bad enough that this is one of the most predictable films of all time, the movie is a shameless PG-13 rating, that glamourizes one of the most honorless trade skills of our society. Angelina Jolie really manages to sink this movie to the lowest common denomiator when she say "What do you think is better, having sex or sealing cars?" There are no interseting characters, no original ideas, and nothing the is appealing about this movie. The fact that it was able to gross 100 million at the box office is prabably because ticket prices are too high.Before you even think about seeing this pretty piece of trash, I suggest going to see the real box office sensation "The Fast and the Furious" at a much more suitable choice.</fullReview>

This is shown from the start. Memphis then must steal 50 specific cars in three days. An intriguing task and one which could make for a very interesting film, however, the film takes much too long to build to the climax.Once all of the dull set ups and preparation for the job is finally done, the film explodes into fun filled action ending in an outstanding climax. The last "boost" (theft) ignites into an well set up and edited car chase between Memphis and a police detective.The film would have been much better if there was a little less concentration on setting up the series of "boots" and more on actually "boosting" the cars.</fullReview>

I found this movie to be one that possessed some really good things and some really bad ones.First, the movie does have some horrible expository writing that the actors could have done without. I don't think that directors can take the "but this is an action movie!" stance, since both good writing and good action buildup have coincided peacefully and rightfully in other movies.Second, I can't help but contrast the camera angles with those of Mission: Impossible 2's. Obviously, in Gone in 60 Seconds, the director wanted the audience to feel disoriented. I think he went a tad overboard. The result was too disorienting. Woo was able to find a good balance; the director of Gone in 60 Seconds was not.Third, knowing of the original, I was excited about a multi-million remake. The director should have taken some hints from the movie's predecessor. I wanted to see cars crash, spin and soar. The only true chase was alright, but it leaves you begging for more and wishing that there was more true action in the movie overall.Fourth, although the writer knew that there had to be multiple antagonists to be pitted against the strong protagonists, they turn out to be weak, and in some cases, ill-fitted for a movie where the audience is expecting chases to happen in cars, not on foot (see the movie, you'll see what I mean).Fifth (onto the good things), despite the extensive and numbing expository, there were some very subtle parallels plugged into the plot. The villain's salvage yard versus Otto's restoration shop is one for example. There was at least, some thought put into the writing after all.Sixth, the contrast of and tensions between the young and old generations was also delightful. For me, that was one of the best things about the movie.So, I'd give it a 5 out of 10. The action was good, but the camera angles stank. The writing had some very good ideas plugged into it, but the exposition and protagonist/antagonist conflict were ludicrous. So, see the movie and enjoy it. It's not a pure action movie, but it's neither a drama. If you want a one-time thrill and don't care much about what is said in a movie, this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of passing interest to gearheads only really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it, I get excited at the sight of a sleek hunk of wheeled machinery built for speed. So, this movie was like eating a large candy bar for me. Not terribly filling, but enjoyable enough while it lasts. Nobody puts in a real standout performance. The characters are all stock (the natural, the veteran, the rookie with something to prove, the hacker etc...) but are cast well enough to hold your interest most of the time. Except the bad guy, he comes across as just crazy instead of dangerous. This movie could have had very serious niche appeal to gearheads with a greater emphasis on the cars, but alas Bruckheimer and crew wanted to give it more mass appeal so the story focuses on family love and interaction and tends to shy away from serious chases. Things do finally get revved up near the end, but the chase is for the most part ridiculous "action film" exaggeration instead of smartly edited scenes of fast cars doing what they're built to do (a la Bullitt). There are some real beauties on display, even if only for a few frames here and there, but for what must have been budget constraints nothing gets pushed around all that hard. Save for "Eleanor", a beautiful tricked out 67 Mustang (meant to be a Shelby GT, not even close). If you love cars you'll find enough to interest you here for a little while, though you may feel compelled to hit fast forward at times through the character intensive bits. If you want to see lots of cars go fast, though, see the original. Its plot was equally as transparent but they didn't skimp when it came to action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cast was enough to make me want to see it. I love Nicolas Cage and Robert Duvall, I believe Delroy Lindo is one of the best kept secrets of Holywood, Vinnie Jones will be Britain's next big thing and then there is Angelina Jolie -nuff said. The plot is rather shallow, but people won't see this movie for the plot. They 'll see it for the action and they 'll see it for the cars. Not being a car person, I just enjoyed the buddies getting together and going for it although all the odds are against them. Cage is their maestro, Duvall the veteran and Jolie the thief you would happily give your car to, Chi McBride is the very bad villain, Delroy Lindo the very good cop and that's about it.But it works. The action is fast, the cars are fast, the editing is fast, the titles sequence is fast. "Gone in 60 seconds" is like making 100 mph on the freeway -you don't think about it, you just have fun doing it. Car aficionados observed several goofs, but us action movie buffs just lay back and enjoy the action. Having that in mind, you will like the movie. And then you will rent something like "High Fidelity" to see how you can really base a movie on characters. 7/10 for action, good rhythm and cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing all the hype for Gone In Sixty Seconds from many of my friends who had read this or that about the film, I had the impression that it would be a flick filled with explosive car chases, but, rather it had only one car chase, might I add it was to spectacular and was of the predictable type. Also, I think the parts weren't played well, especially by the villain. The film makers did not express him enough -- I wasn't afraid of him, he seemed kind of wimpy, not a very scary bad guy -- and that he did not pose an immediate threat. All in all, it was a poor chase movie but a stylish heist film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but a bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a car guy. That is the main reason I was interested in this movie. I expected to see a lot of hot cars and great chases and I was disappointed. The only real car chase is at the end with Memphis (Nicholas Cage) in the Shelby GT500 (which was of course a replica, and a pretty bad one at that.) It was a decent chase scene but was quite unrealistic in places, especially when he jumps over the cars on the bridge.The acting was decent, although not the best work for any of the well known actors that were in the movie. Cage was decent but I think he was held back by the character. Jolie was a much less important character than the previews would have you believe and I wish she had more screen time. Ribisi was just so-so, which is very unusual for him but again, I think that the role was limiting for him. Overall the movie was entertaining but nothing special. I gave it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film helped me loose my faith in Hollywood...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is completely horrible. Without a doubt one of the worst films 2000 brought to us on the big screen. Pretty bold statements, I know, but there is truth behind them. I finished watching the film knowing only what I knew going in; "It's about stealing cars". There's not much more to it than that. No real sub-plots to speak of, and the few that surfaced were weak, and died after a couple of scenes. Actors were just empty shells, with no real motivation. Cars were given names to signify that they were just as important, if not MORE IMPORTANT as the actors piloting them. Welcome to mainstream Hollywood cinema everyone.I'm not a big fan of Nick Cage, and stick to my guns that the only decent film he's done is "Bringing Out The Dead". Similarly, Angelina Jolie isn't on the top of my list either, yet if there was a performer that was grossly underused in any film ever, it's Ms. Jolie here. Time her screen appearances. What did you get? Fifteen minutes? And in that time we figure out she is a crack mechanic, loves stealing cars, at one time dated the title character, at one time stole cars with the title character, gets turned on by stealing cars, still loves the title character, and actually never stopped loving him. A lot learned in a little bit of time. Jolie is present as a piece of meat. Nothing else. Maybe they should have talked to her Oscar, and found out that she CAN act. It could have helped the movie. They might as well have put a blonde wig on a Chevy Nova, and `creatively' named it `Angelina' like they did with all the rest of the cars featured. Would have had the same effect.But alas. The movie stereotypes itself in order to please the common male. Cars, cars, cars, a strong woman who is eventually broken down by an even stronger man, and more cars. Predictable storyline, wandering plot, and actors that could have been replaced with cardboard cut-outs without us being the wiser. Seeing this movie in the same night as "Hollow Man" really made me loose my faith in Hollywood. Too commercialized, too stereotypical, and therefore too predictable. Show a nine-year-old child seven Hollywood "blockbusters", and then on the eighth, ask him/her to predict what will happen next. Chances are he/she'll be able to do it. Are we, the audience, less intelligent than a nine-year-old child? "Gone In Sixty Seconds" seems to think so. And THAT is something that sickens me.</fullReview>

Instead of just keep watching the movie as an ordinary another one, try to pay attention very deeply on the car racing scenes, with Porshes, Mercedes and of course with the Shelby Mustang one, which is absolutely amazing... And, if you really are a car lover, you can have all the emotions and feelings inside you... Can you imagine yourself driving a Shelby Mustang in a very high speed running away from the police? And still not satisfied with the velocity pushing the Nitro Turbo button? And what about jumping over an entire traffic using a lifting truck? Well, the movie is not cars all the time... you can have also the pleasure of watching a very hot sex scene with Angelina Jolie... My suggestion is to watch this movie, enjoy it, and if possible keep it recorded with you for a down moment, because I am absolutely right that it can put you up again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gone in sixty seconds" is a good film to watch in the cinema, but once you rent it on video you notice what the strength was of this film. It's still pretty good though, but that same cinema-effect is gone (in 60 seconds), even if you watch it on DVD. That's the only thing that "Gone in sixty seconds" has to offer: great and impressive action scenes along with some decent camera shots in order to make those particular scenes even more impressive and to finally get to those few 'cool' and imposing car chases. Unfortunately, the rest is not as good as the 'groovy' action. None of the acting performances are really good. They're not bad, but many actors in this film have done much better before. (Nicolas Cage ? "Face/off", Angelina Jolie ? "Girl interrupted" and Robert Duvall ? "Apocalypse now!") And so you would expect something better from these people; although I do realize that this is still an action film and that action films rather have great ACTION than great ACTING. The best performance (if there is such a thing in this film) comes from Nicolas Cage. The same goes for the story: it is pretty lame and at times predictable. The 'few' jokes are bad and the only interesting character is a (big, but without saying one word) guy called 'The Sphinx'. On the other side, Angelina Jolie is a very pretty girl and I can't wait to see her as Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider-movie.All things considered: a pretty good action film with beautiful cars and great car chases, ... but unfortunately: there have been many great action pictures similar to these throughout the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok let's start off with the positive side of this film: All the acting is very well done, I would say aside from Cage the best part is done by Delroy Lindo, he plays the cop like this is an oscar-contender movie.This one was a big disappointment in the believable department. We aren't shown in detail how one car is stolen. It's like magic how Angelina's character drives away a growling V-12 Lamborghini without making a sound while it's owner is on the other side of the house window. The car chases are very tv-style and the camera work is choppy and convoluted. After watching Ronin, theses chases seem like a commercial. It would have been nice to have this movie be 100% believable, but to top it off, Cage's Shelby lands a jump that would have wrecked the frame and/or suspension completely and drives away.Moral of the story: Rent Bullitt or Ronin instead.</fullReview>

But for JB all that is expected, even enjoyable when packaged well.What GI60S lacks is any sense of intensity. It commits the unforgivable JB sin: it's dull. Boring, even. It fails to deliver the audience-pleasing cliches we've come to associate with JB (which should rightfully be credited to Michael Bay and Tony Scott) -- pounding obvious musical cues, fantastic explosions, "woah!" slow-motion and panning shots, cartoon-vivid heroes and villains.And then there's the big action moment, which to my eyes suffered from a missing zero in the special effects budget.If you want to entertain yourself with pretty cars, buy a coffee-table book -- you'll see more. If you like the cast, see them in something else -- their performances here are flat. This film is so poor, Angelina Jolie doesn't even look sexy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How is it that 3 Oscar winning actors (Cage, Jolie and Duvall) all picked this script? That being said, how is it possible that neither of them turned in a credible performance?? Granted, they weren't given much to work with, but quite frequently the dialogue was delivered so awkwardly I felt embarrassed for them. In a movie that was based on high-adrenaline car chases, it is sad that not one of them gets your blood pumping, not one of them leaves you on the edge of your seat, and not once do you really care if the car crashes and all of the lead characters die. A car chase is the most over used action device available to a film maker - you would think that Bruckheimer and his team could have put together a believable chase sequence. Not so.And come on, the final climax "face-off" scene between Cage and the cop who has been chasing him for years? Nice try, but I don't think so. They must have some really forgiving law enforcement officers in Hollywood.It's not the worst film I've ever seen, not a bad rental if there's nothing else on the shelves. Just don't expect too much...and be glad you didn't pay the $12 to see it at the theatres. I certainly am.</fullReview>

Memphis must steal 50 cars in 3 days or his brother will be killed. Memphis frantically gathers his old crew, and Kip and his crew. They scout the cars, and then try to steal a few of the cars but the local police are on them and "the ladies are dirty". The climax of the movie is with Eleanor, the 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500. Memphis races around the city at over 100 mph at times trying to loose the cops. A great movie, with action and a story.

		<fullReview>There was hardly a minute that passed in Gone in 60 Seconds where I didn't wonder, "Holy Cow, Why Is __Insert Actor's Name__ In the Movie?" I kept wishing that all of these talented actors had split up and decided t do two or three really good movies instead of one hideously dully piece of garbage. You've got three Oscar winners: Angelina Jolie, Nicholas Cage, and Robert Duvall. There are a handful of familiar indie-film faces: James Duvall, Timothy Olyphant, and Giovanni Ribisi. There are one or two faces familiar from European films: Vinnie Jones and Christopher Eccelston. And then you've got a couple classy actors who seem to specialize in stealing scenes: Chi McBride, Will Patton, and especially Delroy Lindo. Oh yeah. The talent onscreen is impressive. However, Gone In Sixty Seconds highlights the principle flaw of the Jerry Bruckheimer school of filmmaking.The strategy in Bruckheimer's recent action extravaganzas is to fill the screen with as much talent as possible, pay a half dozen hip screen writers to produce catchy dialogue, and then hand the film over to a director with no experience. To be fair, Dominic Sena has actually made a movie previously (the moody Brad Pitt film Kalifornia). It only looks like he hasn't. This is perhaps because rather than hiring talented and experience technical people, Bruckenheimer has entrusted the look of this film to a cinematographer and production designer clearly not up to the task of producing a coherent film. What's up on the screen is a chaotic mess for which there's too much blame to accurately passed around. Gone In Sixty Seconds looks like an overblown car commercial. And in reality, I guess that's all it is.Working from the general theme of H.B. Halicki's 1974 minimalist auto theft picture, Scott Rosenberg certainly hasn't added anything by way of plot. Basically "Memphis" Raines (Cage), the now-retired greatest car thief in the world, returns to LA to help his brother out of a jam. Recycling the hoariest device known to writers, Raines must get the old gang back together for the heist of their lives, stealing 50 cars in 1 night. Oh my! It's just that pointless. And it's even more counter-intuitive. Every single action in the film prompts a response of "Oh, surely there was an easier way to do that." There isn't a single action in the entire film -- not a single motivation, character, or sequence -- that feels the slightest bit real. Or understandable. If you take it all on faith and just wait for car races and things blowing up, you're still liable to be disappointed. With the exception of the amusing final chase, which takes up the last twenty minutes of the film, everything is run of the mill. And yet, this film made 100 million at the box office, while a fresh, exciting, well written film like Ronin, which featured some of the best car chases in decades, was a disappointment. It's all kinda sad.Everything is strangely lit. The photography is frequently just ugly. None of the one-liners have any pop. And the actors are just stranded. Cage sleepwalks. Duvall cackles pointlessly. And beyond looking kinda hot, Jolie does nothing at all. Ribisi comes closest to acting, but then again, I could just be confusing performance with bad facial hair. It happens.I'd give this one 2/10. I'm not sure what exactly elevates Gone In Sixty Seconds above a 1 star film except that sometimes it was unintentionally funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cars are by far the best part of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like cars, this is the movie to watch. That is the only point I could see in the movie at all. The acting was sub-par, as well as the plot, and the "non-stop action," as some have called it, was hardly enough to make me blink. I've even seen better car chases in several other movies, such as Ronin. Watching the movie just to look at cars was the only reason I slightly enjoyed this movie. It's a good movie for lots of people because you don't have to pay attention to the plot at all and still catch a couple of fun parts. Otherwise, don't waist your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lame remake to be sure but what do you expect from Bruckheimer ? How about a script written in sixty seconds. Nick Cage doesnt really try to save this action oriented movie . With so many holes I dont know where to begin. How about here:First, Gio Ribisi's character Hip is so jaded in this movie, they should have changed his name to Lack, as in lacking anything interesting.Angelina Jolie. I've seen cameos with more on-screen time. Her character, what was her name, hmmm, oh I think it was Lips, anyway, it was like on-screen time = sixty seconds. And could someone explain to me how she rolls out from under an engine and not scrapes her lips on the bottom of the car !Lindo as the cop is poorly written, makes detectives look like idiots. And Bob Duvall is in for some loose change.No character development at all. Less emphasis on the actual cars they are stealing than you'd think (I would have actually enjoyed a little more history and nostalgia regarding said autos). And the inevitable-we-can-out-do-Bullit car chase through the city at the end. Didn't Nick do the same in The Rock ? and now this - I'd say he's a shoe-in for a remake of the Steve McQueen classic.Aptly named though, because when you pop this one in the DVD/VCR player, you'll be Bored in....... You Guessed IT !! Sixty Seconds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were two motives for me to rent this movie. One, I'm a huge Nicolas Cage fan (ever since Face Off). And two, I love cars. (Yes, very out of the ordinary for a girl, but what can I say? I love Mercedes.)I had heard guys in my marketing class talk about this movie. They told me it was really cool and you could take auto theft to a higher level. That's very true with this movie. Memphis and his crew had a great way of stealing cars. It was the unthinkable. They stole cars that were said to be "unstealable". All throughout the movie I was asking, "Can they really do that?" or "Do the police know about this?" Haha...The action scenes were bad either. Although I think they needed more of them. Usually, I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this one was an exception. The scenes with Memphis driving the last car was the best. I also liked the last part of the movie. It was a real tear-jerker for me. The movie was also very funny in some scenes.I didn't like how the movie lacked depth in script. It wasn't much of a real movie, if you ask me. But I guess you can't expect too much out of movies that are in the "action" genre.Anyways, if you're a real action movie-goer, then you should see this. If you're looking for more depth in movies, then avoid this at all costs. If you LOVE fast-racing cars, then you should DEFINITELY see this!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fasten your seatbelts for a thrill ride that will knock your socks off. "Gone in Sixty Seconds" is one ride I didn't want to stop because it had everything I ever want in a movie.As soon as I heard Jerry Bruckheimer and Nicolas Cage I knew "Gone in Sixty Seconds" would be a good movie and they didn't disappoint. A with their earlier project together, "Con Air," Cage and Bruckheimer bring us non-stop action. Cage is joined by Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, Angelina Jolie, Will Patton and Giovani Ribisi as they only have 24 hours to steal 50 cars.There are several things that appealed to me right away when I saw this film. First, the dialogue is intelligent, the cast is superb and the plot is something to be proud of. I wish everyone can get the opportunity I did to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A battle of wits and a change of values in high stakes car theft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone in 60 Seconds 2000. A car thief, Kip,in a sophisticated organized crime group makes a mistake while boosting [stealing] a car. The boss of the outfit is a ruthless murderer shipping highly expensive, rare cars overseas and wants to use the bungler Kip as an example and to bribe Memphis, Kip's brother and ex-thief with a reputation as the best to steal 50 rare and expensive cars by Friday morning at 8 AM. Memphis resists and then gives in to snatch his brother from being crushed at the salvage lot. He quickly organizes some of the old gang and some new people with unique skills plus his old girlfriend, Sway,he left when he reformed. The movie depicts the psychology of car thieves and car theft, as well as the unique psychology of the different types of experts in car stealing. It shows the loyalty to family and within a ring of thieves to each other over the law. This is contrasted with the ruthless use of money and power and threat of death by the boss to bully and bribe Memphis and the gang to carry out his high-risk scheme. The risk is heightened because the police who had tried to catch him before he reformed finds out that he is back and is once again involved in car theft. The ruthless boss lays down his terms as allowing Skip to live plus $200,000 with the stipulation that they meet the deadline exactly because that is the time the boat shipping the cars is to leave. The ring plays out the nearly impossible feat under the time pressure and while playing cat and mouse under the eye of the police. During the execution of the last heist, Memphis and his old girlfriend repair their lost love and reunite. After a harrowing last chase where Memphis shows his extraordinary skill and his determination to save his brother, he, nevertheless, winds up with the boss ordering Kip to be murdered anyway because Memphis was 12 minutes late. During a deadly tussle with the boss and his henchmen, the police suddenly enter the scene and the fracas ends with both Memphis and the police pitted against the boss. Memphis saves the policeman's life as he kills the boss. In return, the policeman, seeing Memphis has really reformed and was only back into car stealing to save his brother, decides not to arrest him. As he walks away, Memphis tells the policeman where to find the cars. The gang, having gotten together just to save Kip and for the thrill and comradery of the old car stealing days, has a parting party to celebrate the ordeal and their success, totally unconcerned with not getting the money, illustrating that this crime's appeal is its thrill which is greater even than sex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Cheesy, Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone in 60 seconds is a really good movie that has a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera. Lots of people have bashed the movie for being dumb and corny, corny yes its corny but its means to be, and stupid well to me a stupid movie is one that doesn't accomplish what it was aiming for (like Bless the Child...WORST movie EVER), so no Gone in 60 seconds is not stupid. Jerry Bruckheimer produced it so you know what you're in for when you sit down to watch it, which isn't a bad thing his movies are fun and have great action scenes and snappy dialogue (but what do u expect when Scott Rosenberg wrote it...Beautiful Girls, Con Air, &amp; Things to do in Denver when you're dead are all cool movies with great dialogue). The characters are all cool ("Memphis" and "The Sphinx" r the best) and yes the movie is cheesy at times but hey at times everyone likes a cheesy thing or two (Shaft is another cheesy movie from the summer that was great). Most say the movie is all set up until the very cool chase scene at the end (which ends with some really stiff CGI of the Shelby GT 500 jumping over an accident...that could have been better looking) but the set up is fun and never boring, u get to know the characters as much as u need to and have some laughs along the way. The only problem with Jerry Bruckheimer movies is that I like a movie that is also a visual ride (which is what all his movies are including this one) but they all look the same...u know the orange/yellow look most scenes have and when it's dark it's REALLY dark, it's like even though he uses different directors and the movies look good they look the same, Dominic Sena directed Kalifornia which is another great movie and yes it and Gone in 60 seconds do kinda have the same visual style but tell me u can see a difference in his and Michael Bay's work. But thats my only problem (which isn't that big). Gone in 60 seconds is a fast moving, funny, very cool movie. Ya wanna have fun with a movie see this one, makes me wanna go steal a car :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like cars you will love this film!There are some superb actors in the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance.The others are not bad either....There are only two slight flaws to this film. Firstly, the poor plot, however people don't watch this film for the plot. Secondly, the glorification of grand theft auto (car crime). However if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it then good look to them, hope you have a good time in jail!When i first read that Nicolas Cage was to act the main role, i first thought "...sweeet.", but then i thought "...naaaa you suck!" but then finally after watching the film i realised "...yep he suck's!".Only joking he plays the role very well.I'll end this unusual review by saying "If the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this death carries with it an inherent nobility. And a supreme glory. We should all be so fortunate. You can say "Poor Criminal." I say: "Poor us."p.s. - Angelina Jolie Voight looks quite nice!</fullReview>

There's no point in watching this movie except for the fashion show of cars passing through since the story is a complete waste of time, the ending(after the car chase) is so ridiculous it doesn't make any sense. More car chase scenes should have been added, like a Dodge Viper(was there even one in the movie?) vs. a Ferrari, and more footage of cars captured because a 2 second shot of a car in the background is just a waste of time. Another thing I want to add, how in the world did a Jaguar XJ220 suddenly pop up? If they had that super-car, why not a Mclaren F1!? Why wasn't that on the list? Great chase at the end but not enough. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

The remake takes the original and stands it on its head. Whereas Halicki gave us 75% car chase and 25% supporting drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25% car chase and 75% supporting drama. Cage as super man, saves his brother, kisses the girl. MTV edits, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halicki didn't live to see his baby (he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the '74' film) degraded in this manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in Sixty Seconds is the first time where I felt producerJerry Bruckheimer really cheated his audience. I know thatBruckheimer may not make the most emotionally powerful ormeaningful films, but he has an incredible passion for it. Hedoes love making films, and he knows how to make a productionlook good. Armageddon is a beautiful film..it may not be thebest film in terms of emotions, but it looks simply beautiful.That being said, I am throughly dissapointed in this film. was Iexpecting a first class character study? no, not at all. But I expected more then this.I don't know what happened.. but I can point out some problems. NUMBER 1:THE directing The director, Dominic Sena, last directed Kalifornia. The manhasn't directed a film in years, and it shows..the film isunfocused..many shots, especially the car scenes, seem like hewasn't sure what to do and many of his supposed high style shotslook more like poor edits. He never gets any true performancesor characterization out of his performers. I'd have given thisto Michael Bay..he could have at least created a film more sureof itself and its style. two:The screenplay. Much like the direction, the screenplay isunfocused and meandering. There are too many detours and toomany attempts at making a almost complicated plot. I know thissounds bad, but I wish they had dumbed it down..more car chasesand more excitement would have made a much more enjoyable[andbetter remembered] film..the screenplay tries for two much. three:the performances-This is what got me bad. I thinkBruckheimer has in the past made you care about his characters.In the Rock you cared. This film fails at that. Everyone,including the really fantastic Cage, never really creates acharacter. Cage himself never gives us someone to care about.He's more like a series of vibes then a real person. THis makessome of the scenes with his brother Giovanni Rabisi feel reallyforced and unnatural. Delroy Lindo and Robert Duval are terriblywasted, as is Vinnie Jones. The climax is also forced. I don'tthink that we spent enough time with the villian to care abouthim..I would like to say that this was a good effort, but itfeels more like a rushed and tacked on film that has no realplace. It truly feels lazy. I think that Bruckheimer was toobusy nuturing his next film, Remember the Titans[which is farmore passionate, and much better], to really give this one athought. It's no longer a challenge for him, but that doesn'tmean he should</fullReview>

Gone In 60 Seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The movie is in no way predictable. So the ending should be a suprise.

		<shortDescription>First Bruckheimer film I really enjoyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with a friend. He wanted to see it, I wouldn't have picked it but okay sometimes you have to compromise... I was pleasantly surprised. It was a perfect little movie for a night out with a beer afterwards in a bar. Story was threadbare and astonishingly simple but that didn't hurt. Eccleston, Duvall and Jolie pretty much wasted and Cage clearly running on autopilot. So why do I think this is the most enjoyable Bruckheimer film to date? Well, because of this:* no pretences what so ever. It was clearly made as a FUN popcornish movie * good pacing. Although there is not much action (for an action movie) Senna let it run fluently. * terrific look. Although Senna plays second fiddle to Bruckheimers bombastic formula ingredients he made it look damn good. Those cars.... * the cars itself. I am not a car freak but I enjoyed the looks and especially the sound of the cars...RRRoarrrrrrrr... * and most of all (and nobody mentioned this before) the lack of dying, killing, shooting, murdering or any kind of deadly violence! ok, some explosions and punches, but that's it. Only one guy buys it and it is no surprise who that is. I really, REALLY appreciated that in this movie.So, bring your twelve year old son (or daughter), nephew, or brother...he will loved it and you will have a great time too.The only real crime in this movie is the 20 million dollars Cage gets for just looking cool, act like a stiff, kiss with Jolie and driving around in a 1966 Ford Mustang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this film, yes, I know it was fairly far fetched, there is no way that Shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all it's traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the Brit Bad Guy, he was a little "too" much don't you think? Anyway, great film, great cars and great acting. I for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This good action movie was made by a motor sports fan for fellow motor sports aficionados. However it has a certain feeling of a déja-vu. The plot, as expected, is full of clichés, but who cares since the most important aspect of such movies is the action. The action here is mainly about car chase scenes and the accompanying stunts which are a compilation of all the car chase scenes you saw in every movie and TV series altogether.The actors are convincing in their roles with remarkable performances by Nicolas Cage and Robert Duvall. Having said that, I still wonder what is the reason behind having the character played by Angelina Jolie. You can remove the scenes where she appears without affecting the movie in anything, and you might even get a tighter and stronger plot. I believe that the producers created the character to add a feminine touch to an otherwise all-macho movie and thus give Angelina Jolie a chance to exhibit her silicone-enhanced lips. The same applies to the character played by Robert Duvall: his only contribution to the grand theft consists of jotting some lines on a chalkboard!A point in favor of the movie: the brief fight scenes prevent the viewer from getting distracted and help him concentrate on the main course of action.One last question: if it takes 60 seconds to steal a car, then stealing 50 cars would take 50 minutes, what the heck were those guys doing all night long then??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in 60 seconds contains some of the world's best cars. Gone in 60 seconds is directed by Jerry Bruckheimer who made such explosion-fests like con-air and the rock. So I put two and two together and figured this movie would give me the chance to see some of the greatest car chases since the Blues Brothers, with the added bonus being the cars would all cost over 20 grand. How wrong I was.I was hoping to see a Porsche being hit by a truck, or maybe a Ferrari being rolled about 10 times then bursting into flames, I'd probably even settle for a Merc to crash head on with a BMW with expensive, metal-crunching results. No such luck. Gone in 60 is a boring Bruckheimer flick (I didn't know there was such a thing, until now) which is permanent build-up and no pay-off.The budget looks like it was spent on renting all those beautiful cars, not on packing them with explosives as it should have been. I thought it was pretty weird to have cast Vinny Jones in this film, as his part as the guy who can't speak was lame and unfunny.This film belongs under the boring family drama section as it is an insult to call this an "ACTION MOVIE".</fullReview>

A bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and LOT´s of car, with a great chase near the end. The jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible, so the movie ain´t as bad as people are painting it. It has some quality, and I liked to watch it. In fact, I loved the film. And I didn´t need to turn off my brains to watch it.

		<shortDescription>Fast cars, family loyalty but just not enough speed and action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why are you so depressed?" my girlfriend sometimes asks me. I look at her vacantly and return my gaze to the poster where lies the thing my heart yearns for. She is slender, aesthetically perfect in every sense, powerful, sexy, and yet, even in her silence she roars across the asphalt of my imagination. She, much to the amusement of my girlfriend, is a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500, and I, like many other adoring fans around this globe would like to do the things "the Cage" does to this car in the movie. I want one, I do not have one, and therefore my life is incomplete.The plot, unsurprisingly is simple. A car thief (Nicholas Cage) who previously was forced into retirement for reasons which won't be disclosed here, is persuaded to get involved in one last all or nothing car heist. In the process of planning this heist, he comes across a London gangland boss, his lost love (a real girl not the car), the ever lasting loyalty of his colleagues, and finally his relationship to his brother, which has been under considerable strain since his absence. The film is saved by Cage's usual likeable charisma. His character is a self effacing good-guy-thief, who, as usual in these films, is able to turn to his nasty side for help when a family member / car body part / girlfriend is being threatened, and does so with as much wit as he does violence and driving skills.Trademark Bruckheimer signs everywhere - noise, great soundtrack, adrenaline pumping sounds of extremely powerful engines and of course the pre-requisite sizzler accessory - Angelina Jolie. The movie itself is not as much of a mess as I expected, except for the sometimes over sentimentality of Cages' relationship to both his family and his ex-partners in crime. And here lies the crux of the movie. It seems to be about doing what you shouldn't; about wanting things you can't have; about getting involved with things you know you really shouldn't; and yet, despite all the warning signs it's absolutely inevitable.Cage's involvement in the crime is justified by his need to save a life, but one is able just for a moment to glean the sheer primal and base satisfaction that is derived from punching the pedal and escaping the everyday confines of life, towards a better place, even if it's only for a moment of pure, unadulterated pleasure. It is in part a film about human nature and the sheer power of desire that drives our every move.But someone should have remembered it should also have been a film about cars, sex, and bad guys, all of which there simply wasn't enough. There is a great car chase at the end of the film with Cage driving the now legendary Mustang, but somehow there should have been more of this.Buckle up, leave your mind behind and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

The first film was on the same level acting-wise as my college drama dept.This remake is just that: a remake. The acting is SUPPOSED to be silly. It is meant to be like the original. Do you think it's easy for Nic Cage or Robert Duval to be Bad Actors?? Me neither. Watching the first film should be a pre-requsite.

		<shortDescription>Unexciting plot, predictable, supercars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the reviews of this film I was expecting something rather disappointing, along the lines of no plot and cars 'burning' around, thus turning it into nothing something resembling a race more than a film.To start with, I was quite impressed with the opening sequence of the film, whilst it used no fancy effects to set the mood for the rest of the film, the opening shots of super cars, coupled with the music, soon grabbed my attention.The plot, though simple and clearly obvious that not a lot of thought had been put into it, carried the film quite well. (Though I am not going to go into depth in relation to the storyline, as you can read about this on other web sites and cinematic review sites if you wish, though there isn't really a lot of it!). Overall I would basically say this about the plot, if you were looking for film that requires little brainpower to follow, and at the end of a long day your brain can't cope with films such as the likes of total recall, then go and see this.The plot basically revolves around Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage), who has to get his brother out of a serious mess (and that is an understatement!), by stealing 50 cars in 72 hours to keep his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) alive, otherwise he will be killed by the most notorious car thief in the city (imaginative plot isn't it!?).Throughout the film, the cars used are very impressive and will keep even the most amateur of car enthusiasts entertained. Though, this in the end is what let's the film down, as I explained at the beginning, it is not as bad as a lot of the previous reviews suggest, but how can you carry a film on the use of showing super cars flying around the street, in scenes that resemble something similar to that from the Dukes of Hazard! As you may have guessed, it can't really be done... I usually measure a films ability to keep myself interested by how long I spend thinking about other things whilst watching it. A good film should make you feel part of the action, and only at the end realise that you are sitting in a cinema seat. I am disappointed to say that during this film I spent about 15 minutes thinking about what I needed to do when I got home, and that is what made me realise that the plot, though it suited the film well, maybe should have involved a twist or two to keep the audience on their toes so to speak.The ending to the film (and obviously I will not tell you that here!)is also pretty pathetic. I think that you can guess the scenario, good vs bad, I think that you know the ending already ;-)...And as for Vinnie Jones (Sphinx), I am lost for words, go and see it and find out for yourself.....DV</fullReview>

Clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it. Fanboys expecting an Armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. This is one for the more intelligent action fans. It didn't even bother me Jolie appeared so little.</fullReview>

The old guys prefer doing it fast and smooth, while the young ones do it harshly and a bit strong.Also involves in car chase, when the recent people chooses to race through the city using only speed and power, while the old ones doing it with style and brains...The car chase scenes are outstanding and yet still innovative, even with the possible boring and stupid jumping scene, still bring good grips to the audience.So, buckle up, forget about how Nic Cage appearance in Moonstruck or Leaving Las Vegas, he's more to Con Air and the Rock here. Forget how Robert Duvall plays in Apocalypse Now or Falling Down, even Angelina Jolie's act in the Bone Collector.These guys are here to entertain and decorate the good actions and cool cars.

		<shortDescription>Average car-chase action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood seems to have a thing about crime paying, it glamourizes it in every other film and over glamourizes its "heroes" or "anti-heroes" to suit Hollywood's tired and over-used style over substance and Gone in Sixty Seconds is no different.The plot revolves around Nick Cage's little brother taking a "boost" to steal 50 cars within a number of days - only he fails and his brother (Nick Cage) is forced into coming out of retirement and getting some of his old car stealing buddies to help him steal the cars in three days.At this point you kinda stop and think that car stealing buddies wouldn't do this just to save some kid - it'd be for the money, but the director keeps ramming down your throat that honor among theives exists....so much so they actually want to save Cage's brother from a life of crime.Anyway, the film moves at a snail's pace - trying to do something useful with the time it has - trying to import non-existant plot and script to places or locales that don't need them.The actors in the film are under-used. There were so many actors the director never seemed to use them, they just seemed to be along for the ride. Actors like Vinnie Jones or Robert Duvall aren't used as well as they could have been. Sure they are meancing, but their bark is as loud as their bite.By the time the action hits your screen you forget the plot and sit back, switch off your mind and watch the action. As each car is stolen, the action and tension is built up. In fact its the action, not the story or the script which keeps you wanting to watch the film.Finally Cage steals his last car and has to evade the police as they chase him along the streets and finally into a river type racing track.It is here where the pure adreline rush direction hits you, the direction is crisp yet doesn't show the full speed or the entire action at its zenith - instead it shows pieces of the action, trying to make you want to sit up and take notice of every piece of direction the director throws at you.Overall this film is pretty average. The car chases, and indeed the jumps and action is nothing to write home about - the direction while crisp and enjoyable doesn't do anything new or try to concetrate on the action, instead it tries to inject too much tension.So what do I think, should you go and watch this film? Yeah sure, watch the film, but don't expect anything as good as other car chase action movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the hell is Angelina????? And why the hell did I watch this??????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSWell, well. So here we are all over again- in the demented field of action flicks with nothing similar to a brain. The new bud to stay with them is "Gone in 60 Seconds", a brainless, shallow, idiotic, annoying flick, produced by (guess who?) a man named Jerry Bruckenheimer (I won't even worry if I'm writing this damn name right). I don't expect depth or brilliant character development of an action flick. Let's give this work to a genius as Paul Thomas Anderson. But I can expect at least some fun, with interesting situations and thrilling moments. That's why I liked "X-Men" so much and I kind of enjoyed films like "Deep Blue Sea" or "Face/Off". But "Gone in 60 Seconds" is not like them, just because IT'S NOT FUN! Believe me- the car chase sequence in "Go" was much, much better than any action sequence here. It's tiring, repetitive, even monotonous at times. What do you think of passing two hours watching dumbs stealing cars and stealing cars and... stealing cars. Cars, cars, cars. I despise them, so you can guess how much I despised "Gone in 60 Seconds". And... could someone tell me why did they sell this as a movie starred by Angelina Jolie, but she is on the screen for... what? 20 minutes???? The answer is easy, but first let's talk about the movie itself.I wonder how and why someone gives a 10 to a film like this on the IMDb. I gave it a 3 and I think I'm being the kindest person in the world for that. But before you give high marks to this c**p, think a little about it. Have you already seen situations like those anywhere? I bet you have seen 1000 times over. The good guy was a bad guy in the past, but now he is honest. However, in a blink of eyes, he is mean again just to save his stupid brother. He meets the love of his life again and they have some trouble. The police is trying to catch him, but never does that. Is it possible that the US policeman are so demented? Why aren't they dismissed? And there's the villain, simply a caricature. Compared to him, the Joker from "Batman" would look like a character from an art-house European film. There is the climax, obviously on a dark place full of machines and big pipes. The villain dies, falling from a very high place, but not before the hero almost falls from the same place. Of course the police guys forgive the hero, because they are very kind people and they don't want to hurt the feelings of a car robber who gives girls names to the cars. Yawn! If you liked the story, then you'll love "Gone in 60 Seconds". But if you didn't, just stay away.The story is a lame and the plot holes are not very tolerable. Do you remember of a scene in "Speed" when the bus jumps the space between two bridges? Here Nicolas Cage does the same thing with his car, jumping above many, I mean many cars, buses, trucks etc. And the situation stays like this. But will surely be the most inverossimible movie scene of the year. Talking about Nicolas Cage, he stays with Mira Sorvino and Marisa Tomei among the people who forgot that they have an Oscar at home. After the brilliant "Leaving Las Vegas", he became a star of action flicks, just stopping to do something forgettable as "City of Angels". Oh, and he also became a mediocre actor. Giovanni Ribisi is terrible and the villain, Christopher Eccleston, just screams for a Razzie Award. He annoyed me! And what is Robert Duvall doing here? Oh! And don't think I forgot Angelina. She is a sub-supporting actress and is the second name to show up on the screen. These guys are smart, I just say that. I bet her photo was put on the poster after the Oscar for "Girl, Interrupted". I just hope she doesn't join Cage's team."Gone in 60 Seconds" is a very bad movie and there are almost no qualities. The cool soundtrack is one of them, but it doesn't help, of course. This is a clear proof of how the American cinema is degradating. I hated this movie!3 out of 10 = REALLY SUCKS</fullReview>

I know this movie did it's best to follow in the tradition of the 1974 Gone in 60 Seconds by using a Mustang, but, in actuality, the 1971 Plymouth Hemi-Cuda that he stole with Angelina Jolie is worth a lot more than the Mustang Shelby he drove in the final chase seen.Also, the 71' Hemi-Cuda is faster than the Mustang Shelby and much, much more rare. I also saw on their stolen list, a 1967 Corvette Stingray 427, which is also faster and worth just as much if not more than the Shelby. I'm a car buff, so I pay attention to these things.In final, I wished the Hemi-Cuda was used in the final chase scene but I can see how the producers did not want to follow in the footsteps of Nash Bridges or Corvette Summer.Great movie regardless. I highly recommend it. Especially if you like cars, muscle cars. No room for souped up Toyota's or Honda's with rediculous tails painted light blue, purple, etc. Those cars are a joke next to the machines in this movie.</fullReview>

There was really only one chase, at the end, and that was nothing special, i have seen better car chases on TV movies.and that final stunt, which was so obviously CGI, reminded me of that scene in grease where the car starts flying... (Everyone in the cinema laughed, which is not really the reaction that you want for a film's big finale)the odd thing is, now i think back on it, i can't think what actually WAS in the film. Nic cage must have had about 100 lines, but none of the other actors could have had more than 50 each. and with the lack of action, i can't think what they filled the time with.still, it has made me do two things: 1) worry about whether Mad Max 4 will use CGI, which seems to completly ruin car chases. 2) want to find the original to see what the film should have been like with a 45 minute (real) car chase in it.finally, i have to say that that Vinnie Jones was by far the best actor in the film.

		<shortDescription>Movie Excitement Gone in 120 Seconds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the only exciting scene in the movie was the first one. I got pumped up and ready to watch a movie full of fast-paced and dare-devil car chases. Instead, all I saw was a boring movie full of childish dialogue, cheesy cliches, and a mediocre final chase. For a movie that had such a contrived plot, too much time was spent setting that wanna-be plot up. For literally the first 80 minutes, you know exactly what's going to happen and you have to painfully watch Cage's character round up a bunch of helpers. The ultra-lame lines that Cage's and Jolie's characters utter as well as the idiotic looks the people in the movie give each other really brings a big-name movie like this quite a bit of shame.Additionally, if I'm going to watch a movie about car thiefs, I'd at least like to see half of the cars stolen driven away fast. Only the Porsche at the beginning and the Mustang at the end were the only stolen cars that were burning any rubber (although the FBI Bimmer was quite nice). The Ferraris and the Diablo, for example, just puttered out of their showrooms or driveways. I guess it would just get too expensive to crash all those nice cars.The last chase scene, which is what the movie really builds up to, is alright. The camera views did not catch the action properly. If you want to see a movie with a good action and the best car chase scene ever, watch Ronin.I give the movie 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did expect an action movie,however this flick is severely lacking in any quality,it's just another "Blockbuster" trying to attract those who are easily wooed by so many multi-million pound charades.This film has every corny ingredient necessary,and must really appeal to those aged between 8-13.Anyone older than this who actually enjoys this film should realise they have no taste and must be lacking intelligence also!As well as all that why is Nicolas Cage such a revered actor,he has such a corny rehearsed way of speaking on camera and really takes away more than he actually adds to films.I expect his uncle Francis Ford Coppola was his introductory flame and the only reason for his aquisition of any respect,but i don't think they get on at all,oh i don't know,but i do know i hate Nicolas Cage and good films these days are hard to come by!Comon everybody.From me this film gets 1.5 out of 10,purely for the cars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in Sixty Seconds is a film which it is very easy to watch. We are treated to a series of scenes as various young and older car thieves discuss and plan how to complete their task of stealing fifty cars in one night, but all this is really just a build up to a selection of great car chases. The plot is purely there to keep us watching until the car chases begin. Also I found myself sympathising with both the car thieves and the police trying to catch them. This is the major problem for a film which has car theives as the main characters, we have to like them. But we also know that stealing cars is wrong so we want the police to be successful as well. This becomes very confusing and the viewer is left without clearly having an opinion about the characters. Don't get me wrong though, I really enjoyed the film. However this was not because of any deep meaning underlying what was going on, or because of a witty and involving script. It was purely on the basis of it's action sequences and if you want a film that is uncomplicated and fun to watch then I highly advise you to see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in Sixty Seconds was everything I imagined it to be. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was an exciting, intriguing, fun action movie that kept me entertained for an hour an a bit. Yet, there are faults, the script was a bit dodgy at parts, and Angelina Jolie could of been used more, but the performances from Giovanni Ribisi and many other leading roles were excellent. Jerry Bruckheimer has once again given us a hip and cool action movie that any fun-loving movie-goer can enjoy.Rating: 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nic plays Randall "Memphis" Raines a retired car theft who has gone straight for over 6 years. His young brother Kip who still jacks cars, screws up a deal to steal cars for a big crime boss that is supposed to go to a Columbian client. Now the big boss tells Memphis to jack 50 cars in 72 hours for the Columbian client, or else his brother is toast.This is a total formula movie that is predictable from beginning to end. The first 20-30 minutes is actually pretty boring cause the characters are so one dimensional and just plod through the same setup (I will kill your brother, you have 3 days, blah blah..). As we start to see the players they seem to be in the typical rehashed plot. The actors are all good they just have nothing to work with.However, once the plan starts to come together and is told in the movie, finally the characters and film starts to take shape. We start seeing more of the actors work out their roles better. Cage goes into a high dealership posing as a snobish buyer to get information, in what is probably the best scene in the entire movie, as he high toats himself saying everything is not worthy to his tastes to everyone in the showroom.As the criminals are on their stake outs, they start putting more of the 'car' nuts aspect into the film. While they are waiting in the darkness they quiz each other over radio with questions like, 'What is the license plate of Magnum PI's car?" and so on.Another colleague boosts a car from a parking lot, and while driving out of the parkade a car jacker runs up to the car telling him to fork it over. Quickly the experienced car stealer de-arms the car-jacker and then lectures him that he doesn't know how to steal a car quoting 'Stupid Amateur' while kicking him down.There is also Vinnie Johnson in the second film of his I have seen, as 'Sphinx' who doesn't speak. While Memphis is rounding up his cronies he phones 'Sphinx' and we first are introduced to him at his works where else.... in a morgue. Sphinx's colleagues then of course say to each other 'How is he suppose to answer the phone?'.Problem is Sphinx is a good character but they do not use Vinnie Johnson right. His talent as a goon/threatning lugnut is wasted in this film. Then after giving him no lines in the film, they decide to let him say one line at the end of the film. What was the point of that! They totally messed his role up. When he says the line it totally destroys his character because he doesn't even seem like the same person in the movie. What a waste...Sure there is the obligatory car chase which is cool except how it ended.Even with all these problems I still didn't mind the movie that much it was just standard fair, and lightly entertaining at best.Rating 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) is a retired car thief. After his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) blows a big job for top villain The Carpenter the older Raines is forced out of retirement to save his brothers life. The cost? He has 72 hours to steal 50 top range cars.Dominic Sena pilots this basic plot making his intentions clear from the outset with a dazzling high speed chase. Once Memphis is on the scene he has to assemble a crew to help boost the 50 cars on his shopping list on a one night marathon. The supporting actors are good, seeming to vault effortlessly around the poorer parts of Scott Rosenberg's screenplay. Robert Duval deserves a special mention as Otto, Memphis's mentor and teacher. Delroy Lindo is good as the nemesis in the police Detective Castlebeck. Angelina Jolie as Sway, the love interest, has only a minor impact on the proceedings. The real stars of this film are the cars.The actors uniformly do a good job with the thin script.The action, especially the final chase, are breath taking, although the actors get mired in the slightly sickly sweet 'brotherly love' theme. With no real twists or complex plotting this is a movie you can just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the famous actors?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this was one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. First of all, it got your adrenaline up, which to me is important. Second of all, it depicts American love for cars and life style in a very accurate way. The way Cage talks and names cars and begs them to be good to him, all that is very specific to this country's culture and if you've ever been to Los Angeles, it makes even more sense. The movie points out that a car is more important then money, then women, then sex and though, not many will agree that it's a positive description, it is true of many people's feeling about it. Now, the question I have, is why did they stick this movie will all these famous people. Robert Duvall, Angelina Jolie, Nicolas Cage were all in there, while just putting in Cage would of been sufficient for attracting people. Jolie was barely on the screen and considering her last performance in Girl, Interrupted, you would think she would get more air time. Perhaps her role would of been good to give to some new actress seeking publicity because it would of made her career, but for Jolie, it seemed to have been a waste of time. Also, I can't really say that any of the acting was superb, which was surprising considering the excellent cast that the producer had to work with. Overall, I thought the movie was very good. The action, the cars, etc. Just be careful when driving after the show, make sure not to pull any of Cage's stunts from the movie. They probably should of had a warning while rolling credits, "Do Not Try This At Home".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In recent years, or at least the recent year, I've become attuned to such issues as sexuality in movies and such things that only come from studying film in a college environment. So little things tend to leap out at me when watching even movies intended for consumption with popcorn, such as this one, Jerry Bruckheimer's (producer of The Rock, Con Air) latest MTV-edit action offering. The issue here that struck me was that the one female character in the movie - Angelina Jolie's 'Sway' - was barely onscreen for the film's duration. Here we have a major star (she stands on the poster with Nic Cage, only a little smaller than he), a major actress (a recent Oscar winner), a beautiful woman (watch 'Gia') ... but she's almost literally pushed off the screen by actors like Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, Giovanni Ribisi, not to mention of course, Nic Cage. Considering the screenwriter in question is Scott Rosenberg, who wrote the incredible female-character-oriented screenplay, 'Beautiful Girls', the blame for this blatant sexism can only fall to the obvious culprit, Mr. Bruckheimer, who is known for his testorone-fuelled blockbusters from Top Gun through Crimson Tide up to Armageddon and finally this (not to mention the forthcoming Pearl Harbor - in which I cannot imagine many strong female roles will appear).That aside, the movie is fine. I've always liked Bruckheimer's movies, and I liked the director, Domenic Sena's, last movie 'Kalifornia' ... however, the formula becomes tired. A quick comparison to 'Armageddon' is easy - the gathering of 'the old guys' who have been scattered across America, the family bond (here brother to brother, there father to daughter), the all-too familiar score style, the flashy and often inane use of editing. It's easy to slip into liking, but easy to slip out to hating. So torn between a positive and negative opinion, I'm going to just sit on the fence because hey, this movie stars Nic Cage and Angelina Jolie and if you like these actors as much as I do, then you're going to go and see it. So go see it. It's worth it.My opinion: it's Bruckheimer, go figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of GiSS (Gone in Sixty Seconds) i was overwhelmed, not since Cannonball Fever (aka. Speedzone) has there been a movie with lots of high speed carchases throughout it. Since I am a big car enthusiast I really looked forword to watching this movie, and finally the day came. A friend and I went to the biggest screen in Sweden just to watch GiSS, and man was I dissapointed, the first fourthy minutes nothing really happened except the scene when the Porsche is being stolen. Later on the only thing you saw was Cage, Jolie etc. walking up to different cars stealing them, there was really only 2 "real" carchases throughout the almost 2 hour long movie, the one mentioned above and the Shelby GT500 chase. I almost laughted when they said "He will take that last, because he's afraid of it", i felt the same the moment the GT500 stopped and he pleaded for the car to start, and of course the scene when it suddenly became a 747 with Cage as pilot flying 30, maybe 40 metres throughout the air and when hitting ground it seemed intact!Anyway, if you go to see Gone in Sixty Seconds for the cars, save your money for something else, if you aren't you may find some parts good, but the acting isn't up to normal Cage standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's to brotherly love - Bruckheimer style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's surprising that GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS hasn't been remade until now. In the original, the affectionately known star Elenor jumps over not twenty, not ten cars, but one car. To compensate for the slim budget, the shot is repeated about fifteen times, in slow-motion, in close-up, from different angles. Considering BULLITT was made the previous decade, the 45-minute car-chase was not the most exhilarating sequence ever shot.Perhaps the problem was the fact that the films heroes are no-good criminal punks. But, modern Hollywood logic has a way around every problem. The good guys are good to their mothers, and the bad guys are British.Brits make great villains. Thesps like Rickman, Irons and Branagh sneer their way - in vain - towards defeating holier-than-thou yankee heroes. The good guys get the witty lines, the bad guys die a painful death, and it's been that way since the dawn of time.Now comes GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, and it's Christopher Eccleston's turn to ham it up. The difference here is that the dialogue does not discriminate. This is equal opportunity embarrassment: three Oscar winners and a talented supporting cast looking foolish as anything.Delroy Lindo gets the lions share of the clangers (`I should arrest you?but I understand brotherly love', `I know him?he fears that car'), and compared to his idiot cop partner, he's the brains of the force. Angelina Jolie is a typically slight romantic interest. Eccleston is supposed to be a villain fearsome beyond comprehension. This is off-set by his bizarre wood-fetish, and an assessment of baseball (`it's so bloody boring') that would make the worlds worst stand-up comic cringe. Robert Duvall, the finest actor in the film, is reduced to putting lines through stolen cars on a blackboard - that's it.Now I realise that the characters are hardly a fundamental concern in a Bruckheimer picture. But from a critical perspective, it's hardly worthwhile reviewing any aspect of them. The action set-pieces are as spectacular as always. While the big car chase is only half as long as the set-piece in the original film, it is a definite crowd-pleaser. While there's a strangely long time between thrills, the tempo never drops. Writer Scott Rosenberg can take credit for this. His script is so insubstantial and cliched it never lingers on any plot detail long enough to become a pressing concern.Perhaps it was intentional the dialogue is so bad. Perhaps it's a joke at the expense of the stars track records (except for Cage, not averse to setting his sights so low). Either way, the embarrassment factor yields ten times as many jokes as AMERICAN PIE did. And while most people would no doubt - given such a credible cast - have made a more substantial sum of its parts - GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS is a passable action blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one thing Gone in 60 seconds delivers, is utter disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, finally a movie dedicated to the thrills of high-speed getaways in fine automobiles. Or at least, that was my initial thoughts when I first heard about Gone in 60 seconds. This one I just couldn't miss. So I watched the movie. And came out literally shocked.What did I get? One and a half wasted hours of complete boredom, followed by 15 minutes of blurry camera shots of something that I believe was Nicholas Cage in a Shelby GT500. 15 minutes which translated into an amazingly predictable and lame attempt of a thrilling car-chase. And that was it. Thank you for watching Gone in 60 seconds. Have a pleasant evening.Obviously, the producers have never even heard of a movie titled "Ronin". Well, maybe it wouldn't have made a difference if they had. I mean, how can you properly direct car-chases, when there are hardly any in the script?The lack of car-chases and the insufficient quality of the one included aside, the pace is shockingly slow, the lack of action is severe, the ending is pathetic, the attempts of humour are so cheesy they're painful to watch, the characters are hardly memorable and the acting is strictly mediocre at it's best (though Nicolas Cage does of course throw in a decent performance).*** Slight spoiler ahead ***However, the producers were successful in their efforts to add extra-terrestrial elements to the movie by including a UFO. The UFO, which was visually identical to the Shelby GT500 mentioned above, took of from a ramp and then spent some 30 metres in mid-air before it returned to the ground with a thud and accelerated away, seemingly undamaged. Indeed a stunning demonstration of alien technology. Great work.Disappointment, ladies and gentlemen, disappointment awaits you after having suffered the approximately 2 hours it takes to watch Gone in 60 seconds.</fullReview>

It seems like most movies these days are either Oscar ready dramas or they are simply one explosion that lasts for 2 hours without the benefit of a plot. "Gone" was neither and both. No it won't win Best Picture. No none of the actors gave a stellar performance. But Nicolas Cage was typically monotone and cool, Angelina Jolie was typically hot(in a knappy, grease monkey way), and the cars and excitement were non-stop.Having read the original shooting script, I saw the film as lacking a few parts. Without having read the script, none of my friends thought anything was missing. The flow of the story and interaction of characters were fresh. It wasn't a complicated plot(steal my cars or die) so you could spend all your energy simply enjoying. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice visuals, yet probably took "60 Seconds" to create the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gone in 60 Seconds" is nothing less than what we've come to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer film by now: blaring music, jerky cinematography, plus Nicolas Cage playing another hero with a nutty name; here he's Randall "Memphis" Raines (is he a Johnny Rivers fan or something?), in the tradition of Stanley Goodspeed ("The Rock") and Cameron Dye ("Con Air").Raines is an ex-car thief who is soon roused out of retirement upon learning he must boost 50 cars in a small period of time, or his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) will die at the hands of villain Raymond Calitri's (Christopher Eccleston) hired thugs. So, Raines enlists some of his thieving buddies (Chi McBride, Vinnie Jones and Scott Caan, among others) to boost the 50 cars, which all happen to have female names (as in a '67 Shelby named "Eleanor"), all while Raines is continuously hounded by a wizened police detective (Delroy Lindo). The filmmakers probably devised this story in the same amount of time it took you to read this.Being an action junkie, this film lived up to, but didn't surpass, my expectations. One of my favorite scenes was in the beginning when car thieves are trying to escape from the police, which was nicely enhanced by Crystal Method music and flying camera work by Paul Cameron.Now to the negatives. To say Robert Duvall was wasted here would be an understatement. The only thing notable about Angelina Jolie's role was her hair, which resembled a macrame plant holder. It's obvious that she received such high billing for such little screen time due to her Oscar win for "Girl, Interrupted." The insipid "romance" with her and Cage was a big waste of celluloid and only served to gum up the plot. One big groan factor was seeing Master P (who seemingly can't have rappers defecting from his record label fast enough) in a bland role as - gasp - a gun-toting thug. I didn't even know it was him till I saw the end credits - praise the Lord. Ribisi is barely believable as Cage's brother, and Eccleston's villain is hard to take seriously. What really blew me away was when Memphis gets socked with a set of brass knuckles and all he winds up with is a small dot of blood on his lower lip. Give me a break. We all know what would happen if we were hit with one of those things in real life.The first hour drags horribly, and doesn't pick up until the actual theft spree begins, but even that relies more on cheap laughs (most notably McBride yelling into a cell phone, "My wife's having a baby!" which was pretty funny) rather than thrills. I couldn't believe that there was only one car chase in the entire film, near the end. At one point I was wondering: who deserved top billing, the actors or the cars?But what stuck out the most was the essence of the plot, about car thieves trying to boost 50 vehicles in 24 hours. Now, I can suspend my disbelief as well as the next person, but I personally had a hard time rooting for the "good guys" - Cage and his band of Merry Men - due to the fact that they were just that, car thieves, no matter what their cause was. It wouldn't have mattered if they were stealing these cars to save Mother Teresa; this film most of the time resembled an auto theft "How To" video.Still, many parts of this movie were fun to watch and managed to hold my attention, including the truck smashing through a wall during the end chase sequence."Gone in 60 Seconds" is a mildly entertaining flick with some flaws, which we've come to expect from a Bruckheimer work by now. Like its automotive counterparts, it starts slow out of the gate and makes multiple pit stops before finally picking up full speed. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's with all the bad reviews? That was the best movie I had seen all summer. It had action, beautiful cars, my favorite actor Nicolas Cage, and an all around fun environment. Who cares if the plot sucked? If you have a fun movie, its good. I was confused why the world would blow up if the angels went back into heaven in "Dogma" but I loved that movie as much as this one. This was my favorite Nicolas Cage movie since "Face/Off". If you haven't seen it, go now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unfortunate Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how you can take a film about exotic cars and muscle cars and screw it up, but this one did.I rented the original a few months ago and have been anxiously awaiting this remake, but it falls short of the original. The most frustrating thing about this movie is that the director/producers had access to some incredible cars, Porsches, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, but we only see these cars driving out of a garage or backing out of a driveway. What a waste!Exhibit 1: Angelina Jolie gets out of an incredible looking car and says something to the effect that "it just took me for a ride." Thanks for the teaser. It would have been nice to have at least seen the car break the speed limit.Exhibit 2: Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie have a quiet moment while they wait to steal a Diablo, but all we get to see is the car back out of the driveway!!!I keep waiting for a movie to bring back the excitement and chase of Bullit. This one is not it. 5/10, and only because the Shelby was a fine looking car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie was really good. The car chase was cool, and I liked all of the cars in it. The cars pretty much made the movie. I read in a review somewhere that it didn't compare anything to the original movie. But, I don't ever think that you should judge the remake by the original. If you really liked the original, you're probably, under hardly any circumstances going to like the remake. That's probably why this movie did not stay in the theaters too long. I don't really think that this is a remake, it's the story retold through another person, a different director. And, in that aspect of it, I think it's a great movie.

Okay, maybe the cars are nice and the guys like admiring Angelina Jolie but this movie is definitely not a movie to be watched if you want to have a lot of fun at the movies. The vague character development and corny plot wreck it for people. Nicolas and Angelina are constantly discussing their past relationship numerous amounts of times during the movie and before this, the viewer does not even know what happened between them to make them break up. So you're a car fan, huh? You might see something about this crap that others don't if you just watched it to admire the fancy cars like most people do because the actual movie doesn't appeal much to most people. This movie will make you be gone from the theater in sixty seconds!</fullReview>

But you still couldn't beat the all out action of the 40-minute car chase in the original. The car chase in the "2000" film was short and very choppy, too bad because I thought in this day and age with the newer technology I was going to see the best car chase flick ever.

		<fullReview>Gone in Sixty Seconds, a remake of the 1974 (supposed) classic, is slick, technicaly proficient, and utterly souless, something one expects from a Jerry Bruckheimer production. Steal 50 cars in 48 hours? Interesting, but wholly implausable setup, and the payoff is weak. Nicolas Cage has proven he can be a great actor (Leaving Las Vegas, Bringing Out the Dead), so why does he continue to waste his superior talent on roles that could have just as easily been played by Stallone? The dialogue is forced and the chemistry between Cage and Angelina Jolie is a joke. On the positive side, the cinematography is nice, as is the premier car chase near the end of the film. But if you must see a Cage/Bruckheimer action film, go rent Con Air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will the "Real Eleanor" please roll up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who had a long "love affair" with an elusive Eleanor (the closest I got was a 1972 Grande with a Mach One 351 conversion, I've almost worn out my copy of the original film. I knew they were going to inevitably change some things here and there, but outside of being about guys stealing cars in California, little remained of one of my favorite films of all times.Don't get me wrong, there is good cinematography and what driving there is isn't half bad, but the whole quirky tale of the car thieves who only stuck it to the insurance companies and tried not to hurt anyone was missing. There were some plot leaps in the remake, which hopefully were sacrifices to the cutting room floor in the interests of keeping the film under two hours (and will be restored in the DVD version ..please...please...) but the story line was ok.I was shocked to see that my Eleanor was no longer one of "the last of the real Mustangs" but a silver 67 Shelby. I still don't understand why that was necessary. The original Eleanor actually got STARRING CREDIT for the movie! How many cars can boast actual first up credit and not an honorable mention tucked in the credits at the end (Cars by ........Motor Company.) The new Eleanor was nothing more than a stand-in. The original was pure gutsy driving, defying mechanics, aerodynamics, and probability. So what if the UCLA film school produced more polished pictures. This film had raw nerve and excitement. Toby Halicki produced three (well sorta three) films that set the Gold Standard for movie driving. Had he lived, he would probably be doing some amazing things with Eleanor's children and grandchildren.I sat anticipating THE CHASE (93 cars wrecked in 40 minutes....) with an A-list cast and director, I had hopes of at least an hour of awesome driving. My watch may be running slow, but the entire chase lasted less than the first "faux capture" in the original.Watch the movie as a fun summer flick, then forget it and rent the 1974 version, while you still can.</fullReview>

With Enemy of the State, Armageddon, The Rock, and Con Air, Bruckheimer can just make anything happen. He makes certain subjects look cool. He rebuffed NASA, NSA, FBI, and he even made transporting prisoners look cool too. Now he is moving on to a new subject: stealing cars. This movie is good and fun. It is the type of movie to where you can just shut your brain off for two hours and enjoy what cinema should be: clean, harmless fun. Nicolas Cage is one of the actors who is pretty good at that. He bounces back from his stupid movie Bringing Out the Dead gracefully. Angelina Jolie who is so dang fine isn't really in it as much as I thought she would be. Other than that enjoy this movie and forget what the critics say about this fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this version of "Gone in 60 Seconds" disappointing. I fully expected to see more and better car chase scenes than in the original that was released in 1974. While I have watched the previous version about 6 times, I always lost count of the number of autos smashed in that version. It had more chases although the plot development perhaps was less than this version. I felt that too much time was spent in character and plot development for this genre and title of the film. While the climatic chase scene had some interesting twists, it was not enough to push it above the 1974 version in my mind. I did expect more than I got considering how good the other movies ("The Rock" &amp; "Enemy of the State") were done by Bruckheimer. It wasn't a total waste of time, but I still wonder what purpose it served to have Angela Jolie in it. In short, would have preferred more wild car chases and less romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruckheimer's first "faux pas"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer's previous productions(Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon), I never left a theater disappointed by one of his films but I guess there is a first time for everything. "Gone" is long, boring for the first 90 minutes and then you wake up with a big car chase until the movie ends. There is your typical "cop " who wants the "bad guy" badly(Haven't we seen that concept a zillion times already ?.) Angelina Jolie's character is unfortunately as empty as the scenes she appears in. Once again, Giovanni Ribisi is cast as a "bad boy"(What a waste of talent) and Robert Duvall sounds like he is extending his role from "Days of Thunder". Let's hope that the reunion Bruckheimer-Michael Bay for the 2001 release of "Pearl harbor" will make us quickly forget this "faux pas".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie hoping to see the ultimate car chase. While I enjoyed the newer version I found it lacking in this area. I have seen the original 1974 version countless times. The original movie wrapped up with a car chase that lasted over forty minutes wrecking a enormous amount of cars. Their car budget alone was unheard of at that time. It is this fact that has raised the 1974 version to cult status. While I expected the story line to change due to the difference in todays world and that of 1974 I was hoping for an even greater ultimate car chase to finish this film out. I went to the theater hoping to see spectacular stunts and great special effects. The chase that did happen was decent but was far from what I was expecting. All in all this was a good film, but if your a fan of the original you will feel as if you were let down. For anyone who hasn't seen the original I strongly suggest you rent it. Many of the fantasic car crashes in it were first created for this movie.</fullReview>

I noticed very few factual errors during the movie... they did their homework, even down to the way the cars sound. Unfortunately, the acting was mediocre, and the chase scenes failed to display any particularly notable stunts (although it did prove Nicholas Cage capable of turning quickly at 20 miles per hour).End result, if you're into cars, you'll love it, otherwise I suspect you'll be bored to tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer films purport to be full of bombast, crunching violence and big shooters (see The Rock, Con Air), but in actual fact they are the most comforting pictures you could ever find. No surprises, an obligatory rogue hero (invariably Nicolas Cage) and comic-book violence that reeks of the A Team with knobs on. A couple of eight-year-olds in any playground across the world could have thought up this plot - which of course is always Bruckheimer's point. Master car thief Cage needs to steal fifty smart cars in the space of 24 hours to save his hapless brother from certain death at the hands of the statutory dastardly Brit (in this case Christopher Eccleston, doing a very poor job on the psycho front). So, he goes and enrols the services of some motley thieves, including Duvall (he is EXACLTLY how you'd imagine. Ever seen the execrable Days of Thunder?), Jolie (blonde, big lips, no discernible character) and Vinnie Jones. Yes, the Welsh midfield maestro who stole Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, steals the show here too. As a mute. No brain fare, which is always watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm into cars A LOT, so I liked the awesome intro to this movie and the neat car chase at the end. In the middle, though, there's a couple things about this movie I have to say....1. GOOD: Robert Duvall was put to pretty good use in this movie. 2. BAD: I don't if you guys noticed this, but I'm getting sick of Nicholas Cage's "pseudo-ebonics." Example:Here's an actual piece of dialogue from the movie:"What do ya do, pay the pit crew with Oreos and gummie bears?" "Bro, I folded. You know that." Why does Nicholas Cage have to talk that way? Couldn't he talk like a normal white guy and have just said, "Hey, remember, I don't steal cars anymore. You should know that." His psuedo-ebonics is so fake. He's been doing that ever since the second half of Face/Off. I had to watch "Gone in Sixty Seconds" twice just to weed out all of the white ebonics and translate it into normal-guy English. 3. BAD: Jolie's character, like the love scene she's in, never seems to go anywhere. 4. BAD: For a movie that makes it look like it was made by car nuts in the previews, they should have shown a lot more of the cars. 5. GOOD: The little black guy was funny. "Ghetto Smurf", he called once. Well, what can I say? This film just smacks of summer-movie dumbness; go ahead and watch it, just be aware of what I've told you and you'll be better prepared by not setting your expectations too high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I'll preface my comments by saying I am a HUGE fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. That being said, I was a little disappointed by this movie. Jerry held true to his genre and created some great action, especially with the car chase. The movie was also visually stunning if you were into cars.The story was ok. I have not seen the original, so I don't know how "true" to the story this version kept. Cage went back to the Stanley Goodspeed (The Rock) type of character which I really liked. Duvall was great as the mentor to Cage and the rest of the group. The ultimate disappointment was the lack of depth Jolie's character had in this movie. Her talent was flat out wasted! She was strictly in this movie for the female "perspective" and to draw her fans (like me!).Overall, it wasn't Bruckhiemer's best. He has done better and will do better (Pearl Harbor). Pure action. Pure entertainment. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This formula movie has it all--likable characters, humor, heart-stopping car chases, sensible plot, and fiery f/x. Even as a car thief, Nicolas Cage is cast perfectly. He's funny, charming, sexy, and fast as lightning. Though Angelina Jolie is listed as a star, her character is secondary to the film, and she doesn't have as much onscreen time as many drooling males might hope. But what little time she has, she exudes sexuality that lasts far longer than 60 seconds. As engaging as the film's characters are, it's the car thefts and chase scenes that steal this movie. Definitely worth full-price at the box office!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A golden opportunity missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear not, RCMP. Despite the provocative title, Gone In 60 Seconds is unlikely to inspire a rash of car thefts -- successful ones anyway.To the extent that they are capable of learning in the first place, wannabe criminals are not going to come away from this movie about `a crew of boosters' much the wiser as these car thieves rely more on gadgets than ingenuity to get their wheels.Afficiandos of `ultimate crime' movies will also be disappointed.A big-budget remake of the 1974 exploitation flick of the same name, Gone In 60 Seconds stars Nicolas Cage as Randall `Memphis' Raines, a reformed car thief who is forced out of retirement to pull one last job because his little brother, Kip, (Giovanni Ribisi) has got himself in a bind.To make a long story short, Memphis must steal 50 cars by a certain deadline or his brother will be killed. (The tag line is 50 cars in 24 hours, but in truth he has four days to get a crew together to pull the heist, and they don't really get around to the actual stealing until there's 12 hours left).This movie starts out strong enough, as a series of subplots come into play.Not only is Memphis facing a tight timeline but Detective Roland Castleback gets word that he is back in town. Dedicated policeman that he is, Castleback is determined to finally put one of Oakland's most notorious car thieves behind bars.Complicating matters further, there is a rival gang that is upset that they didn't get the contract to steal all those cars and earn the $200,000 that would have come with the job. If they can't get a piece of the action, they want a piece of Memphis.And one of Memphis's little helpers mistakenly steals a car from Chinatown that turns out to be loaded with drugs. Nothing like causing conflict with the Asian crime bosses to make things interesting.The drama couldn't get much better, what with so many breathing down Memphis's neck. How on earth is Memphis, as capable as he is, going to get himself and little brother Kip out of this one?Well, as it turns out, the rival gang members and the baddies from Chinatown are simply written out of the script. That's right. Instead of developing the story into what could have been a truly memorable finale, those behind this movie took the easy way out. The rival gang is easily disposed of with the help of a tow truck and a cable, while the Asians are just no-shows. Maybe they saw the evil of their ways and got out of the heroin business. We'll never know.After all the build up, the rest of this movie is a total disappointment.In the end, only the good detective bothers to show up for a car chase so uninspired that the run through Los Angeles aqueduct is the highlight. (Gee, like that's never been done before). And thanks to producer Jerry Bruckheimer's no-scene-last-longer-than-two-seconds rule, it's more confusing than thrilling.As far as Gone In 60 Seconds is concerned, the only real crime is that this movie was made in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expect to have fun, nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had fun, so for me the movie was a success. I was expecting to not have much of a plot, actually it probably had TOO much plot development. Nicolas Cage was great, as was Angelina Jolie, but who I thought really shone here was Delroy Lindo as the detective that was all over Cage's character. A couple of the car chase scenes were (ahem) a trifle unbelievable, but still, all in all, very fun. The only thing I can think to criticize with this movie was that I would've liked to see more of the tricky capabilities of these car theft 'artists' and more exterior shots in the car chase scenes. I thought the movie was actually very socially responsible as well, although you wouldn't expect it, or seek this movie out because of it. Several times during the movie we are reminded of the dire consequences of theft, yadda yadda. Don't go expecting it to be Hamlet, 'cause it doesn't even try to be Hamlet, and I don't think it should. But if you are expecting some speeding, sliding, roaring and crashing action, you will probably like it, like I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre, predictable, and a waste of talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer tends to be very hit and miss with his movies. Some of them are very entertaining, like The Rock and Crimson Tide. Some of them are, well, like Armageddon. Gone in Sixty Seconds tends to fall in the lower half of the spectrum. It's not a complete dud like that aforementioned Bruce Willis flick, but very mediocre. First off, there wasn't a single part of this movie that I couldn't call five minutes ahead of time. I mean, it just runs straight through, twist free. Who couldn't see that the last car he steals would be the one he has the history with? Secondly, there are a lot of great actors in this movie that aren't given much to do. Nic Cage shows none of his trademark quirkiness, Angelina Jolie is just some pretty window dressing, and Robert Duvall apparently doesn't do anything but cross car names off the chalkboard. Even Delroy Lindo, who's usually incredibly cool in everything, doesn't have much to do here. However, I will give the film credit for a really great chase scene featuring my favorite car of all time, the Shelby GT 500. That scene, and the really impressive cars throughout the movie, made me enjoy the film a lot more than I would have otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this movie is pretty bad. The really bad guys are all bad. The cops are made to be looked as bad. The noble car thieves are mad to look as martyrs. Nicholas Cage plays a former car thief (Memphis Raines) now reformed, whose brother has fallen into big trouble with a British crime lord. Memphis is commissioned to steal 50 cars in two days. The movie gets off incredibly slow with only one car chase. Raines then wastes almost all of his time plotting and scheming and wasting his time that should be spent stealing cars. There is then one, I repeat, only one exciting extended car chase when he actually is stealing the cars, and it is insanely unrealistic, like a racing video game. There are some exciting parts though, and I suppose it has got a good plot (based on a 1960's cult hit movie) and Cage doesn't do that terrible of a job acting.</fullReview>

Think of it as an auto show with a plot running down the middle of it. My biggest problem with the movie is that Angelina Jolie isn't in it more, or for that matter Delroy Lindo. But overall, if you are looking for a fast paced film with a couple of good fight scenes, a better villain than Mission Impossible 2 (if only this guy was in Woo's movie think how much better it would have been), Nick Cage being Nick Cage and an awesome collection of cars, this is your movie. If you want something else, wait for the Patriot or Perfect Storm to come out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Car chases, Average Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone in 60 Seconds(2000) is a movie that has breathtaking chases and plenty of energy. The problem is it relies too much on the plot instead of just being a pure action film in the likes of The Road Warrior(1981). Without the well executed chase scenes, this would be nothing but a pretensious and uninteresting movie to watch. Another complaint I have about this film is the lack of screen time for Angie Jolie who gave the film's best performance. In many ways, Gone in 60 Seconds reminded me a little of Michael Mann's Thief(a early Bruckheimer production, which is probably his best). This is a film where I would suggest a person who interested in films to leave their thinking cap at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was at home, getting ready to watch The 13th Warrior, when I first saw the Gone in Sixty Seconds Trailer. I got so excited seeing that Jerry Bruckheimer was producing, and Trevor Rabin was doing the movie's score. It was great but then at the end it said PG-13. I had a thing against PG-13 movies but now I don't thanks to this movie. I first thought that PG-13's were corny because they weren't allowed to curse or show a lot of blood. I also thought they would be boring. I was wrong. Gone in Sixty Seconds has all the good action a car chase lover would ask for. I'm glad I didn't go by the rating. In all, the movie's car chases are great, and I loved the score for the movie. So trust me, go see it if you want a good ride. (9 out of 10 stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd like to say - not bad . . . but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!Remake of the HB Haliki film, of the same name. The old film was clever, a little slow leading up to the chase maybe (if just to set up the chase), very understated, very 'indie', with an obvious interest in the means of the thieves - thus, the 60 seconds of the title - and particularly the cars they stole.This film, on the other hand, while sort of kind of interested in the cars, or at least a silver Mustang, takes little interest in the thieves, and spends far too much time on generic action film shoot-outs, and the supposed plot or lead-up to the chase. Not much time is left for the chase. It's not choreographed nearly as well as in the original, and seems to use far fewer cars as if they had a smaller budget than the original . . indie film. More time is given over to the typ. shoot-out in the warehouse. The whole thing seems derivative, even at times of the original movie to be fair, but really of just a whole bunch of basic action films. At the end, the old Eleanor, all rusted and beat up, is presented as a gift for the successful night of thieving. It's a nice homage to the original. But a far better job of that could have been done by doing a far better job on this film. The spirit of the original is gone in this which is overproduced, underthought, barely interested in the characters and their prey.Have to give credit to the opening credit sequence. Looked like we were getting ready for a preview of Matrix II, or something. But it was good. It was visually interesting, and I liked it. For the rest of the film, it seems like a rip-off for someone who has seen the original film. And it might seem like that to someone who hasn't - I wouldn't know. What you get in the Bruckhammer treatment is boom box bass - even just when someone just gets punched in the face. That, admittedly, was missing in the original. But that's sort of why Haliki's film was so popular - it didn't seem like a film, almost more like a documentary. And it also seemed like something people had fun doing, rather than something they just phoned in for the money.Can't recommend the film, except for the boom box effects - which you'd prob. best get in a theatre, or good home theatre. Then again, you could prob. just listen to a sfx cd, and get the same 'buzz'. You don't need a car chase movie for that. Definitely check out the original. Maybe if and when they remake it, again, that'll prove to be more worthwhile (they remade Treasure Island, and had at least a couple of good versions of that).</fullReview>

So many action films take on the task of making the action exciting and fail horribly, but this time you won't be disappointed. There's nothing real original about this movie, (car chases, love affairs, foreign bad guys), but that is the beauty of it!

		<fullReview>As I watched the movie, I found myself stretching every five minutes, but I wasn't experiencing continuous muscle spasms (even though some could say the movie can have that effect), the reason I was stretching so much was because the movie is just awful and it was boring me to death.I should have known better, especially after I read the synopsis, Nicolas Cage comes out of retirement to rescue his younger brother, what a great (in terms of stupidity) beginning to an awful movie.Now, let me point out that I didn't enter the cinema with any expectations of a well-crafter story or of any story at all. The trailer was cool so I expected the script to be bearable. Wrong!!! But I digress, what I really went to the movie for was the promise of many high-octane car chase scenes. I love cars, that's why I went there!But no, as I walked out of the movie (at the end, even though I was tempted many times to leave before) I found myself comparing this unbelievable piece of garbage to the "Fast Getaway II", for the only reason that the car chase sequence in the beginning of FGII (the only part I saw) was better than all the car scenes in Gone. That's pretty sad! Especially when you have an extensive budget in your hands.So, what is wrong (beyond all the holes in the script and a pointless storyline.) All the action scenes are shot so close to make them appear more dynamic. The result is that we never really get a good chance to see what's going on and things are not really that exciting, the long shots in which we see cars taking turns at breathtaking speeds are few, and the action is cut so quickly that we don't have any time to enjoy the single shots. Ultimately, if I go to see a movie with all types of Ferraris and Porsches I really want to see what the cars can do.After the initial car chase in the intro we don't see any action for over an hour, and then it lasts five to ten minutes. So, the bottom line is that it's awful, the performances by the actors are poor, and whoever wrote this piece of you know what, well whatever, I've vented my anger enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a movie with outstanding acting, this is not the one for you. Several of the actors featured in this film were vastly underutilized, especially Robert DuVall. On the other hand, there are a few nice character moments -- Cage's character "Memphis" Raines explaining to his brother that it was never about the money; the whole gang getting psyched for the job by listening to "Low Rider"; Raines asking his mother at the diner for permission to break his earlier promise to her.But, if you like cool cars and car chases, and you don't mind turning off your brain for 2 hours (and there's nothing wrong with that, especially if the theatre is nice and cool and it's hot and muggy outside), it's worth seeing. But I'd recommend seeing it at a matinee or a second run theatre. Better than Mission: Impossible 2, in my opinion -- much more fun to watch, and more believable (even the car jump scene at the end is more believable than most of the stunts in MI:2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely do I feel the need to pay money to see a movie that I am not interested in seeing. I had thought that GONE IN 60 SECONDS looked entertaining and worth a rent, but on the suggestion of a trusted friend and film afficianado, I saw it. I was ENTERTAINED and thoroughly ENJOYED this film, however it was a typical J. Bruckhiemer in which he expects that you will not question what he shows you. I, on the other hand, know and believe what I see. Corvettes don't fly attatched to a plane(loved CONAIR though) and beautiful 1967 Shelby GT's don't jump like that! It had me totally ready to give a 9 vote because so much of it had been believable. The premise is far-fetched, but they were experts so... Anyways, the film made me smile, as do all of his films. The director, Sena, did a fine job with casting and showing off all of these beautiful cars. The plot was as expected, Nick Cage was too sweet as usual, the dialogue was toned down for the PG-13 rating (a smart move in my opinion), and the chase sequences were on par if not better than the greatest we've ever seen(BULLIT, BLUES BROTHERS, RONIN). Overall, another quality entertainment flick, but don't expect the Academy to come calling!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment. I didn't expect much going in and I was still disappointed. Let's put it this way-all the good parts of the movie's trailer are the best parts of the movie: the wrecking ball smashing a car through a brick wall, the propane tank smashing up numerous cars as it flies through a shipyard (yes, the movie ends in a shipyard, for those of you keeping track of such things). One thing I didn't see in the trailer was a '67 Mustang using a tow truck ramp to jump over a half mile-long accident site in the middle of the Vincent Thomas Bridge in Long Beach. Neat, but if you really want to impress me, do it for real instead of faking it with such obvious digital trickery.This is the thing that really had me scratching my head: this film, sold to us as the ultimate adrenaline rush, car-chase-every-five-minutes, car-thief-picture-to-end-all-car-thief-pictures has a grand total of...one car chase. What? Really? Well, now you know. What's worse is that the car chase isn't even that great (want to see a REALLY cool car chase, rent the DVD of "The Corruptor" with Chow Yun-Fat and skip to the car chase scene toward the middle). In case you haven't guessed yet, I'm trying to discourage you from going to see "Gone In 60 Seconds."A great cast is wasted on a ridiculous plot (was this Rosenberg's thesis project in film school or what?). Nicholas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall (why, Robert?), Delroy Lindo, Giovanni Ribisi...wasted. It all starts when Ribisi's character, Kip Raines, unwittingly leads the police to a stash of stolen cars. To make up for his screw-up, he's got something like four days to steal fifty cars or he'll be drawn and quartered by a bunch of mean-looking white guys with accents. Luckily, his older brother Randall (Cage), nicknamed "Memphis," used to be the best car thief around. Guess who's coming out of retirement? Memphis agrees to "boost" the cars to save the main bad guy from crushing Kip and the car he's sitting in (with the window open) in a hydraulic press. This was an amazingly dull scene. To top it off, they let Kip go. They don't hold him captive with guns pointed at his head or anything. He just walks free, then hangs around to help steal some cars. So much for jeopardy--you know, that thing that makes you actually care about what happens to a character.For the following two hours, we get some comedic car boosting scenes, some cat-and-mouse games between Memphis' crew and the L.A.P.D.'s car theft division, led by Roland Castlebeck (Lindo), and Memphis and Kip talking about their feelings (for the last time Mr. Bruckheimer, we don't EXPECT character development in your movies, so please stop trying). There are a few less-than-spectacular action scenes involving cars thrown in here and there. There's even this great scene where the crew steals three Mercedes from the police impound. Actually, I had to use my imagination. The filmmakers build this boost up like crazy, but don't even go to the trouble of showing it happen."Gone In 60 Seconds" is like Chrysler's new PT Cruiser-it looks real cool but has absolutely nothing under the hood (though I hear they're going to be dropping a V6 in it on the next batch. Woo-hoo). Or maybe it's more like a car with a big engine in need of a tune-up: every time you think it's going to blast off and take you for a great ride, it stalls.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a little slow in the beginning and has a fairly simple plot, but man are the action sequences good! They make you want to go out and get a 1967 Shelby! Really liked Nicholas Cage, and Angelina looked hot (even though she had a small role). Overall an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***************SPOILERS AHEAD**************I wasn't expecting a best picture nominee or anything, but come on Mr.Bruckhiemer, we are not that stupid. You had a mindless yet very fun picture going here up until the point where you decided to have Nick Cage apparently make a '67 Shelby Mustang fly like a 747. If you had cut that scene, I would have left the theater with a smile on my face instead of feeling very, very dumb for sitting through this movie. Granted, the cars were beautiful to look at as was Angelina Jolie (DAMN!), but that can't be an excuse for you letting that scene stay in the film. I'll wait for "Coyote Ugly" to hit theaters before I swear your films off altogether, so you've got about a month.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... Let's Go! Gone in 60 seconds is definitely a fun ride. The story was straightforward, but not brainless, and not contrived. The movie jumped into the action incrementally and promptly, yet allowing excellent character development... no yawning.Stealing cars was made an art form, every job was unique and artful, climaxing in a 160 mph chase. Although the theme and the action exudes testosterone, the characters were not empty and shallow. The acting was excellent and the characters were engaging.Gone in 60 seconds... although I don't exactly get the title, I definitely recommend it.Roy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big fan of the PC game Grand Theft Auto, I thought this would be an awesome movie. I was really disappointed. I was expecting A LOT of chases and A LOT of over-the-top action. It was sorely lacking. Two much time was spent setting up the motivation for the boost, and not enough time on the actual boost itself. It had its moments, but not enough of them for me. One good aspect was the soundtrack, which used a lot of already overused tracks, but was appropriate throughout. Overall though, if you want to see some great chase scenes and great action watch The Rock, not this stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the most visually exciting and entertaining movies I have seen all year. It kept me stuck in my seat right through until the end, and took my breath away. The acting is awesome, especially from Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi. The sound is excellent, and the story is well written. Gone In Sixty Seconds is a completely recommendable film.If you are expecting just sex and fast cars, you better think again. Gone In Sixty Seconds is really about brothers and going your heights to save them. But that doesn't mean it is completely serious and s**t!I recommend you see Gone In Sixty Seconds if you want a crime-fulled, action-packed, thrill ride of a movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the movie, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let me start by saying I really did like the movie. But I have one complaint: A lot of folks are writing their comments and saying things like, "if you're looking for some great car chase scenes, this is your movie," and "can a lot of beautiful cars, in a lot of car chase scenes carry a movie? I think it can." Well, I think it could too -- very much so! I love fast cars, and watching a good car chase just warms my heart. But this movie, while very enjoyable, did not deliver what I expected in the car-chase department. I don't think most of the comment writers here really paid attention to the movie as a whole, with regard to the action elements. There really was not ALL that much action in the movie. I actually went to the movie BECAUSE I thought it would be full of car-chases; that was the real draw for me, because that's what the trailers lead you to believe the movie would be. ***SKIP AHEAD TO AVOID VERY SLIGHT SPOILER*** But there were really only two good car chases in the whole movie: the obligatory beginning, and ending chases. ***SPOILER END*** So, for that reason, I felt a little disappointed. Still, I did enjoy the chases that I did see -- some very exciting stuff, which was worth going to see. Oh, one more small gripe, which I'll direct to the movie-makers themselves: when you're filming a car-chase (or fight scene) back that camera off from the action just a tad. When the camera is right on top of the action, and things are moving so quickly, it makes it a bit difficult to determine exactly what is going on. If you're going to all that trouble to set up a big, elaborate car chase, and choreograph these extreme near-misses between vehicles, then back the camera up a little, and let us see it. Let me also say this, I'm not an old guy saying, "why don't ya slow that down a little; I can't see all that fast-movin' stuff." No, I'm 25 and I've grown up with all that MTV quick-cut, swift-camera-movement crap, and I'm telling you it's really freakin' annoying. And it's totally NOT effective in a car-chase scene where the driver's skill is supposed to be on display. Those shots of a super-sports-car slipping through a narrow gap while running through an intersection are just not very impressive when the camera is so close that you can't SEE the speed involved, and the driver's skill at maneuvering through that tiny space. I wanna SEE the stunt, not just know that there was one. This movie was not too bad about doing that, but it had a couple of moments where I would've liked to see a different angle on the stunts. Anyway, I liked the movie (even if it sounds like I didn't) and I gave it an 8. So, yeah, I'd recommend seeing it, but don't get the idea that it's an action-packed car-chase extravaganza. If ya want a really good car chase, check out Ronin (several awe-inspiring displays of driving skill,) Bullit (Steve McQueen in the first great car-chase in movie history,) and The Blues Brothers (yeah, that's right, The Blues Brothers; in a number of great chases. The ending chase has to be the most expensive car-chase ever. Great stuff.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage and Jerry Brukheimer have done it again.They have been awesome together with this movie plus ''Con Air***1/2[3 1/2 Stars]''and''The Rock***1/2[3 1/2 Stars]''.I would definately name Nicolas Cage as best actor and Jerry Brukheimer as best producer this year and of all time.As for the movie itself,it was awesome.The movie isnt loaded with action every single minute of it like most Jerry Brukheimer movies but it has an excellent and one the most interesting plots that ive seen in a movie in a while.Some movies usually has its action scenes keeping you in intrest but this movie doesnt depend on action to do that,it depends on its great plot and acting.What also makes the movie real interesting is the techniques that are shown of how they steel 50 cars in one night.Personally i dont give a s__t what the cops are saying about criminals getting ideas of how to steal cars from this movie because that what makes the movie real interesting and car stealers are probably going to figure these things out sooner or later even with out the movie.Now for all those hard-core action fans there is action in the MOVIE!DONT WORRY!.Towards the end of the movie theres is an awesome car chase and it is one longest and with out a doubt the best car chase ever shown in a movie.Theres never been a better one,thats how awesome it was.Also there is an awesome cast with Nicolas Cage,Delroy Lindo,Will Paton,and Robert Duval and of course Angelina Jolie who was a real hottie and maybe in my opinion the best actress this year so far.And just like every Jerry Brukheimer movie this movie is pretty hilarious.If your a Nicolas Cage and Jerry Brukheimer fan and love car chasing scenes go see ''Gone In 60 Seconds''.***1/2[3 1/2 Stars]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I've not been a fan of Nicolas Cage in the past, I was quite reluctant to even consider seeing this film, but the whole plot and strategy were enough to drag me in. I've discovered that Cage is a terrific actor and this film was just made for him. Angelina Jolie is an awesome sidekick to Cage, as were Robert Duvall and Delroy Lindo, and the chemistry that the entire cast has going makes this movie TOTALLY worth your 5 bucks.If you're looking for high speed chases (in a sweeeeeet Mustang), romance (Jolie &amp; Cage), relationships (really sweet moment with Giovanni Ribisi when his friend's in the hospital and at the end), comedy (the whole cast!!), and a lot to talk about afterward, get out of your house and see Gone in 60 Seconds. It's one movie that I would definitely be willing to see again. And again... And again... =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is WRONG with this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really glad I didn't pay to see this movie; then again, I never do: AMC 30 is one of the easiest theaters to sneak in ever built. Nonetheless, I still feel the urge to laugh at what I say. This film might be brilliant as a comedy, but as a serious action flick, anyone who enjoyed it really must reevaluate what it is they were watching. THIS MOVIE WAS ALL TEXTBOOK! TEXTBOOK. I found myself calling every twist in the story. We see Cage working legitimatley. I turn to my friend and say: "He's been out of the business for years, they're gonna come and recruit him". Done. Cage goes to speak to Robert DuValle...the old "leader of the pack". They catch up on old times, and Cage spoils the moment by bringing up "business". TEXTBOOK! There was not a THING in this movie that we havn't seen before. Angelina Jolie couldv'e given us something to look at and taken off her shirt or something! :) The script was absolutely horrible, and Cage couldn't act his way out of a paperbag. Truly. WHO WROTE THIS THING? Cage's dialogue sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. Some interesting cinematography is overplayed by the LONG LONG intro, where we see pretty much the entire contents of someones apartment through different colored filters, with changing film speeds. Original? Hardly. Interesting? Yes...for the first 2 minutes. It gets REAL old! I admit, the cars were beautiful. But 2 hours of BBBBBBBBBBRRRR,rrrrrrRRRRRRR Muscle Cars flying around doesn't make a good movie. Oh, wait. I forgot. The general movie going public is stupid: it IS a good movie! Enjoy everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would the summer movie season be without a Bruckheimer flick, Nick Cage starring, of coarse (he's contractually obligated to play the lead in every second JB film. Well, no, not really)? Jerry keeps cranking them out, and i'm always there with my hard-earned money, eager for a dose of snappy dialogue and far-out action sequences, and i'm rarely disapointed. Actually, I think the last one was two years ago (Enemy of the State). You slowing down on us, Jer?I think this is Sena's first movie since Kalifornia, and it looks beautiful. His style and Bruckheimer's mesh quite nicely. Cage is great, funny and cool. The supporting cast is made up of a ton of actors that will leave you saying, "Hey I remember him from...". A lot of fun performances here, Ribisi (spelling?) especially is one of my favorite supporting actors in films today. Jolie (for what little screen time she has), has some good chemistry with Cage.Oddly enough, my only complaint is that there aren't enough car chases. I'm thinking back and I only remember one (a big one) toward the end, though it was spectacular. I have no problem giving this movie a 9/10 stars. I laughed and I was dazzled, what more do I want? G'night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Bruckheimer is at it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why people are having such a problem with this movie. It was *great*. The story is what really pushes this one. The script was a little light, but then there aren't many these days that aren't. It was a little like Jaws in that it moved along easily most of the time, had bits of furious action mixed in, all the while, working up to it's grand climax at the end. Being a typical Bruckheimer film there are a couple of parts that you say "Yeah, right", but they really didn't detract from the whole. My only real problem was that they didn't exploit the actors. Cage seemed to be right on, as usual, but Duvall, Jolie, Ribisi and the others were almost like afterthoughts. Hey, it's an *action* movie and we just have to deal with things like that. Lindo's seemed to be the only other actor that got a major push in the movie.Of course the true stars of the movie were the cars. Shown in the movie were Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Hummer, Benz, Jaguar and a few others. And of course the object of Memphis Raines affections, a '67 Shelby Mustang GT-500.So, sit back, relax, and suspend reality for a couple of hours. That's what we go to see action movies for isn't it?

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Date Movie for Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: This includes a few comments that MIGHT spoil some of the suspense or fun for some viewers.)Good news for all you XY-chromosomed cineastes still smarting from being dragged to see "The Joy Luck Club." It matters not if you, like this reviewer, are automotively challenged. I can barely jump-start, much less hot-wire, a car, but I dug the hell out of this flick anyway.Like most filmic male-fodder, it has a rather silly premise. If Memphis has gone straight, why doesn't he just call the cops as soon as he's found out that the creepy Limey has nabbed his baby brother? Why does he keep his promise to steal all those cars after the Bad Guys have released Kip (as if they would!)?Well, because if any of that happened, the movie would be too darn realistic and it would spoil all the fun. You wouldn't have the reunion of car-stealin' buddies, the young wannabe crooks would never get the benefit of the oldtimers' wry wisdom, and Memphis wouldn't get back together with the impossibly sexy female mechanic.No doubt volumes have already been written about the cool chase scenes, so I won't dwell on that. Here's two things I really liked about this movie:1. Giovanni Ribisi did an excellent job of mimicking Nicolas Cage's vocal quirks. Not a blatant imitation, but a credible echo. You can really believe they were raised in the same family.2. They did not spoil the mood with a bunch of sappy romance between Memphis and the pouty blond grease monkey. Just enough exposition to let the viewers know they had a past, without a lot of digression into hurt feelings or momentum-sapping lovemaking scenes.Besides, that'd be totally unrealistic. When you've got that many cars to steal on deadline, you can't waste your time making out -- no matter how delicious and engine-savvy the babe happens to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living in Michigan, I know all too well how much people just love their cars. And besides "Eleanor", the Shelby Mustang, there's just no focus on them. Instead we get character shots, one-liners, and other things we didn't really have in mind when we shelled out 8 bucks to see it. And the movie is far from "action-packed" like the trailers would have you to believe, there's really only one chase scene to speak of and that's near the end.Movies like this should be based on the subject matter and the action that results from it, but when you're dealt a cast of Nick Cage, Robert Duvall, and Angelina Jolie, (all talented actors) I guess you feel obliged to put the ball in their court. The movie does this, and by doing so it distracts itself by focusing on the whole cast of characters (which would put a laundry list to shame) and their dialogue. Gone in 60 Seconds does its best to supply every character with witty lines throughout the movie instead of showing us nice cars and how to steal them within 60 seconds. In fact, it never showed me at all how to steal a car, another aspect of which I was hoping to be enlightened.** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Script, not to good. Action good, cars great. If you need any more incentive, Angelina Jolie, hot-hot-hot. Went to see this film with a few buddies of mine, we left our wives at home, and we all liked it. This was not one of the worlds best films but if you like fast cars and Angelina Jolie as a blond, you will have a good time. There were so many wholes in the script I stopped thinking about it and just enjoyed the ride. I would have liked to see more of the cars but I guess the manufactures did not want to show too much of their high price cars that can be lifted in less ten 60 seconds. But if you want mindless fun and like cars, then this movie is a blast. I would like to see another film like this that shows even more of these new and old auto classics. Every year here in Phoenix there is an antique auto show and it is always great. This year the car I liked the best was a German twelve wheel all wheel drive staff car that generals used to tour occupied countries it went for over $900,000. This has nothing to do with the movie but I feel this is a whole culture that Hollywood could exploit, Americas love of fine antique autos.</fullReview>

The plotline could have been a followup to the original in the manner of "The Color of Money" for Fast Eddy but then again Cage does a fine job of having fun in his silly role as a car booster. OK, so what if modern cars are a lot more difficult to steal than the movie portrays, you can't jump a GT-350H off a tow truck ramp and drive it any more than the Dukes of Hazzard could. Suspend reality for a bit and watch this movie for the fun of it. Forget the Ferrari's and the exotic cars being stolen, because they can't be stolen, forget the locking steering columns and GPS trackers. This movie is just great fun.</fullReview>

It moved slow, had paper thin characters, and the dialogue was horrible. I actually laughed out loud at some of the lines. The car chase was decent but not as good as I'd hoped for.

		<shortDescription>What A Great Movie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so great!! I loved the action, script and performances by the whole cast including Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall, and the very beautiful Angelina Jolie. Even though this is a remake of the original classic, you should check it out anyways. But first rent the original classic before you see this version. If you didn't like it, you don't have much taste in movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful, awful, awful. To sum it all up:Script: Unbelievable and hack meat story lineActing: Good, but were these awful characters worth it?Directing: Sena hasn't directed since Kalifornia in 1993. You think in seven years a person would learn something about their profession!Ending: Very predictable and clique. In the words of Roger Ebert "I've seen this movie before countless times"!OVERALL: Wait till video if you're a Cage or car fan. If you're neither wait till TBS airs this every Sunday afternoon in place of Top Gun or Road House!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing New Here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, so what else is new? None. Jerry Bruckheimer is known for summer blockbusters with corny scripts and a lot of action. Well, if that's what you want, that's what you'll get. He actually has made some solid films with characters in it as well though, as he did in DAYS OF THUNDER, CRIMSON TIDE, and ENEMY OF THE STATE were all plot-driven as well but with a balance of action and chararcter well done, which in GONE IN 60 SECONDS did not work very well.I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed this movie. I went in with my friends, set down, and I was thrilled away. The action sequences were very very well done. One of the best chase scenes ever.(But it still doesn't beat FRENCH CONNECTION) The action and the usual ingriedient was there, a chick, a pro car thief, and an old-timer-cop who wants to put the pro in jail.Now, even though I enjoyed this to a certain extent, I thought the script was HORRIBLE. The story first of all, was very, very, very typical. So this kid named KIP(GIOVANNI RABISI) gets into trouble stealing cars and now his brother Randall(NIC CAGE) has to help him by getting back to his old ways and steal more cars or else his brother DIES! And when Randall gets back, he needs help to steal the 50 cars from his old buddies. And among them, of course there's a love interest that Randall had a break-up with so now he has to resolve that. In that group, there are the typicals, the Old-timer, tough-guy, smooth black guy, the chick, and of course the main character who's the best at everything. Very, very typical. Also, there will be a LOT of exposition, or rather LOTS of vulgar or unbelievably direct dialogues between characters when they're talking about the past that they come out REALLY REALLY unrealistic.Well other than that, as usual if you liked all the other Jerry Bruckheimer movies, I don't see why you shouldn't see this. Even if you're not a Jerry Bruckheimer fan, you should probably see this, it was a cool action movie, despite the stupid script. BETWEEN *** and ** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's up with the Shelby?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get it- the star of the film is a 1967 Shelby 500 GT, a type of mustang. The car is certainly nice looking and handles well (if the car-chase scene is any indication) but there are much better cars in the film that have much more power, are much more rare, and are far more expensive. The Shelby was just a muscle car, and anyone can buy one today for less money than a Buick Park Ave. If I were Nick Cage, my "Eleanor" would have been the Jaguar XJ 220, Bentley Azure or Lamborghini Diablo, each of which was featured in the movie. Each is 10x more rare and 10x more expensive. The Jaguar was $800,000. Also, it would have been nice if the camera would have given us a lengthier glimpse at some of the cars, instead of just the old sixties pony car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a bad movie. A career ender for Nic Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall (he's old anyhow, so it doesn't matter too much for him.) This is Jerry Bruckheimer's worst movie since Days of Thunder (another car movie). I never saw the original, but it must have been good to have gotten this cast to sign up for this picture. However, the magic that may have existed in the previous version- does not exist here. Everything fails. The story (there isn't any, thats why I am not writing a synopsis) The directing, the acting, and the car chases are not as phenomenal as I would have anticipated (does not match Ronin's car chase scene or come close). This movie was a big disappointment (I knew it would be bad, but it was worse than I even thought it would be) It was laughable. The jokes were corny, the writing was awful. If you see this movie- be prepared to hate it. Cause it sucks!</fullReview>

Don't expect too much and you'll get your $7.50 worth.</fullReview>

But for almost two hours of film, I would have hoped they would have devoted more time to the relationship between Sway (Jolie) and Memphis (Cage). She was sorely underutilized... but every moment she was on screen was golden.This isn't a film for those looking for a deep, intricate plot. The storyline is simple, makes sense, and is carried out well. Lots of beautiful cars driven by equally beautiful people. It's a slam-bang action film, and the chase scene everyone's talking about at the end is worth waiting for. Just remember, going to see a film entails a slight suspension of disbelief. =)3.5 stars out of 4.. only because I wanted more Sway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I am going to discuss the following points in this review. I will be scoring the following categories: Plot, Acting, and Action. This being an action film in it's own right, I am not going to be dogging on it because it is not a Best Picture nominee. If you go to this movie expecting the wrong thing, then I guess that's your choice. This is an all out action movie, and anything less would be a disappointment. I went and checked out this movie yesterday afternoon at my local theater. I was pleasantly suprised to find that there were only about 6 or 7 people in the theater, odd for an opening day matinee. So I sat down with my bucked of popcorn, and supersized drink, ready to watch a groovy car movie. I have to say, from start to finish, the movie goes at 100 miles per hour, and doesn't really slow down. I enjoyed every minute of the film.PLOT: First of all, if you enjoy previous Bruckheimer/Cage collaborations, then you will walk out of this satisfied. The plot is not especially laden with twists and turns, there is a token attempt at romance, and there aren't many dead spots. In a nutshell, a notorious car thief must steal 50 cars in 72 hours to save the day. The majority of the movie revolves around accomplishing this feat. (*** out of 5)ACTING: This next paragraph discusses the acting, and contains some very minor spoilers. Read at your own risk. Cage is back in full-bore action hero mode in this flick (a la "The Rock" and "Con Air," without the southern accent but with some annoying blonde highlights. He used to steal cars, and now he doesn't anymore. Jolie is vibrant on the screen, and she has a megawatt smile that lights up the film in some moments. She digs fast cars. Ribisi is Cage's little brother, and he wants to follow in his brother's footsteps. He doesn't serve much of a purpose otherwise. Jolie could have easily been pasted into this role. Lindo is the cop who let one get away. Duvall seems tired on screen, his character seemed a little out of place. None are that engaging, but the acting is not the focal point of this film. The cast does a decent enough job keeping the movie flowing, but you won't find any Oscar worthy nominations here. (*** out of 5)ACTION: Indeed, the stars of the film are the cars. Mercedes, BMW's, Cadillacs, Ferraris, and even a Humvee are in the film. The action sequences, as always are top notch. The car stealing scenes literally steal the show. I think the true star of this film is Ellanor, Cage's pet name for a 1967 Shelby Cobra Mustang. If you must know, it goes really fast. This car is involved in the final action sequence, and really ties the whole film together. The chase scenes are the best I have seen since Ronin, and I really enjoyed them. There were a few spots deemed best as unbelievable, but are probably more close to impossible. The great thing is, however, you find yourself rooting for the impossible by the end of the film, which in and of itself is anticlimactic. I will say you won't be that suprised by the ending. (****1/2 out of 5)Overall, this is a great film. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. It does take a little to get it started, but once it starts, it doesn't stop. Edge of your seat action for the last half hour ensures that you will walk out in awe, and the acting is passable. The plot is straight on, and is one of those "The clock is ticking" types. No twists and turns, which can be disappointing. Can Cage save the day? The action sequences save this movie, that's for sure. I've got to recommend this to any fan of Cage's previous action work, or to anyone who enjoys exotic cars that go really fast. Vroom Vroom! (******** out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it was pretty bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is forgetable, I went into the theater thinking it was a movie like Ronin(good car chase movie), but it was no Ronin, in fact it was under par from Ronin. Gone in 60 Seconds best describes the climactic car chase scene, 2 hours of building up to this point are gone in 60 seconds, it really wasn't worth it.let me make a little listStuff in the movie that was needed:1.)Randal "Memphis" Raine's sexual obession with cars.2.)Randal not doing the job for the money but for the cars, come on give me a break.3.)In the junk yard scene keep on the look out for an exploding trash can in the background, for some reason flames blaze from it, for no reason. And its always like that through out the movie. from night time, to the next day, the trash can is spewing out flames, its almost laughable.4.)Randall and Otto talking about race cars and the noise they make, its totally unnessary, I mean we already know Memphis loves cars, how much does he have to do to prove that.5.)the scene where Memphis jumps over the traffic jam, was horrible and unrealistic.6.)the bad guy, Ray (the bad thing about is that his last name sounds almost Italian) something, where the hell is he supposed to be from, he doesn't sound english, he doesn't sound scottish, he doesn't even sound irish, am I missing something here, assuming since he was arrested in England, I assume he's supposed to be english, and with a really phoney accent.this movie was poorly written and poorly directed, it could have been good, had it been a 2 hour car chase movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Normal summer popcorn movie, is it really just that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer to the question above is yes/no, I will tell you what I mean in due time. I was screened this movie during the wekk at midnight and I was very excited to see it. The trailer for this film has been showing on different movies for a long, long time. And after I got sick of seeing the original trailer, they showed a new one which got me even more psyched about seeing this. Okay, no more of this boring talk and lets get down to the film. Nicholas Cage plays ex-car thief Randall " Memphis" Raines and man that went straight for his brothers sake. His brother, Kip Raines(Giovanni Ribsi) ended up in the same life as Memphis, a car thief. Memphis then gets word from his friend, Atley Jackson(Will Patton) that Kip has gotten into deep trouble, Kip took a "boost" and messed it up. A "boost" is when you steal a certain amount of cars in a certain amount of time. Kip took the job from a mad man and didn't preform very well. Memphis makes a deal with the man saying if he steals 50 cars in a sinle day, the man will let Kip live, the man agrees. Memphis knows he can not do this on his own, so he enlists some of his friends, there's Otto Halliwell(Robert Duvall), Donny Astrick(Chi McBride), The Sphinx(Vinnie Jones)and Sara " Sway" Wayland who happens to be Memphis's ex-grilfriend. They all put togther a plan to steal the cars. But Kip wants to help, which Memphis allows, Kip brings in some of his young friends to help, there's Tumbler(Scott Cann), Toby(William Lee Scott), and Fred(James Duvall). Then there's Dectective Roland Castleback(Delroy Lindo) a man set on catching these men in action. The car chases in this film are done great, with the standout one being the very last one with Memphis and the police. The direction by Dominic Sena is done good, and is produced well by Jerry Bruckheimer. This film is not a normal popcorn movie beacause it's not just blow them up and shoot them down, they actually try a story with this. I fell they should have just picked one, either make it a story of friendship and love or just a plain blowing them up films, which aren't all that bad. I was disapointed a little by this film but it is worth seeing on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has got to be the worst film of the summer so far. This movie was supposed to have great car chases. On Jay Leno, Nick Cage said that it had the best car chase of all time. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!! It's not the worst car chase in the world, but for a movie with a 100 million dollar budget it is quite pathetic. Most people here probably haven't seen the original Gone in Sixty Seconds which had a forty minute car chase. This one is like ten minutes. The greatest car chases are in Bullitt, To Live and Die in L.A., Ronin, The French Connection, and The Seven-Ups. I knew from the trailer that the acting was going to consist of one liners and corny jokes, but my god, it was worse than I thought. This movie doesn't even tell you how to steal a car like the original. Please do not see this movie. Please! Unless you wanna see Nick Cage use some nitro on a Shelby.</fullReview>

Car chases and car crashes. The ending sequences with all the squealing tires and smashing steel was the whole reason I went to this film, not to see Nic cage get cozy with Ms. Jolie and make nice nice with his little brother.Very enjoyable for about 45 minutes...so don't give it too much thought if yer late getting to the theatre, you really won't miss much in the first hour or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read a lot of bad reviews of this movie in the papers and such, but believe me it is not bad at all. The plot is what it is. Were suppost to root for these car thieves, so just go with it. Now, "Gone in 60 Seconds" has the elements that make a movie fun. Lots of action that is not overdone, and no corny stuff to ruin the movie. There is of course a few cheezy lines, and an anology or two that doesn't make sense, but compared to most action movies this movie is mild in that category. Car chases are fun, and though this is a great exhibition of them, there is a lot more that makes this film work. The characters are fun, the colors are great(Dick Tracy like), and the engines are loud. It is a fun movie that is not far-fetched or filled with cheezy one-liners. It is a good movie, not great, but one that should appeal to just about everyone..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blind and completely mindless fun, summer's here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone in Sixty Seconds is essentially a 2 hour car chase with some dialogue scenes mixed in... and it's a blast. The plot is barely there but actors like Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, and Nicholas Cage can almost make you completely forget that fact. It's just so damned entertaining. It has its funny moments. It even has its witty moments... The really cool car chases in even cooler cars go without saying. It is blind and completely mindless fun. It's the epitome of a summer action flick, only you can't predict every freakin' scene the way you could with Mission Impossible 2. Don't look for meaning or an underlying philosophy of life through stealing cars here. This isn't Citizen Kane, but it doesn't try to be either. It tries to be an entertaining action flick with Nick Cage and the "IT" kids Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi, and towards that goal it succeeded masterfully. It's also great for fans of golden oldies... remake of cult classic(who'd a thought?) "Gone in Sixty Seconds."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good acting, sexy cars, fun &amp; interesting characters... Angelina Jolie is perfect as Sway, and Nicholas Cage gives depth &amp; believability to Memphis. If you love fast cars, great chase scenes, &amp; clever getaways, this is your movie. A few hilarious one-liners &amp; great camerawork make this a movie I will be going back to see again &amp; again. GO SEE IT. Vinnie Jones is excellently spooky as the Sphinx, James Duvall and William Lee Scott are also great.. there's not one thing I can think of about this movie that isn't good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About the only thing this movie has in common with the 1974 film on which it is (very) loosely based is its title and a couple of similar plot points. I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed by this movie. The simple fact is, there's really nothing particularly novel done here. The film never moves beyond the rank of a passable Summer time-killer. There are a few funny lines, but not TOO many of them. There are a few car chases, but for what's supposed to be an action-packed thrill ride, they come spaced too few and far between. The acting is okay, but with the exception of Delroy Lindo as the dogged detective hot on the trail of the car thieves, nobody really seems able to rise above and really stick out from the pack; even the usually reliable Cage seems too subdued here. We're used to seeing him as something of an every-man who turns a rather believable and resourceful super-hero in a crisis, but the script just doesn't provide the goods for him to do so this time around.All the flash and bombast that's become the trademark of all of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's films (The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon) seems misplaced in the context of this very simple story. The scrappy 1974 original was made on a next-to-nothing budget, and actually added to the story's appeal. It also got the job done faster and more economically (97 minutes Vs. 118 minutes) You really feel the padding here.This new version of "Gone In 60 Seconds" is not a bad movie. It's easy to watch and imminently forgettable. "Mission Impossible 2," which was released 2 weeks before this movie, is much more likely to stick in the mind (and warrant a repeat viewing) a year from now. My rating for "Gone In 60 Seconds (2000)" **1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in 60 Seconds had a shallow plot and didn't have quite the non-stop action the name implies; yet it kept the viewer's interest. Memphis (Cage) is a man with such family values and honor that he couldn't be a car thief (which is why he retired), but Kip, his younger brother is far too ignorant to have lived the six years of his brother's absence. The car chases were among the best I have seen (though the film took quite some time building up to them). Most of the characters had a lot of depth. Being a car chase movie I didn't expect much story line (such as Cannonball Run), so as shallow as this plot is, I was pleasantly surprised. I have to rate: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in 60 seconds (which I caught at one of those free advance screenings) is one of those movies where a big budget company grabs some obscure low-budget gem with cult fans and gives it this glossy sheen as if they're redeeming it. The original "Gone" was a low budget film in which a bunch of people who really liked car chases decided to make a whole film based around them. It was fun, and showed that the people earnestly were so into this stunt racing they wanted to do something interesting on film with it. It wasn't supposed to be a masterpiece, and it did it's job quite well. Ahhh..the wand of Hollywood has now graced us with this remake that is supposed to be "better" and more exciting because it's got all this nifty money behind it. And let's not forget star power. Unfortunately, this new version is so horribly shallow that audience members really ought to seriously THINK about stupid these filmmakers WANT you to be. Yes, the new stunt work is impressive, but it's all pap. These filmmakers want you to forget that someone in the 70's used blood, sweat and tears to get a movie made, and instead pay attention to their rock-video generation garbage. Gee..I can't wait until Hollywood next decides to "legitimize" yet another cult-fandom movie. Lets see a remake of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" with kooky Will Smith and *insert generic Tiger Beat star*!! Or how about a new, action-sequence laden remake of Rocky Horror that's turned into a "hip hoppin' comedy!" so it can now be "understood" by the masses with easy to remember, HIT soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Police officers looking to fill their speeding ticket quotas should simply camp outside any theatre showing GONE IN 60 SECONDS and wait. I found myself doing 90 MPH on the way home after the movie without even realizing it. This movie oozes that much adrenaline. It's beautifully shot. It's well-acted in almost every case. It features a great soundtrack of well-used music. The car chase scenes deliver big-time thrills. The cast is made up of a great blend of known players and faces you recognize from somewhere else. This is a pure summer roller coaster of a movie.Two complaints: I have no idea why Angelina Jolie was in this movie, except to act as eye candy for the motorhead guys in the audience. Her character didn't move the plot along one iota, and the love story between her and Cage only slowed an otherwise speedy script with a relationship I didn't buy for 30 seconds, let alone 60. Complaint #2: without giving anything away, the character who walks away from the big climax gets off WAAAY too easily. But those are minor annoyances in an otherwise fun ride. Just watch your lead foot as you leave the theatre.</fullReview>

But only a couple and they were not delivered by Nicolas Cage who seemed to have lost his sense of humor in this film, taking it all way too seriously. And Angelina Jolie... why?

Sure, the characters are superficial and the plot a bit contrived, but it packs plenty of bang for the buck.I've seen so many car chases over the years that I doubted this flick could break any new ground in that regard. However, the final chase is, indeed, breathtaking! Ya gotta love it!!Nicolas Cage is fine as the lead, however acting and dialog is not this film's strong suit.

The movie is on autopilot most of the time, it is full of cliché's and the screenplay is as shallow as can be.One of the hardest things to understand about this, a primarily commercial movie (I doubt it was made for any reason other than the box office) is that it doesn't utilize probably the best commercial asset it has: Angelina Jolie... She is a darling of the audience (especially male, whom this film is primarily targeting), but her appearances in the movie total no more than a couple of minutes...? Inexplicable.See it if you must, or if you are a total maniac for cars and car chases (there is one very good one in the movie, albeit lasting far too long for my taste), otherwise stay away from this film, it has absolutely nothing to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Car-stealing caper barely even scores style points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carjacking is generally a good time, but Dominic Sena manages to make it unexciting in "Gone in Sixty Seconds," a remake of the 1974 film. Aside from a good final chase, this film spends more time talking about stealing cars than actually doing it. At the least you'd expect a two-hour showcase of some beautiful automobiles, but you get cheated out of that too. Instead, you get a cast full of unfunny hollow characters running into problems trying to steal cars, and when they finally do, they last, well, sixty seconds.Sena, whose credits include working on Janet Jackson videos, is interested in ineffective style choices. It's expected in a movie about grand theft auto that there's going to be excessive glitz and a lot of visual dressing up of an average story line, but instead of adding exciting flare, Sena chooses to set things on fire in unwarranted places and set to cheesy electronic "let's wear leather and get in and out of cars" music.The story is pretty straightforward and the plot moves quickly despite a few holes. In it, Nicholas Cage, who's notorious for picking all kinds of projects good and terrible, stars as retired car thief Memphis Raines, who is brought out of retirement when his kid brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisy) gets in trouble with a big overseas car broker. The broker threatens to kill Kip if Memphis doesn't steal an order of 50 cars within three days. Memphis assembles a team of quirky thieves young and old to save his brother's life while a pair of detectives follow his trail.Infamous '90s action producer Jerry Bruckheimer has the right idea in getting this movie made, but the team of Sena and writer Scott Rosenberg (who wrote the Cage thriller "Con Air") just doesn't get the job done. It would have been perfectly acceptable for "Gone in Sixty Seconds" to be a high-adrenaline film for action junkies with a flimsy plot, maybe even hyper-masculinized, but we don't even get that. There's a great opportunity for the story to bring us into the world of car boosting, but we learn nothing about how a car is stolen other than brief images and dialogue. I don't think they had reason to believe everyone was going to start stealing cars with that information. But if nothing else were wrong, there's still no tension or sense of what's at stake. Kip, for some reason, is really cool about everything and it's his life is on the line, so if he doesn't care, why should we? The brother tension between him and Memphis is simply that, not a developed subplot by any means, nor is the sexual tension between Memphis and Sway, Angelina Jolie's character, who's reasons for helping with the mission appear to be to avert sexism. Robert Duvall and Chi McBride also play two-dimensional roles. Apparently the fact that Kip might die (even though he doesn't care) is good enough for everybody."Gone in Sixty Seconds" is mostly a predictable and conventional story line, but it's effectively so, helping keep our attention despite the film's complete lack of an edge. It gives just enough to convince its audience something exciting is coming and meets that expectation with average marks. But I don't even think a car-lover would find this more than marginally entertaining. ~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and Empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the eponymous cult classic, Gone in Sixty Seconds follows a ragtag group of car thieves - led by Nicolas Cage's Memphis Raines - as they attempt to steal 50 cars over a 72-hour time period. Director Dominic Sena infuses the movie with precisely the sort of glossy style that one expects from a Jerry Bruckheimer production, while screenwriter Scott Rosenberg peppers the story with a whole host of quirky characters and clever instances of dialog. The film is consequently entertaining but senseless; the inherent slickness of virtually every aspect of the production eventually becomes mind-numbing, and there comes a point at which one can't help but crave something (anything) of substance. Having said that, Gone in Sixty Seconds is certainly teeming with charismatic performances (Cage is at his oddball best here) and there's simply no denying the effectiveness of the climactic car chase that finds Raines on the run from dozens of determined cops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie will be a great movie, for those who want to be a thief. This movie has some great actors such as Nicolas Cage, but the content of the story is really bad that I can only label it as a bad movie!Firstly, the movie shows us a lot of skills for stealing cars and it teaches us that we can do something bad in order to save somebody! It gives a wrong concept to audiences that they can do something bad if they've a good excuse.Secondly, the movie has a lot of chasing scenes. I can't disagree that those chasing scenes are really exciting, but it is boring also. The police chase Cage after he has stolen some cars, but after his crew has also stolen a cars, they chase again. It is really boring!Thirdly, I don't know what are the uses of the appearance of Angelina Jolie in the movie. Is it that helping Cage to steal few cars and have some sex with Cage?Lastly, this movie used a lot of trick photography. I think the real thing is the most important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happened here? You have Nicholas Cage and Angelina Jolie along with a team of car thieves stealing 50 cars to save Nicholas Cage's brother. It involves escaping the crime scene, gangsters, shootouts, and evading the police.Sounds like a good time at the movies? To an extent, yes but this movie is only running on five cylinders instead of eight.The script and acting is probably the movie's main strength and the actors are good in there roles.Now for the not so good...We only get one big car chase, only one. And what really makes it an average chase is the overdone MTV style editing, the jerky camera movements, the music, and the use of a computer generated car on the last big stunt of the chase.Overall, it's an average movie worth a rental just to look at the cars, laugh at the jokes, and to look at Angelina Jolie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1974 original.Master car thief Memphis Raines has retired from the car theft business and has a legitimate job. However, his not so bright younger brother winds up in trouble when he fumbles a job for a powerful client. Raines and his crew must pick up the job to save his life, his brother's life, all while the police are hot on their tail.This big-budget star laden production has certain better elements than the original cheap production. There are good actors in all major roles, the film's non-action scenes are actually decently directed, and the overall feel is that of an overall competently made film. Don't let that fool you. The original may have been cheesy and pretty dumb, but at least it delivered exactly what it promised - high speed action and thoroughly enjoyable mayhem. It was dumb, but it was essentially a movie equivalent of a young boy playing with his toy cars and most guys can remember those fine days of childhood, which is precisely what made the original so fun.With this glossy production we are treated to an ridiculous plot involving the mob, recycled character angles about former lovers, and - the biggest disappointment - not ONE decent car chase. Not one.Zero. Zilch. Zip. Nada.There is some car action, especially in the end, but it is over so quickly and features none of the enjoyable ridiculousness of the original - only the cop cars crash, none of the crashes or stunts are at all intense or over the top, and this film actually tries to match a movie that has a forty minute car chase, but only manages to provide about 10 about minutes of car chase action.Looks good, but it's dull, slow, and yet another reason why Hollywood should stay away from remakes. 2/10Rated PG-13: violence and profanity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in 60 Seconds goes nowhere fast. There are a lot of good actors here (Nicholas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duval) but no script to back them. There were a few good acting scenes, but they were unconnected and just seemed to come together in a jumbled mess. Since this was billed as an action movie, one would expect that there would at least be some car chase scenes to curb the boredom, but there is very little action at all. There are some nice cars, but they are only seen in short glimpses so even car buffs would be disappointed. This movie has nothing good to offer to anyone. An example of the lame writing is an early scene (one of the only action scenes) where the police give chase with a dozen patrol cars and a police helicopter over one stolen Porsche. That city must have a lot of bored cops with nothing better to do. Definitely not worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes there are movies that surprise me with just how awful they are, and not only that - the reason why they are so awful may not even be apparent. "Gone in Sixty Seconds" looks on paper like a movie that should at least be entertaining enough while it lasts. And still i was bored to tears throughout.I love cars. I can admit that. I like watching cars, driving cars and movies about cars generally keep me entertained unless they really stink. And this movie really stinks. And yet it has almost everything. It has decent actors (Cage, Lindo, Duvall)and a big budget for instance. I wonder though if it had a script... Apparently this is a remake of a 70's movie and i'm not surprised. The basic idea is not that bad. Steal 50 cars really fast or your brother dies. Straightforward enough, and i can forgive the fact that the usually good Christopher Eccleston is perfectly pathetic as the villain.What i can't forgive though is the long and exceptionally boring car chases, the overworked dialog, the stupid mistakes and the pathetic lingo used in the whole movie. This isn't even light entertainment, how could it be when it's not in the least bit entertaining? I wonder sometimes at how some directors manage to remove all excitement from their action scenes. Paul W.S. Anderson is one of those, and the same trick is done here. No matter how many cars they crash or how fast they drive my pulse is still at the level where i'm barely alive.And barely alive is something you could use to describe this movie, it lacks pulse. Pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat enjoyable but still messy movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gone in Sixty Seconds" can be an enjoyable action movie as long as you don't take it too serious.The movie is professionally made but it still is very obvious that the script went trough many rewrites. The story feels at times messy and has some pointless action side-plot lines. Not everything in the movie feels connected with each other.It's somewhat a shame of the story because the movie had a very good cast that really could had made this movie an unforgettable one, had it had a better more coherent storyline. The cast is seriously filled with some big names; Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, Scott Caan, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant, Robert Duvall, Christopher Eccleston, Vinnie Jones. Every filmmaker can be jealous at a cast like this. Robert Duvall is especially excellent in his role but he seems a bit out of place in this movie. He simply is a too good actor to be in a movie like this. Why he ever agreed to do this movie, I will never understand.The movie does has some nice moments, especially the car chases. The movie is nicely edited by action movie specialists; Roger Barton, Chris Lebenzon, Tom Muldoon, without ever going really over-the-top. The movie is nothing memorable but it does provide some good entertaining moments and characters.For what it's worth, it's better than any of the two "The Fast and the Furious" movies. Why? Because at least it doesn't take itself as serious as those two movies do. At least "Gone in Sixty Seconds" is because of that reason still an enjoyable movie to watch, despite me rating it as lowly as I do. The fact that I'm rating it as low as I do has everything to do with the story aspects of the movie but nothing with the entertainment value it has.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big, big fan of the original "Gone in 60 Seconds" which, if you want to see some action, is the film to see, not this one. Too much attention is paid to Nicholas Cage, Angeline Jolie and hot, hot cars that no one in their right mind could steal or get away with stealing. When was the last Jaguar XJ228 theft you heard about? Impossible. The original had believable thefts and believable cars, but this stuff is unbelievable.Anyway, Nick does a good job in the acting department, I'll give him that, and Delroy Lindo is fantastic. Robert Duvall was good too and there were a few moments during that laughable final chase (again, see the original movie) that were quite exciting. I know today's cinema is all about people like Cage and Jolie, and cars like that (which some mobster as the one in the film wouldn't even know what to do with in reality), but I'm afraid I'm a poor old sap who's living in the past and prefers that classic, believable stuff like the original "Gone in 60 Seconds". This ain't classic. Bruckheimer just wanted to release another huge action flick, I think, and to hell with the story! Sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this has to be one of the best Nick Cage movies I've ever seen! With an all-star cast including Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duvall, and Angelina Jolie you can't go wrong with this movie.There are some cheesy scenes I will admit. But to keep the storyline going with romance and car chases this has to be admitted.A remake from the 1974 movie is one of the few remakes that is greatly better than the original. The final car sequence with it jumping over 150-200 yards of back-up is slightly overdone but still get's your blood pumping. Fast action coupled with funny one-liners make this a great movie. Any one looking for a fast action movie with sexy cars and tons of adrenaline pumping in your veins you came to the right movie.Ending criticism: If you like car chase/action movies this is one to get your blood pumping! (Two thumbs up!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mid-level Bruckheimer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Bruckheimer pantheon, this is isn't as bad as Armageddon or Bad Boys II but neither is it as good as The Rock (if these movies can be compared). I remember I saw this back in 2000 right after I saw MI:2. That film is a masterpiece compared to this. Maybe it was the source material but novice director Sena didn't appear to be inspired and the talented cast seemed to be in this simply for a paycheck. The film has no artistic merit. There are a few exotic autos though. All in all, a film that will be "gone in sixty seconds" after you view it. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Randall Raines (Nicholas Cage) is called back to duty after retiring from a life of fast cars and fast times when his younger brother, Kip, gets into trouble with a big-time car thief. He has to steal fifty top of the line cars in twenty-four hours, or his brother will be killed. They decide to get their old crew together, including his long lost lover (Angelina Jolie), to get started on the biggest boost any of them had ever done. The cops are closing in, and they have just begun this wild ride. In a vicious circle of cars and love, Randall Raines will have to avoid the cops and get these `ladies' on a ship leaving for South America. They have to hunt the cars down from people's homes, dealerships, and even the police impound yard. Every car has a name, and the most famous is `Eleanor', which is Randall's unachievable steal. Will Eleanor make it to the deadline? I think the reason that director Dominic Sena made this movie is because people really underestimate the car thieving business. People in small towns generally mistake how serious the problem has become in larger cities. The thieves are more educated about their hobby, and people are becoming more susceptible to the problems. These people aren't your stereotypical teenage boys out joyriding; these are very smart guys who know how to tap into the DMV files, get in and out of warehouses undetected, and usually have someone from inside the dealership working for them. Crime isn't just from poor kids in trashy neighborhoods anymore. This has become a job like any other. I enjoyed this film because it was a look into the problems of big cities while I am living amongst cornfields. It was a pretty fast paced movie, and it had my attention the first few times I watched it. Times have changed, and car boosting has become a sport. I liked the cars in the movie because they ranged from classic mob style cars to classic muscle cars, from Ferraris to Porches. It was fun to see the fast cars and the techniques used to boost them. I would suggest this movie to anyone who appreciates cars - the `ladies' are hot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool cars, badly played out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a major dissapointment. Of course it was produced by the notorious Jerry Bruckheimer, also known for "Pearl Harbor" and "Kangaroo Jack" (Both classics...ha ha). Immediately after finding out he had produced this movie, even before seeing it I knew the movie was not going to be too good. The cars were cool and so was the idea, but the writing was terrible. The perfect example of this was the dialogue between the Rains' brothers when Memphis tells his little bro why he steals cars. I almost crapped my pants laughing so hard at the horrible script. If you like cool cars and stupid movies see this flick I give it a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After recently viewing this movie for the first time, I couldn't help but compare it with the superior "fast and the furious" which came out a year after "60 seconds" was released.Being a Nicolas Cage fan I couldn't be to hard on the film. I like the scenes in his movies where he's stressed out, under pressure, talking in the hyper tone, and flailing his arms, its hilarious. The rest of the actors did an okay job also. Some points in the plot were not very well thought of, some characters were kinda cheesy, and I wanted the cars to have a more important role in the film rather than the just break in and steal'em bit. They don't even show how the heck they broke into the warehouses!!! I mean come on, thats half the fun.This is definitely a "check your brain at the door" film but it has its moments. If your into watching luxury and muscle cars being chased down streets by incompetent cops who seem to purposely crash into other vehicles then this movie is a good flick to rent. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Need for Speed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with this movie was the lack of real automotive verve and the fact that Nicholas Cage is a horribly uncharismatic actor. I loved how it started off with the excellent credit sequence with the pounding blues song, shattering of glass and the roar of the engines as they sped away underneath flashing city lights. And then cage shows up, and all energy immediately drained from this film. I think the fact that they made the thefts have to be so in-and-out covert that they lost the fun in what should have been a movie full of purring engines, rampant (aka MORE THEN ONE) car chases, and vehicular jocularity. I mean for crissakes this movie is about STEALING CARS not going grocery shopping. Other then the chase with eleanor near the end of the movie it was just, boost the car, next shot driving into the dockyards to deliver the cars. I mean cmon now, even though I only got brief glimpses of the amazing machines these people are stealing I still was in awe of them. This movie called for, no DEMANDED, more time spent on the power of these cars. Cage's character himself says he steals cars for the joy of it and not the money, so let's SEE IT. And Cage, it would help if you could act above your nose, I don't think I saw him even scrunch up his forehead or blink his eyes during this movie. To make a bad pun, this movie's potential was Gone in 60 Seconds</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 out of 10Gone in Sixty Seconds should have been a fast-paced, no-holds barred thrill ride with one mile-a-minute car chase after another. Why then, is the movie a complete bore with hardly any action in sight? This is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, so certain adrenaline rush expectations must be met. I almost fell into a stupor watching this silly bore. Poor performances, an uninteresting story, total idiocy (our "heroes" don't bother trying to skip town or strike a deal with the police), and a complete lack of action make this a dud, the worst Bruckheimer production in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No plot, but a lot of action and slick "gags" highlight, "Gone in 60 Seconds," which is about how long it takes to figure out that Nicholas Cage probably got a sizeable paycheck with little effort for this forgettable action flick.Production values, cast and, a somewhat interesting litany of vignettes are arranged around some really nice automotive machinery, screeching tires and, breaking glass. The on-screen visuals really are first-rate with masterful stunt work and driving.Beyond that, even Delroy Lindo's and Robert DuVall's "cool" cannot entertain enough to mollify the film's obvious transparency. And, Vinnie Jones' character might have been exploited beyond the cursory with good effect, but it was not to be.There is nothing to sink one's teeth into in, "Gone in 60 Seconds," excepting perhaps Angelina Jolie and, a really cool "Boss 429" Mustang used in the predictable climax and, 60 seconds is about how long it will take the viewer to forget this shiny, albeit shallow, and contrived experience.</fullReview>

And I don't need a great plot. I've enjoyed plenty of action films with vacuous plots, if they're campy and not overwhelmingly stupid.But, despite can't-fail actors Nicholas Cage and Angelina Jolie, "Gone in Sixty Seconds" fell flat. Surprisingly the plot is quite slow, scattered, and there isn't much tension. Ho hum! So what if the protagonist has a "bad vibe" about a certain type of classic car.Take it from me -- this was my kind of movie -- skip it. And skip "The Fast and the Furious", which is ever stupider.Who should see this film:-- nobody, even if you've been seduced by the promos.

None of that matters, one person stole the damn show. Ms.Jolie was great as Sarah Sway Wayland. She acted like a tomboy which was cool. She was very young in the film to be involved with Cage.

But, just because a film doesn't use CG so much doesn't make it good.They used music so many times that it seemed like they had every rap song on there. Now, about the twist in the end: Where was it? Instead of having it be a bit confusing (see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), they make it too predictable. (Spoiler: If my guess is correct, a policeman whose life got saved by Nicolas Cage lets him go just because of "brotherly love"-this guy likes the Lawrence Brothers. My brother says it is that a car got fixed. Yeah, that is a "twist.)Moral: Focus more on stuff like story instead of music and CG. But you actlike its dead. Strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in 60 seconds is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I use the word movie very losely. I can't find anything that can ever save this movie in a million years. The plot is weak, the entire cast seems to be like zombies on an acid trip. Even Nicholas Cage who is a very talented actor in many movies just walked his way through this one. Giovanni Ribisi whose best performance I've ever seen was in Saving Private Ryan gave a performance that was even worse than the girlfriend on Godzilla. Let's just say noone gave an honest effort in the entire movie.Not only am I disapointed in Cage's performance, but also I'm surprised that this is even a Jerry Bruckheimer film. I have loved every Jerry Bruckheimer film (including Armageddon and it's many flaws) until this waste of good talent was released. Since Top Gun and Days of Thunder, I have been hooked on the whole series of films produced by him and it's a shame I had to see such talent go to waste. If you want to see a great example of Bruckheimer's talent, watch Crimson Tide.Another problem I have with this movie is that there are no real villains because the whole movie is about car theft. The only people in the movie who are not villains are the two cops trying to track the car thieves down. I'm sorry but extremely nice cars and chases involving at least a couple thousand cars do not make a good movie. Anyway I give this monstrocity 0 out of #### stars.</fullReview>

And, as it turns out, there was not a single likeable character in the movie.The previews seemed to be all about the "love of fast cars," but we don't get enough of that feel.Take it to the junk yard...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** Boring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even by the standards of the adrenaline-heavy Jerry Bruckheimer action films this one still falls very short. Nicolas Cage plays a retired car thief who is suckered back into the business for one night when he has to steal twenty (or was it thirty?) cars to save his brother (Giovanni Ribisi) from being murdered by a vicious gangster (Christopher Eccleston). Trouble with this setup is that Ribisi is such an unlikable idiot that if he were my brother I'd be glad that someone else was willing to do me the favour of getting rid of him. The car chases are exciting, but so brief and overly edited that they are completely ineffectual, leaving the story's lame and mostly useless character development hanging out in the open. Angelina Jolie is criminally wasted as a ex-thief who never even gets to steal a car on her own-this is a bona fide action hero, people!</fullReview>

As usual, Nicolas Cage sucks the big one, Angelina Jolie seems to be there merely for her bad hairdo and pouty lips, and Giovanni Ribisi...well, he is usually good, but this movie was obviously beneath his talents.

		<fullReview>I don't know what movie these other reviewers saw, maybe they accidentally rented the 1974 version (which was an action movie)? This is another character-interplay "chick flick" disguised as an action movie. I wound up begging, screaming at the screen, "Please, some action, any action, just have someone even drive a car, anything!" I can see the conversation between the director and producer in my mind -- "Gee, do I have to show them actually stealing the cars? Can't we just show them back fresh from the theft and let them tell the story in their eyes?" This is an unbearable, slow, almost actionless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always thought that if you were going to remake something, you would at least try to make it bigger and better but this is not the case. The original Gone In 60 Seconds had a paper thin plot and real lousy acting but at least it had a super entertaining, 40 minute car chase where 200 or more cars get smashed. The new Nicholas Cage version has a paper thin plot, really bad acting and a short unimpressive chase scene. So what the hell is the point of redoing it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with, I cannot believe Nicolas Cage got paid 20 million for this film. Don't get me wrong, I quite like him as an actor but all he does is stand around and play the concerned older brother. His emotions range from serious to even more serious. He spends long periods of time staring straight ahead as if in deep thought. To watch someone as rich as him taking an easy pay check like that was a little disheartening.The script in this film was predictably poor. It was as if they just got the "slackers guide to making an action movie" booklet and followed it word for word.Family member in trouble? CHECKOld pro reluctantly comes back to what he does best? CHECKDialogue that makes the actors seem like narrators? CHECKPointless romantic Interest? CHECKNot even remotely scary Bad Guy? CHECKCamera angles that mean you can't even see the action properly? CHECKVinnie Jones as impossibly hard nutcase? CHECKYou now know exactly what I think of this film. I am sure to attract many of the old "It's action! just sit back and enjoy it!" comments. This is something I have been hearing more of and it is starting to disturb me. I struggled to stay awake in this film. An action film should have me on the edge of my seat. I do not watch a film intentionally for dialogue but poor dialogue sticks out like a sore thumb. The less said about the script, the better. I imagine that only very young people(I might have liked this when I was about 11) or car enthusiasts would enjoy this. Even if you are usually a fan of good action films as I am, this ranks nowhere near the top.I was told that Angelina Jolie looked 'hot' in this film. That is probably the worst I have ever seen her. I shall not comment on Robert Duvall's appearance in this film out of respect for his previous performances.</fullReview>

It's just a movie where they put awesome cars and car chases in it and don't care about plot, characters, or even acting for that matter. You wait an hour to see some car chases and then they aren't even exciting. What happened to pomp? What happened to suspense? What happened to quality?The cast is amazingly incredible. Three Oscar winners and not a drop of talent. Don't get me wrong, the actors have tremendous talent. But the acting in this movie is like watching cardboard on screen for two hours. I expected to see some awesome car chases and didn't. They were so disappointing. And was the subplot with the dog necessary? No. Not even close to necessary.The only real neat part is, well... actually I'm drawing a blank. I can't think of any! That is how memorable it is.

They would have shown "The Godfather" on TV, which I guess is a movie of far higher quality, but sitting in the theatre with a coke and some pop corn I really enjoyed "Gone in Sixty Seconds". My friends expected a lot and where most disappointed afterwards but I ignored the stupid plot full of clichés and Nicolas Cage's overacting by absorbing the fine atmosphere of the music and the lighting and by watching Angelina Jolie who looks really good with that new hairdressing.

		<shortDescription>Action, And One Long Car Chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High-voltage, testosterone-driven, non-stop action highlight `Gone In 60 Seconds,' directed by Dominic Sena, and starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie. Top car thief Memphis Raines (Cage) retired from the life once he awoke to the fact that all of his friends were either dead or in jail. But the main reason was that he wanted to keep his younger brother, Kip (Giovnni Ribisi), from following in his footsteps. Now, six years later, Kip is in trouble; he's become a car thief anyway, and when he botches a `boost' big time, the man he works for (Christopher Eccleston) brings big brother back to make amends. He gives Memphis seventy-two hours to deliver fifty cars, of specific make and model, or he will kill Kip. By the time Memphis gets his old crew together, including Sway (Jolie), the girl he left behind when he retired, and scopes out the cars he'll need to boost, he has one night in which to do it. And if all fifty, and not one less, are not there by 8:00 a.m., Kip dies. There's not much story here, not nearly enough to warrant the star power involved, but if you're into fast cars, and the sound of a revving engine does it for you, this movie will keep your attention. For Cage, the character of Memphis isn't much of a stretch; none of the characters are for any of the actors, for that matter, as they're basically one dimensional, and nothing you haven't seen before in just about any action movie ever made. To give credit where it's due, however, they all do their best with what they're given, and actually bring a level of credibility to the overall proceedings. Jolie looks good, as always, but her talent is wasted here, as her part is, basically, nothing more than window dressing. Rounding out the excellent supporting cast are Robert Duvall (Otto), Delroy Lindo (Detective Castlebeck), Will Patton (Atley), Chi McBride (Donny), Vinnie Jones (The Sphinx), and Scott Caan (Tumbler). There's plenty of great action sequences in this film, many of which will keep you on the edge of your seat, and Sena keeps the tension high throughout with the help of a driving soundtrack and some good editing. The big question is, of course, will Memphis make it in time? Which gives it the suspense it needs to keep it at least somewhat interesting, for there is just enough unpredictability in the story to keep you guessing as to what the final outcome will be. `Gone In 60 Seconds' is basically one long car chase, with one bit, especially, leading up to the climax, that would make Evel Knievel proud. All in all, this movie is a lot like cotton candy; it's not a meal that's going to satisfy your hunger, but if that's what you're in the mood for, you might as well go for the best there is, the kind that's sweet and melts in your mouth. And if that's where you are, and that's what you're hungry for, you've come to the right place. I rate this one 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERSThere's a parallel universe out there where Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark, edgy, controversial independent movie. Unfortunately in this dimension Gone... is a flashy, vacuous, testosterone-fuelled moronfest starring Nicolas Cage.For reasons not really worth getting into, he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, only one of which has an alarm. This crew consists of the guy with the funny-shaped ears who's rumoured to be the new Superman; a guy who conducted electricity in The X-Files; an ex-professional footballer and two token black men.Their enemies are cops, rival car thieves and Bilborough from Cracker, his Manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for American audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since Daphne in Frasier. There's also Angelina Jolie, who gets no character; save to be a receptacle to men's sexual desires. She and Cage are supposed to be old flames, which is odd, as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the film's overlong 135m running time.In fact, characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a "moment" a violin plays in the background to accentuate the "emotion". It's no spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous Paul Gasgoine "hand ball" manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent) only gets one line; not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the film's dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny. Allegedly. After he struggles through it in his "not-quite-acting-but-it'll-do" London drawl, Cage quips "I always thought you were from Long Island". My ribs, as you might imagine, were well and truly tickled.In fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect, from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters. This sees the biggest aspect of Hollywood take hold; why is it that a black man cannot appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it? The younger man, who, like the elder, jive-talks for the whole duration, proclaims: "us black people don't like the cold ... we're tropical people". He then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch Roots. He is, of course, parodying the image of black people, but how funny is that? His older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself, and thereby his colour, in third person. "My black ass" this, "my black ass" that. Does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that? Thought not.The film's soundtrack is played almost non-stop and with increasing volume, some of the tracks - especially Apollo 440's "Don't Stop The Rock" - so loud they're actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue. The surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together. No background music concept here, it's the aural equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their stereo turned up full blast. "Keep that music down, young man!"This isn't the worst film in the world and in many ways I enjoyed it. It's just that it's predictable, lazy and witless, with minimal effort in its construction. Apparently box office expectations are considerably down for this movie. After being force-fed junk for several years it appears the general public are starting to wake up to the fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put this movie was amazing. I won't go into any heavy details on the plot but, come on, jaw-dropping action, spectacular performances, a clear yet complex plot, and directing so above the bar it's touching the stratosphere, this movie is a thrill to watch again and again; and I didn't even count the inclusion of Angelina Jolie! Angelina is startlingly beautiful and seductive, with moments of wit and comedy throughout. She is a joy to watch and not simply as a pleasure to the eyes but as a treat for the soul. Her on screen chemistry with Nic Cage can only be described as "intense" as both actors seem on the break of real and pretend emotions. Nic Cage as always is brilliant and his pace and delivery are more thrilling than an adrenaline shot to the heart. I recently saw the trailer to Nic's next thriller "Trespass" and I've gotta to admit the amount of heart-racing action brought on a euphoric wave of nostalgia. Check out the trailer and then personally thank me for changing your life. http://on.fb.me/pchomT If you enjoy being entertained, GET THIS MOVIE.

		<fullReview>I actually never wanted to see this movie because I thought it would have been a rip off to the Fast and the Furious movies. Then I realized, this movie came out first. Also I read the cast list and I realized that I should see this.This is a remake off the 1974 original. The story is about Memphis Raines who has to steal fifty cars in three days in order to spare the life of his younger brother, Kip. Meanwhile, he has to avoid the pesky detectives who are bent on catching him.The acting is pretty good. Nic Cage is an underrated actor and I don't see why so many people give him grief. Angelina Jolie of course is pretty smoking hot. Duvall is a great actor and will always be.Overall, this movie is full of adrenaline and speed though not as much as the Fast and the Furious. I though it was better than anticipated. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

Nicolas Cage plays a retired car thief whose younger brother screwed up a car boost and now Cage, along with his old partners and the kid's gang, has to steal 50 hard-to-find cars in order to save the kid's life. Great cars, a great final chase scene involving a 67 Shelby GT 250 flying like no car ever could, but it doesn't matter. If you're looking for a movie where you don't have to think too hard (or at all, for that matter), and if you enjoy cars, then this movie is right up your street.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think i need to see original one to convince me out of this low impression about this film. But hey! Why to waste time?Although acting wasn't as bad as the script. I guess that all about this film is about re-heating a classic, like "Starsky &amp; Hutch" or "Shaft" or you name it Hollywood remake. For those out there that really saw the original in it's time, there might be something here, but for "modern"/"urban" young adult, as i consider myself, there's not enough to call this really anything else than poor entertainment. Not putting entertainment down.. Vice versa, good entertainment needs to carry out some form of class, or should i say even entertaining value. Personally, i got nothing but pity for Mr. Cage, who's one of my favorite actors.But hey! These movies come as 13 in dozen, and still they are best way to waste any weekday's boring evening.For those of you who might consider yourself more in need for intellectual stuff to watch, grab yourself a copy of Luis Bunuel's The Brute.I'll have to give this "gone in 60 seconds" a three star review, because it's worth of three star review.Entertainment, but not at it's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst Gone In Sixty seconds has a pretty fabulous cast and an acceptably punchy plot, I simply cannot forgive the glaring technical inaccuracies.Now, I'm not the sort of person who would usually let a bit of "artistic licence" get in the way of my enjoyment of a motion picture, but this movie really stretched my tolerance for the portrayal of all things automotive.1) None of the cars being stolen seemed to have any kind of steering column lock. Why is this? 2) The entry method to many of these exotic vehicles was laughably unrealistic.3) Why did none of these (very expensive) cars have engine immobilisers? Basic Fords have such devices! 4) The ludicrous "Nitrous Oxide boost" scene, where Cage "jumps" a huge set of roadworks without trashing the car and/or killing himself was, for me, where this movie "jumped the shark" (no pun intended).My friend and I watched this film, squinting and squirming all the way through at the chronic lack of attention to detail.It just isn't good enough to rely on a good cast and shiny cars to carry an entire movie. Some kind of research into car theft might have been a good start... Hire an ex-car thief as a consultant, maybe.It's not rocket science. A (potentially) good movie ruined by lazy direction and production.4 stars (out of 10) from me, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

And what a STUPID ending!I used to like Nicholas Cage, he made a believable drunk/waster/no-good brother/Elvis - these are the roles to which he was suited. (Raising Arizona is one of my favourite films).Then he began thinking he was Bruce Willis (One's enough, thanks).The sheer preposterousness of his more recent offerings beggars belief, and now I hear he's in a remake of THE WICKER MAN!

The chase at the end should have been good considering the buildup (Which sucked anyway). Don't waste your time. To those who enjoyed it, shame on you for accepting another Bruckheimer mess.

And the formula-over the top Dukes of Hazzard/A-Team style action, good guys win, baddies get it spectacularily at the end, etc. Some attempt at family connections here too.This was better than I thought it would be, but then again so were the Rock and Con-Air. Cage was fine. It was the kinda hit he needed after 'Bring Out Yer Dead', '8 MM' and whatever else have come and gone. He needs to get back to some serious acting though, I think we've all seen he can do action now, it's not like he has anything left to prove.Angela Jolie wasn't on all that much, mailed in her performance and frankly needs to eat something on a regular basis.

		<fullReview>Tick... tick... tick... 50 cars, 72 hours. You do the math. Nicholas Cage plays a retired car thief (!) who is forced to pull One Last Job because the local hood with the obligatory indecipherable Anglo-Saxon Euro-trash accent will kill his brother. This plot DOES seem familiar, like the boxer coming out of retirement for One Last Fight or the guy who's been released from jail but has to pull off One Last Heist to satisfy some lowlife. Anyway, there's your plot. The man's promised 50 cars to some other lowlife, and naturally no one around can steal them as quickly as the now-retired Memphis Raines (Cage). Oh, he's clean now. Yep, works at a lonely gas station. He's in charge of the go-carts. This is what goes for a car thieves' retirement home in Hollywood.Undaunted, Raines calls in his old cronies. Oops, that one's dead. Oops, that one's absconded with money to Florida. Oops, that one went with him. And so the list dwindles, and he's forced to deal with his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) and his own little gang of would-be thieves. Oh, and there's Robert Duvall, playing the usual Old Man of the Gang, the Voice of Reason; and Angelina Jolie, the requisite ex-flame of Memphis - reluctantly, she agrees to help. Surprisingly, there's unfinished business between them!I'll leave it to you to decide whether Raines gets the job done. But in between there are about a million car crashes, a few good throwaway lines, and of course the equation of stealing automobiles to sex. If this movie had been released in the 1970's (and believe it or not, there WAS a movie called Gone in Sixty Seconds that came out in 1974), the trailer for it would contain words like Thrills! Chills! And Spills! There are a few quirky things tossed into the script like so many red herrings before, but they're only there to make the movie look different than any other cheesy car chase film from the 1950's to the presentAs for the acting, it's a mixed bag. Duvall's his usual stalwart self, although he does seem to be playing the same patriarchal roles over and over. Jolie isn't as prominent as I would have expected, but I think this was filmed before her Oscar-winning turn in Girl, Interrupted. And Cage? Well, Nic Cage CAN act when he wants to. Here, I assume he didn't want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the french say... Bof! What a hole! Alright, so Brukheimer is saving money for "Pearl Harbor" and couldn't spend much in this one like in "Armageddon", but hey, this is extremely a fraud movie. From all the marketing and trailers, we get the supposed idea: Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and the beautiful Eleanor engage in a series of incredible car chases, since Bruckheimer is the greatest action master. The film opens nicley, and you think "the best is yet to come, right?". Then, the payoff: 45 minutes of dull, slow and unexciting car robbing, and the maximum speed obtained is 40 mph. In the end, probably to apologize, they make a nice car chase so that people think: "oh, it's great". But the damn car chase is so trivial you don't get excited at all. Fraud, fraud, fraud and even more fraud. They steal cars, and they don't deliver anything. What a loser! Even Jolie isn't cool. And the film is a disappointment, one of many like "Con Air". Helás! Bof!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in 60 Seconds is by far the worst film and remake ever made. The story itself was not the best, and the dialogue was completly pointless. The acting from Nicolas Cage could not have been worse. As for Angelina Jolie, not only did she look horendous, as acted awfully too. Robert Devall's scenes were very slowly paced, and the music was just plain awful. The sound wasn't great either. As for the directing, I can't see how his style changed from Kalifornia to this. It was the most disappointing film ever. You could tell that the film was going to be long just from the title credits, and as the end credits started to roll I realised that half the theater had walked out in the middle of the film, just like I should have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers)Wow. I never thought I'd long to see a Micheal Bay film, but Bay's dreadful opus's have one thing that this movie does not-they aren't BORING. Corny, hackneyed, and full of way too many explosions, yes. But boring, no. This limp noodle of a film was so dull that I stopped watching halfway through out of sheer ennui. All of the characters were like eighth graders walking through a script for their junior high glee club drama. It was strictly by the numbers, and most of them(especially Cage) seemed half asleep. The car thefts and chases aren't even very exciting.The worst acting award has to be split between Delroy Lindo's plodding cop and Giovanni Ribisi's drugged out slimy younger brother, who acted like he'd been sucking Robitussen by the gallon full before going on set. Christopher Eccleston was totally wasted in his cameo, as is the dynamic former English footballer Vinnie Jones as the mute Sphinx. Very seldom have I seen so much acting talent wasted in such a spectacular way. And there's Cage too, of course;) If this is a popcorn movie, then it's burnt popcorn.</fullReview>

This "remake" has little in common with the original. This movie shows very few cars, wastes all of its time on uninteresting characters, and ends with a LAME 4 minute car chase. Meanwhile, the cast plays their roles like a bunch of cardboard cut-outs. This was a TOTAL waste of time.</fullReview>

Nicolas Cage plays, well Nicolas Cage pretty well (I KNOW he's supposed to be Memphis Raines, but lets not be pedantic)What's wrong with this film? absolutely everything! Hello? this was originally a car-chase film....not ANY car chase film, simply the best that had ever been seen in 1974. That's why it was a monstrous cinematic hit...everyone was talking about it and queuing at the box office TWO sessions ahead to see it! (I was one of them). What the hell was this? a two hour talk-fest with some token action at the beginning and the most disappointing of climactic chases lasting barely 8 minutes and culminating in the most underwhelming of digitised jumps you ever saw. H B Halicki, the producer and star of the original would be turning in his grave. Also, classic car or not, Cage's Shelby Mustang cannot hold a candle to the formidable Yellow Mach 1 in the '74 original!It would appear 90% of IMDb reviewers have not seen the original, I don't think half of them even knew there WAS one. Probably just as well! Utter screaming disappointment to be marked down as yet another pointless and frivolous remake!</fullReview>

So these days he merely creates stylish movies with no story structure. While I have never seen the original I will still recommend that you watch that film instead because it couldn't possibly be any worse than this hip pop-culture modern version.

		<shortDescription>One of the year's worst action pictures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ****Well, after a great start to 2000's summer season with the rousing epic Gladiator and the exhilarating Mission: Impossible II, summer films had a very sluggish June, particularly with the release of Gone in 60 Seconds, which is the worst Bruckheimer-produced action film yet, surpassing ConAir. That's disappointing, too, considering the great cast involved and the possibilities for some exciting car chases.Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) is a former L.A. car thief who has given up the life of crime. Unfortunately, his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) has taken up after him, and is now in trouble with a crime lord (Christopher Eccleston). In order for his brother's safety, Raines must steal 50 cars in 3 days. For help, he recruits some of his old gang. As they slowly map out their plan for the steal, a cop and enemy of Raines (Delroy Lindo) becomes suspicious of Raines sudden arrival and begins to tail him. Now, Raines must thwart the police and manage to retrieve all 50 cars.I suddenly realized after 20 minutes that Bruckheimer films have gone to an all-new low in intelligence. Gone in 60 Seconds features a clunker of a script, especially when you realize that the villains have actually let his brother go, defeating the whole purpose of using him as a hostage. Hmm, makes you wonder how Eccleston's character could have possibly ever become a crime lord with the street smarts he has. Like two other Bruckheimer action films-The Rock and Armageddon-this one also features a ticking clock, yet the whole process is ruined by the fact the clock ticks to nothing, simply because those bad guys can't off Ribisi because they don't have him hostage.I know some people will say that intelligence is a rather moot point in an action film of this sort, but Gone is also a very dull film. The setup, which goes on for an hour, is about 35 minutes longer than it needs to be, and a subplot involving a rival car-thieving gang is virtually pointless (with the exception of one good laugh involving a truck chained to a car). Plus, the scenes where they actually steal the cars are quite boring. Who'd have ever thought hot-wiring cars could be portrayed as being this unexciting.Believe it or not, the movie only has one car chase. To be fair, it's actually a fairly good one despite many implausibilities (at that point, I was willing to let anything keep me awake), but considering the fact that it comes about 95 minutes too late, it can't save a movie that's already borderline awful (for me, this movie came VERY close to *). What's most disappointing must be the cast. Nicolas Cage is average as Memphis Raines, playing basically Cameron Poe again without the souther accent. But my real comment is, what's up with the hair, Nic? Delroy Lindo is better as the cop after him. Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duvall, and Angelina Jolie are absolutely nonexistent. They look bored, which is a handicap considering the fact that all 3 together add up to a rather substantial amount of screentime. If they're bored by the proceedings, what are the chances the audience won't be?Domini Sena is a director with a flair for...well, virtually nothing innovative. There are a couple of exciting moments in the car chase, particularly with Cage driving backwards and on the wrong lane, but there's nothing novel about that. Gone actually has a rather murky look, though it seems as if though Sena is aiming for something flashy and enticing. The effect is the exact opposite. I can't really lay too much blame on Sena, since there's equal fault in the script from Scott Rosenberg. Apparently, the man can't even write in some decent one-liners to liven up the proceedings. So what you have is an action film low on action, charimsatic performances, and humor, which basically makes the video or DVD not much better than a doorstop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cut to what chase?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one who saw the original in a local drive-in back in the '70s, I was awaiting this remake with almost breathless anticipation. A cult crash classic, reworked by Jerry Bruckheimer? With the widow of the original's auteur on board? I was ecstatic.And boy, was I disappointed. No, strike that. I haven't left a theater in such a state since The Blair Witch fiasco (and I don't wanna hear about it, either). All Jerry &amp; Co. had to do here was set up the plot and let the cars run. In the original, the chase runs some 40 minutes, the cars at breakneck speed. In this atrocity, the chase seemed to run less than five (ok, maybe ten), and the cars barely seemed to hit second gear. Sure, you get the obligatory LA river/reservoir tour (like we hadn't had our fill of THAT yet: Grease, To Live &amp; Die in LA, T2, CHiPs and so on and so on), wherein we're expected to buy a Shelby pulling 140 through standing water without hydroplaning, but what else was there? NOTHING! They drove NOWHERE, and worse yet, SHOWED US NOTHING. Not until halfway through Cage's Sunday drive did Director Dominic Sena see fit to give us a long or overhead shot so we could see what was happening.But then again, who came to see real driving? Apparently, if you ask Sena, none of us, since he chooses - IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHASE - to cut away to a heart-to-heart between Cage's idiot brother and friend. Now, had the revelation imparted at that particular moment been unexpected or at very least of any substance - say, along the lines of those in Citizen Kane, Psycho, The Crying Game, A Few Good Men, and the like - then it MAY have been excusable. But the exchange here is absolutely pathetic.HEY, IT'S AN ACTION MOVIE, REMEMBER? Admittedly, action movies become truly exceptional action movies when the creators take the time to create &amp; present real characters with real conflicts and real emotions. BUT YOU DON'T CUT FROM THE ACTION TO DO IT!Imagine Mel Gibson bonding with the Feral Kid in the cab of the tractor-trailer during the climactic chase in The Road Warrior, as cars clip, collide, and crash in the background. Didn't happen, did it? Nope, once you cut to the chase, you stick to the chase. George Miller knew this basic tenet of action filmmaking and stuck to it. And this in a movie that made Time magazine's top 10 list upon release!And to cop out at the end with a digital car stunt is just profane. If I were a stunt professional, I'd be on the picket line tomorrow.Here's to PEARL HARBOR. At least Michael Bay knows what he's doing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review may contain some spoilers.The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well. Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well. But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable. For those who don't know, the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them. But even with a change to nearly every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 version that made it great. The one in this version is watered down, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase. Where the original chase was very believable, the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase film, fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake.</fullReview>

The acting was spotty at best, although Nicolas Cage tried to uphold his part. The plot line was standard Hollywood pablum, with absolutely no surprises and characters that were no thicker than their "slim-jims". Even the chase scenes were poor - predictable and too much visual noise to easily follow what was going on. Angelina Jolie, who has received a lot of positive press lately, was barely able to hold on to her character. Considering the cast, this had the potential to be an excellent movie.As it stands, Gone in 60 Seconds may well describe how long this movie lasts in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in Sixty Seconds is set in Long Beach in California where car thief Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) gets caught while stealing a Porsche, the guy he was working for Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) is not happy. Atlee Jackson (Will Patton) tracks down Kip's brother, the legendary car thief Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage) &amp; tells him that Calitri wants to kill his brother Kip. Memphis confronts Calitri who says Kip was hired to boost fifty cars &amp; that he has a buyer waiting for them, with only four days left Calitri demands Memphis steal the fifty cars instead or he will kill Kip. Memphis has no choice but to agree &amp; gets together a gang of thieves to try &amp; steal fifty cars in less than four days which has never been done before...Directed by Dominic Sena this was a big budget Hollywood remake of the action film Gone in 60 Seconds (1974) &amp; while I have not seen the original one I can't imagine this being much better as I thought it was pretty average, available as both a theatrical cut &amp; a director's cut which runs ten minutes longer I will be basing my comments on the shorter theatrical version. The one overriding factor that I disliked about Gone in Sixty Seconds is how soulless &amp; casual it is, in this film nice cars are just seen as things to steal &amp; no thought is given to the consequences or the victims at all. In fact at one point a thief is asked if he feels sorry for the victims &amp; he just says 'hell no'. Well, having your car stolen is a big deal &amp; is very distressing &amp; this film treats the matter with disdain &amp; like it's cool to steal cars with no regard to the consequences. The character's are poor, they are empty &amp; shallow &amp; unlikable, from the idiotic Kip to the annoying gang of thieves that range from a mute to a black comedy relief gangster to an old level headed professional. The dialogue is bad, the scene on Kip's porch as Memphis tries to explain the allure of stealing cars &amp; make it sound sexy is cringe worthy as is the scene in which these care free thieves entertain each other by car related film &amp; TV trivia &amp; the discussion Memphis has with his mother is also a complete misfire. The ending is a disaster too, so the cop &amp; the criminal find some mutual respect for each other &amp; the cop lets Memphis go but what about all the other car thieves? What about the rest of the police force? Did they just forget about Memphis &amp; all the damage he caused &amp; all the cars he stole? The plot could have made for a great action thriller &amp; is the only thing the film has going for it but even that is stolen from another film so I really find it difficult to recommend Gone in Sixty Seconds apart from a couple of half decent action scenes, some unintentionally funny dialogue &amp; badly misjudged emotion that comes across as camp.The biggest surprise about Gone in Sixty Seconds is the bland action, there are lots of boring shots of cars but actual vehicular mayhem is kept to a minimum, the final fifteen minutes sees a cool car chase but otherwise there's every little here to get excited about. There are some screeching &amp; speeding cars, a couple of cars are blown up &amp; there's a few fist fights but very little else. The cars look nice enough but I just don't get the attraction really, a car's a car to me &amp; if it goes fast &amp; has a nice paint job so the hell what? The whole film has been alternately shot with bright neon lighting during the night scenes &amp; a dull sandy colour during the daytime scenes. Made before the annoying fad for machine gun editing at least it's filmed with a steady hand &amp; you can always tell what's going on but the trend for loud obnoxious music is here in full force.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 it's well made with flashy production values, fast cars &amp; a no expense spared feel. Mainly shot in California the final chase scene was filmed in Ontario in Canada. The acting is bad by everyone, Cage &amp; Angelina Jolie are awful. The acting talents of Robert Duvall &amp; Delroy Lindo is wasted while Vinnie Jones &amp; Christopher Eccelston have nothing more than cameos. Writer Scott Rosenberg has a small cameo as a Doctor.Gone in Sixty Seconds is a flashy soulless &amp; empty remake that I didn't even think reached the lowly heights of averageness, often unintentionally funny &amp; lacking is memorable action scenes I was left throughly unimpressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made back when PG-13 movies when making their descent in quality and their rise in abundance, GI60S is nothing but car pornography for gormless audiences who care not for story or character but are nonetheless fascinated by the flickering images and colors.There is nothing good about this film. Nothing. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. The story takes an age to get going and when it finally does it doesn't really amount to much. Instead of being a white-knuckle thrill-ride it is more a leaden-traffic jam. The story dies a long slow horrible death within 2 minutes and the rest of the movie is just us watching stay dead. It's not a pretty sight. Certainly not a sight you want waste money on this DVD for.There are about two chase scenes, tops. Are they are both SO BORING. There is a certain gimmick the director uses in these scenes (no it's not the 4 million shots of Nic Cage's foot on the pedals). I'm talking about the cops, who have almost caught up with Cage, being cut off by a truck, bulldozer, jalopy etc. it happens so many times it is practically a joke that is funny only to Dominic Sena. And the editing throughout the entire movie (as always in a Jerry Bruckhiemer production) is like the film has been shredded and just thrown back together. You cannot make out a single thing. The whole experience is a blur.The plot of stealing cars is not entertaining. It is not cool, hip or streetwise. It is just boring. And apparently, in Long Beach California, if it's not Night it is always Sundown. I don't think that this is planetary possible but it happens in this movie nonetheless.Speed and steel do not make a good movie. Even the villain is SO unscary. And he's only in it for like a minute. No constant threat is made to Nic Cage. We begin to wonder why he is even bothering stealing these cars. Plus, this film marks one of his numerous terrible performances. Cage can be good when he wants to, but frequently, when starring in junk like this, he is on zombie auto-pilot. And people moan about Seagal having no acting talent?Every cast member is wasted. The score is nothing but sound effects and noises with no real theme at all. The direction is pedestrian and the film as a whole is a waste of time and money.The Director's Cut DVD is not really true Director's Cut but the same film with 9 extra minutes of filler that was wisely left on the cutting-room floor first time around but has been chucked back into the film as a way of making you part with more of your cash. Don't do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the "game" when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for British crime boss Raymond Calitri. The job involves "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will enact his punishment. So Raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and sets about the task to hand. But the police are on to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy takes. It would seem a near impossible job to complete.It's got quite a cast has Gone In 60 Seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan &amp; Timothy Olyphant. All of whom deserve better. Enough acting horsepower there to propel a Porsche 998 Turbo. Trouble is, is that this is very much a case of too many cars overstocking the car park, mucho characters, not enough zest. From the off we are in no doubt that this is a Bruckheimer/Simpson production, bonkers script laced with loud noises and lashings of cheese, scattergun editing, and directed with sledgehammer subtly by Dominic Sena. It's essentially a big budget remake of H.B. Halicki's 1974 indie movie of the same name, with the premise offering up the potential for an adrenalin fuelled car based movie. Potential that sadly is never realised. There's one or two high impact moments, daft for sure, but enjoyable none the less. But if you pardon the pun, the film never gets out of first gear, it's more content to labour with its ream of characters who mope about trying to make the boorish screenplay {Scott Rosenberg} work.Car fans will get something from it {the cars are ace on the eye}, as will fans of unintentional comedy movies {check out Ecclestone's carpenter grief moment}. But no, it's really rather poor all told. 4/10</fullReview>

Nick Cage is the retiree coming back to help out someone, but he needs his old team if he wants any chance of pulling off this very risky deal. the only problem is, most of them have worked hard to turn a new leaf, and some weren't quite happy with how he had up and left years before. not only that he has to deal with old rivals and the many competitors who aren't happy to have this car thief legend back in town. and i said all that without as many car references. awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what NOT to do. The original kicked some major tire squealing butt, this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of Bruckheimer films, which is: we all know they suck, but they have great action. This film has NO ACTION. This film is BORING. Where are the cars? Where are the chases? Where's the tension? Where's the suspense? Where's the rush? Where!!?? This isn't really a movie at all, it's a bad commercial. 50 cars in 24 hours? That is wrong. They have 3 days to steal them, the ad is wrong. How bad is that? The leads acting is stiff, wooden and forced. The villain, the cop, the others...who cares. They utter their pointless lines, they serve the illogical plot. They slog through it the best they can as the music video director says "don't worry we'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is" or "we'll fix it with lots of loud music" The "script" isn't really a script at all, it's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of: -------Warning - possible spoiler------ 5------4-----3-----2-----1------ The Fugitive. The biggest crime of all is the underuse of Vinnie Jones, man....this is the baddest, coolest mofo since Jules in Pulp Fiction. And what do they do!? They make him a mute who's hardly in the film! Make Vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film. How could they have been so dumb? How? How? Why? The original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away. The original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers! Go find the original. Or if you're craving some real car chase action go rent RONIN. The chases in Ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged. Bruckheimer and Cage had all that money, all those resources, all that experience, and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for $250,000? How can that be? You feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie. Where I was once excited to see Coyote Ugly, Remember the Titans and Pearl Harbor, now I say: God help us all. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Jerry Bruckheimer ("The Rock", "Armageddon", Pearl Harbor") loud and pointless flop. Cage with that stupid expression in his face, Jolie who likes to hear about cars at her sexual encounters, unfunny script lines, thick characters, ridiculous plot (stealing cars to save his idiot brother's life), all these in an action movie with no action (I don't even like this kind of adventure with car chases). No direction (producer's star shine in every boring step...) and a supposed to be "cool" acting from those who involved in this (only Duvall as an old pro is as always a joy to see). Horrible in every way, enough only for the producer to make a few money from the audience. Avoid it at any cost</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The style of a Jerry Bruckheimer production (I'm talking about the gritty action, explosions, and such) works only when it collaborates with the film. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a fine example of this, mainly because of an acceptable script, thrilling direction, and stellar acting (you know who I'm talking about). When the Bruckheimer style is used as the film's fuel, as it is in Armageddon, Con Air, and the disaster that is Gone in 60 Seconds, it abruptly puts a stop to the quality. The plot is too simple and dumbfounding: Nicolas Cage and his Pennzoil-covered merry-men must steal a plethora of damn-near unattainable and valuable cars within a time limit for a stereotypical British villain or else the captured brother is killed. I've never seen the original film this remake tries to fire up, but I feel safe in assuming that nothing was improved. The star power of this cast, with names like Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo, Will Patton, and Vinnie Jones, doesn't bring anything worthwhile, anything at all, to the table (You might as well go see their likenesses at a wax museum.). After sifting through this garbage, I found my favorite scene is the deadline cruncher car chase between Cage and the po-po; the stunts and car are both kicka$s. Aside from flying cars, every bit of this accumulation of gunk is irritating to the bone. If you would like to see any of the actual cars of Gone in 60 Seconds without actually enduring the flick itself, I'm sure a few are still on display at Ripley's Hollywood Car Museum in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Trust me, you're better off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of this movie, it seems, revolves around scenes in a garage where the lead actors tell the audience what they're going to do. The actual doing is then reduced to quick, almost montage-like scenes of the cars being stolen.The film is essentially a car chase (at the end) padded out with lots of mostly unimportant dialogue and scenes (the rest of the movie). As an example, the pace of the movie grinds to a halt when, having found the keys for three Mercedes cars they need, the dog swallows them. There's then an entirely unfunny set of scenes involving ex-lax and waiting for the dog to crap out the keys. All the while you keep hoping the movie will continue but it doesn't until the dog poops up the keys.The film is saved only by the final car chase, which rivals anything the Matrix series has provided, and which has the only half-way decent cinematic portrayal of what a compressed gas cylinder will do if the valve snaps off. Also a saving grace is Vinnie Jones - awful actor, but you can't help but like him anyway. His few scenes are worth looking out for.And that's about it for Gi60S. Mostly dull with a few spots of brightness and a good car chase at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that `Gone In 60 Seconds' is no `Gone With The Wind', but it does have some admiring qualities. This action-packed bubble-gum summer smash is about a former car thief who joins up with his old `stealers' team in order to do some quick car-jacking so his brother's life could be spared. Yes! It does include some of the idiotic theme plots that destroys action films: boring kidnappings, repetitious slogans, and lengthy chase scenes. These qualities should have been put on reverse in the editing room. However, what drove me crazy about the film is the chemistry or should i say gaseous substance between stars Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie. My eyes were tailgated on screen whenever they shared scenes together. `Gone In 60 seconds' is no autobahn, but it is definitely worth the ride.*** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this movie. I do prefer movies that are a little more... intelligent per say, but I still feel Gone in Sixty Seconds is quite underrated. Actually, my biggest complaint is that the movie was too short. There was simply too much story and way to many characters to fit into the movie's time frame.The basic story is about a car thief, (Cage) who has achieved legendary status and then retired. His younger brother, trying to be like his brother, falls into car boosting too, but soon gets in too deep and ends up on the hit-list of a ruthless crime lord after he messes up a very important job. Now, the only way to save his brother's life is for Cage to come out of retirement and finish the job: Strealing fifty high profile cars in one night. Together with many other top thieves, they set out to do the impossible.While the cast is truly star studded, with big names such as Nicholas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Rober Duvall, most of the acting and characters aren't that sympathetic. The movie simply has too many characters to really get deeply into any of them. Delroy Lindo does a fairly engaging job as the old arch-nemesis of the protagonist, and Cage is good as usual, but the rest of the cast is nothing special, except perhaps for the mysterious coroner who never talks, Sphynx.But, the movie is still worth watching for the suspenseful action and the truly incredible chase scene at the end. Is there anything more beautiful then that Shelby Mustang GT, nicknamed Eleanor, roaring down the streets of Los Angoles? There are many other exotic cars in this movie too, from a very unique Hummer to a Lambourgini Diablo.Don't go into this movie expecting a deep and involving, dramatic story. While it does attempt at this, it doesn't necessarily succeed. But the action is suspenseful and although a tad unrealistic at times, it is a great kick to watch. This movie is better then the average action movie. A true classic for the car chase genre.My rating: **1/2 out of **** Other recommendations: Bourne Supremacy, The Italian Job (1969), Smokey and the Bandit</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he's forced to save his the life of his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) when he screws up on a job, by completing his brothers job of stealing 50 cars in one night. He has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his bro out of dutch. But the cops are onto him, so can he pull it off? This was one of the great candidates of a film to re-make as the Original was far from a classic. And if you don't go into it expecting much, and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is. You'll end up enjoying the ride. Watch it on a double-bill with "The Fast and the Furious" for a night of high-speed hijinks, just don't take the car out for a spin right afterwards.My Grade: B- DVD Extras: 7 minute Jerry Bruckheimer Interview; Bruckheimer Bio/Filmography; Action Overload: Highlight Reel; The Big Chase; "0 To 60" featurette; "Wild Rides" featurette; Stars On The Move; The Cult "Painted On The Heart" music video; Theatrical Trailer, and Trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a flat movie. My friends and I rented this crap and had a ball trashing it all the way through. Not since Armageddon or ConAir have I seen this much posturing towards homophobic male machismo and testosterone. One can only assume that the writer and director were targeting 15 year-old redneck boys with this one because every line, every emotion displayed, every plot twist was comic-bookish, sophmoric and portrayed in the way that a high school boy would think it should be portrayed. The writing was hands down the worst of all the movies elements. We're supposed to feel empathy towards the lead character played by Nicholas Cage because his brother was targeted with a death threat by some low-life foreign crime boss whose main beef was that he couldn't let his criminal reputation be spoiled by the young brother's botched car heist. Who gives a crap. Wow, that guy was peeved. I, the movie audience member sure hope his seedy reputation is kept in tact! Why did Nicholas Cage and Robert Duvall say yes to this movie script? Just reading it alone had to signal NO PLOT to these decent actors. One can only assume they were taken over by the same 15-year old boy mentality when they found out that the sexy Angelina Jolie would be on the set looking like a mechanic's dream. Uninspired acting, awful plot, predictable twists (the SUV with the "snake" liscense plate - didn't see that one comin') all added up to zilch. My interest in any and all characters was gone in 60 seconds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>===minor spoilers=== I am, like many others, a huge Jerry Bruckheimer fan. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front, and the trailer coming by before MI:2, expectations were rising. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar- Angelina Jolie. What can possibly go wrong? A lot. The script is neither funny (which it tries really hard to be) nor exciting. You put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa!! you've got comedy? I don't think so. Excitement is totally out of the picture. First of all (and this is probably said many times) there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed? IF you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) is walking with Nic in the streets again. Is this excitement? Think not. Then comes the best bit- the romance between Nic and Angelina. She actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' 'Are you seeing anybody?' 'What went wrong?' etc.Then there's only one sparkle of hope left: the car chases. They're disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there's only one. A very long one, caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement. I really had trouble following the action.So is it an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - there's no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel like I'm being generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about 51 times the HOT STUFF</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about Kip (Giovanni Ribsi), a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total). He is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the ?order'. The objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of Randall (Nicolas Cage), a ?retired' booster and also Kip's brother and a couple of old friends of Randall's. As you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course Randall is the best thief there ever was. Of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story. You are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the HOT STUFF, since there are only 50 beautiful, fast, cool and expensive cars to be stolen. Well the other hot item in this film is Sway (Angelina Jolie (who will be a big STAR (trust me))). She is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft, but she is pretty hot too. OK not hot as in pretty, but hot as in damn cool and sexy. She was very believable in this role, probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too (don't believe me, read her biography) and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man. I only know, that she plays the kind of girl I like in this film, because she is not too mainstream, a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo.OK the only downsides I felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one totally unrealistic scene, the story is only OK and that there are not much jokes. Hey but after seeing the whole film I must say: WHO CARES. Why must I say that, well because it was still entertaining; had a couple of cool car chases; good music; some Bruckheimer scenes (where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet); good actors who all did their jobs; pretty cars; one cool, wild, sexy lady (yes, I mean Mrs. Jolie) and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with. So some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. All in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall OK movie with a cool ? feelgood ending.As for Nicolas Cage, well? He is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as The Rock, Con Air, Face / Off, Snake Eyes and finally this one. Plus what actor has had so many good action / thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ? Well no one!!! Maybe Jackie Chan, but he is one of my favourites too. One thing that is true though about Mr. Cages Bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. The Rock, was a clear 9, Con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7. Not that that mark is bad. Does it not show that his films under Bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe Cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? No it doesn't show us that, because almost all of Cage's films were successful in the last few years, except for 8mm and Bringing out the Dead. 8mm was not great, I admit that, but that was never Cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. About the latter film I can not say anything, ?cause I have not seen it yet. One thing though I know for sure, if Bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, I would have said YES to all of them. I would have said yes to The Rock, because the story was great and because you would get to play with Sean Connery and Ed Harris. I would have said yes to Con Air, because there would be a lot of action in it, because the story was good and because you got to act with John Malkovich and Ving Rhames. In this one I would have starred because I would have gotten a big paycheque, I would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because I would have been able to kiss Angelina Jolie (can't wait to see her in that Lara Croft outfit). This one was a good choice of Mr. Cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have had the chance to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This movie stays to it's wonderful action and great story. Although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it. Not having this movie on DVD helped make the purchase easier. I have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which don't always go together. Overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you either get two things. A picture that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture. I was disappointed when I made this my first blu ray movie. I almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard. Although after watching other movies I know better. I don't believe they spent as much time as they should have transferring this movie over to hd. That is generally the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and the Blue Ray Discs you should only have the best picture. So I only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the DVD version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>greatest car boost of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After little brother Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) runs into big problems with his latest car theft deal, big brother Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicholas Cage) is called upon. Memphis retired from stealing cars six years ago, but is forced to make a comeback tour when his brother's life is put on the line. He's got three days to steal fifty cars. The list of cars includes "Eleanor," a 1967 Shelby GT 500 mustang, a car that has eluded Memphis many times before. When Detective Castlebeck learns Raines has returned to town, he becomes suspicious, and is determined to catch him in the act. Memphis calls upon his old team to help with the twenty-four hour boost. This team includes an old flame, Sarah "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie). Randall has four days to build a team, find the cars, and get them delivered to the pier.The film shows the importance of family and when we do the right thing, good things will come. Granted, stealing cars isn't a "good thing", but it is Memphis' motives that are noble. He does whatever it takes to get his little brother out of the mess he's in. The characters are easy to relate to, and we begin to root for the criminals, which in the end are the good guys. The movie does a great job of drawing us into the story and making us feel compassion for the characters. We feel the adrenaline rush through watching them evade the cops, but the storyline still grabs our hearts through Kip's and Memphis' brotherhood.From the dialogue to the lighting we are pulled into this film within the first few minutes. The lights dim, becoming almost grey, while the cars are being stolen giving us the feeling terrible things may arise, yet it brightens up and the mood changes each time Kip and Randall reconcile. The characters talk in everyday language that is easy to relate to. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing; the right song at the right time makes a world of difference. Overall it was a great film that could easily be seen multiple times. You'll never feel bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With so many PURE JUNK movies like the Fast and the Furious series out there...This movie brings some REAL cars into the picture.Nicholas Cage was perfect for this role.I love the old musclecar/ chop shop, oldschool feel to this movie.Acting and lines are great....Action is awesome....(although i saw a few shots in the final chase scene that could have been done with a more raw feel to them) (i compare it to the 2004 dukes of hazzard chase scenes, which WAS a goofy movie, but the DOH chase scenes gave me goosebumps watching the dodge charger blazing by and just a raw muscle car feel to it...while blasting ACDC.....)This movie seemed to lack that alittle bit at moments.There's also a lot of realistic funny scenes in the movie....Great car/race/ grand theft auto type of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of good action films in my day and this one is definitely one of the best ones. If you want to enjoy a film including amazing cars, an interesting and innovative plot and obviously if u want to see the beautiful Angelina Jolie, this is the film for you. The film gives you an interesting view into the life of modern and old school car thief's. The film always keeps you excited and might have some twists, I don't know...well...I might know I don't want to spoil it for you. This film is a one of a kind and i reckon you see it as quick as possible, trust me you will enjoy it. Not only is the plot interesting but all the characters are being so represented in such a cool and interesting way that you just start thinking:" I would love to be like them.". Enjoy the film. ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gone in Sixty Seconds" is a wonderful slice of popcorn escapism. Beautifully glossy, this movie is always a joy to watch. With a great cast, a wonderful score by Dominic Sena and stylish direction, it definitely stands up to repeat viewings.Nicolas Cage's "Memphis" Raines is a likable bad-guy turned good, whose efforts to save his brother (Giovanni Ribisi) are extremely gripping. The cast includes the delectable Angelina Jolie, the man-mountain Vinnie Jones, a truly villainous Christopher Eccleston, Robert Duvall and Will Patton.9 out of 10. A fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memphis has been set a challenge, he must steal fifty cars in one night otherwise local gangster Calitri will kill Memphis's brother, Kip. So Memphis must re-connect with his old crew to do the impossible.The plot is not original but it still excites the audience and will have you rooting for the main character. Nicholas Cage is brilliant as the older brother trying to help his younger brother; Angelina sizzles on screen as the sexy Sway; the rest of the cast provide satisfactory performances but it great to see British veteran Eccelstone opposite Cage; his Calitri is very menacing.The thrill of Gone in Sixty Seconds is the whole planning in my opinion as well as the execution of the plan and how the team deal with setbacks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie now. Cool one, I must say. Didn't expect such a low rating here. It is predictable fare but Nicholas Cage and his gang's histrionics makes the watch worthwhile. I enjoyed every moment of it. Angelina's just the babe here but I couldn't think of any other girl for her part. That itself speaks about her on screen presence - even though there is nothing much that she does. Cage, as usual, is tailor-made for such roles. He is very good...This movie isn't for my collection but I wanted to see it since long. Saw it today and enjoyed it. That's about it. Purpose served. Nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie twice as i normally do. Once to enjoy the movie and the other time to analyze it. Gone in 60 seconds is a good movie. Though at some points of time the narration seemed slow over it was a great watch. The ways in which car thefts are shows was pretty interesting. The best part that you will agree is the seen on the bridge where the protagonist takes that great jump while being chased by the cops. One more point I liked was the brotherly love the main characters shared. Another good scene is the crushing of the car by the negative actor with protagonists brother inside. The romance was not very appealing. You may definitely feel like going over the scenes once again after the movie is over. I would definitely recommend this one.

		<fullReview>When the guy dressed up like a pimp is distracting the guy at the impound lot, look up in the left, upper corner of the screen. There's a sign on the building that reads "Gone in 60 Seconds" with some smaller text above I couldn't make out. Just wondering if anyone else noticed. I did like the movie quite a bit, although it did lag in many spots. Not one of Bruckheimer's best, but far better than many movies out there today. It's difficult to find anything to watch nowadays that's not loaded with a bunch of garbage RAP in the soundtrack. We need many more action movies that actually have a plot and don't rely on all flashy special effects. Music is good in any movie, as long as it's something that actually took talent to create. Unfortunately, far better than Cage's recent films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Gone in Sixty Seconds in a hotel room, jetlagged. But any attempt to stay awake thanks to this movie was futile, as it knocked me out.My opinion, in a nutshell, is that the movie had a horrible plot and failed miserably on the excitement front, too.The basic premise is that Nicholas Cage is a reformed car thief who has three days to steal fifty cars or else his brother will be killed. Now, the premise is unbelievable but let's forget that for a moment, since most Hollywood movies have ludicrous plot lines.What the movie does have is potential: a cast including the talented Nicholas Cage and Angelina Jolie, lots of cool cars and opportunity for chase scenes and edge-of-your-seat excitement.Unfortunately, it comes up short delivering. Angelina Jolie's talent goes completely to waste; the sole purpose of her part seems to be to put red lipstick on and wear tight clothing. When Cage's character decides to steal the cars, instead of getting to work, he spends another half-hour of movie time being mushy and sentimental. When they finally do begin stealing cars, it's so easy it's boring.The movie's redeeming qualities: a really cool car chase scene near the end, featuring the requisite car-flying-through-the-air-and-landing-in-one-piece trick. A few good one-liners. Not much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, finally a movie about jacking cars. After Grand Theft Auto, this is the most comprehensive edition about jacking cars on the big screen. This is a movie, which is filled with action. Not much romance, but only action. Memphis and his gang jacking cars, for a one night boost, to save his younger brother's skin. Amidst all this is the fact that Randall Reines is a big target on the GTA Inspector list. Nicholas Cage is superb, with the last car jack. The last action scene in the docks will leave all movie goers spellbound. Also car fans, go and watch this movie for some extremely cool cars. There is also a hint of comedy whilst the action is put to rest. Overall, a top grossing movie and a definitely must see.</fullReview>

So when my father and my brother elected to rent 'Gone in 60 Seconds', a car film, it was with a heavy heart i sat down to watch. However, the film was totally not what i expected. For starters, it features William lee Scott, so Eye Candy was there. Secondly, you didn't have to know a thing about cars to know that they were classy. And thirdly (and most importantly) it was actually good! The choice of actors was brilliant, and the storyline was appealing to both male and female. I would refer this film to anyone who is planning on a movie night that will involve both guys and girls as this film can please both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gone in Sixty Seconds is one of the best action movies ever made! It has style, it has suspense, and it has one of the things most lacking in movies of this genre: it has a soul. Behind the huge challenge of planning a one-night, fifty-car heist, and beneath the incredibly well-staged chase scenes, the basic plot line is about love for family and the desire to protect them from harm. Cage gives one of his usual great tough-guy performances, and the heat between his character and Angelina Jolie's burns up the screen. The cast of characters is diverse and often peculiar, and their antics introduce a lot of humor in the story. The ending couldn't be better. If you haven't seen this movie, get out and rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, i went to this movie after i saw "girl, interrupted", because i was impressed with Angelina's Jolie acting there. But i hated this one, it was awful!!! No good acting, as i was expecting, no good scenario (to steal cars all movie without any emotions??? - come on!!!). Even soundtracks were too bad, it didn't fit there. I would rather watch something hack, like all those Texas killing thing or wrong turn, but never again such a crap!!! If you asked me, was there something good? Well, maybe that little love affair between Angelina's and cage's characters, but that was so unnatural... It looked like she doesn't give a big s**t about their relationship, he either. Well, my opinion about the movie was better at the time i watched it, but still i can remember how time to time i was bored, which happens never in the cinema.</fullReview>

I think it has what is needed: a decent plot, good action sequences, and a star-studded cast. What more do people want? Like I said, this film does have a decent plot consisting of a retired car thief who is forced back into the business after his younger brother gets into deep trouble with the law doing the same business. He is forced by his brother's boss to steal 50 cars in 3 days otherwise his brother's life is severed. Like I said, great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Car Thievery at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Gone in 60 Seconds' is a movie in which Randall `Memphis' Raines (Nicolas Cage), an ex-car thief, has to steal fifty cars for Raymond Vincent Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) in one day. If he doesn't steal all of these cars, Calitri is going to kill his brother Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi). So Memphis has to round up his old gang and try to get these cars, while the police are breathing down their necks. Some of his old gang includes Sara `Sway' Wayland (Angelina Jolie), Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall), and The Sphinx (Vinnie Jones). About half of the fifty cars are exotics -- and there are some very nice ones I may add -- but in the end the last car was the best of them all. I don't want to spoil the ending, but there is an awesome car chase in which Memphis steals a 1967 Shelby Mustang, and is chased by the cops. There is intense action in this movie that keeps everybody on the edge of their seat. Some of the dialogue could have been better, like this one line towards the end: Calitri says, `It never rains but it pours,' because of Memphis Raines, but it makes no sense at all. There are some funny parts in this flick too: such as when Otto's dog eats three keys that they need to steal three new Mercedes Benz, Memphis tells one of the guys to go buy some exlax to give it to him. This movie tries to show that no matter what a person has to do, even if it is something that I told my mother that I would never do again, we will always save our family members. No matter what it is, even if it could get me killed, I will always make sure the family is going to be safe.</fullReview>

It has the perfect mix of wit and drama. It actually has a plot and is not just a movie about cars and racing, like so many other car movies. The music is terrific. The special effects are superb. I just can't get enough of it.The action scenes are the best I've seen in a long time. The final car chase at the end keeps you on the edge of your seat for what seems like forever. It is full of breath taking stunts, crashes, crowded streets, and alley ways and could not have been better executed by anyone except Nicolas Cage.If you have not seen Gone In 60 Seconds, you are missing out.</fullReview>

When I got the video I expected more action, much more action. The car chase is good but only occurs at the end of the film. The rest of the movie tries to get you interested in the character of Raines and his brother Kip and their friend Otto and others but their characters are never developed to a point of liking them. There is a dog that eats some special car keys and in my opinion is more interesting than most of the humans. So if you can wait for about one and half hours for a chase then enjoy otherwise breeze past this one on the video shelf.</fullReview>

Even so we can use a much better story-line.The second phrase:When you use nitrous oxide in your car, it will certainly drink a huge amount of gas. Accelerating hard to over 160 miles an hour will surely make the fuel gauge dive. In other words, it's impossible to Memphis to travel all those miles without refuelling.</fullReview>

"Flower" is one of my favorite Moby songs, and Jerry "get dat dolla, spend dat dolla" Bruckheimer meshed it with his trademark $million+ opening credits. The first couple minutes of this movie are just silly good. After that, flick's pretty weak, but that's clearly on record in this forum already. Moby ought to dedicate a few years to this movie thing. Among his credits: this, "porcelain" for the discovery of the beach in "The Beach"(the best part of that movie by FAR), and "God moving over the face of water" for the final scene of "Heat", in which he seemed to pretty much serve as a mouthpiece for Michael Mann to say "I am on the mountaintop now, and nothing I do will ever be this amazing again.

		<fullReview>Typical Jerry Bruckheimer film; if you've seen one of his horribly contrived movies, you've seen them all: the characters are all poorly developed stereotypes and unessential to the plot (except for, say, 2 of them). I'm proud to say I wasn't done in by the marketing and didn't shell out $7.50 to see it; I caught it on TNT the other night. Naturally, the cars are the coolest part of the movie, but I'd rather just go to a car show and check them out than sit through inane, uninspired dialogue loosely framed around a "plot". The plot is this: Memphis Raines(Nic Cage) has to steal 50 cars in one night in order to save his brother from some kind of evil foreign guy, you know, the kind that's become an archtype in action movies. OK. Here's the thing: his brother is still free, they haven't captured him or done anything otherwise debilitating to him. Why can't Memphis come up with a better idea than doing what the bad guy tells him? Such a desperate attempt in the story is made to make Memphis the good guy, much to the detriment of the already fragile plot. Go see "The Fast and the Furious" instead; the plots are equally inept, but at least TFATF is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say about this movie. It is your basic help out your family story we have seen before. The movie surrounds two brothers Memphis Raines (Cage) and Kip Raines (Ribisi). Kip is hired by some ahole car thief who wants to kill him after he can't pay his debt of 10,000 dollars and loses cars he has stolen for him. The bad guy then finds Cage who is retired from stealing cars and to do one big job to save his brothers life. He has to steal 50 cars in 3 days or kip dies. Cage calls all his former car thief buddies and the story begins. What i had a problem with was why not leave town. It is not like they were holding Ribisi hostage. Oh , well it is a movie and it is entertaining with all the car chases. The movie has plot holes but overall it is a good ride.</fullReview>

And the cars, my god. 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500 is one of the most beautiful cars I have ever see. I have seen this movie more than 10 times now, I got both the DVD and VHS. I can't get enough of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ignore the critics, this is a good movie. I liked the soundtrack too. I thought the cars were excellent, especially the Shelby. That was an awesome car. The movie had a pretty good plot. The acting was not really good at all. Nicholas Cage was not good. He is getting too old to play this type of role. Angelina Jolie was not good either and she was awful with Blonde Hair. Overall, a pretty good movie and it keeps you entertained for almost two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have discovered that this film is like Marmite, you either love it or hate it. I love this movie. (yet hate Marmite) I think that Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and all the other cast are brilliant, and while I think that Angelina's charactor, Sway, could have had a much bigger part in the movie and her relationship with 'Memphis' could have been looked at more, thats pretty much my only complaint. I think that this movie is worth your time and money. There may not be a huge amount of plot but its fun to watch and if you love cars there's even more for you. Some real beauty is in this film car wise. You must see this film, even if its only to see if you love it or hate it, after all, you never know until you try it right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action but awful picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It´s no doubt a fast paced action movie but the story of steeling cars is really nothing special. This movie is better than "Swordfish" but I cannot understand why director Dominique Sena has to mix in every film so many colors to create for me an unreal film that I don´t like. The picture in GI60S is during 99% really awful. But why? To give it a modern touch? Oh no, let it be please. The script is thin and the acting is just average.Rent it before you buy. This one could work for all fans who like car chases or sport cars but don´t expect more. For all these reasons I gave only 5/10.</fullReview>

They are helped by a great cast including Angelina Jolie, Scott Caan, Will Patton, Chi McBride, T.J. Cross and others.

		<fullReview>To start with: "Gone..." is way too slick. The main problem is that the action in this movie is too statical. A second problem is the fact that the story has a lot of potential for a great action movie, but since there is enough potential action to make this movie 2 times the normal length. I have never seen the original "Gone.." and therefore I can not judge the quality of that movie, but I think that of all possible action, the remaining action destillate in this remake is to slick and almost never real exciting. Overall this movie is enjoyable to watch, all acting is on a reasonable level and the art direction is ok. For sure, the cars steal the show, so I would say, a must see for car-lovers. Overall it's not a bad movie, but certainly no masterpiece. 7-/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>50 Cars. One Night. Unbelievable? Yes. Impossible? Not for Memphis Randle. Nicolas Cage convincingly portrays a car theft trying to steal 50 cars in 1 night to save his brother's life. For the guy audience, there are expensive cars, popular songs, and racing. For the female audience there is just two words: Nicolas Cage. Nevertheless, the fellow cast - Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie and James Duval- also performs just as well as Nic and makes the movie a blockbuster. LA is the backdrop for this action packed, fast paced, and at some times hilarious feature that will - and had - everyone talking about it for days. This movie will entertain everyone in the family, so, better get this flick fast before its ?Gone in 60 Seconds'. So buckle up, it's going to be a fast ride.</fullReview>

"Gone in Sixty Seconds" is the case. Cage is here a superman-like person who is compelled to steal cars. The film has plenty of emotions, particularly when he is racing his last car, but nothing new, go and see "Ronin" starred by De Niro and Jean Reno, and you will see similar scenes on narrow streets of Nice, France.</fullReview>

This is no problem for him, as he has the beautiful Angelina Jolie among other capable members of his "gang" of auto thieves ready to do their share of stealing. Robert Duval gives a good performnace as the experienced body (chop?) shop owner that assists Cage in the thefts. This is the MUST SEE movie for those of us who don't take auto security seriously. Just remember fans, always park in a well lit area, roll up your windows, lock your doors and beware of car thieves. Your vehicle CAN be stolen in SIXTY SECONDS OR LESS! INVEST IN A GOOD SECURITY SYSTEM AND USE IT!! This movie had a lot of good action scenes in it and deserves to be added to our collections of action films.

Despite his desire to lead a legitimate life, he's forced to come out of retirement, get back into the game, and steal fifty cars in seventy-two hours in order to save his brother's life from a ruthless crime lord, all the while trying to elude the suspicious cops who are in dogged pursuit. Has the makings of yet another memorable Jerry Bruckheimer action extravaganza, but it's pulled over by one-note characters, stupid dialogue, and zero momentum. An action-packed climax breathes some much needed life into the film, but by that point it ceases to matter. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen to Eleanore's engine at the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie didn't live up to the hype. I was expecting a hard hitting action packed chase film. What you get is a 3 or 4 minute dark chase at the beginning, a 15 minute daytime chase at the end and a 2 more short 2 minute "chases" scenes in the middle. The middle chases aren't really anything special: one involves a Cadillac SUV and some security guards, the other is more of a smash up scene between a Humvie and a cop car. The first chase had potential, but nothing exciting happened. There is alot of style in this film, but not enough to recommend the movie as a movie alone. The last chase scene is too confusing and not well directed. So, as a movie, it played alot like a made for TV film. Not much violence, not much action, no sex scenes, so maybe the kids will like it.I did however, give it a 6. Why? Because the DVD is another story. If you can find this DVD for less than $20, it is worth the purchase. Here's why:First, you've got the menus. I usually hate animated menus that take awhile before it allows me to select my choice. In the case of this DVD, however, I loved the revving sounds and the soundtrack as the gritty car graphics spin around on the screen.Next, the trailer. This movie has one of the coolest trailers I've ever seen. It's better than the movie. with the DVD, you can watch it over and over again.Next, the extras. There are a few documentaries that take behind the scenes of the movie. There are the cast interviews one with Jerry talking about what a producer does. These are short, but interesting features. You can listen to Dominic Sena talk about why he chose certain chase sequences and think to yourself, "yeah, cool, but you didn't do a good job implementing it.."Next, Eleanore. A custom 1967 GT-500 Shelby Mustang. This car is the sexiest thing on the planet. If you haven't seen her, search on Google for pictures.Finally, the engine sound of Eleanore. With a decent surround sound system, the final chase scene will come alive. Even though the sequence itself is fairly standard, the surrounds and the subs kick in to make it more exciting. Trust me, the idle Eleanore engine sound alone is worth the purchase of the disk; I wish I could have a DVD of just that engine sound..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right, all right, even I, a dedicated, hard-core fan of the 2000 movie, Gone in Sixty Seconds, find some of the acting a little bland, but only on some of the older people, such as Nicolas Cage. But Cage is a chameleon actor; his character in this movie is all grown up, calmed down, cool, therefore, he acts that way. I always want to agree that Angelina Jolie deserved more screen time, especially in such a spicy role. Sway is a character that lights up the screen, especially when played by Jolie, and she definately did the best she could. Most people say that this movie is slow; I beg to differ. This movie is the perfect action movie: high-paced, full of interested characters and character combinations, and the soundtrack kicks major ass. And when you're dealing with such beautiful dream cars (mine being the Jaguar XJ 220), you DON'T, repeat, DON'T want to bash them up. Why the hell are people complaining that not enough cars are crashed? Plus, some people are asking, "Where are the cops?" Well, geniuses, they are waiting for Memphis's crew at the Mercedes's. Believe it or not, the South Bay area in California is pretty big ;) and they can't watch everything when they are sitting in one spot. Plus, whenever a person sees them taking cars, cops show up. This movie was funny, catchy, well-written, sweet, bright, exciting, and so star filled it almost hurt my eyes to watch. I vote it a 10 outta 10.</fullReview>

I watched it to the end anyway, just to see how bad it was.And believe me, it's bad. First of all, Nicolas Cage plays a terrible role. The 'romance' with Angelina Jolie is laughably unconvincing, and the rest of actors are just 'fillers' with no real part or character depth.I also expected this movie to be action-packed, but the action only started in the last half hour or so, and it wasn't very good. The rest of the movie is filled with very poor dialogue and incredibly poor jokes, including the one where a number of 'professional' car thieves allow their car keys to be eaten by a dog, after which they have to wait for the keys to come out with the dog's droppings. Come on, this is supposed to be an action movie, not a slapstick comedy !The movies only saving grace are the cool cars they get to steal, but that alone is not enough to make up for the rest of the movie, which is utterly boring and predictable.1/2 of out **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty big mess of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is bad. There, I said it. I have a lot of car-obsessed friends who think this is God's gift to film, but listen to me, this movie is no good. Let me explain.I've got a lot of reasons to not like this movie. Here I go.The villain in this movie is like a rejected James Bond villain. Had he been a Bond villain, they would have called him Wood Man. The guy is obsessed with wood for some reason. Okay, that's a little weird, but it didn't help that they have a horrible British guy playing him.Okay, another bad point, if you think this is a kick ass car chase movie, then you haven't seen many movies. There are only two or three car chases in this movie. Actually, the only good chase is the last one, which isn't bad but it isn't Ronin. I have seen some car chases my friend. I am a push over for a good car chase. Ronin is one of my favorite movies of all time just for that reason. But if you want a good car chase, there are better places to look. Rent Bullit, The Blues Brothers, Ronin, The French Connection, or Taxi before you rent this. Especially Ronin. Holy God, those car chases are amazing.On a technical side, this movie is sad. It's shot like a music video (which is my number one pet peeve). I hate it when directors do this. Example: you have a scene where two guys are talking to each other, you know, basic character development. This is normal, all movies have these. But these music video guys take a 3-minute scene, cut it with 500 different camera angles that cut every second or so. Why can't the camera just stand still at a distance where you can see both guys in one take? If you have two actors who can't remember their lines for a 3-minute character development scene, then you shouldn't have hired them BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ACTORS.Whew, now here is another gripe I have: the waist of talent. Robert Duvall is in this? Angelina Jolie is in this? Giavani Rabisi (however you spell it) is in this? Well, it's hard to tell because each of them has about a total of three minutes of screen time. Why didn't they give them more time? That's my next gripe. Hold on, it gets better.One of the most difficult types of films that directors can make are films that have many characters. Any director will tell you, they hate this. The reason is because the director must develop each character, explain why they're there and give them some human quality. This takes time, and when you have dozens of characters, that only makes it harder. Only really good directors can handle this. Directors like Guy Richie or David Lean. Hell, it's something that even Spielberg has difficulty handling (look at the Lost World). And let me tell you, Dominic Sena (the director of 60 Seconds) can't handle it. Just trust me on that one. All of the characters seem underdeveloped and as I watch this film, I couldn't really care less what happens to them.It's funny, because Sena seems to have gotten much better. Swordfish is the definition of a bad ass action movie, a movie Sena directed. I'm glad he's improved since 60 Seconds. Because this was his first big time movie, I can forgive him. But, the movie still sucks.I will give some pluses to this. It isn't all bad. Sure, there are some funny parts. There are some cool parts (that scene where Vinny Jones blows up all those cars by sticking a rag in the gas tank and lighting it was pretty cool). But, the overall feeling I got from this movie was, "Damn, that was weak." The movie is filled with too many stupid clichés for me to like it (like the ending scene on the catwalk that I saw coming like a cruise ship falling from the sky on a sunny day). Overall, this movie feels like it was put together in a factory. It feels like a product, not a movie. It feels like it was made only to milk money from teenagers. As a man of film, I hate this. Movies should be made just for making them. Movies should be made to be entertaining and fun or intelligent and provoking. Movies should be made for millions of reasons, but one of them is not just to make money. Sure, movies should have a business aspect to them and producers should look to make money with them. But to make a movie ONLY to make money? That is sad. It's also sad that these types of movies outnumber the other ones. Tisk Tisk.3/10PS: Like I said, if you think this movie is "Real bad ass" don't complain to me for being a puss. Trust me, there are more bad-ass-flicks out there than this. Go see Swordfish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a con job the makers of this film did by making the viewer in the audience think that Angelina Jolie would have a big role in the film. She is in the film for five or less minutes and yet the film makers would like you to believe that she is in the film for the entire length. Gone in 60 Minutes(2000) is one of the lamest car chase films to come out of Hollywood in the last five years. The acting is wasted and the direction is less than average. Nicolas Cage gives one of his least challenging roles as legendary car thief Memphis Raines. The car chases are not even exciting to watch. For people who want to see real car chase flicks then I suggest the films, Mad Max(1979), The Road Warrior(1981), and The Vanishing Point(1971).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a nutshell: actors are good but the movie is unsurprising, stupid and humor is disturbingly childish, as usual. What the hell...is it necessarily bad? It's up to you. To me the fact that I've seen dozens of flicks like this makes "Gone in sixty seconds" look like kind of boring from time to time but when there isn't anything better to do, one can might as well spend some time to check out if it's any good.Watch "Gone in sixty seconds" if chase scenes and brainless action gives you satisfaction. If you're looking for a film with an intelligent plot, this one is definitely not for you. This movie is designed to make stealing cars and speeding look like cool and sexy and it does the trick. I don't recommend this film because you can't miss anything by not watching it. Still, I can't say "Gone with sixty seconds" is total crap. Figure it out for yourself if you dig cars and think you might enjoy watching 'em go fast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a bad film, but it ends like most hollywood films end, and the car chases remind me of other car chases. Nothing new here, except for the propane tank shooting around during a chase scene. The acting is ok, and the police investigation part looks real. This is the second feature you watch, at the drive in, after seeing a great movie like Gladiator. This movie is a 6; for the car buff a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action, weak plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (American Gigolo, Beverly Hills Cop, Armageddon) took a little known B movie from the 70's and remade it into a big budget action flick. Unfortunately, the updated screenplay is no better than the original, which was a meager excuse for one big car chase.The story revolves around Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage), a renowned but retired car thief pressed into service to save his brother's life. He must steal 50 cars in a few days or his brother will be killed. This is not a very complex or intriguing plot, but it gives Bruckheimer an opportunity to spend $90 million wrecking expensive cars. The dialogue is vapid, something to fill the time between action sequences, which were quite spectacular.Director Dominic Sena, (Kalifornia) got an opportunity to direct his first megabuck film and did a fine job on the stunts. This film didn't offer much opportunity for nuance; so he did well with the project he was given. The car chase scenes were spectacular especially the car jump on the bridge.Nicholas Cage and Giovanni Ribisi are wasted in a film with few good lines. Cage did a lot of his own stunt driving, which was impressive, but he didn't have a lot with which to work with such a shallow character. Angelina Jolie is just a throw-in to up the testosterone factor. The best acting performance is probably that of Delroy Lindo as the frustrated detective.This unabashed guy flick is nothing more than a dressed up B movie for action junkies. I rated it a 6/10 on the strength of the car scenes. It delivers plenty of heart pounding action, but if you like a movie with a plot, it falls disappointingly short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever see a bunch of cop cars chasing someone around the streets of L.A.? How many times? Ten? A hundred? Well, you're gonna see it again (in Long Beach/San Pedro). "Gone..", an unoriginal and top heavy flick, sports a budget-busting and talented cast which it wastes as it fails to deliver on all levels. Too much Cage with no stretch. Not enough Jolie. A nemesis smaller than life, not bigger. Action done by rote. No human connection. Marginally creative. The list goes on and on. "Gone..." is a dud and a sad waste of top talent. Nonetheless, it's probably worth the price of a video rental on a rainy night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A WASTE OF THREE OSCAR WINNERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this film my jaw dropped as I was ashamed of the wasted talent. First, there is Nicolas Cage (Oscar winner #1) in a role made for a 'B' actor like Patrick Swayze, who plays the older brother of a young car thief. The younger brother rubs a master criminal the wrong way and Cage is forced against his will to steal cars for a deadline the master criminal must meet. Robert Duvall (Oscar winner #2) plays an old mechanic and car expert who helps. I pictured another 'B' actor like Sam Elliott in this role and there's Angelina Jolie (Oscar winner #3) who is one of the criminal gang on the side of the people we are supposed to like and this role could have gone to someone like Cameron Diaz or one of the 'Beverly Hills 90210' women. Even Giovanni Ribisi, who plays Cage's younger brother is wasted and this does not help his cause as he is in the process of becoming one of Hollywood's newest rising stars. This is a fast food culture type of film with 'A' list actors clearly in it for the money. I have lost a lot of respect for Nic Cage who has not mixed up his roles enough since winning an Oscar for 'Leaving Las Vegas' and has taken his art form and turned it into a fate destined to have him remembered in the same breath as Burt Reynolds, Charles Bronson and Sylvester Stallone and NOT Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman and Al Pacino, the truly great actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Car Porn redeemed by a cagey performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plotline is absurd, the villains cardboard cut-outs, the cops unbelievably incompetent and the chase sequences, while thrilling, are pure fantasy. So why see it? Well, there are probably a lot of males out there to whom driving is better than sex, or a substitute for it, and this film ought to give them an orgasm or two. The one female character, played by Angelina Jolie, is a male fantasy - one of the boys who is really a girl, and who is turned on by fast driving. The only notable thing about this piece of exploitative rubbish is Nicolas Cage's cool performance. He is an expert at characters in desperate situations acting against type (eg "Leaving Las Vegas"). Here, he acts sane, stays cool and thinks ahead. A kind of a hero in fact, though the person he is trying to save (his brother) scarcely seems worth it. His methods are a bit dubious also. Christopher Eccleston does quite a nice English villain (perhaps he'll pop up soon in a Bond movie as one), and it's always nice to see Robert Duvall, but he was wasted here. The finale was in a scrap-metal yard, an entirely appropriate venue for a piece of cinematic junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very guilty indeed. This movie was by far the most cliche ridden movie I have seen this year. It was glowing with predictability and poor dialogue from a script that feels like it was written by 100 monkeys on typewriters. My favorite actors embarrased themselves by acting like idiots, and the whole movie felt like a highly polished send-up. I was laughing during the bit at the end when Nicholas Cage jumps over the traffic off that ramp. It was so unrealistic and stupid. Then, after that cliche, the mute character (Played by Vinnie Jones) gives off one of those long, detailed speeches, and the audience laughs whole heartedly. Usually when that speech comes on, I throw large objects at the screen, this time I could only grisle my teeth in anger. Despite all of that, I was entertained by the great soundtrack, and the sheer stupidity of everything and everyone involved with the movie. I'd give yourself a big slap on the face for enjoying this movie, but that would make me a hypocrite. 5.5/10.</fullReview>

From the title seqeuence, with the family portraits with obviously superimposed actors heads, I knew this was going to be a slow starter. The groan factor was apparent as soon as Cage sat down with his mother and issued a pathetic big brother speech, from there it just got worse. The ending takes the biscuit, from all around me there were groans and even a few swear words. Although the standard action is apparent, the sequences don't seem to deliver. Speed and stunning crashes just seem to happen without any usual fanfare, there were no gasps or "wow's" from the audience when a truck is flung through a concrete wall. It all just seemed to lack excitement. The music was good, although too many short snippets of songs were used, simply to sell an movie album. Performances here are cheesy, although Vinnie Jones and Christopher Ecclestone are way cool. Skip it, the actions numbing and dull, cheese galore and full of groans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fairly typical summer 2000 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we are almost into August and a good slate of the summer sweeps is over. And just like last year we have had a few really good films ( Gladiator, Perfect Storm, The Patriot) one huge box office bohemoth that took the summer sweeps by storm( Scary Movie) and then we have the rest. The rest are those films come out and people see because it is summer time and they have nothing better to do. These films aren't bad movies, they just aren't that great and they will surely be forgotten in a short while. Films like Me Myself and Irene, Shaft and now Gone In Sixty Seconds fall into that mold. Gone... is passable entertainment but it does not astound you or do anything different than any other film does. In fact, I can not understand how this film got the incredible cast that it did with the script being as paper thin as it is. Look past Nicolas Cage and Duval and you still have some of the best up and comers in the business. With Ribisi, Scott Caan and one of my favourite actors on the scene today, Delroy Lindo, this film is blessed with a cast that can take any mundane scene and add a bit of TNT to it. Take for example the scene where Duval says to Lindo, " You break it you buy it my friend!" This was probably a line written in the script in a normal fashion and Duval took it and added that coyote like laugh to it. He brought his character to life and added some much needed personality to what was probably a stagnant looking script. And when you are blessed with actors that can do this, your film is that much better because of it. I am not saying that Gone... is a bad movie but it certainly isn't anything great. But it is some of the performances that keep what modicum of interest in the film that I had. Without a different cast, this may have been quite a bad film.But what it comes down to in a film like this, is action. You have fast cars, Cage, Jolie and Bruckheimer. This alone makes the film worth looking at because this is a formula for action, explosions, chases and mayhem. But I don't really think the film delivered on that promise of eye popping action and amazing car chases. There were a few good ones but when the press kit tries to tell you that this will compete with Bullitt as the best car chase around, then you better have some merit to those claims. And while the car chases in here are good, they certainly didn't wow me and show me something that I have not seen before. Raiders of the Lost Ark did it better and so did the Dukes of Hazard. And even though there is no denying that this film is doing quite well at the box office, I don't think that makes it a great film. It is good and it has it's moments. But don't expect to be entertained the same way that you have been before in a Bruckheimer film. His great ones have been incredible. This is one of his average efforts.6 out of 10.... There are worse films out there this summer but there certainly are better ones.</fullReview>

The trailer would like you to believe that the movie is a non-stop-thrill-ride, but it is sometimes slow and the movie needs some more of those brilliant car-chases, which is what this movie is all about. Nicolas Cage is excellent as always as he teams up with Jerry Bruckheimer for their third actionmovie(the two first were "The Rock" and "Con-air"). The action and car-chases are the two things that will make you see this, not the storyline. Great film, but with some flaws. 7,5/10</fullReview>

"Gone in SixtySeconds" is a movie with the most excellent car chases everfilmed. Though it might annoy some viewers because the plot forthis movie is quite wafer thin, and also that the dialogue is abit crude and unintelligent, those minor flaws can be overlookedthanks to the breathless pacing and the awesome burning of tirerubber in this movie. A discriminating viewer might confuse"Gone in Sixty Seconds" from a Castrol GTX TV commercial!The ever-dependable Nicholas Cage stars as Randal "Memphis"Raines, a retired car thief who is forced back into the game bya sinister bloke by the named of Raymond (played by ChristopherEccelston, who, because of his dirty and slightly Euro-trashyway, reminded me of Dougray Scott from "Mission: Impossible 2.")who wants Memphis to steal 50 cars for him in a matter of 3days, or Raymond will send his goons to kill Memphis' kidbrother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi), who also has a yen for grandtheft auto, like big brother.So, Memphis enlists the aid of his fellow car thief buddies,including Donny (played by big Chi McBride), a big soul brother,Memphis' mentor Otto (Robert Duval), and a sexy mechanic namedSway (the hot Angelina Jolie) to get the job done before Raymondcan get his chance to whack Kip. What follows is a blisteringquest around Los Angeles to steal the cars while avoiding thecops, led by a weary detective named Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo).The storyline is a bit weak, I have to admit that. The writersof this flick (which is actually an update of the Hal Needhamfilm of the same name) should have put more energy into creatinga stronger, sensible plot, because it's basically nothing morethan to steal fast, beautiful cars for a desperate cause,nothing more.

There is NO action throughout the whole movie. Literally the first half and more is all talking, and nothing else. The cars are awesome, but they show each one for about 10 seconds max. The only one you get to see is a '67 Shelby. You'd think that if people could afford to buy a Diablo, or an XJ220, that they could afford an alarm system, but no apparently they can't. This movie has so many flaws in it, is so predictable, and is just plain boring, it's not worth the time of day. The best part of the movie is the "Jerry Bruckheimer" logo, and that's sad.</fullReview>

A few reunion calls and a good game plan is in order. From the movie trailer, you would expect a whole ton of action and excitement. Instead, we get drama, plenty of talk and a moral attitude amidst a bunch of thieves. Many actors we want to see are very rarely shown. The real fun of course happens only at the climax where Eleanor and the cops meet for a showdown. The fun is there, and it is mindless but you might as well see it in the theater. If you rent it, you would probably realize how boring it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who think Michael Bay the Great Satan of American Cinema should change their tune after seeing this summer's Bruckheimer blockbuster. In lieu of Bay's gleaming images cadged from Bud Lite commercials and Smashmouth videos, a promiscuous use of green, yellow and white fluorescents that give the female actors over forty a chemotherapy look. In lieu of ARMAGEDDON's snappy, team-generated dialogue, miserable gags about doggie poop. In lieu of Bay's head-smashing kinesis, the forward momentum of a subpar STARSKY AND HUTCH. Poor Nicolas Cage actually looks sad and ashamed to be dinging the bell on another big-time payday. Robert Duvall seems to be controlling his desire to sprint off the set. Angelina Jolie continues to wear the skanky-junkie look of Gia Carangi (to which many blazing white lights have been employed, so as to disguise her pallor); how can it be that this actress, who so recently seemed like Marlon Brando reborn as a supermodel, could have become so attitudinous, so boring, so last month? There are nice turns by Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo and Will Patton. There are also a lot of really sucky actors (explain this one: who hires Scott Caan?) that make the screenwriter Scott Rosenberg's would-be Hawksian teamwork a non-starter, to say the least. Bruckheimer doesn't hire sucky actors. He hires ridiculously overqualified actors to populate his car crashes. What happened here? Why didn't Rosenberg's script get rewritten? Why couldn't they hire even a hack on the level of Simon West? Why did they hire a DP whose specialty is uglification? Was Bruckheimer spending all his time casting the faint-inducing cuties of COYOTE UGLY?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Packed with action in S. California, Nic Cage is good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow I missed this movie when it came out in 2000, but was able to borrow the DVD. I in general like Nic Cage and his roles, and I like him here. There aren't many honorable characters here, but they make the story palatable by keeping the killing to a bare minimum.Nicolas Cage is Memphis Raines, known car thief, perhaps the best ever, who has now gone straight. But he gets a visit, seems that his younger brother, Giovanni Ribisi as Kip Raines, has gotten in with the wrong element and, having just botched a heist is threatened with death, unless Memphis can help out. He doesn't want to, but also doesn't want his brother killed.Memphis has to assemble a crack team and plan everything just right, because his task is to steal a list of 50 specific cars over one 24-hour period and deliver them to a shipping container at the Long Beach wharf. This represents quite a cast of characters, including Angelina Jolie as Sara 'Sway' Wayland, Scott Caan as Tumbler, Will Patton as Atlee Jackson, Chi McBride as Donny Astricky, and the old veteran, Robert Duvall as Otto Halliwell.A heist wouldn't be very interesting without a group of law officers trying to foil their plan. They are led by Delroy Lindo as Det. Roland Castlebeck and his sidekick Timothy Olyphant as Detective Drycoff.In spite of the time devoted to the preparation for the heists, and one very long and spectacular chase scene near the end, this is basically a character study. Big brother and little brother. Old friends. Law enforcement trying to do the right thing.It is an interesting 2 hours.MAJOR SPOILERS: Memphis saves his favorite car for the last heist, the 1967 Shelby Mustang. This is the chase scene, and even though he does many improbable things, arrives as the 50th car in Long Beach, even though it is highly damaged. But he is 12 minutes late and the bad guy won't accept it. In fact he decided to kill Memphis for having pointed a gun at him a few days earlier when trying to rescue his brother. So a shoot-out ensures and the bad guy falls to his death after cornering the cop, Castleback. Memphis saved the cop's life. In return the cop told Memphis to beat it, make himself scarce. In return Memphis told him to send someone to check out a shipping contained of stolen cars. The bad guy dies and everyone else comes out OK.</fullReview>

The film comes up with a reasonable concept in which he can steal many cars but still look like the good guy - that he does it under duress.Cage is a mercurial actor: in this film he underplays the grandstanding a bit and it's better for it. Christopher Ecclestone's entry to the pantheon of Brits-playing-bad-guys is good if a little humourless. Giovanni Ribisi is the whining brother Kip who, frankly, deserves everything he gets. Angelina Jolie is the totty. It's not a great film and is virtually laminated with the gloss put on the picture, although it can be exciting. Avoid if you love old school Mustangs. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My new girlfriend, henceforth known as my Better Half, is intrigued by my side-interest in reviewing movies and wanted to see how I'd handle one of her DVDs. The trouble is, her celluloid tastes differ wildly from mine. "Alive", "The Green Mile" and "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" are all well and good but I'm afraid I have no desire to see them. The same goes with "Jackie Brown", a DVD I bought some time ago and still have little impetus to sit down and watch. Then I stumbled across this, a bizarre addition to her collection next to "The Horse Whisperer" (*shudders*). Finally finding a movie with some testosterone, we sat down to watch this typically flash-bang Bruckheimer movie in each others arms. Aaaaah! Nicolas Cage leads an impressive cast as Memphis Raines, a former car-thief with legendary skills. Sadly, Memphis cannot retire in peace as his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) gets into some trouble with local British hoodlum Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) and forces Memphis to return to the city after six years away. Calitri needs Memphis to steal fifty cars in four days or his brother will be killed so reluctantly, Memphis rounds up his old crew including veteran petrol-head Otto (Robert Duval), silent psycho mortician Sphinx (Vinnie Jones) and beautiful tomboy and Memphis' former squeeze Sway (Angelina Jolie). And as if his task wasn't hard enough, Memphis has to contend with his old nemesis Det. Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) sniffing around - a cop still haunted by his failure to put Memphis behind bars.Regular cinema attendees will know exactly what to expect from a Bruckheimer movie. Just like John Woo fans expect lots of slow motion gun battles and doves, Bruckheimer aficionados love the mix of high style, glamour and rapid action sequences. And so it proves here - "Gone In Sixty Seconds" is possibly the clearest example of style-over-substance. The action, particularly the frequent car chases, are excellent and exciting - much better than "Bad Boys", another Bruckheimer production. The cars themselves certainly look and sound the part (needed more Jaguars for my tastes but still...) and most of the actors acquit themselves well. The fly in the ointment is Jolie who looks bored and upset at having so little to do. Likewise Jones as Sphinx though given his fledging career thus far, he's probably just happy to share a screen with Duval and Cage. Also, the soundtrack is a real winner from Moby's opening to Apollo 440's classic "Stop The Rock". One CD I intend to find shortly, let me tell you! However, other Bruckheimer trademarks are not so welcome. A typically paper-thin premise is stretched to breaking point and despite the cast and cars, the whole thing feels deeply superficial. It doesn't seem to go anywhere, like it's stuck in third gear and never really hits its stride until the night of the heist itself. And apart from a few standout moments, the whole thing is somewhat forgettable. Oh, you'll enjoy the film certainly but you're never sure exactly why. It's fun in a switch-your-brain-off sense, much like other wheel-based action films like "Smokey And The Bandit" though this is better than almost anything with Burt Reynolds in. If you had to watch a road-based movie then I'd probably make it this one or the original French version of "Taxi" but in truth, there are only so many things you can do with a car. If "Gone In Sixty Seconds" was a car then it would be a Lotus Elise - good to look at but not exactly what I'd call a classic.</fullReview>

The characters were too goofy and heroic to be believable, and the story was much too soft and kind compared to the original. The crew steals pretty nice cars, but too many times, when they steal the cars it was just too silly to be an action thriller. The only good thing about this movie was the main car of the movie..a Shelby Mustang GT500, which, I admit was really nice. Makes you want to drive one. Watch if you're bored or a have nothing better to do, otherwise don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of INCREDIBLE!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt that I've actually given away anything crucial in the following commentary, but I've noted it as a "spoiler" just to be on the safe side.GONE in SIXTY SECONDS: I've read quite a number of comments from people who, like Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi), miss the point entirely. The story that Jerry Bruckheimer promises (as is extremely obvious by the opening credits alone) is about family. Look very closely at not only the photos, but also the surrounding props during the opening credits.The film is less "pure action" than some of Bruckheimer's other films, with more focus on character development and, most importantly, /WHY/ the characters behave as they do. This makes for a much deeper film experience than one would normally expect from his films.Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage) is possibly the greatest car thief ever to haunt Long Beach; auto theft in the area dropped by 47% when he 'retired'. When Kip blows a major boost while trying to fill his older brother's shoes, only "Memphis" can bail him out. Even then, he /can't/ do it until their mother (Grace Zabriskie) releases him from a years-old promise to never steal cars again.Some beautifully exotic cars are stolen (including my personal fave; a 71 DeTomaso Pantera). $200,000 is at stake as payoff for the delivery. "Old school" melds with "new school", closing the gap as differing generations of car thieves unite in a common cause...But the story... The HEART of what ties it all together is family. Not merely those related by blood, but by bonds of love and friendship. Brothers in arms, united once more.Such as his old flame Sway (Angelina Jolie), his mentor Otto (Robert Duvall), and his closest pals Atley (Will Patton), Astricky (Chi McBride), and Sphinx (Vinnie Jones), each of whom who felt "put out" to varying degrees by his disappearance from their lives years earlier.Keep this one aspect in mind as you watch 'Gone in Sixty Seconds', whether for the first time or the thousandth time, and I will guarantee you will enjoy the movie even more. You'll be hoarse from cheering on "the bad guys", and some scenes will bring tears to the eyes of the hardest "tough guy". Buckle up and brace yourself for an emotional roller-coaster even wilder than the climactic chase scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Good Car Flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With other films like "The Fast and the Furious" coming out around the same time "Gone in Sixty Seconds" did, I expected "Sixty Seconds" to be another forgettable car chase movie hyped up on testosterone. I was wrong. "Gone in Sixty Seconds" turned out to be a surprisingly good car flick with a good car chase at the end. I definitely recommend it -- especially if you're sick of other car film like "The Fast and the Furious," which are just adrenaline pumped films with no real car chases worth remembering... It's not a "great" action film, but it's good, and in my opinion the best car film of 2000 when compared to "Furious".

		<fullReview>Who thought this would be a good idea for a movie!? I ought to slap that person about a million times! Nicolas Cage is in it, it is from the producer of ARMAGEDDON and it is about stealing cars. You would think this would be good, right? Wrong! Somehow, the writer managed to write one of the crappiest scripts to ever see paper.Dominic Sena wasted a hell of a lot of film and plastics to produce this crap on VHS and DVD. As soon as I get this film back from my friend, I am tossing it out my second floor window. Maybe if I'm lucky, it will hit the director and writer in the head. So, if you like stupid movies, you will like this. There is a sex scene that I don't mind that much, but other than that...I advise you to burn this as quickly as humanly possible.GONE IN 60 SECONDS gets 1/5 only because there were a couple explosions and some of the car chase sequences were okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless waste of talent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was disappointing. Short on action, overlong on pointless (and mostly unsuccessful) scenes of character building, this could only have been saved by spectacular stunts and driving. Well, maybe the stunts were there, but when such scenes are shot like a music video, not giving you enough time to digest what's happening before the next quick cut, confusion wins over excitement. And when a film like this seems to rely on CGI rather than genuine spectacle, you start to question the point of it.?Memphis' Rains (Cage) is a retired car thief with a ridiculous name and an errant brother, who gets himself into trouble in the first reel. To save his brother, Rains must steal 50 rare and expensive cars in a single night, with the help of an outsized ? and mostly wasted - supporting cast. Ribisi and Lindo are the exceptions, almost delivering their dull dialogue in an interesting way. Jolie is cool and sexy as always, even if she is little more than a token babe. Chemistry between her and Cage just wasn't happening.Having not seen the original, I gather its selling point was a chase that lasted for nearly half the film's length. Opinion seems to be that modern audiences want their action scenes in small doses, but I don't believe or understand that for a second. Wading through a dull film for a couple of minutes of action just wasn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very shallow script; lame story line; wasted star studded cast; but enough action to keep your eyes on the screen. Lovers of fine cars will be in Heaven. Memphis Raines(Nicolas Cage)is a recently retired genius car thief that must come to the rescue of his little brother(Giovanni Ribisi). Raines must gather a crew and boost 50 exotic cars in one night in exchange for the life of his brother. Cage can say so much with his mannerisms and expressions to make up for the script. Robert Duvall wants to take charge of the movie so bad you can see it. A blonde Angelina Jolie is sassy and sexy and that is enough. Gosh, she makes me sweat. Will Patton is like a fish out of water. Ribisi is just a little over the top, but after all his life is at stake.Not one of the best action/crime flics, but sure is fun to watch. At times, Cage and Jolie are at the flash point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever saw.First. The romantic angle between Cage and Jolie is a joke. They spent about five minutes in this movie flirting or talking about their old relationship. Then Jolie spends the rest of the movie blowing kisses and winking at every guy in the movie.Second. This film had a good cast. It was completely wasted though, they should have been given something more to do rather walk round, look cool, steal cars and talk crap. I've never seen a film where the characters were so stereotyped as well. Duvall's old gearhead, Cage's master thief to the rescue, Jolies tomboy, Jones silent thug, Ecclestons English baddie and Lindo's hard nosed cop.Third. Giovanni Ribbsi who plays Cage's brother looks bored. I've seen Boiler Room and thought he gave a good performance but in this film he just doesn't try hard enough. His character comes off as a sleazy little b*****d who I couldn't care less whether they saved him or not.Fourth. This is a film about car thieves, not a very popular bunch. When talking about Cage's special car (I forget which kind it was) someone mentions he's never been able to steal one of these. Here's a hint, STOP STEALING CARS THEN. I mean what is the audience supposed to do hope he steals this classic car, as if.Fifth. The car chase at the end is not one of the best; in fact it's pretty lame.I didn't like this movie and would advise anybody not to see it.3 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Cage. An even bigger fan of cars. And by my terms , the biggest fan of Jolie. Whaddayaknow! Gone in 60 seconds was one heck of a good movie. They have some awesome lines in this car thriller. To quote a few,"The cars are on the boat or your brothers in the coffin." "Metals cold , ugly. Woods warm provided by nature. Watching a piece of furniture take shape is like watching a child grow." "You have 60 seconds to consider your options. .................. ......................... be a big brother." "Then bring me his brother. One Raines is as good as the other. It never rains but it pours." .......and so many more. I understand that IMDb has a database of these quotes. But it was worth mentioning them cause that is what makes up this movie apart from cars. They have such awesome cars and lines, you wouldn't care about character development, really. Although, you must give it to Cage for having dug out an awesome performance for his character "Memphis" Raines. A thought for the soundtrack too: I fell in love with "The Cult" after I heard "Painted on my Heart" play swan song to a beautiful Lamborghini. I frankly don't understand why people are giving this movie a hard time ! What did they expect? An aria boosting 50 top end cars at the Sydney Opera House?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless stuff for little boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his little brother messes up while doing a job for crime boss Raymond Calitri, ex-car thief Memphis Raines is reluctantly recruited to finish the job by stealing 50 further luxury cars within 4 days or else his brother will be killed. With time ticking away Memphis goes to his old mentor Otto and forms a crew for one quick crime spree.At the cinema this didn't appeal to me, or video, and even the free to air television screening was only an option after a fit of not having anything else worth doing for 2 hours. Taking the risky line of not having any worthwhile plot, characters or consistently good action, the film turns out to be an inflated bag of hot air and noise. The plot sounds simple when summarised and indeed, it is. Spice is sort of added to the mix by the involvement of the cops and some sort of possible confrontation with Calitri but it is still a very simplistic affair indeed.The action doesn't actually cover any of the holes and there is only one semi-enjoyable chase that occurs at the end of the film. Up till then it is an uneasy mix of comic banter and flashy cars. For a film that relies so much on spectacle not to have several big action scenes is just unforgivable ? what did the producers actually expect me to watch this for ? the chance to see expensive cars? I can go to a motor show for that!The actors are given weak characters and can do nothing with them. Cage was once a good actor but has sold his soul to action here, his performance is lifeless and his attempts to bring some sort of emotional core to the film fails badly. Actors like Duvall, Lindo and Ribisi only make themselves look bad in this ? slumming around, going through the motions in a tiresome manner. Eccleston is a poor baddie who seems toothless, the film attempts to give him quirks (the wood furniture) but really he is dull in the extreme and almost an non-issue. Jolie looks OK which is really all she's given to do ? her character is paper thin, they might as well have called her `breasts' rather than pretend she had a part to play.Overall this film lives and dies on it's action and spectacle as the plot and characters are all poorly written and developed. The fact that the film fails to have more than one good action sequence just shows how badly this whole thing has been done. If you like seeing flashy cars then this may be for you or if you are very easily pleased in the action department then you should be OK ? I just thought the whole thing was about as solid as smoke and not worth my time ever again.</fullReview>

Confused? Me, too. I know, we're talking about Hollywood movies. I know that the script can be quesionable, if the action is okay. I know... But what were all those pseudo-relationships about? I enjoyed watching the cars, but I can do this every day at the car dealer's, so why wasting 2 hours for a film like this?

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage plays Randall 'Memphis' Raines, a retired car thief who must come back to his old job one more time to steal 50 cars with help from his crew in one night to save his brother's life. Oscar winning actor Nicolas Cage gives a brilliant performance as usual. Angelina Jolie is quite a good job too. I also think Giovanni Ribisi did a really good performance. I've recently been thinking that he's a great actor. Now, obviously Gone In 60 Seconds is a Jerry Bruckheimer produced movie. (Dominic Sena, being the director. Who also did a brilliant job.) So, it's of course got loads of action. That's of course a good thing, if that's what you're expecting to see. The movie has an interesting story to go with all the good action, with Scott Rosenberg writing this great screen-play. I give Gone in 60 Seconds a 10/10.NB: If you enjoyed all the car action in Gone In 60 Seconds, than I also recommend The (Brilliant.) Fast And The Furious. It's just as fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To save his kid brother from being whacked for failing to deliver on a car theft job to a hood named Calitri, Nick Cage comes back to town to do a job for that hood. He rounds up Robert Duvall and assorted others, including Angelina Jolie. Breathing down his neck is cop Delroy Lindo. The climax naturally is a long car chase.The movie is a 4 or 5, so I give it the benefit of the doubt, as I usually do. However, it's an uncomfortably bad movie: boring, predictable, juvenile, hackneyed, and horribly edited. The director and film editor need to learn how to make a movie. There is zero suspense and zero thrills when action scenes are simply chopped up so much that the viewer cannot follow the action. The movie should have taken more time to show the cars, supposedly so great, that were being stolen, not ignitions and windows being broken. What a bore. The challenges were contrived.Nick Cage did a very fine job acting. He saves the movie from disaster. Without him, it's mostly nothing but juveniles running around with the exception of Lindo mainly and Jolie, who handles her small part and Duvall who handles his.Everyone else is trying to act so cool and hip, and that includes the brothers, that they come off being absurdly uncool. To be cool, the picture would have had to make them actually underplay and be cool, not overplay. The same goes for the film editing. Dozens of movies, including Italian-French policiers, show how car chases can be done, or even To Live and Die in LA.Oh yes, Will Patton. He's good. He's typically good, as in No Way Out, but I can't say he had much of a part here. He had no real character to dig into. A Brit played Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). He had a tough time emitting the words, so many words, and being a tough guy. He probably should be playing in a drawing room comedy of manners or a remake of Room at the Top. He was miscast. Lindo's assistant (Timothy Olyphant) was uncomfortably bad. Let's hope he does better with other directors in other vehicles. Who was the director anyway? It was Dominic Sena. He had done mainly videos, and maybe that's why this movie is so herky-jerky.If I'm being biased against this style of movie, so be it. I don't think it involves us in the audience deeply enough as the material warrants. I consider it superficial. It turns off our emotions and makes us witnesses of glitz, flash, rapid movement, and really nothing at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before collecting great cars, the movie collects awful clichés: the kid brother in danger, the fearless old brother in rescue, the unidimensional villain (that Eccleston plays always poorly), Angelina as the eternal lost girl and a band of thieves with great hearts! The height of absurdity is reached with bringing the 50th car with 12 minutes late and the villain, having already 49 Porsches, BMW and Ferrari, calls the deal off! In addition, for a car movie remake, it looks like more to "T2": the LA river chase, the steel factory !Well, what's left then? The car sequences aren't too bad in spite of the heavy filtering of the colors. Above all, Cage knows as always how to reach his audience and put us in his pocket. It's only unfortunate that he chooses only poor movies to express his talent.</fullReview>

His life is disrupted by the news his brother is in trouble and will lose his life if he does not manage to steal fifty (50) cars in about 24 hours and they have to be very expensive. Memphis Raines calls up some old friends he used to work with in his car stealing days and manages to get plenty of help. Angelina Jolie, (Sway Wayland) adds lots of excitement to Memphis Raines life and their is some hot moments in a car that will steam up the windows. Robert Duvall appears in this film along with many other great supporting actors. There is plenty of action and lots of police cars running after Memphis Raines who does a great job of getting away from them all. Great entertaining film you will enjoy from the beginning to the very end.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed her in Girl, Interrupted as much as possible considering the subject matter, and I really liked her character in the Bone Collector, but I never paid her much attention. She was just the latest bit of fluff to sit on Billy Bob Thornton's lap, and nothing much more.Cage contributes an adequate performance herein, but I have to say Jolie's work tops his in quality, this time around. Cage appears distracted, unable to concentrate, and maintain a viable believable emotional state, be it edge, excitement or grief. I'm more than a casual Cage fan, so I find this a difficult review.The story is a great story if you are a fan of actioners, and the direction was adequate, what brought this down, really, is a deteriorating state of social conscience (as reflected in this script) and Cage's seeming inability to hold a coherent dialog in his head.Otherwise, this is quite enjoyable and rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Gone in 60 Seconds' has everything you'd expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer film but what's great is that the film makes it a strength rather than a weakness like ConAir. Firstly the cast of characters is simply brilliant. Though I've gotten a little sick of Nicholas Cage's face to see him hanging out with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall is a change I wouldn't pass up for anything.What's also great is that the film steps out of reality and into the real of Bruckeimer World in a way that balances out the bad stuff. People commit crimes but only the badguys kill people. These are the basic rules that are never broken except when it's time for the protagonist and antagonist to face off.Being a big fan of the "Grand Theft Auto"-games I naturally couldn't help finding comparisons in both characters and events and this also helps to accept some of the ridiculousness of the film. What's great is that the film is essentially a harmless action comedy... with style.The only minus this movie receives from me is that while the grading was obviously a conscious choice for the film-makers it did make me feel a little ill looking at it for a long time.</fullReview>

There's nothing to really complain about in GISS because you don't complain about odorless, colorless, and non-toxic gas.Which is what this movie is.So, without further delay, kick her over and give her a ride.I mean the movie, you dolts.

The soundtrack is also unforgettable, especially the opening song, and the main theme. The weak side of the movie are the moments that should be funny or maybe cult, like the "sex in car" scene between Cage and Jolie.

Jaime Bergman is on the Seat next to the Driver but the Driver is Joe Flanigan and doesn't appear to be credited in IMDbI would like if this could be corrected. Feel free to check this before adding him to the credits in IMDb.Thanks, Tracker_au</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gone in Sixty Seconds" tries to inject some nitro into the heist-caper genre. As far as sheer style goes, it may have succeeded, but as story and characters go, it's simply formula.Nicholas Cage plays Randall "Memphis" Raines, a notorious car thief that has "gone clean". He is called back into action because his brother Kip (great name), who attempted to follow his brother's legacy, has a death notice on his head by a big wig shipping magnate, because Kip lost some cars Kip owed the magnate. Wonderfully original set-up, isn't it? Memphis and the magnate make a deal: steal 50 cars with 24 hours and Memphis' brother will live. Oh, yeah: the cops and some bad-boy gangs are going to be causing trouble along the way.The set-up is way darn fast so as to not keep the audience waiting for the action, yet this fast ignition of the heist plot is way rushed and does not give any depth to anything. We basically have the plot laid out in front of us by page 2 of the script. But never mind. That's not the movie's point.The point of the movie is the thrills, spills, and chills of stealing breathtakingly gorgeous automobiles. After the set-up, the film is basically one huge montage of various members of Memphis' team hijacking, hotwiring, and zapping the security systems of cars ranging from a Jaguar concept car to a 50's Caddy. (FYI, hotwiring a Ferrari is a wee trickier than Angelina Jolie makes it seem. Maybe it's her horrific hairdo that scares the cars into starting.) Of course, this is all stylishly wrapped in a thumping, nerve-wracking soundtrack by Trevor Rabin and Tony Scott-wannabe cinematography that quickly loses its purpose. The coup-de-grace of this film is a hardball chase sequence between the LAPD and Nicholas Cage driving Eleanor, an absolutely beautiful '67 Shelby GT 500. I won't give much away about this chase, but you can bet you'll be seeing segments of it in home theater demonstrations.Gone in Sixty Seconds is a film you'd go see if you just have time to spare and a couple bucks to spend. It will give you thrills for the moment, but afterwards, you won't even feel a rush when you barely make a yellow light. Movies like "Bullitt" and "The Italian Job" are much better car-related crime films. The filmmakers get the job done here, but without making the film amount to much. The only thing I really loved with a passion was the Shelby GT 500. Period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick had its share of humorous moments and the special effects were very good but (as I like to do), lets get to the acting. Now Raines' brother was not the best actor I've ever seen, kinda whiny and pathetic. Delroy Lindo as usual has a handful of hilarious moments but what I liked the best was how Nicholas Cage, even with his over-acting pulls it off. The over-acting on his part really made his character funny. Watch as he goes into the Ferrari dealership and deals with the salesperson. Check out his performance at the coffee shop. Me and my kids both rewound that part about fifty times. If you're looking for realistic or true to life this probably wont do it for you. Overall, "SHOOTER" shoots this one an 8, on the basis of entertainment value and humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great Car theft film ,that's really quite entertaining, with some wicked Car chases, and fun performances all around!. All the characters are great, and the story is pretty good as well, plus Nicolas Cage is simply amazing in this!. While it did take a little while to get going, it was always entertaining, and Nicolas Cage proves once more that he can play a top notch Action hero, plus I haven't seen the original but Really enjoyed this remake. One of my favorite stunts is when cage uses the Mustang (Elanora) and is all surrounded by Cop cars, he decides to do a big jump, as that was really cool, and I have to say I enjoyed this more then Fast And The Furious(even though that was pretty good too), plus it's pretty well made and written as well. I also loved how Cage drove in reverse to avoid getting nailed by this huge truck, and Angelina Jolie isn't too shabby in her role, plus I really dug the ending, as it was quite cool!. It's basically brainless entertainment but great brainless entertainment, and Christopher Eccleston played a pretty good villain, plus it's often quite tense at times. This is a great Car theft film, that's really quite entertaining, with some wicked Car chases, and fun performances all around, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Dominic Sena does a great! Job here with very good camera work, awesome angles, and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!. Nicolas Cage is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is a major bad ass, looked damn cool, was extremely likable, had good chemistry with Duvall, Jolie and Ribisi, proved he is good at being an action hero too, brought lots of charisma,as he was so convincing! (Cage Rules!!!!!!!). Giovanni Ribisi is excellent playing Cage's younger brother Kip, he was likable, and you root for Cage to get him out of danger,although sometimes he was a bit too low key, but that's a minor thing. Angelina Jolie didn't have all that much to do but did what she had to rather well, she was also really quite sexy, as I'm not overly fussed on her as other people are, but I dug her here, maybe there is something to her after all. Will Patton is great as Watley, he had a cool character I really dug him. Delroy Lindo is always a plus in any film he's in here is no different he played another awesome Cop role!. Timothy Olyphant is usually awesome but disappointed me here, as he was too restrained, he still had a couple of good scenes though. Christopher Eccleston is pretty good as the villain he was menacing and did a good job. Robert Duvall is fantastic as always and did just fine in his role, I just wished he had more screen time. Chi McBride is funny here in his role he was good. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an awesome movie for all fellow car buff's out there. Also it is a great thriller movie. This movie has some of the hottest car from today as well as old muscle from years past. The 1968 Shelby GT500 in the movie is amazing. I know it sure made wish I had one. Also the Porsche 911 Turbo was great as well! If you want to see some of the best car all in one movie this it.This movie is not just about the cars it also has some heart and meaning in it. The story line is good, not great. It's about 2 brothers. The older brother is a retired car booster, "Randall" and the younger brother still is boosting cars, "Kip". Now Kip has a big boost to do, its a 50 car boost. One night while he's out boosting a car him and his buddy's get caught and don't complete the order. This makes the mob boss who requested the order very mad. He will kill Kip if him and his brother Randall do not complete the order in 3 days. So both Randall and Kip work together with both of their friends to complete the order so Kip can live. In the process of this they get to drive/still some of the most amazing cars from the past and future!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the scene where Memphis played by N.Cage is passing the list of cars around,Director Dominic has casted very neatly every car along with its performance and passion to be stolen! but i would like to write out the points where he could not make out or where mistakes happened... When Memphis breaks the mirror off the Shelby Mustang, it remains hanging by it's wires. The problem with this is that Ford wasn't putting power mirrors on cars.The whole premise of the movie is that Kip Raines by Giovanni Ribils who tries to fill in the list of cars and his brother had to finish it for the Russian crook. The idea that Kip would have the skill and manpower to do this, when the black gang that chases them later seems to specialize in this type of crime, is stupid. Even though he was the brother of Memphis, the most famous car thief in the area, this is quite a lapse by the Russian and almost impossible to swallow. The Russian may have thought that Kip was trained by Memphis and had the same connections. It's very possible as they were family.The famous "RAINES" The assumption would have been made that Kip worked alongside Memphis, not knowing that Memphis did not want Kip stealing cars.As he left his profession for kip's good carrier and a promise to his mom.Regarding the theft of the 3 Mercedes, a huge issue is made of the fact that the cars cannot be stolen without the proper keys, which have to come from Germany. So how did the Caan kid get the dealership to order, have shipped and receive the keys within a couple of days? Even with a rush delivery, shipping would be at least overnight, and the keys would need time to be manufactured. Unlike the keys needs to have a duplicate ready to be dispatched by Some private Jet or so!!!When Detective Castelbeck played by Delroy Lindo and his partner are searching the warehouse with the UV lights, they find the list of the cars written with the UV reactive ink. When Castelbeck raises his arm the power cable of the UV light can be seen going into his jacket sleeve to a power supply somewhere inside it. he he...The cord can be seen in a few other shots during this scene. It appears that they are using standard light fixtures, with UV bulbs, the same fixtures that you can get at any hardware store, ones that require them to be plugged in. Just because they do not show them plugging them in, doesn't mean they are battery operated. When Castlebeck discovers the black light car list, he says that there are only a few cars that they should follow, the rarest ones. He chooses several to watch including a Hummer. When Sphinx played by Vinnie and Mirror Man steal the truck and are ramming the police unit, we can see from the badges on the hood and steering wheel that this is actually the Lamborghini LM SUV and not a Hummer!!!!When the Raines brothers are taking refuge in the diner from the black gang, Kip sneaks out and hooks up the BACK of the Mercedes to the cable via the tow hook in the rear frame. When the wrecker leaves, the cable is connected to the FRONT axle which is ripped out. Kip actually loops the cable round both axles and attached the tow hook to the rear. So when the wrecker leaves, the cable is tightened and rips out the front axle. If the tow hook was just attached to one place, the car would just be dragged down the road.Also the Artistic creation of The Russian crook was broken by Memphis - where his deal was in millions and why would one be worried about art and wooden carpentry! This Shot needs to be seen after reading, try to watch it at least twice.I would rate it a 7 out of 10.it a watchable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi,I don't understand why everyone gives this movie such a low score? I've seen a lot of movies and this one is my favorite because it has a great worked out storyline, OK it's quite simple but it's been worked out very good in my opinion, and the characters are also well played by top stars nicolas cage &amp; angelina jolie.The level of realism is maybe exaggerated like stealing that many cars in one night but most of it is quite realistic (not that I'm a car thief) example: in the beginning they've got a stolen mercedes sitting there, the newest one. now if it's been sitting there for 6 hours or more they would already have tracked it.Every person who I've mentioned Gone in 60 seconds all say that is was great and still it's got such a low score?F&amp;F now that's a crap film but for a car film this is the best film.. Maybe you Americans are just to used to good stuff?Xyus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film but spot the Continuity Error.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a very simple plot wrapped around some very intense chase sequences. Although some of the stunts look too fake (Eleanors jump) it is a great film overall. Nick Cage does well with a script where he's upstaged by the car element of the film. Angelina Jolie adds the sex or even very slight romantic interest to the plot, whilst Vinnie Jones proves the point that you still don't have to speak to have a presence on screen. The only concerns I have is the Det. Castlebecks partner has a very annoying knack for stating the completely obvious and that Mercedes dealers would have checked their staff better than the one in the film obviously did. The ending has its moments and isn't as predictable as you may have first thought from the rest of the film. The Continuity Error.... When Donny knocks the kid down that tries to take the Jaguar XJ6 off him at gunpoint leaving the multi-storey car park, when the film goes to the list the XJ220 gets crossed off. The XJ220 doesn't get dropped off till later on in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GONE IN 60 SECONDS (2000) ** Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo, Will Patton, Christopher Eccleston, Chi McBride, Vinnie Jones, Timothy Olyphant, Scott Caan, TJ Cross, William Lee Scott, James Duval, Grace Zabriskie, Master P, Arye Gross, Frances Fisher.Surprisingly action-free, action/car chase flick produced by usual deliverer of popcorn thrills Jerry Bruckeheimer streamlines this loose remake of the 1974 cult indie flick of the same name with wasted talent and 1 (count 'em ONE) car chase (!) Cage, running on vapors since his Oscar win, stars as legendary car thief Memphis Raines (great name huh?) forced into one final heist to save his dumb younger brother (Ribisi, slumming for the $) from a venal Eurotrash gangster (Eccleston, ditto) with 4 days to steal 50 vintage cars. Enlisting his mentor in crime Duvall (the same) and former flame Jolie (who smartly is in like maybe 5 minutes of the film total!!) Cage sets the plan in action with his old cronies and new (and incredibly stupid) apprentices to do the impossible.What's impossible is the ridiculous screenplay by Scott Rosenberg and listless direction by Dominic Sena. Granted the chase isn't too bad; it's just the remainder of the bulk of the film that stinks. Think a muscle car with the engine of an Edsel and you get the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sigh. It was good, but only as a good dose of mindless action. On the other hand, it also had the same drawbacks that The Rock, Armageddon, and Enemy of the State had.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone in 60 Seconds was a true Jerry Bruckheimer film. It has the fast-paced action, the big Hollywood stars, the fancy camera work, and the awkwardly tacked on bit of romance, but overall it was a disappointment. Much like Mission: Impossible II, it had great stunts, but they stretched the imagination to the breaking point (a scene on a bridge packed with traffic late in the film comes immediately to mind).Nicholas Cage plays a retired legendary car thief named Randall Raines, who now runs a go-kart track for kids, what a nice guy. That's even more manipulative than his name in The Rock (Stanley Goodspeed), another Bruckheimer film. And yes, someone does manage to say, "When it Raines, it pours," although the line seems to have been meaninglessly thrown in.The film also had a few continuity problems as well. At one point, the thieves are stealing a beautiful Cadillac SUV out of a garage in a residence, in the backyard of which there appears to be a jumping barbecue party going on. This was at only a couple of hours before the deadline at which point the 50 stolen cars were expected to be delivered. At one hour to that deadline, the sun is up. That party was either still going strong at 6 o'clock in the morning, or the next scene took place on the other side of the planet.Despite numerous problems like these, Gone In 60 Seconds had its redeeming values. The cars were absolutely beautiful (especially the 1967 Cobra which, like many of the cars, got beaten up pretty badly), Robert Duvall was excellent as the father figure to the reunited band of car thieves (dubiously named Otto), as was Delroy Lindo as the traditional curious cop. But as a whole the film relied too much on the stunts and the cars to carry it along. The story was weak, and the ever-present love-story was badly tacked on. This is not a film to miss, but it is also not a film to actively seek out. If you happen to be at a friend's house someday who owns it or has rented it, watch it and revel in the fact that you didn't pay eight bucks to see it. If you never get around to watching it, you really didn't miss much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Chase Scene.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer's Gone In Sixty Seconds is a cool action film with a not too bright plot set behind characters that are transparent. Nicolas Cage is good as a retired car theif who (like the Rolling Stones) returns for a renual of his old car theft job after 6 years. Angelina Jolie gets second billing, but doesn't have much of a role as you might expect (but she still is as sexy as Pamela Anderson in a tube top and french-cut panties). Best actor in this film is the veteran Robert Duvall who helps out in the 24-hour car heist to save a guy (Giovanni Ribisi) who is Cage's younger brother. Terrific car chase and some good acting don't completely heal up the bad parts in this film, so don't be going to this film looking for Bruckheimer's best. Just a satisfactory effort. B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally don't know why this movie is getting so much crap from people. Granted, Oscar-nominee it definitely isn't, but it sure as hell is a fun movie, especially if you're an automotive buff (I almost had a heart attack when I first saw the '67 Shelby GT-500). Aside from the slew of classic and modern cars that have the ability to make most people drool, there's a great cast to play the parts, and the action is definitely present without being the only aspect of the movie. It's not vulgar (the swears are kept to a moderately low level), and there actually is a plot line to it. The bottom line is, this movie is a fun rental for a Friday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Cat's eye comments follow.Having made a gallizion dollars making colorful wallpaper, Bruckheimer turns in this film to producing something to make his life worthwhile. And he produces a surprizingly sensitive study of class and angst. Obviously, his years of study have paid off: his form is Shakespearean -- to build a story around one character in two bodies. Following French filmmakers and recently Greenaway, he uses a homeopathic character study, the less time on the screen for our main characters, the more powerful.The primary character is a valley girl, a girl of privilege, who has been sheltered her whole life. Never wanting for possessions, never being disciplined, never being loved. One day, she is having some friends over; these are similarly dead. purposeless people (apparently Bruckheimer has a fixation on this crowd). Drugs, sex, thin profundities. Then she encounters some guys stealing her Cadillac SUV. The encounter proves thrilling.Fast forward, she has left her riches, become a homeless prostitute and addict. She seeks the thrills of car theft to recapture that one moment of escape. In that pursuit, we see her here joining a car theft ring composed of a bunch of morons. (This is underscored by using the same crowd of goofs to stand for both the current and past gang.) She needs to take stuff to validate her life. That need now transcends drugs, sex, will. There is a side plot about fraternal fidelity that builds the context for the mechanics of how gangs substitute for family.In other words, this is a Breathless Breathless. It preaches that thrillseeking kills the mind and saps the spirit, and it does so by wrapping its message in thrills. Pretty intelligent, this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just how many movies can there be in which an ex-con has to go in for one last shot? 'Cause that's what Memphis (Nicolas Cage) has to do to save his brother in "Gone in Sixty Seconds". If you're guessing that you've seen this plot before, you most likely have. Half a mo', did I say "plot"? Action flicks with A-list stars don't need no stinkin' plot! Just a lot of car chases. In this case, Memphis has to steal 50 cars in 72 hours or his brother is dead meat. Hmm...now will this cool dude, played by an Oscar-winning actor, be able to pull it off? Wait a minute. I haven't even mentioned the rest of the cast. But do I need to? Isn't it always the case that he assembles a ragtag team of misfits, including a tough woman (Angelina Jolie)? Anyway, there are lots of good movies out there, so why would you bother wasting your time on this? Maybe now that Angelina Jolie is a mother, she'll start making better choices about which movies she chooses. Maybe. Also starring Giovanni Ribisi, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Chi McBride, Robert Duvall, Christopher Eccleston and Vinnie Jones.</fullReview>

Next thing Jerry does is get on the phone to tell everyone he`s making another two hour MTV cinema releaseYup it`s another Summer block buster from Jerry to give bored teenagers something to look at as they guzzle their popcorn . I will be honest though and say at least Bruckheimer and co tried to make a movie that`s a cut above the not too disimilar FAST AND FURIOUS and DRIVEN . The cast featuring such names as Cage , Duvall and Eccleston do their best with their wafer thin characters ( Imagine if we had Bruce Willis , Ediie Murphy and Ben Affleck instead - OMG ) and the central plot of a race against time to steal 50 cars probably looked good on paper but as you might expect GONE IN 60 SECONDS is all about style over substance with a pumping soundtrack . I should alsao point out that no matter the technical worth of this film ( And the technical aspects are actually good ) it doesn`t disguise the fact that there`s only a limited amount of screen time you can award to car chases before everything becomes boring</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw one trailer for this film, I knew it was all going to be a boys and their toys film, with fast cars, cool cars and car chases, just like The Fast and the Furious series kind of stuff, from director Dominic Sena (Swordfish). Basically young car thief Kip Raines (Lost in Translation's Giovanni Ribisi) was supposed to steal fifty listed cars for Raymond Vincent 'Carpenter' Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), but the police foil this plan. Kip's brother Randall 'Memphis' Raines (Nicolas Cage) has been retired from the world of stealing cars for a few years, and Raymond is forcing him to get back into it by threatening Kip's life. He has over 70 hours to get the fifty cars listed or face the consequences, so to help Memphis assembles his old crew, starting with the one who can contact the others, Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall). The crew includes redheaded mechanic Sara 'Sway' Wayland (Angelina Jolie), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Donny Astricky (I, Robot's Chi McBride), Freb (Independence Day's James Duval)and The Sphinx (Vinnie Jones), and Kip helps out too. The plan is to steal most if not all of the cars for the G.R.A.B. (Governor's Regional Auto-Theft Bureau), and with walkie talkies, the gang are using ladies names as code. Trying to catch Memphis and the crew in action are Det. Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Detective Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), and after finding the original list they have a good idea of the final car, nicknamed Eleanor, the 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500. All forty-nine cars apart from this one are present and accounted for, and Memphis speeds to the pit stop a few minutes late. With his being late, Calitri changes his mind and orders Memphis and Kip dead, but don't worry, Castlebeck comes along, and when the villain is defeated and Memphis saves his life, he is let off. Also starring Scott Caan as Tumbler and William Lee Scott as Toby. The all star cast is alright, but it's the cool cars you keep your eye on, and the final high speed car chase is great viewing, it is reasonable action crime drama. Okay!</fullReview>
