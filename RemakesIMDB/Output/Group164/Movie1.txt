		<fullReview>A "great movie" is not necessarily one that combines superb acting, character development, intelligent comedy and artistic direction. Instead, a great movie is one that succeeds in doing what it set out to do, and therefore the original Gone in 60 Seconds is great indeed.The car chase scenes in this movie are superior to all others. The 40 minute chase at the end of the movie is obviously cinematic history, but the chase that excited me the most was when the tow truck was trying (and succeeding) to outrun the police. Critics of this movie fail to understand the joy that is brought to a car-loving audience such as myself when a tow truck with an actual car in tow powerslides and fishtails and eventually gets away. This is not something you see in modern high-budget car chase movies. This is the type of genius you see only in a movie created by a guy who really knows the subject matter.If you want quality acting, well-written drama, and striking cinematography, go elsewhere... it's as simple as that. The world only needs one Lawrence of Arabia. But if you want to be stunned with incredible action scenes featuring REAL cars (instead of oh, say a Lincoln Navigator like the one in the remake), pick up a copy of this movie. And if you must have something to accompany the car chases, listen closely to the dialogue; while it may not be poetic enough for some people's ears, it'll make you laugh whether the writer intended it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best car-chase film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Gone In 60 Seconds" will be remembered by many viewers as the best car-chase film of all time. It will also be remembered as the film that featured lots of destroyed cars in a 40 minute chase. As said in the film's IMDb trivia: "93 cars are crashed in this 97 minute movie." The best part of this whole movie is the 40-minute chase scene. So many cars are crashed and destroyed during the chase, including original city police cars. What's more, the chase scene had absolutely NO special effects, meaning that all the crashes and smashes were real. Furthermore, H.B. Halicki himself wrote, directed, and starred in the movie. He even drove the "star car" (the Mustang) throughout the chase!My only negative comment about the film is that the beginning of the movie is very slow; so slow that you may be very eager to get to the 40-minute chase scene. However, if you have the DVD, you can just watch the film starting from the chase scene if you want to.Overall, this movie had an awesome chase scene. It is the best chase scene ever filmed in a movie. It has to be seen to be believed.P.S: This movie is much much better than the awful remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original car-jack classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only seen trailers for the Summer 2000 release of GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS. But the trailers show a big budget, MTV style editing, and big stars. What it didn't show was that this thriller about a master car thief is a remake of this 1974 no-budgeter by auto man Halicki. The 1974 GI60S's charm is that it is very low budget. Some scenes, such as the auto auction in the run down lot, or the Radio DJ's cramped little studio add to some crisp atmosphere. However, the first half of GI60S is rather amateurish (One entire scene is terribly out of focus) and we have trouble following Halicki's unprofessionally written plot. The second half of the film is a car chase that has to be seen to be believed! In 40 minutes, close to 90 cars are destroyed in a massive auto chase spanning several cities, freeways, parks, lots, you just name it. For all it's sloppiness, the original 1974 version of GI60S has a neat charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this day of "so called" independent film making, the majority ofwhich is backed by big studio money and ruined by the meddlingof "suits", it's so refreshing to see a truly independent film! "GoneIn 60 Seconds" was written, produced, directed and distributed bythe same man, H.B. Halicki, who also stars AND did most of thestunt driving! This is truly a film the likes of which we will never seeagain, thanks to our over-protective, sue-happy, society of wimpsand victims. Several comments are made about the acting in thisfilm. I would say that for none of the cast being professionals, theyhandled themselves very well. And as for this being Halicki's firstfilm as a director, he must've known a few things and/or had somegreat tech people working with him because the film is cuttogether so wonderfully. Then too there is the sheer guiltypleasure of see cars obliterated. I wish I could've seen this on thebig screen. So, if you're looking for a film with a lot of meaning,skip this one. If you just want to enjoy a well crafted little film, andsee lots of Plymouth police cars get crunched--run out and getGONE IN 60 SECONDS (but drive safely, please)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Gone in 60 Seconds is a worthless piece of garbage compared to the original, CLASSIC. '74 doesn't try to make the movie seem anything other than what it is: a car chase movie. H.B. Hilacki is a crooked insurance claim representative that works in a chop shop and steals cars. His main business is stealing cars, then finding an indentical wreck, replacing the stolen cars VIN and other items with parts from the wreck. This group of thieves are much cooler than the 20-something dork-troop that make up the new movie.Halicki's character gets a job from someone: steal 40, high class expensive cars in a matter of days. There is one catch, since Halicki lives by a code: the cars have to be insured. This is how the movie gets away with being able to steal cars and at the same time not make the robbers look like villains. This movie, whil being mostly action, is also a comedy. There are some really cheesey lines, but it's all in good fun so you have to laugh. One scene for example, Halicki steals the prized Eleanor, a 1974 Mustang. But her owner catches him and gives chase. They go tearing through the streets at night, causing wrecks all over the place. Finally the cops pull over the guy that was chasing Halicki and ask him what he was doing. He says he was chasing a guy that stole his car so the cops go back to his house to check. When they get there, though, they find the Mustang parked safely in his garage. HA. This movie contains something the remake doesn't, ACTUAL CAR CHASES. Not incredibly lame helicopter chases and FAKE stunts. No, all the stunts in this movie are 100% real, and a good majority are UNSCRIPTED. Also, 95% of the actors are played by real people. The cops are cops, paramedics are paramedics, pedestrains are pedestrians, and are REALLY running for their lives. The climax of the film is a 40 minute car chase between Eleanor and probably every cop in the city. There are at least 5 or 6 times when you think he is caught, but gets away. This is a really fun movie with the best car chase in movie history. I couldn't imagine anyone liking the remake more than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crap acting, dodgy voice dubbing, lack of plotting... no matter, the reason for this films existence is highly evident, the stunts are superb, the final chase builds like a classical music piece, starting off small and basic before escalating into a full blown crescendo. The sheer amount of destruction on-screen is astounding, but unlike most car chases this actually shows the consequences, with cutaways of the chase "victims" placed in between the hi-octane spills and tyre squealing thrills. Unlike the recent Nic Cage remake, which purports to be a Ferrari but is actually a Fiat Uno in disguise, this version keeps things simple and lets the action do the talking. Shallow, yes, but you'll hard pressed to find a more exciting car chase this side of Ronin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen the remake of Gone In 60 Seconds (not a bad movie either) then you must see this outstanding original. Unfortunately, a movie nowadays could never be done like this. H.B. "Toby" Halicki had a dream and he certainly accomplished it here. He must have had more connections than the Gotti Family. It's good to have connections. You take care of people and they take care of you. Toby certainly took care of people and was given the freedom to make this high octane movie the way he wanted to. He had a magnificent collection of cars, among many other items, and used them all in this movie. He bought cars simply to destroy in the movie. He did his own amazing stunt driving, produced, directed, and everything in this movie. Though no one was a professional actor everyone performed well. This isn't an oscar-winning movie, but it's certainly amazing to see what had to be done to make this movie happen. I think this movie is slowly starting to become a cult classic. I can find it in any store nowadays, along with his other few great movies. If you're a fan of the car chase, you'll love this movie for the realism of the impressive 40 minute car chase at the end of the movie. It is AWESOME! Best thing since Bullitt with Steve McQueen. It's great considering you didn't have the special effects. Enjoy the movie! It's a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey guys, if you want to REALLY enjoy this flick, watch the horrific remake first. You had to be young in the mid 70's to remember the hype that went with this flick. A total B-Grader that had audiences (including me and my 19 year old wife) queued up around the block.Considering its microscopic budget, H B Halicki delivered precisely what audiences wanted to see - truck loads of cars smashed up! No more no less! No-one handed over their (then) $5 expecting to see Sir Laurence Olivier do Hamlet, they just wanted some serious fender-bending and this they got!Admittedly I suspect most people who own the video or DVD these days fast-forward to the actual 40 minute chase each time they load it up. I am actually watching it as I compose this critique! (Right at the sequence at the end where Harley pulls off the big swapperoo at the car wash!) Absolute stand-outs are the incredible smash on the freeway when Halicki takes out the power pole at 80 mph plus and the unimproved-upon final scene as the Mach-1 leaps several cars at the intersection. That shot, lovingly photographed from multiple slow-motion camera angles was worth the ticket price alone. The climactic scene in the 2000 version is just plain wimpy!The plotline for the film is remarkably simple. Man steals cars for a living! For trivia fans who may NOT know. H. B. Halicki died during a stunt filming the sequel GONE IN 60 SECONDS : THE JUNKMAN which features arguably the greatest car stunt of all time. (Sorry, not telling!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing what could be done with a tiny budget and no digital effects. I watched this after having seen the trashy remake, and expected a similar degree of dumb wisecracks and hackneyed sub-plots.I was impressed, however, to discover real talent behind the camera. The plot is simple: a car thief has to steal 40 fancy cars in a very short time. Using a combination of skill, insider knowledge of the insurance business and just sheer brass, the protagonist and his pals start their automotive harvest. Everything seems done and taken care of, when everything goes to hell at the last moment, leading to what surely be the longest car chase put to film.The best thing about this movie is its low-budget feel. Many of the early scenes are almost mimed, with voices overdubbed later; you don't see actual dialogue, just hear it on top of the action. But as things progress, it begins to show more polish, and by the time we get to the big chase, you get what appears to be the entire 7th Cavalry Division in squad cars chasing one li'l yellow Mustang.A very smart touch during the big chase was to frequently cut to the aftermath of car crashes, with wounded cops and civilians being dragged from burning cars and hustled away in ambulances -- it added an edge to the film, to show there are actually consequences to these actions (and how often is that shown on the big screen?).Aside from the marvelously-choreographed action sequences, there are many moments of great wit, which I won't describe so's not to spoil them.All in all, a brilliant piece of film-making, made not with glitz, glamor, star-power or special effects -- just sheer talent (and pretty cars, o'course!).</fullReview>

All very cool! Aren't we glad we moved onto a new millennium!I saw this movie back in 1974 when my wife was out of town and I had a guy's night out! Then completely forgot about it until I went to 2000 version with my 18-year-old son! I told him ... the original was better.Today I bought the original. My wife, my son and I all enjoyed it.It has comedic elements ... the car wash conclusion for example!This is a classic ... just like the "yellow" Eleanor (Looks more like pumpkin to me!)... STUNT movie! Enjoy it for what it is and it is worth a look!As a side ... I used to have a gold 1973 Plymouth Sebring like the blue one featured early in the film. I told my son ...

		<shortDescription>Pure hokum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most movie buffs will be more familar with the remade version starring Nicholas Cage. This movie however is so different and far far away from the remake. The format is the same. Very slow moving for its first segment with lots of jumping around and pointless scenes which have no relation to the plot and a minimum amount of dialogue. The finale of the movie is probably the ultimate in car chase scenes in history. A lenghty car chase with many smash ups on involving police cars. ( these were real members of the public who agreed to appear in the movie, but the cars were specifically bought, 150 in total) is a joy to watch and reminiscent of an episode of TV series "CHIPS".Worth a look for those who want to make a comparison to the recent movie or those into high automative thrills so to speak. I like it beacuse it was so badly acted, so bad that it becomes enjoyable hokum. The DVD which I rented of this a few months ago while in Canada has behind the scenes footage which is worthy of note. Look out also for Gone in Seconds 2 made in 1982 starring Christopher Stone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best and most exciting 70's drive-in car chase movie to ever roar its wild way across the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply one of the best, leanest, fastest, most bluntly straightforward and unpretentious of the numerous fuel-burning, whiplash-inducing, tire-shrieking, rubber-shredding, neck-snappingly quick and spectacularly destructive crash 'em and smash 'em car chase action romps to tear hell broke for next week frenzied across drive-in theater screens back in the 70's. Granted, the plot centering on an underground stolen automobile ring ain't much, the acting is strictly hit or miss, and the film's technical aspects are rather ragged (and frankly who honestly cares about that high-falutin' nonsense?), but what this gloriously gonzo humdinger lacks in depth, story and subtlety it more than compensates for in sheer relentless headlong narrative drive and no-holds-barred insane gas-guzzling motorhead action.The climactic 40 minute (!) car chase across several states (five cities in total), down major highways, over bridges, through building and parking garages, even ripping hither and tither down dirt trails and on bustling crowded sidewalks and parks stands tall as a masterfully well-sustained piece of butt-pulping, metal-bending, supremely testosterone-charged ultra-macho car chase action in excelsis. Jet-powered by snappy, stiletto-sharp editing, a nonstop pile-driving pace, a handful of sensationally spirited country and western tunes, a generous sprinkling of breezily irreverent humor (I love the feisty old lady who angrily smacks the car with her umbrella!), and lots of pure dynamite explosive action choreography, this adrenaline-pumping sequence will have you sucking exhaust fumes for at least a month. It's that incredibly great. And don't kid yourself about that stinky and unnecessary big budget mainstream blockbuster remake starring Nicholas Cage. The original is still the real way-gone stirring deal -- and always shall remain so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly one of the best car chase films of all time. It is substantially better than the flashy new remake, and is much more entertaining. Toby Halicki is a genius of low budget, independent film making. This film cost around one million to make and was worth every penny spent. Eleanor, a 1973 Mustang Mach 1, steals the show(mainly due to the fact that the last 40 minutes of the film are devoted to her). The are some terrific one-liners uttered by the characters, especially the ones that Maindrian Pace(Halicki) says. If you ever get a chance to see this film, please do. It is a superb way to experience the 70's and to see a great car (and great driver)strut their respective stuff. This is a Super Flick!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's my car chase.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from a time of the legendary car chase, think Bullitt, French Connection, Vanishing Point, Italian Job and The Driver. And before Fast and Furious this one stands out as having possibly the best and most realistic chase and definitely has the worst film leading up to the chase.The film was written, produced and directed by stuntman H.B Halicki who also stars as the main car thief and man driver in the chase. And that's what this film is all about the chase, the 93 cars destroyed as Halicki's Maindrian Pace and Eleanor (the Ford Mustang, credited in the film) sped around various parts of Los Angeles (Long Beach to Carson) past unsuspecting bystanders, who had no idea what they were seeing was not a real police chase.While the chase is spectacular, the film leading up to it is awful, made cheaply and badly, seemingly overdubbed, also badly. It is maybe worth fast forwarding to the start of the chase and ignoring what came before because it doesn't really matter.If you are a fan of car chases then this film is a must watch. I would rate it as the second best chase, only because Maindrian was not on a mission from god.Featured on Episode 74 of The Emerald Reprobates Podcast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gone in 60 Seconds" is easily one of the great car chase movies, and it works almost in spite of its inherent "rough" quality. The acting here is pretty low-rent, and the pacing (for the first half, that is) is probably on the sedate side for the modern audience. Me, I was in candyland with one shot after another of '70s muscle cars, not to mention the array of foreign sports (Panteras don't grow on trees). And the movie is distinctly of its time and place. Verrry '70s. Who can hate that? And there are several shots of panicked pedestrians during the final chase - and according to the trivia section, those weren't stunt people. Guerilla filmmaking, baby! But then we get to the second half, which is all car chase. Forty god-loving minutes of car chase. So much wanton destruction, it borders on demolition derby. And it's not the modern cut-to-ribbons in the editing room, noisy, dizzying bonanza - it's a genuine let-it-build series of near-misses, clipped-fenders and t-bones that actually thrills and builds to a pretty cool jump. And that's not even the cool payoff that is the slick getaway in the final moments.You can fault this movie for its pedestrian first half, but I can't think of any reason to hate the second. And even if you bought the film and just skipped to the car chase, "Gone in 60 Seconds" still earns its place.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not that strong but the car chase is really cult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the dream of H.B. Halicki to make a movie about a car chase. And the man did it all, he wrote, directed, produced, acted and did stunts for this flick. It became cult due that reason. The flick itself doesn't really has a good story to tell. It's pure a flick about a car chase and here we have a Ford Mustang Fastback called Eleanor to be transported from one point to another. But the driver is being ripped-off by his boss and the chase is on. It is the chase that makes it worth watching. Knowing that these days a lot of the cars being demolished in this flick are worth a lot of money. The chase itself clocks in over 40 minutes and it's all about crashes going on between cops and parked cars and of course cops against cops. For the lovers of muscle cars it is naturally worth watching but it's easy to spot that it was a low budget flick. The 'actors' in the flick were what they did in real life. I mean, a cop was a real cop...The people standing on the streets just have a look at that, they are bait for the cars. Luckily no accidents did occur. But also it is so fine to see the real US back then in the early seventies. I do prefer 'Vanishing Point (1971)' but this cult classic here is also a must see.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

A great time warp that captures a decade and parades a host of vehicles.One sequence done in slow motion from two angles and then at full speed is very artistic and perhaps unexpected for what appears to be a simple film. The dialogue and acting is open to criticism however at the same time there is a reality feel to it. After all most people aren't that wordy anyways. A very nice film only meant to share the producer's passion and joy for cars.

This took weeks to film with all the permits, street closeups and logistics involved. They had to rebuild the car several times in the process ending up at a Car Wash where the wrecked one is 'switched for one in perfect condition.If your a "car buff" rent this one to show your friends.Two sequels were made; The Junkman and one in 2000 with the same name staring Nicolas Cage.

And if you do and can excuse the highly amateurish production and the thin storyline in the first half then be prepared for a fun ride during the spectacular second half. Our hero tears through five cities in a nice 1973 Mustang leaving a slew of wrecked cars in his wake of high speed mayhem. Going on highways, alleyways, fields, and just about everywhere that a car can go, he goes! Terrific breakneck fun. 7/10Rated PG for metal crunching mayhem</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a true work of art, and far superior to the big budget remake some twenty-five years later.As some other reviewers have mentioned, the set-up story that precedes the chase and occupies the first half of the film certainly stood no chance of taking any Oscars for acting or screenplay. None of the characters are played by actors, and it shows, at times laughably. Having said that, Halicki actually does turn out a competent story that makes sense. The amateurishness of it only serves to make the characters easier to identify with than a more polished performance might. Hollywood thought it was good enough to spend several million swiping it in 2000, and the fatal flaw of the remake is that it takes itself far too seriously. There is some degree of character development and one understands the motivation behind the characters actions. I wasn't bored with it at all. Further, the entire film is a pleasant time-capsule visitation back to 1974, when cars were enormous and powerful and gas was still affordable. I was particularly amused at the pervasive perception of insurance companies as absolutely crooked and devoid of any moral fiber whatsoever?some things never change, they're even worse today. It is this underlying theme that serves to flip the position of good guys/bad guys in this story and has you rooting for car thieves to be successful in their quest.Of course, the real reason to see this film is the famous 40-minute chase sequence. THIS is a car chase, and once you have seen it you will find yourself wondering why anyone ever considered the pathetic "Bullitt" worth a second thought. If a film's purpose is to entertain, then I can find no fault with this one.The only drawback I would note is that the 25th anniversary release of the film on DVD has some rather notable sound issues. Be sure you have good batteries in your remote because you'll be on the volume switch constantly. The roar of the engines is exponentially louder than any of the dialog, and there are frequently brief scenes where extras or even the main characters appear to be speaking but have no voices at all. This seems to be a common malady with many of today's DVD releases and while it shouldn't ruin the film experience for you, it is distraction and you should be aware of it before you pay good money for a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest chase scene ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many say this movie is low on plot and that it has cheesy acting. However, if you are into car chases, then you should definitely check this one out. The big chase is about forty minutes long, and your jaw will drop through the entire scene! There are many great crashes in this picture. It shows many sweet automobiles in certain scenes. You won't know that this has the greatest chase scene ever until you see it for yourself. The remake with Nick Cage is nothing compared to this classic film. So the rest of the movie is cheesy. Who cares; it has a car chase that definitely makes it worth sitting through. You're perhaps wondering if Pace will get away and successfully steal the final car. You'll have to watch to find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great car chase movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the Nicolas Cage remake of GISS before seeing the original, but I must say that the original really impressed me. It's a real bare bones affair as it cuts straight to the action of the car stealing. H.B. Halicki is great as both star and director. His character, Maindrian Pace, is a real tricky guy as he moonlights as a car thief while working for an insurance company.I wish that the slimy Eugene had got his comeuppance as he's the one who gives the cops the anonymous tip which leads to the epic car chase, but at least Maindrian doesn't sweat the pursuit much. The stunts are incredibly arranged and it's unbelievable how many cars get wrecked as the yellow Mustang known as Eleanor evades Johnny Law. H.B. Halicki should have done more acting because he is great here and so are the other supporting cast. For action fans, this film is a must-see. It is hard, however, to choose between this version and the Cage version as they are both great films in their own right. I'll let you make your own mind up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I mean exactly that. Basically, the original Gone In Sixty Seconds has no redeeming value. Period. That said, it's probably the best car chase movie ever. Forget what anybody says about the car-theft-ring plot, the sole purpose of this movie is to wreck 94 cars in 90 minutes. And it deserves a special award for being no more and no less than what it claims. There are some funny scenes-the big cat, the "submarine skipper" at the car wash, the old lady with the umbrella...My one major complaint about the DVD release is the soundtrack. The threw out all the awful home-grown music and replaced it with a real score. The country song and "Lois Lane Blues" are so awful they make the movie worth watching, and they dumped them for the re-release! Find a copy on VHS-it has the original soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I meant Jill.

I apologize for any inconvience this may have caused anybody who may have read my comment, not that anyone read it, but if you did and you caught the error, I commend you because that means you were paying attention and that you are a true car nut, because only a true car nut would know that the red Challenger, (Licence 000-GAL) was named Jill not Jan.I feel humilited about this error, But Because I can recite the plate numbers for Kowalski`s 70 Challenger (Colarado OA-5599), the Blues Mobile (Illinois BDR-529),And Elanor (California 614-HSO), I feel I have redeemed myself for this grave error.

		<fullReview>Yes, like most others, I saw that great embarrasment of Cage and Jolie's careers. The others in that movie only re-iterate how sad and overblown the movie and plot were. I think the original cost about a third of what ONE stunt costs in the new one. Anyhoo, my point is, that if you love great blow ups, and brooding actors, don't watch the original. However, if you love car chases, jumps, and find yourself a closet Dukes of Hazzard fan, this is the movie for you. One of the best parts is actually seeing the opening of one of the most traveled freeways in L. A. and seeing it turned into a demolition derby. H.B. actually got a bunch of friends, and did this masterpiece. I heard that the owner of the dealership near the end didn't actually have any idea what was actually to take place. hehehe Hands down the best and I mean THE BEST Mustang chases ever recorded on film. I bet Ford got a huge kick out of seeing the actual car being creamed by other Plymouths and Dodge Sattelites and driving away at 65, not to mention it is the ONLY car used in the chase. No Hollywood stunt cars here.</fullReview>

I got the distinct impression that it was all done off the cuff. It was almost like the film crew knew of some car chase crime in advance and knew just where to put the cameras! There is something quite natural and flowing about it. very unlike the MTV style remake which was apallingly bad for "x" times the money.There's a lot of humour too - the old lady with the umbrella and the radio guy doing pavement interviews....what was that all about?I enjoyed it and agree with other comments posted here - watch the remake then watch this - you'll soon figure out the superior movie.why, oh why they didn't do a straight remake I'll never know - the plot was simplicity in its self - all that was needed was better acting.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Classic. Why bother with a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have had this movie on video for some time now. I remember seeing it on TV as a youngster and just had to get it to see it again.The video I have has the original sound track, with all the hokey country and western music that other reviewers seem to miss from the DVD release.That being said I have just purchased the DVD release and let me tell you that although it is the same movie it shows what part the sound track has in shaping a movie. Firstly the original sound track as mentioned is basically country and Western and really makes this movie a bit of a laugh and only makes the clothes and hair even funnier. I'm sure this is also helped by the overall quality of the video, which is in mono and almost looks like it was filmed with the colour turned down.The DVD is a completely different movie. The hokey C&amp;W sound track has been replaced with some very well chosen mood music that really changes the whole tone of the movie. Yes the clothes and hair are still there but where the original Louis Lane Blues seemed to go on and on and get on your nerves, the new music gives a real feel that something big is about to happen.This brings us to the the point of the first half of the film and that is to set up the best car chase scene ever filmed. Forget your Nic Cage remake with it's 8 minutes of special effects car chase. This is the real thing. All the stunts are real and all the cars and crashes are real. The other thing with this movie is that while it is a car chase movie it does not glamourise it. It shows the consequences of the car crashes and it shows people getting hurt. The other thing it proves is that not all cars burst into flames after a crash.This movie is realy a one off and the remake was really a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated badly, but what a chase...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're reading this, the chances are you've recently seen the film for the first time (that'd be me then), you're already an afficionado, or you accidentally came here looking for the Nicolas Cage remake.Well, c'mon in, pull up an outlandish '70s armchair, and sit back for the ride of your life...First off, let's get the bad parts over &amp; done with. The acting's lousy, the sound muffled (very badly, in places), the hairstyles/attitudes are seriously dated (what did you expect? '74 was the absolute pinnacle of bad taste...), and in the much-trumpeted final chase scene, there's one enormous, howling continuity error (more later). There's good reasons for all of the above: H.B. Halicki (writer, director, producer &amp; star) was working on a budget that probably wouldn't even run a car in 21st century UK...Despite the non existant budget, and dreadful acting, however; Halicki has managed to create what has to be the ultimate car chase sequence. Forget all the other scripted nonsense, this is for real. Cars get and stay damaged. It would appear that the entire Palm Beach police force were out chasing this man in the 40-minute blinder which switches from urban to highway to wasteland back to highway to car dealership to highway and so on and so on. This chase alone is worthy of a place in cinematic history. Watch this film, if only to see how a car chase *should* be done.*** spoilers below, skip this part if you've not seen the film ***And now, the biggest continuity error I've seen in a car chase film, bar one....Observe as Halicki piles into the intersection crash, launching Eleanor into the air. Observe the landing - no problems yet. However, in the from-front sequence, Eleanor starts to spin and - if you look closely - it's obvious that Halicki still has all the power on, hence the enormous cloud of tyre smoke, into which Eleanor disappears....The film then chops back to a full-speed section, in which we see Eleanor land more or less straight, to power off into the distance.Oops!I did say the biggest blooper bar one: Funnily enough, Cage's jump in the inferior remake is that one. If anyone seriously imagines a Shelby GT500 can land nose-down from 7ft or better in the air (probably nearer 20ft to get the distance), and not be even slightly banana shaped afterwards clearly needs their head examined.Anyway, niggles aside, watch this film. Or at least, watch the last 39 minutes and 60 seconds....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Car Crash King's outlaw classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the grandmaster of 1970's era car chase flicks. A gritty, low budget, heist picture with plenty of afros, muscle cars and handlebar mustaches that also happens to sport the most exciting, realistic forty minute car chase ever captured on film. When I say realistic what I mean is that the stunts and crashes are logical events in the chase without being gratuitous. No outlandish flips or zany jumps over grand canyons; just speed and plenty of it. The cars behave as they would in the real world. Often, a major crash sequence is followed by a scene with emergency vehicles tending to fiery wrecks and injured motorists caught in the mayhem, adding to the sense of danger. I believe some of the stunts were even shot illegally. The scene, shot from an overpass, showing the legendary H.B. Halecki shooting across four lanes of Long Beach freeway, missing the offramp and taking out a streetlight is a perfect example of outlaw filmaking. One gets the impression that one take was all they were going to get. Moments like that are what make this flick a classic of the genre. Other, more well known chases of the period don't hold a candle to this one. Also, skip the recent remake. The original blows it off the road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Gone In Sixty Seconds in 1974 at this broken down theater in West Memphis, Arkansas when I was 10 years old. From that point on I have been a car chase/motorcycle/Evel Knievel stunt fanatic. The fact that H.B. Haliki was a high school dropout who made his millions in the auto junk business is reason enough to admire the man behind this drive-in classic. With his knowledge of the biz, he made the most hair raising car chase flick ever while teaching himself filmaking 101 at the same time! He was the Jackie Chan of the seventies. A one man demolition squad who teamed up with family and friends and made this movie on a shoestring budget that made over 40 million worldwide during its release. His efforts alone should inspire not only filmakers but anyone who has been putting his or her dreams off for one reason or another. Do like Toby Haliki,Do some research, find a way, stick to it and "CHASE" your dreams.</fullReview>

Compare it to other chase movies, such as 'Bullitt' (my personal favorite), 'Vanishing Point', or 'The Driver'. These films are all better because the climactic chases have one thing that the original 'Gone' does not - continuity. I did not get the feeling I was watching a car chase. I got the feeling I was watching numerous stunts all strung together in an amateurish attempt at making a great chase. I think it could've been great, but failed for lack of a good editor. I think this film is worth having in my collection of good car chase films, but in no way is it the best ever, or the grandaddy of all car chases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of this movie since I was very young. It features some of the best car chases, in my opinion, that I've ever seen. You have to remember this was a very low budget movie, before special effects and the last chase was only done with one car! I also love it because it was filmed here in the south bay, where I grow up. I was extremely happy to see that it has been re-released on DVD, I just found out, so I bought it right away. The previous home video release was a long time ago, and hard to find. They did an excellent job on restoring the film, it looks brand new. but my only beef with the new release is, as another reviewer has mentioned, it features a whole new soundtrack through out. This movie is VERY 70's and dated, but that is a big part of the appeal. the original music suited the picture much better. Especially in one scene where "pumpkin" sat and listened to a 70's song called "Lois lane blues" which is forever etched in my memories of this movie. the new DVD has, in it's place, some newly recorded "faux 70's" music, that as a fan, I found very distracting, and frankly, was a bit disappointed. As i said, part of the appeal, for me personally, was how 70's the movie was. Maybe it was an attempt to modernize it slightly, i'm not sure. The DVD still has few neat extras, and it's still a good action movie. if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the seminal movie that raised publics awareness about automobile security. Back then nobody knew actually fast a car can be heisted. Gone in 60 seconds said it all in its title and people became aware how vulnerable their prized possessions were. Now because of this, we have an entire industry dedicated to protecting automobiles.Looking at this movie is shocking in a way because it shows how "raw" the society was back then. I really love the movie because I can see the nostalgic landscape of Los Angeles shown in all their glories. I can catch some of the landmarks that exists even today. The "cars" are lavish for back then. Pantera, Mangusta, Daytona, Rolls, and of course the '73 Mustang. Very cool.There's something primal about this movie. Maybe because the production is so basic. There's no special effects, or attempt to make the characters pretty. It feels like drinking water right out of the faucet. This rawness makes this movie moving in a way like no other movies I've seen recently.This is one heck of a movie, and you owe it to yourself to see it at least once.</fullReview>

You are here to watch the longest continuous car chase in the movies.

If you are expecting great exposition and dialogue then watch the Nick Cage version, if you want to see why the man's widow still drives the yellow Eleanor then watch this, and the rest of his films. Ignore the dialogue, watch the wrecks! Unlike most people I refuse to compare the two films of the same title since Hollywood would have been totally unable to do a movie with the %1.57 budget of the original film. Both are good on their own merits (although Jolie and Giovanni Ribissi both mailed in their roles), 2000 for some nice cars and characters (Vinnie Jones as Sphinx)and the old one for it simplicity and honest try at making a great movie with essentially no budget.

		<shortDescription>Great movie - even without sound!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Background: Because I am nearly deaf, I depend upon videos and DVDs that are captioned or have subtitles. Most videos made within the past 10 years have captions and DVDs often offer BOTH of these capabilities. As you probably have guessed, I do not go to movie theaters to see a movie because I have absolutely no idea what is going on. Over the years, I have garnered an extensive collection of both videos and DVDs. All of them either captioned or having subtitles.Current: My introduction to this movie was inspired after renting the 2000 DVD with Nickolas Cage, which I though was a terrific movie. While searching for the 1974 H.B. Halicki video, I found that it was not captioned, so I was thrilled to recently find the 25th Anniversary DVD which was released in 2000, assuming that it would at least have subtitles. Surprisingly, it is neither captioned NOR does it have subtitles. Unfortunately, I did not realize this until I attempted to view the movie. I could not return it because I had opened the package. What a disappointment.I could not understand the dialogue and was a bit confused as to why the heist team ended up destroying the cars, I decided to check the plot at IMDb. It told me of a different reason for all of the cars being stolen as compared to the 2000 version, and that was helpful. Thank you, IMDb! So I decided to watch it anyway, because I was looking forward to the final chase scene, which had been described as even better than the N, Cage 2000 remake.I loved this movie - EVEN IN SILENCE! I really enjoyed seeing the fashions from the 70's, hilarious as they now seem to me. Did I really dress that way? Yes! Seeing the older cars was wonderfully nostalgic. And the heist methods were ingenious. The final chase scene was terrific. Although I couldn't understand the dialogue, I laughed in a few places that seemed comic to me. Possibly not hearing what was being said made the movie even more enjoyable than it really was. I recommend this movie very highly, even as a silent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this true indy masterpiece on Jap cable TV and I think it's jolly good. What a great slice of the '70s and the 40-min car chase at the end was brilliant. I loved the black pot-heads who continued to drive on stoned out of their minds even when their car was beat up! There's no way this could be made nowadays in this age of corporate suits and pc sensibilities. I just wish I had a time machine to go back and see it as it was being filmed! I don't know who this Halicki bloke was, but he was one hell of a driver- Ryan O'Neal prancing around as THE '70s Driver?? Get out of town! Eat your heart out coz you couldn't hold a candle to the late great Halicki! R.I.P mate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The car chase scenes are about as realistic as they get.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure there is some editing involved, where the Mustang (Eleanor) is laid up in the shop for several days before filming can continue. And there are some boring moments, like when the Long Beach Police have Toby trapped on the sidewalk before he makes his escape but that only adds to the suspense. Or when they're out in the dirt field off the Harbor Freeway. Just keep in mind that if you are involved in a real chase, it's not going to be action packed at every turn, especially if it's going to last 40 minutes. Remember how boring O. J. Simpson's chase was on the San Diego Freeway.I met Toby at a swap meet in the mid 1970's and he invited me on a tour of his place, which was just across the street. It was his salvage yard, where he kept all of his collector cars stored in a Knotts Berry Farm like atmoshere. He kept a Stutz parked on the carpet in his office. He had Rolls Royces flanked by Ferraris. He had old Cadillacs and Thunderbirds but his favorites seem to be his collection of Masseratti-Citroens. He had about ninety cars all together. Eleanor was also there, sitting in a garage all banged up. For the stunts, he had her reinforced with tubular framing inside the passenger area.Getting back to the movie, sure it had bad acting, bad dialog, poor soundtrack but it makes up for all of that in the end. Toby, as his close friends called him, was a very interesting man and has to be regarded as one of the geniuses of independent film making. I'm sure he is missed dearly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand the appeal of this film. The car chase scenes aren't that exciting or fun to watch (when compared to "Bullitt" or even "The Blues Brothers"). The main character is scum, the plot non-existent, and the acting is horrible. There are some disgusting racist overtones at the very end of the movie.When I saw this film on TV, it was shown with a 1/2 hour documentary, produced by Toby Halicki's window, that makes him how to be some kind of genius. It was a really unfortunate commentary on a movie with a seriously screwed-up world view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrific flick. Not a great movie from the standpoint of movie making and classic film, but a good guy flick to watch with buddies over a couple of drinks. Car chases, especially the end chase is fantastic and stands as one of the best car chases ever. One of the great aspects of the movie is how much they accomplished on what was obviously a limited budget. I recomend this movie highly, though is it rare to find a video release of it. Compared to the remake in 2000, this original is much better for the chases and the nostalgia of the 70s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers. (!)Influential car chase/crash film, with a sort of deadpan/documentary acting style and editing, about a ring of pro and very slick car thieves, who steal only the best cars sometimes right under the owner's nose, leading up to the clever half hour car chase, which is the heart of the film, in which the bad guy (good guy?) gets away with seemingly the entire LAPD and sheriff's after him, with police and news choppers following the whole thing and reporting to local radio. But he gets away (unlike a similar Vanishing Point car chase film, which I think came out a few years later).The look of the yellow Mustang fastback (?), the chase car, is one that stuck with a lot of people, and probably has contributed to the value of such now collector cars. It looked . . cool. A yellow '73 Mustang, I believe - referred to by the thieves in code as - Eleanor. People might remember the chase in Bullit. But they remember the car from this film.The thing about the lead up, even the chase itself, is that for the choreography of the chase, and the participation of SO many different police departments and cities (which was something), one remembers the almost pseudo-documentary nature of the thing. The actors walk through it as just another day on their job, without a lot of posing or melodrama, without it even so much looking like a film, as it were - save for the subplot which leads to the chase. That was kind of refreshing, even then, and likely wouldn't be seen in the remake pending, of the same name (likely just Speed 5 with some phony romantic thread).The unremarkable offramps, dirt shoulders, car dealerships, highways and byways of the greater LA area probably never looked so interesting as in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cheesy cheapness of this authentic slice of the 70s is part of its charm. H.B. Halicki wrote it, directed, starred in it, did the stunt driving and hired his family members as actors, costumers etc. His family's mercantile company bankrolled the distribution. The man is such an egotist that he doesn't seem to care that his character is unlikable, and he doesn't shy away from showing the tragic results for innocent bystanders of his protagonist's 40-minute car chase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This original is much better than the Nick Cage stinkeroonie from 2000. This version rates a "10" for action and fun, but perhaps a "5" or less for plot and acting. Aren't all the actors in it mechanics or friends of Toby Halicki ? Halicki had no budget to speak of, and a script of 5 pages total ! The train accident at the very beginning was a real wreck that director Halicki heard about, so he went down to the scene to film it and include in the movie. Halicki didn't have permission to film on the highways, so those are all real commuters being overtaken by "Eleanor". The scene where "Eleanor" crosses the freeway, loses control and hits the lamp post was unscripted. Halicki split the scene of the accident to spare the legal hassles and left the broken lamp post by the side of the road. The wedding scene was a real wedding and Halicki decided to include it for some reason. This film is pure car chase scenes, so viewer beware !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tongue-in-cheek it's gotta be, but Toby set out to make the definitive car-chase movie and succeeded beyond his wildest imaginings. It shouldn't have worked. The acting is eye-rolling awful, the paper-thin plot elusive, the hair and clothes styles embarrassing. (for those of us who actually dressed like that, anyway) The film is very obviously low budget, yet hundreds of cars were demolished in the making of it. It seems impossible that he could have gotten the blessings of so many police departments to cause so much mayhem. There were no special effects in this film; all the crashes were real.But nevertheless, he pulled it off, and the 40-minute chase scene has you on the edge of your seat, even today. There is an unfortunate miscalculation and Toby cleans up a light pole and was in fact badly hurt, but evidently carried on bravely to the finish. I have nothing but admiration for this film. I have not seen the 2000 Nicholas Cage remake, but am led to believe it does not do justice to the original. This movie will remain an unchallenged classic, because there is no longer the option for anybody to try to repeat it. The authorities could not afford to allow such a thing today. They'd get the pants sued off them. Besides, it shouldn't have worked, what with the rotten acting, anorexic plot and personal financing, but it did. It won't happen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If not the greatest car chase ever filmed, certainly one of them...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last, the Great grandaddy of all car chase films has been released on DVD. OK, so first things first. The plot, well, isn't. A guy steals cars, but his girlfriend, who's alos part of the car theft ring, doesn't like stealing cars which aren't insured, so after he steals 40 cars in a week, she makes him give one back because it's not insured. But her brother's mad at him, so he tips off the cops. There's that 40-minute chase. The hero escapes. End of film. Character development? no. Resolution? Nope, not here. Believable? Ha!And yet still, it's got that ultra-cheap magic that makes it work. No, the car stunts aren't the greatest ever filmed (the sequel, Gone in 60 Seconds II AKA The Junkman has far better ones) but it's all real, no CGI efects, and it was all done with one car - no substitutes here, so you don't get that detached feeling you do with most Hollywood blockbusters (read: The Bruckheimer remake). Just one thing. I have an old vide copy of this with the original music that's been completely altered for the DVD release, and I wish that they'd left it intact. Yeah, the songs are cheesy seventies pop, but they go with the film so much better, and sorry, but I personally consider "I Do Hope The Man Doesn't Catch Me", "Lois Lane Blues" and "Gone (Movin' On) in Sixty Seconds" to be far better suited to the movie than the replacement stuff, which alters the feel of scenes which were supposed to be comedic, and at one point spoils a whole sequence where a character was originally listening to a song on the radio, and now appears to just be sitting around doing nothing while the soundtrack takes over. Still, there's that chase, which may not be quite the greatest ever filmed, but which is still a remarkable achievement. Not to mention a great advertisment for 1973 Ford Mustangs...</fullReview>

In the hands of a poet like Yalicki, cars crashing into each other again and again and again for the entire duration of the movie becomes a metaphor for our times. Don't be fooled by the amateur acting and directing, for the film's shoddiness is part of its genius. Forget Cannonball Run or Gumball Rally, Gone in 60 Seconds is the real deal when it comes to mundane 70's car chase flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic of Its Type with a True Independent Filmmaker's Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first read about this film in an article in the Los Angeles Times, which was published shortly after Halicki's death in 1989. The article described this film, which I had never heard of (was too young during its original run to go to a drive-in myself), as well as his unfinished follow-up opus, The Junkman. The tale detailed Halicki's upbringing in Buffalo and his rise to fortune and semi-fame in Southern California. A great story, and a man who left behind on this Earth a unique legacy of raw, self-taught action film artistry and love of the classic overpowered American automobile.Saw the movie for the first time a few years after that on VHS, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. It played out exactly as advertised. Later, when it was released on DVD with restored picture (around the time of the 2000 Nicholas Cage remake), I picked up that disc and rejoiced in having a great copy of Halicki's art. The stunt driving is spectacular, and the direction and cinematography are both pretty solid.It is the writing of the script where things fall apart a bit. Have to dock the movie a couple points. Get serious, Halicki--you named all of the main characters either "Pace" or "Chase"? I guess that was some kind of pun on fast cars, but, Jeebus, not too confusing. And what the hell is a "Maindrian"? Is that a dyslexic Mandarin? Someone draining his main vein? Some of the storytelling elements are murky, dialog is stilted, and these are all not professional actors really, so the acting is pretty poor. I did like the smug wrap-up following the epic 45 minute car chase which is this film's raison d'etre. Thought that was pretty clever.But story structure is not why you're watching this film. It's for the primo 1974 atmosphere, big cars with huge engines chasing each other and crashing, and non-stop pace. If you liked The French Connection, The Seven-Ups, The Sugarland Express, Vanishing Point, or countless other 1970's car crash/chase epics, this friends, is your cup of Valvoline. Check it out before you crash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking levels of car violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I saw the remake first and only after I found that there is an original. The remake is mediocre. The original is nothing special either, but at least it's better than the remake.For anyone who have seen the remake first, the original's plot is familiar but there are many differences. One of the many differences spotted is the total number of stolen cars which is 48 in this version instead of 50.Like the remake, the original is worth for the cars, not for the plot, cast or the acting by the actors. The cars are the real stars, but the original triumphs by having a lot more nice cars.On one hand, this movie is recommendable for car lovers, but on the other hand it may hurt their sensibility because of the brutal treatment given to the cars. I am a car person myself and it's unbearable to see the cars being treated like that, such as the Dodge Challenger which is reduced to dust, the beautiful Cadillac that gets burned and the poor "Eleanor" which is so badly wrecked. And still, despite all the abuse it is victim of, "Eleanor" never once shows the slightest sign of fatigue and just keeps running and running. This testifies how strong "she" is. No modern car could take half the abuse "she" does.The "Eleanor" chase sequence is the longest car chase I've ever seen in a movie: it lasts as far as 34 minutes.The car violence isn't just "fiction", it is actually very realistic. More cars than anyone can imagine were destroyed and badly wrecked and there were real accidents and people got hurt. They did many dangerous things. Such is the violence that in a scene a garbage truck overturns the moment when two police cars smash into its side.H.B. Halicki, also known as "The Car Crash King", was greatly involved in this film, not only because he portrays (well) the expert car thief Maindrian Pace but also because he wrote, produced and directed this.There is a lot of adrenaline, yes, but at the cost of safety and brutal treatment given to the cars. There are many beautiful and exotic cars and it's terrible to see such a waste of so many fine cars.The story in this version is harder to understand than in the remake. The best part is the "Eleanor" chase (despite everything) but even that sequence is often interrupted by lame and unnecessary scenes. The rest of the movie has some good moments but some are quite lame too.</fullReview>

It contains real accidents which happened during filming, therefore a lot of the 'stunts' do appear 'natural' and not staged, as is so often the case with car crashes in movies.For mega-car crash fans it is the benchmark of the genre, untopped to this day. For all others, it is 90 minutes of yawning boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was made in the area where I lived and grew up in California. I can still remember when it was being filmed and eventually released in the mid 1970s. H. B. Halicki, a Gardena, CA car parts dealer, made this film on a shoestring budget. He got the cooperation of every city in the South Bay and Harbor area of Los Angeles County except, ironically and tragically, his hometown of Gardena! The Gardena police department wouldn't cooperate with him and, reportedly, fired a sergeant over his cooperating with Halicki. The local paper, the Gardena Valley News, also took a few hits from the Gardena P.D. over their publicizing of the movie. The movie was made by a Gardena resident and business owner, for crying out loud!! After the movie was released, it was a modest success and became something of a cult film. I saw it twice in the theater and recognized all the places where the movie took place...again, every place in the area but Gardena. This movie has a nice feel to it...as one critic put it "like a Howard Hawks film." Halicki went on with his life and career, making the movie "Junkman" in the early 1980s (I saw that too...cool movie). Tragically, he died in the late 1980s in an accident while trying to put together a bigger budget remake of "Gone in 60 Seconds"...it would've been interesting to see what he could've done rather some Hollywood version with Nicolas Cage and other actors (Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, etc.) in cameo roles. This shows what some people can do with an idea, a little money and some film. One last thing though...what kind of a name is Maindrian??!!</fullReview>

It was obviously shot on a shoe string budget. If anyone likes car chases, this movie should be on the top of their list. If someone thinks Bullitt was a good chase sequence, check this movie out. This makes Bullitt look small. It was shot in the South Bay around Torrance and Redondo Beach in Southern California. If someone lives in Southern California, and saw the movie now, they would see the big changes that's happened around here since it was shot. If it hasn't become a cult classic, it should become one soon. I wonder if it's going to be available on DVD. I would certainly add it to my collection. I would recommend this film, just because it's a lot of fun. The acting isn't the best, but the action sequences make up for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the great chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very interesting movie for a lot of reasons -- it's a great car chase film for the drive-in crowd, and remarkably manages to create more vehicular devastation than bigger budget films like "The French Connection" and "Bullitt" (although I would note that this film is actually pretty expensive compared to many drive-in films). It's also something of an homage to films like "The Asphalt Jungle" with its modestly subversive focus on the mechanisms of the criminal element.The first part of the movie is a bit slow granted, but compared to a lot of the newer auto-crash/race type movies it's somewhat welcome that the film allows the pace to build up somewhat. Let's not get carried away talking about characters and motivation and so forth -- about halfway through the movie I still couldn't tell who the main character was supposed to be. I don't think this is a defect in the movie, it's actually part of its self-conscious charm -- the producers of the film have only listed one star for the film: Eleanor, a 1973 Ford Mustang. Basically the plot is about a trio of kids who inherit their daddy's insurance business and use their savvy and information to become wholesale auto thieves. They get an order to deliver 48 cars in a 48 hour period and thus begins a mad spree that makes Corman and Howard's "Grand Theft Auto" look conservative.Minimal sexual/exploitation value here -- it's probably best as a movie for car lovers, the type of movie you used to see all the time on "Lost Drive In" and shows of that type. It's notable that the movie's style is more of a throw-back to films as I say like "Asphalt Jungle" and "The Killing" -- instead of focusing on the kind of shenanigans that the so-called "biker" movies by AIP and CI from the late 60s this one is pretty much only concerned with allowing us to vicariously enjoy the element of theft and with its fascination with fine auto machinery. This gives it a refreshingly adult and even documentarian quality. Someone looking back a century from now wanting to see the great sports cars of the late 20th Century in action could do worse than to watch this movie.One of the aspects of the film that gets a lot of attention is the extensive stunt driving, much of which was apparently done by the film's star/director H.B. Halicki, a famous auto collector who died while making one of his subsequent films. In this area the film certainly lives up to its reputation because it's hard to believe that people actually walked away from some of these stunts without some kind of permanent reminder. The car itself undergoes such an unbelievable beating that by the end you feel like you owe it some kind of respect regardless of how you feel about the movie, like Rocky and Apollo Creed after their big fight.I think this is one of the drive-in films that will survive and be seen as a model of what can be done on a relatively small budget by people with a lot of passion and focus. It will never be considered a straight-up "classic" per se because the dialog is pretty awkward and there's a bit too much of it perhaps in the first half. But once the film really starts going it never slows down to let you think too much about the details, and it sure is a lot of pure fun.</fullReview>

I mean, you have to watch it to have an idea about whats going on, but after this first part was finished I realized that it was very boring, I did not get very much of it (they always talk in this strange language which seems to be focussing on "least words possible") and its basically a bad intro for the only thing important in this movie :THE CHASE SCENE (tadaa !)well, and this is where it really kicks off.(a bit of advice here : if you get bored in the first 45 minutes and wonder whats this all about, maybe skip right to the chase and watch the first part again when you are finished with the movie and feel like it).and this chase scene is ... well ... incredible. its really raw, pure 70s style, no special effects, its not glamourous, its not "cool", its simply cars chasing each other on roads. its sometimes intense, its sometimes scary (a few of the scenes on the highway which were filmed behind the windshield made me bend my toes) and most of all its realistic. my gosh, I never ever saw victisms of something like that depicted in a movie, and there it is : people getting hurt because something smashes into their cars and people being pulled out of burning cars (which was really odd because after watching all these action flicks I did expect those cars to blow up every second ... reminded me of "the last action hero" : "are all cars bulletproof in your world ?") and more.the big flaw is the end, where he suddenly escapes them all and has loads of time to change his car, but this just seemed like an emergency "we have to end this here" choice.so, all I can say again is : this is a really odd movie, the only thing that really matters is that chase scene, which doesnt even have much of a connection to rest of the film and you do not identify with anyone seen in this movie, there are no heroes, no real story is told and everything seems to be a rather sloppy wrapping for "the chase".well, I would give it a 4 out of 5, but (the best for the last) because this one just looks like one of the blueprints for the "sabotage" video of the beastie boys (made by spike jonze) I will give it a 4,5 out of 5.go watch the some of the most intense 40 minutes of movie history. this thing kcks the highway scene of matrix 2 right off the table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speeds along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw only the last 40 minutes of this film, which is fine, because it was a chase scene. People, what I'm saying here is, the ENTIRE 40 minutes I saw was ONE chase scene, and a great one at that.OK, I lived in Long Beach, CA (the epicenter of the chase) for five years, so I'm biased. But to think that one man could have written, produced, starred in, financed, directed and marketed this film is amazing.I saw the updated snoozer starring Nicolas Cage, and I'm still wondering if anyone involved even SAW the first film. They made it so much more boring it was like they were financed by the Drive 55 And Stay Alive Society.Skip the remake. Watch this instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, not the classic it's made out to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone in 60 Seconds is set in California where Maindrain Pace (writer, producer &amp; director H.B. Halicki) works as a respected car insurance investigator, however while not investigating insurance scams Pace heads up a gang of car thieves who steal cars &amp; change their identity. Pace accepts a large order, an order worths $400,000 to deliver forty-eight high end cars by Saturday &amp; today is Tuesday. From Mustangs to Limousines to Ferraris to Cadilacs to Rolls-Royce, Pace convinces his gang that it can be done &amp; they get to work. Highly organised &amp; professional forty-seven of the cars prove no great problem but a 1973 Ford Mustang Mach I nicknamed Eleanor has been elusive, Pace manages to steal one but the police spot him &amp; a city wide car chase begins...Starring, written, produced &amp; directed by H.B. Halicki who also did a lot of the stunt driving too this car chase action film is often referred to a classic &amp; I was interested to watch it &amp; see if the reported car chases &amp; stunts were as good as I had heard, having just finished watching it I was a little disappointed with it. If the title sounds familiar that's probably because it was remade as Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000) with Nicolas Cage, to be honest while I am not a fan of either film particularly I'd probably rather watch the remake again than this often dull &amp; lifeless original. Well the plot is very simple &amp; will appeal to certain people but the character's are dull, there's no focus on fleshing them out &amp; everyone featured feels like a bit part with none of Pace's gang making an appearance after the hour mark, there's no great resolution to anything &amp; it's clear that Halicki was more interested in filming cars driving along than telling a story. The story really has zero impact, we never see who orders the cars, the subplot about the heroin goes nowhere &amp; at an hour &amp; forty odd minutes long I got bored with it very quickly.Gone in 60 Seconds is shot in a really dreary way with bad acting, dull dialogue &amp; lots of montages as people speak. Basically whether you enjoy Gone in 60 Seconds will depend on how much you like the final forty odd minute car chase, while a forty minute car chase sounds like a real winner it's nowhere near as exciting as it sounds. Again there's lots of cars driving around with the odd stunt thrown in but overall it's a little tedious. There's far too much filler with a gang of black kids in a car, reaction shots of various other drivers, lots of shots in the police control room, a radio new presenter &amp; various on the reporters slow the pace down &amp; are nothing more than padding. The stunts are decent enough but again it didn't excite me, the chases in the remake are much better &amp; more thrilling.Filmed in California this is a fairly rough production &amp; you can tell it was independently financed &amp; made. The acting is poor, I'm sorry but it is.Gone in 60 Seconds was a big disappointment to me, I love a good car chase &amp; while the car chases here are alright they are not amazing or as good as I had hoped. Followed by The Junkman (1982).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst car chase scenes *ever*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe anyone finds the car chase scenes in this movie, anything but abysmal.I have not, ever, seen a worse collection of "drivers", as those portrayed in this movie. Dozens upon dozens of people run into stopped cars for absolutely no other reason than they are stopped. Police slide out of control because they are going a mere 80MPH. Accidents happen because boneheads pull out onto the street without looking, or because they are not paying attention. Frankly, I've seen impaired drivers handle themselves better than the police in this movie. 99% of the damage in this movie's long chase scene is caused by the police, something that is utterly laughable.Weird, weird, weird. Were people so spaced out in the 70s, that they thought this was realistic? Was this movie's script written by someone unable to drive? Were they high when it was penned?Who knows!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake is Miles Better !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could have been great because at the time their were lots of fantastic cars that we still want.The problem with this film is that it doesn't focus on the stealing of the other great cars like the remake tries to do. However you do see a cameo appearance of the other cars but you would expect more.The remake was better but has the same problem being only 1 real chase in 1 car. Also the remake eleanor was much better because it was based on the 1969 GT500 which was also in bullitt. The original couldn't use the same mustang because bullitt had been made 4 years or so earlier so instead they used a Boss Mustang which really wasn't as good.After seeing the remake with N.Cage you are gonna want to watch the original but don't expect anything better. Stick to the Remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast American Muscle Cars Rule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think ALL cars are a thing of beauty. The European exotics are very sleek, and somewhat stealthy in their speed. The Asian vehicles are very quick in the turns. When it comes to raw, abusable, thundering, neck-breaking power however, the American muscle cars of the 60's and 70's rule the blacktop! This movie is really about the infatuation we all have with vehicles and speed. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspired the remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened along this film while flipping channels and stopped to watch it because although I was certain I had never seen it before it seemed oddly familiar. Then I realized that I had seen it, at least as the Nick Cage remake. This can be found in the USC course catalog under Bad Film-making 101. I can actually recommend it on that basis. It's very educational in a what-not-to-do sense. It also has a certain appeal in seeing how the Nick Cage redo incorporates a lot of the same ideas. I particularly like the Bengal tiger in the back seat which becomes a python in the 2-door Hummer. To say the original is better than the remake gives too much credit to the concept and turns a blind eye and deaf ear to the gaffs, the stilted editing, and unnatural dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then the new one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not like the new version. This film has a low budget, and the acting along with the story suffered. The whole budget had to be spent on the last fourty minute car chase. The begaining of the movie I give a 6 the middle a 2, the begaining of the car chase a 3, and as it went a 8. This movie is the car chase, and the whole story is nothing more then justifying the car chase. The begaining of the the car chase is very run of the mill, and done so often on tv please. BUT, as it progressed with the camera shot from the front of the car, the purr of the engine, the apeal approved. What sticks out of my mind in this film and saves it is the secene where the car jumps and they do a 3 way replay of the event, and choreographed it nicely. It is a thing of beauty. Especially when they put one scence with the car in the air and splice it back again with another. This part of the film is true brilliance. In the end I gave it a 6 worth watching if your bored and love cars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** HERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS **A gang of car thieves get an big "order" of exclusive and luxurious cars. Now they have to steal them not to find themselves in trouble.I know, my recap of the movie above is ridiculously short. But this is because this is a confused movie. It starts out with a terrible introduction and presentation, which leads to there is trouble to identify and follow main characters. It does not help that they from time to time wear wigs to disguise themselves as well. Because of this it is hard to follow the story as well, when you can't identify the main character and his opponents. I'm uncertain but I think that the leader of the gang was insurance detective as well, thus playing on both sides, further complicating matter. But the story is not really important. About halfway into the movie, they steal "Eleanor" a Mustang. They are spotted by the police and a police chase follows, a chase that goes on the rest of the movie. The chase contains a lot of curious details about the competence of the police leading to that the entire chase, and by extension, the entire movie becomes uninteresting. So this is a bad, not entertaining movie due to its bad introduction and lack of story.The remake from 2000 is much better, succeeding with a good story but keeping and developing some details.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never thought that a car chase could be so boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie with a forty minute car chase. Never mind that the quality of acting is that of low quality porn (without the redemption of sex), this thing should be non-stop, edge of your seat, adrenaline pumping excitement. Sadly, I have never found an action sequence so boring. With one or two exceptions, the stunts are all cliche, there is little if any innovation. And just when you think the chase is over, it begins again, and again, until you are praying for it to be over. The "surprise" ending was clever, but that's about the only saving grace this thing had. You get the feeling that this movie was directed by the stunt coordinator. Oh wait....it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give me an L! Give me an A! Give me an M! And give me and E! What does that spell?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LAME! This movie is incredibly lame! Before the car chase begins, the story makes no sense whatsoever. I was sitting there waiting for the famed car chase, yawning a bit. And then it came. And then, forty grueling minutes later, it was over. If I were not watching it with a friend, I would have turned it off about ten minutes through the chase. If I just could have fallen asleep! Really, I'm not against car chases. But there was no reason to care about anything that happened in this movie. Did the characters even have names in this movie? I don't remember. If you're the kind of person who likes car chases a lot, all three Mad Max movies have chases that are a thousand times more exciting than the ones in Gone in 60 Seconds. There are characters we care about, and the stunts are innovative. The ones in this movie are repetitive and uninventive and unrealistic.So really the only reason to watch this movie is to see muscle cars from the 60s and 70s, and if you're that type of person, you should just be slapped back and forth in the face for eternity. Absolutely one of the biggest wastes of time ever made, devoid of anything remotely worthwhile. 1/10</fullReview>
