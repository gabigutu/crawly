		<fullReview>After knocking off 26 positive reviews I felt the need to slaughter a cinematic turkey of mammoth proportions. And this it. This movie will depress anyone who loves movies. I would hate to encounter anyone who likes this piece of sewage. There is nothing of value on screen: from the horrid acting of LL Cool J to the gratuitous street luge scene. If the director had an ounce of humor he would have used The Trashmen's "Surfin' Bird" here. But that would be asking too much. Instead, the film makers get together and trash a classic. When this happens someone must step in and play policeman and arrest the Hollywood perpetrators involved in this criminal mischief. You have the right to remain silent. Anything--Well, forget it. I believe the director lost his mind. The night vision scenes were visual poison. Puke green. Fuzzy. Shockingly enough, an entire reel or two of this utterly useless footage of a chase of some kind made it into the movie. I have this feeling the film was unintentionally overexposed. The Rollerball game cannot be followed by anybody sober. Loud. Noisy. What are the rules? There is not a scintilla of drama anywhere in this motion picture. Take this stinker out to the curb before it contaminates the rest of your dvd collection or damages your player. Wretched. Shame on all who were involved. And a pox on their homes, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never in my life have I seen something held together by cameo appearances... I mean, this has to be the most commercialized, corporate movie I have ever seen.From the god awful Slipknot's appearance to the Ben Affleck of the next generation Chris Klein, the only uplifting experience was Jean Reno, because he is the coolest actor since Samuel L. Jackson.And seriously, for a movie made just four years before its set-time, it went way overboard.Oh and a fun fact: ECW and WWE's Paul Heyman is that annoying commentator you see from scene 1... and generally in each and every scene afterwards.From wrestling (Heyman), fake metal (Slipknot) to horrible acting (Klein) and a poor storyline that can truly only be outdone by Gigli, I find myself wanting to rip out my left kidney if not for the fact I already did so watching Gigli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rollerball is a pointless remake and a terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball is a bad movie that pretty much fails on every level. It's the year 2005 and the new sport of Rollerball is very popular. Marcus Ridley {LL Cool J} recruits his friend Jonathan Cross {Chris Klein} into the very dangerous sport which may not be that luxury as it seems. One of the games promoters will do anything to get higher ratings even if that means death. I have seen the original and after watching this I wonder why they took a very good film and just ruined it. Rollerball is a poorly written movie that lacks suspense and good action. The film is just really ridiculous at times that its hard to take serious. The dialog is really lame and the characters aren't very developed . The acting is terrible with the worst probably being Chris Klein who doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead. LL Cool J was alright but he just doesn't seem to be trying. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Jean Reno both do a decent job but like LL Cool J, they just don't seem to really be trying. I can't blame them though as the writing is horrible and they are not given a lot of material to work with. The film is a lot more violent then the original, however, the action is still not very impressive. It also doesn't help matters that the studio got scared and went for the PG-13 rating and so the editing looks very bad. The film is about 95 minutes long but it drags on forever since its just a really boring film. The film is also confusing as some of the events that occur in the film don't really make a lot of sense. At some point during the film you will most likely stop caring. If you have seen the original then you will hate this movie. If you haven't seen it then you might like this but that's not very likely. Its just better to see the original. Rollerball is a loud and terrible film that's worth skipping and its also one of the worst films of 2002. Rating 2/10 avoid this film at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rollerball is one of the worst movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnathan Cross, a lover of extreme sports, is recruited to star in Rollerball. The players are on Rollerblades, trying to bring a heavy metal ball into a high goal. Also, there are motorcyclists around to bring momentum to the players. Oh yes, and there are no rules in the game. During his skyrocketing career, Johnathan has to experience what Alexi has found out: Blood brings more viewing pleasure to the audience. In a final game, Johnathan and his team have to fight for mere survival.Back in 1975, James Caan brought us a brutal movie in which you can literally hear every bone in the players body break. Now, John McTieran has brought that film to us again, for a new generation. With stars like LL Cool J, Rebbeca Romijn and Chris Klein you would expect it to be a pretty bad remake, but this is not the case. Rollerball does the unthinkable and gives Psycho a running for it's money as the worst remake ever created by man.Chris Klein in every film he has been in manages to make it look as if he has no range at all. His soft voice and good looks can only go so far, and in a movie where you need to beat the living hell out of another team member, you want someone that can at least yell and make a sound beyond a bird chirp. LL Cool J is only hear to bring the film a "cool" hip look, he's suppose to be the I don't give a damn, James Dean character, but it doesn't fly. Rebbeca Romijn, well, she has a nude scene, but when it's covered in the dark, you wonder why she is even in the movie to begin with.Rollerball is suppose to be a bloody entertaining film, but McTeirnan at no point manages to show us anything entertaining. The entire game sequences seem uninspired and drawn out. When it goes for a shock, it misses and misses completely. I'm still wondering if LL Cool J's character is dead or alive, but apparently it's not important to the story. LL Cool J probably knew that this was going to be garbage and left the movie, leaving the film crew to make his character disappear. I don't blame him.Not even the professional himself, Jean Reno save this film from the ultimate horrible experience that we all will endure from seeing this film. In a film about violence in sports, you would expect to see some, but when you have a PG-13 rating, you know that it was targeted to make money and nothing else.I can't understand why someone would want to see this film, the final action sequence is yet another let-down in this horrible tripe. The only thing that this film has going for it, is it's 97 minute length, so if you do have the unfortunate experience of sitting through it, it will be over soon enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to get an awful mess remaking a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspected 2002 "Rollerball" was an ugly movie, but not that ugly! Well, let's get rid of the only merit of the movie: the presence of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, beautiful and tremendously sexy. Indeed, a statuesque female warrior is always sexy, all the more with that alluring scar on her face.The tragic fact with "Rollerball" is that the story should be good, per se. The authors took the ideas from the original (and true) 1975 "Rollerball". They deleted the political and moral messages, which were somewhat a weakness of the 1975 film, and placed the story in some remote countries of a near future, allegedly ruled by violence, greed, abuse. But the way the film is made turns it into a disaster.There is an over-long (and boring) preamble, with a race down-hill of some cretinous youngsters, in San Francisco. This is a great narrative mistake. The audience is anxious to know about the Rollerball game, and you excruciate them with idiots, easily found, alas!, in everyday life. In the next scene Jonathan (a remarkably blunt Chris Klein) has become the undisputed superstar of the Rollerball. We don't understand anything of the rules of the game. As a matter of fact, we don't understand anything of the plot! The guys on the screen keep talking about other guys, seemingly killed by the bad ones, or something like that. Who are who? The audience utterly ignores it. The next scene (say: someone escaping from somewhere) has no logical connection with the previous one. I bet that in the final editing of the movie a good 30 minutes were cut, making the story a complete mess. The only thing we get is that the villains deliberately provoke accidents on the field to raise the TV audience of the game. And then there is the lousy greenish nocturnal scene. Up to my knowledge, the worst visual idea in the history of cinema. Some 15 minutes of sufferings for the innocent viewer. The ending is even more ludicrous than expected.But what is really incredible, even in a terrible movie, is that, in spite of the enormous technological improvements, the scenes of the game, and related special effects, are by far less spectacular, exciting, violent than those of the 1975 "Rollerball". The possibly interesting presence of women playing Rollerball is not exploited at all. The uniforms of the teams are worse than horrible, they are stupid.There's nothing to save in "Rollerball". Just take Romijn-Stamos and bring her to another movie (keeping the scar on her face, if possible).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the starving in the World, some coke abusing studio Exec gave the OK to spend 70 million US on THIS travesty ! I assume this person lost their job.It is just like watching an episode of the TV show Gladiators, all the combatants have stupid names and costumes, and the grand oval Rollerball tracks of the original have been replaced with a tiny, cheap looking hamster run figure eight, littered with jumps, that is barely 25 yards in length !But what really kills the film is the God awful "Directing".What was John Mac doing ? The Rollerball games themselves are impossible to follow because he is constantly cutting from close up to close up at a frenetic pace (possibly because none of the actors can actually skate ?) The result is you cannot follow what on earth is going on.The only good performance in this film is from LL Cool J, and what with him being a black actor, then inevitably, he gets killed, and we are forced to suffer "Keanu-lite"; Chris Klein from there after.This film really is the pits. I hear that the "Special Edition DVD" is just an empty box.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plain dreadful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really speechless after watching "Rollerball". I expected a dull movie, not something so dreadful. "Rollerball" has all the elements to make one of those bizarre cult classics from the 70's and 80's. Except the fun element.The movie starts with the worst police chase in years. Believe me, any Lorenzo Lamas movie, even one featuring appearances from Dolph Lundgren, can be capable of a car chase better than this: we see Chris Klein running from police in a mix of skateboard and racing-car, in San Francisco. Then, helped by his friend LL Cool J., he goes to an Asiatic country. There, the most popular game is the Rollerball, a mix of basketball and roller-skating that seems to be deadly and a great money-maker. Rollerball is controlled by Jean Reno's character, the average "mad-business-man" stereotype. Then, we learn that Chris Klein is having an affair with his Rollerball partner, Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos.What comes next is not worth telling. Of course, Chris, LL and Rebbeca will make a rebellion against Jean Reno. But there isn't anything new in this idea. It's wasted by a script that, once tries to make a cheap social critic, then tries to shove action sequences in the screen at all coasts, and both are really bad.The acting is at the last level. It's incredible to see Jean Reno, an actor that is mostly great (watch "Red Rivers") making such a mess with his role. It's so stereotyped and has so less to do (despite it's importance in the plot) that you can completely forget about it. LL Cool J. is a special case: he keep going well for a while, and then completely disappears, showing that, maybe, good acting wasn't allowed in Rollerball rules.Oh, the main couple. Chris Klein and Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos. Well, Rebbeca is incredibly sexy in this role, and it's nice to see her in topless scenes, so we can forget she's so bad here. And Klein. Let's just say Chris Klein will NEVER work in an action movie anymore. At least we hope so.In the end, the movie is a complete mess. Is not only a waste of money, but also waste of time, celluloid and Jean Reno. That is a complete sin. It feels like director John McTiernan wanted so badly to make a stylish movie that he forgot to make a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Rollerball' is a god-awful remake of the 1975 Norman Jewison film about a fictional sport in which murdering the players becomes a primary object of the game. The original film acquired what little credibility it had by setting the story sometime in the distant future. This version is set in the present, but it tries to maintain its believability by locating the league in Southwest Asia, under the parochial assumption, I suppose, that that part of the world is every bit as alien, exotic and dehumanized as any hypothetical future society. It doesn't work. It is simply impossible for us to believe even for a split second that the owners and promoters of this sport would think they could get away with such murderous shenanigans broadcast live to millions of viewers the world over. Might not the United Nations, among other international organizations, have a thing or two to say about all this? Also, will someone please explain to me just WHAT purpose is served by having the promoters of this sport killing off their own players? Doesn't that sort of deplete their own resources for future games? I can't imagine too many people willingly signing on to engage in this sort of gladiatorial tomfoolery.Even if we agreed to swallow the whole thing merely for the sake of the entertainment value of the film, we would be forced to admit that `Rollerball' is a chintzy, clunky, uninteresting movie in all respects. The sport itself ? sort of a cross between motor cross racing, roller derby, hockey and basketball ? is completely unexciting, consisting of little more than blurred figures racing madly around a cramped, claustrophobic track. Without even the context of good action sequences, `Rollerball' is forced to fall back on its dialogue and characters, which proves to be disastrous for all concerned. Chris Klein, in the role of hotshot Jonathon Cross - played by James Caan in the original - comes across as a minor league version of Keanu Reeves. LL Cool J is wasted in the part of Jonathon's American sidekick, and poor Jean Reno gets to play one of the most laughable villains we've run across in a movie in a long long long long time. In fact, this redux turns out to be good for nothing BUT a few hearty laughs. If you are in need of such, check out `Rollerball.' It's a real hoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film was a masterpiece. Not only for the (at the time) over-the-top action, but for the marvelously clear look into the future. Only science-fiction would dare suggest the future holds society completely employed by six corporations! What a brilliant prophecy!In the self-centered and hedonistic 70's, isn't it amazing the true gist of the original film is the attempt to keep a famous player from becoming bigger than the game he plays? One need only peruse today's business section to see how our society now strives to eliminate the notion of the individual in favor of an identity-nullifying "team concept."So one can say the original is all about the triumph of the individual.The 2002 version is nothing more than a haphazard mess that shows what happens when a studio changes hands and a cinematic vision is compromised for a PG-13 rating that effectively destroys the film. Rollerball could do with a well-intentioned remake; this wasn't it.................by a long shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original ROLLERBALL was by no means a classic SF movie but at least the audience knew they were watching a dark futuristic thriller . This completely lame remake misfires on every level . Since it's set a couple of years in the future there's no chance it can be called futuristic . It might be described as " Dark " but that's because no one seems to have paid the electricity bill during production . But the main failing in this version is the game of Rollerball itself . In the original the game would see matches where several team members would either die or be maimed for life but in this present day version it doesn't seem anymore dangerous than American football or Rugby or any other type of contact sport . hell even bimbos are allowed to take part . in other words this is a game for wimps in comparison and this ruins the movie far more than the oft quoted aspects like the poor acting , camp sound effects and the night vision sequence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst remakes ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good friend of mine, and fellow rabid film fan, said he would give me a tenner (?10) if I honestly felt that Rollerball was worth a score higher than 1/10; as much as I need the cash, I just can't bring myself to lie. Rollerball is absolutely dire and truly deserves the lowest rating possible.A muddled, unexciting piece of drivel from the word go, John McTiernan's lousy remake of Norman Jewison's 70s cult favourite is every inch as bad as you have probably heard. Perpetually-perplexed-looking Chris Klein is unwisely cast as Jonathan (portrayed by James Caan in the original), a thrill junkie who is convinced by good friend Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J) to try his hand at Rollerball, a dangerous team sport played in Russia and its neighbouring countries.The evil men controlling the sport, led by Alexis Petrovich (Jean Reno), are corrupt gangsters who will trade players lives in order to boost their ratings. But a brave American citizen like Jonathan isn't about to kowtow to the demands of nasty foreigners, and sets about upsetting the applecart.To be honest, there are so many reasons to despise this movie, I really do not know where to start. I guess as good a place as any would be with director McTiernan, who seems to have lost all ability to make a decent film. This is the man who redefined the action movie in the 80s with Die Hard. He also proved he could do a decent remake with The Thomas Crown Affair. So what the hell happened here?His Rollerball is unexciting, glossy toss that makes the mistake of pandering to the teen crowd. As a result, we get a pretty boy lead 'actor' (Klein makes Keanu Reeves look like Olivier), a rapper playing support, an ex-model (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as the love interest, and even an inexplicable appearance by noise-merchants Slipknot. The script treats the viewer with contempt, making no attempt to explain the titular game, rendering the action scenes meaningless. If we have no idea of the rules of the sport, how the hell can we get excited about it?Visually the film is even worse: the 'roller dome'?the arena in which Jonathan is king (despite constantly looking as if he is about to wet himself)?resembles a kids activity area rather than a tough battlefield; the players, dressed in shiny PVC, look like they're off to an S&amp;M party; and for some reason an entire chase scene is shot viewed though some kind of night-vision goggles.The acting ranges from poor (Reno, Romijn-Stamos) to very poor (Klein, rapidly becoming my most hated actor, and LL Cool J).Gone is the bone-crunching realistic violence of the original film; in McTiernan's version of the sport, it seems that no-one is supposed to get hurt?if they do get injured, it's because of their unscrupulous bosses and their money-grabbing ways. Gone is the futuristic setting?this one is supposed to be in the here and now! And gone is any respect I had for JohnMcTiernan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the original film, the game attempted to stand as an outlet of Corporation superiority; constantly demonstrating to the consumers (the people) that individuality is futile. Apparently, one does not have to either read the screenplay or physically watch the original film for there to be a remake. Decent director John McTiernan, who "wow-ed" me with such films as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair as well as his early cult hits like Die Hard and Predator has obviously lost his ability to either A) do remakes or B) handle a camera with any sense of decency. If I was allowed one question to have answered through the course of my life, my question would be, "What was the point of Rollerball the remake?", and I do believe there would be answer from any higher authority. This film single handedly goes down in the record books as not just the worst remake to come out of Hollywood, but it is also a double threat, with it being in the top 100 of worst films ever conceived. It is embarrassing to say, but it has to be said, that Rollerball is one of a few select films that demonstrated no ability in the fields of direction, acting, cinematography, or writing. Nothing, I repeat, nothing of value can be found with this film, and I even tried hard, but one must easily look at this film and simply state, "It failed".There was absolutely nothing science fiction about this film outside of the possibility of the actual Rollerball game being a rather sci-fi-esquire type game, but when you look at it, there is nothing special about the sport. The 1975 film version was extremely science fiction with its views on the future of our world, the surrounding environment, as well as subtly placed usage of the laser gun. Yet somehow, this 2002 version is able to call itself a "science fiction" merely on the premise that it takes place three years in the future. Three. Whole. Years. That to me is the staple of why this film corrupted from the inside out. The writing was atrocious to say the least. It felt as if the writers of this film, one Larry Ferguson or one John Pogue (odd, this horrid smelling filth of a film took two of Hollywood's scribes ? ouchers!), took random ideas, threw them together and attempted to create continuity in the course of 97 minutes. No doubtably procrastination was an issue, and to cut corners to meet a deadline these avid writers chose to cut characters, huge plot points, and any sort of solid stream of consciousness to create possibly the worst that Hollywood could ever offer. Nothing, in the form of script, plot, or action/adventure is worth mentioning in this film. Words came out of the actor's mouths, but they meant nothing, they stood for nothing, and half the time it just had me laughing due to the staged words that they were dealt. Again, there was no value in this film.Chris Klein has ridden the shirt tales of American Pie for a very long time (I always saw him as the Weakest Link of those films), so he decided to take a leading man's role in Rollerball in hopes that he could transform his career into a leading man, but you can't make cardboard stand on his own. Could Chris have attempted to grow a backbone for this film ? is that possible? The words that came out of his mouth had no emotion; he was together with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos for purely the physical admiration, and someone needs to tell him that by squinting his eyes harder doesn't indicate that he is upset or angry. I cannot seem to shake the image of him riding with L.L. Cool J in the Russian night on a motorcycle using "night vision" for dramatic purposes, and Klein speaking unattached words out of my mind. It was hilarity on a grand scale. I remember the pair talking about something, but the laughter coming from my mouth was far more overpowering. Nothing (which seems to be the common theme of this film) is of value in this film. That isn't to say that those like LL, Jean Reno, Stamos, or even my favorite Naveen Andrews were any better. Klein led the pact with kindergarten acting skills, but Reno was completely over the top, which caused confusion as to who he was and why he was involved financially, Andrews was nothing more than filler, Stamos was used for the nudity ? that was all, and LL kept the "hip-ness" factor on a grander scale. Nobody demonstrated anything close to talent in this film and it ultimately boils down to the failure of decent director John McTiernan.Rollerball is one of those films that gives remakes a horrid name. Even if the original wasn't worth writing home to mother about, films of this stature only place a black scar on the future of remakes. I have to be worried about McTiernan because of my enjoyment of some of his past films and how anyone could see the final cut of this film and say, "This is my best work yet!" If you cannot say those words as you hand the final reel to the distribution company, I would reconsider the release. Writing was far worse that imaginable, the acting was nowhere to be seen, and the cinematography (something I didn't feel like going into too deeply with this review) felt as if it was done by those who are afraid of camera. Honestly, I have seen better amateur work than what Rollerball had to offer. Why is this film still being distributed? My only wish is that future directors and actors actually take pride in their work instead of just allowing the paycheck to do the talking. Ignore this film or it will haunt you the rest of your life! Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This rat turd has nothing to do with Harrison's story or Jewison's 1975 SF classic, and using their title this way should be criminally prosecutable.The director, fearing (perhaps rightly) that today's relatively illiterate and dense younger audiences couldn't follow the subtle plot and story arcs of the original, settled for a limp cartoon featuring a grinning plastic hero (Keanu Reeves without the dramatic flair) and a fast whiz-bang pace to make sure no one notices that this emperor has no clothes. I noticed, thank you.Don't waste your time; rent the original and see why it's been a cult classic for 30 years, whereas this one was forgotten in 30 days.The original Jonathan E's search for how the status quo came to be, and why man had lost control of his destiny, was central to the theme -- completely ignored in the 2002 cheap Chinese knockoff. HIs quote, "It is as though at some time in the past we were given a choice to trade our freedom for comfort...." wouldn't even make sense in the remake, and the original ending -- affirming the ascendancy of the individual and (my interpretation) sounding the death knell for the Corporations -- had to be scrapped.Comparing the two versions: Compare the magnificent organ intro of the original (Bach's Toccata und Fugue in D-Minor) with the trashy barking of the 2002 sound track -- that says it all. It's like picking up two tools, one by Snap-On and the other by Chinese-made "Buffalo tools: the difference is instantly apparent.For those who have seen both and prefer the newer version, I have naught but contempt, or perhaps pity. It's those feeble souls that in Jewison's future world would willingly trade the gold of freedom for the dross of comfort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John McTiernan's amateur hour.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Original 'Rollerball' was a movie about dystopia future, where huge corporations ruled the world and there was no wars. But the blood lust of people had to be compensated, so there was this game called Rollerball, which was full of action, thrills and kills. But then one of the players was in the verge of becoming too big. He, Jonathe E. was a threat to the rule.We can forget all about that with this remake of that 70's classic. There is no political metaphor, no philosophical questions about humanity, in fact there is no sense at all, if you don't count nonsense, about the movie. John McTiernan, director of such classics as 'The Predator' and 'Die Hard' has managed to make a movie, that is in one word, poor.With some idiotic excuse the main protagonist Jonathan (at least the name is same), gets in the hazardous game of Rollerball with his pal Marcus (LL Cool J). Soon he notices, that there is something fishy about the game.There isn't anything worthwhile to mention about the film. Tiernan directs like a man, who hasn't directed a single piece of film in his life. The plot is idiotic and the main baddies are pretty much camp material. The action is poorly choreographed and the editing tries so badly to be music video like, that it's flat out funny.Can't really figure any reason for anyone to see this film.Rating: 1 out of 10Camp rating: 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreadful. At least three times during the movie, I contemplated turning the TV off but resisted, feeling I should at least finish what I'd started.There is NO character development--not that any of the characters (less two) were ever formally introduced. I barely knew who was who in this movie. There was also very little plot development, for that matter. To make it worse, this has probably got to be one of the most incoherent movies I've ever seen! I gave up trying to figure out what was going on and why. The story went here, there, and everywhere, without really explaining what was happening, and with very little dialogue. Much of what was done and said made very little sense. Did I mention the camera work was poor? Is it any wonder that I kept staring at the clock, keeping track of how much longer I had to endure?But don't take my word for it. If you've got a couple hours to kill, watch it and wonder for yourselves why this movie ever made it to theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rollerballs !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much. In fact the poorest of poor reviews that this film received had made me curious enough to watch this it (for free on cable I might add). Firstly I should say that I am not a huge fan of the original movie, it is a reasonable action film, so my dislike does not stem from a loyalty to the first incarnation of this story. My dislike for the 2002 Rollerball comes from a feeling of being patronized by everyone involved in the making of this movie. How did the producers ever think that this was acceptable on any level? The acting is second rate but what is to be expected from one of the worst casts ever assembled? Klein is worthless unless he is making a joke of his own persona (Election), LLcoolJ is one of a string of rappers that should never be given a 'tough guy' role simply because of his real profession and Reno, the one talented actor among them, seems to slip into pantomime dame territory. I will give Paul Heyman praise for his character as the English announcer, he seems to come across as a decent and fairly charasmatic actor but he does little that he doesn't do brilliantly in his day job.The attempted satire relating to the commercialisation of sport and its reliance on violence is pathetically toothless. The direction is simply a mess. The attempt to make this non-sensical sport look breathtaking through rapid editing and instant replay is awful. It does nothing but make you realize that restrained directing and editing are a wonderful thing.Rollerball represents everything that is wrong with mainstream Hollywood movies. It shows a lack the of originality, does this version add anything to the original version?, that has dogged film for years. I cannot believe that there are so few new ideas that we have to see cult action movies, cult British crime movies and television shows remade over and over again. This movie should be avoided at all costs. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this movie sucking so I rented it not expecting much. I have seen the original although it has been awhile. I think this was a fun movie with some cool action. The story was not the greatest and I thought the main carracter was to much of a pretty boy to pull of the bad ass. I also did not like how it goes from him riding skateboards in san fransico to him being the most popular rollerball player in 4 months? They should have shown when he comes in as a rookie and played a little of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm the sort of person who loves watching bad movies, and I've been trying to see this movie for years because of its reputation. Now that I've seen it, I can say that it is THE WORST movie I have ever seen. Forget Manos the Hands of Fate, Plan 9 from Outer Space, From Justin to Kelly, Battlefield Earth or whatever - this movie takes it. It is HORRIBLE. I think it features some of the worst cinematography and poorest editing I have ever seen, and I don't really understand why because the individuals involved in this movie (Director, Editors, Cinematography) are not really bad at what they do (at least if their other movies are any proof) . There are sequences included in this movie where you'll be looking at an unfocused close-up of a character you've never seen, followed by a cut to a totally unrelated scene, then another cut to an unfocused close-up of another random character that you'll never see again, with half of their face in frame for about 1 second before they move out of frame and there's another cut to an unrelated situation.I have never even written a review before on IMDb but I just *had* to write one about this movie. The only thing moderately enjoyable about this movie is the DVD commentary, which features LL Cool J rambling on about random topics and complaining when he gets blown up before the end of the movie. Unlike most bad movies that are at least fun to watch because of how horrible they are, this movie is beyond laughably bad, it's simply UNWATCHABLE. See it only if you want to be assured that you've seen THE WORST MOVIE to ever hit theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A certain film critic -- I believe it was the NY Times reviewer -- labeled "Battlefield Earth" as, to paraphrase, "what will become known in infamy as the worst film of the 21st century." He was wrong. "Rollerball" wins hands down. The acting, dialogue and direction are incomparably bad -- and I defy anyone to sit down after watching the movie once and effectively explain the plots, character motivations, or any of the rules of the Rollerball game. This is the most poorly-edited major studio film I've seen since "Superman IV," which is still my least favorite movie of all time. There are at least five or six very, very obvious dubs over the f-word, clearly done late in the game to obtain a PG-13 rating. This is fine for an airing on network television, but for an R-rated DVD? Um, no. Others here have already eviscerated the ridiculous night-vision sentence effectively, so I won't go there. The only thing remotely worth watching in this film is the opening luge sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladies and gentleman, Rollerball was one of the worst movies this moviebuff as ever layed eyes upon. I did walk into the theatre expecting a mediocre sports fantasy movie, what I got was terrible acting, horrendous editing, a plot i could drive a fleet of tanks through and enough nightmares to scare narcoleptics into staying awake. The movie would have been a fine B movie if it wasn't for the director's attempt at making something artistic. I left the theatre angry, upset and offended. This terrible arrangement of utterly horrible scenes should not even have the privlege of being called a movie. This movie makes Fast and the Furious look like Casablanca.</fullReview>

If you say the original, you will want to leave the theater after the first 10 minutes. The new Rollerball doesn't have the social commentary which the original was ALL ABOUT! It attempted to made us look critically at the amount of violence that we want to "entertain" us. But in the new Rollerball, they glorify the violence! It is edited horribly, and we can't care less about about Klien's character. Re-release the original and lock up the new version in a vault somewhere forever.</fullReview>

I am glad those involved must have been quick to bank their cheques...We will see them on "Cribs" next, showing off their new homes and paraphernalia, probably sporting a Rollerball 2002 poster in a glass frame on some staircase landing...I nearly bought the DVD video, after all the advertising hype...Im glad I did not, I would rather buy ?10 of white stewed cabbage and make myself more sick, than I currently am feeling after watching this again...Worst film and my worst IMDb mark Sorry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big budget disaster that really lives up to the overused 'one of the worst movies ever' line. John McTiernan never showed at the premiere, so he obviously didn't think much of the final product, but he signed onto a film staring Chris Klein and opted to shoot part of the film in night vision. Did he also approve the cartoon 'boing' sound effects during the night vision sequence too? MGM moved the release date around a couple of times before pushing it back almost a year and dumping it in February and after endless production horror stories that leaked and talks of reshoots - the film was released in a cut PG-13 form that only showed MGM didn't even want to spend a dime on reshoots for this dud. Silly black censor bras were put over boobs in locker room scenes; the film inexplicably grinds to a slow motion halt like the projector is failing when profanity occurs; blood is digitally turned to sweat - and the whole thing stinks. Sure, some of it is point at the screen funny, but the film is so disjointed and bizarre, that you have to question the sanity of McTiernan. How he wasn't fired after executives viewed dailies, especially the night vision crap, is a mystery in its own. This isn't the work of a seasoned pro, this is the work of man who has lost his way. Very few films with a budget this high and with this many resources at their disposal, are this incompetent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's not as easy as it seems. First you need a good story. To spoil. Then you need a miscast. Forgettable, in every way, the guy in the main role, who's supposed to be a tough roller-ball player.Director misses the point all the time. Here, an accent should be on a metaphor for totalitarian society, benumbed with all the luxuries of the world, convinced that each individualistic attempt is doomed from the start. Here we have a different case - a metaphor, a pure object, a motive became a story itself. With none of 1960's, 1970's, politically awake attitudes, everything became cheap fun or even cheaper boredom.An interesting datum: a character nicknamed ,,The Assassin''(a Russian) speaks somewhat fluent serbocroatian ,,Ostavi to, ti budalo'' /Live that, you fool/ (in Russian a fool is said ,,durak''), so as the central Asian, Caucasian miner (at least he understands it)at the end of movie. The same miner works at the same time in Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Also, if you never knew - central and east Asia are inhabited with loads of African Americans. And America's everywhere.</fullReview>

When the movie actually did come out, those who took a chance to go and see it were heavily disappointed. 95% of the characters were either extremely annoying, or were horribly acted. Everything about the Rollerball competitions was ridiculous. The night vision sequence was the icing on the cake. We can only hope that no film will ever attempt a scene like that again.

		<shortDescription>Truly painful viewing - The worst movie and the biggest insult to quality movie making I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so bad it is not even funny. Positive Numerical ratings do not cut it ?Negative numbers are required to rate this revolting pile of manure.The 1970's original starring James Caan was a masterpiece reminiscent of Michael Chrichton classics like "The Andromeda Strain."Absurd casting becomes obvious early on, for example ? the lovely Ms Rebecca Romijn has a sexual relationship with Chris "I'm going to look like I'm 16 til I'm 65" Klein! It is a truly disturbing and distasteful looking mismatch. Today it makes one think of the infamous Florida teacher "Debra Lefave" and her sexual relationship with one of her 14-year-old students.The entire first half of this modern "Rollerball" I felt nothing but pity for LL Cool J ? a man working hard to broaden his entertainment career - saddled with a script that could have been concocted in a bar between drunken cocaine-fuelled movie exec's with a collective IQ of a single Madagascan Cockroach.One sequence is a chase through the desert, filmed entirely in green-tinted night-vision. The sequence contains sparse dialogue, which, like the rest of the movie, is utter nonsense and without any sense of a plot. When this long sequence finally ends, one is genuinely left with the feeling that someone cut the whole Night-Vision sequence in accidentally ? perhaps during a drug binge, or while sleepwalking.In the 1970's "original," the fictional game of "Rollerball" is understandably a clearly explained core element of the story telling. Many of the originals exciting sequences involve watching the game in progress. The sport of "Rollerball" is a violent game involving people on roller-skates and motorbikes and many violent tactics and incidents. There is an elliptical course for the players to follow and the aim involves the battle between teams of 8-12 men struggling to gain control of a sphere that must reach a receptacle high up on one of the banked walls around the course.In the remake, the game makes no sense at all. Instead, this 21st century version uses a tiny set (perhaps because of budget constraints) which makes the game itself a self-parody reminiscent of a hilarious performance of a song named "Stonehenge" in the movie "Spinal Tap."We are supposed to leave the theatre thoughtful of the subject matter about real-life unfortunate young athletes who suffer crippling injuries early on in their career and about how moral it is to put such pressure on their performances when they are so young and have the hopes and dreams of so many on their shoulders. We are supposed to be left with a profound morality tale that is supposed to provoke thoughts about the morality of big business in sports. The James Caan original left me personally thinking about professional sporting competitions, and how they have such a powerful attraction to young people ? especially ones who have grown up in poverty. Surely the aim of the subject matter is to provoke thought and discussion on the absurdity of the unimaginable wages being offered for such young talents before they have established a maturity which might give them the much needed discipline and know-how. At 18 or 21 almost no-one thinks about providing for their future and the real sports we play are dangerous enough that some can be crippled for life or injured in such a way to end a career.In the remake, the players revolt and turn their violence upon their employers. The morality tale is entirely lost and the thought-provoking nature of the story disappears behind a fog of abysmal direction, camera-work, acting, script, and dialogue.Don't even watch this as a joke ? go watch "Gigli" or something truly amusingly bad. This mess is disturbingly sad for a story which has so much potential, it is consistently nonsensical and lacking in any kind of coherent plot or even a signal of intent from the director beyond making a trendy little slice of sci-fi-lite. Despite the fact that this movie is cut together like a trendy music video it is not in the least bit exciting, well-paced, entertaining or even basically satisfying being played on a TV in the background.Watch only as a lesson in how not to make movies.</fullReview>

Still, errr, I really didn't get this film.The opening sequence, with the photographers complaining about being paid $250 instead of $400 - this confused me. I thought it was somehow significant (the inclusion of the photographers, or else their poor rate of pay). I continued to be confused while Thingy and Whatsit were risking life and limb rolling down the hill. I definitely didn't understand that bit. And hey, what did that bit have to do with the rest of the film, anyway? Nothing other than to explain why the American, Jonathan, disappears into a rather dodgy and Iron-Curtain-ish world of violent "sport".I like the idea of players fighting the corruption of their greedy owners/sponsors, but if that's the only premise of this film, did it have to besmirch the concept of the original? I might have enjoyed it more if I was drunk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This contains spoilers.I've never seen the original 1970's Rollerball, so comparisons with that are out of the picture. But they are not needed, because this movie is just that bad.John Mctiernan (did I spell that right?) is a very good director who has made some of my favorite movies like "Predator" and "The Hunt for Red October". I really think that he shouldn't be blamed for this movie, as the best director in the world couldn't salvage the script.The basic plot of the movie is this: A kid played by Chris Klein is about to be arrested when he is saved by his friend (LL Cool J) and joins a Rollerball League in Kazhakstan. He then encounters corruption with the evil team owner (Jean Reno) and romance with a teammate (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos).Now the problems with the movie are huge, but the first is the game itself. Rollerball is just too confusing and complicated, and we're never even shown the score to any of the games, eliminating the possibility of any suspense. Also, the players wear outrageous uniforms that show little favor for reality.The problem about the evil team owner trying to engineer violence for ratings is just STUPID!!!! A few problems with this are: The game is plenty violent as is, and millions of TVs don't just turn on when someone gets hurt.Eventually the hero and his friend try to escape. The whole escape sequence is shot in green "Night Vision", thus making it very hard on the eyes. And it doesn't help that the characterization is laughable.SO ROLLERBALL SUCKS!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was McTiernan thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Contains spoiler for the original Rollerball)There are two themes running through the original Rollerball - the futility of man against the corporation, and the mesmerizing action of the game itself. Somehow John McTiernan takes both of these themes and totally butchers them into something that does not remotely do justice to the original, or to anything else for that matter.The premise of 'accidents' being staged to pump up international ratings (on what medium?), and concurrent gambling on games, instantaneously, is stretching credibility. Having co-ed teams is almost believable but those stupid masks that the players all wear? And placing it all in Central Asia is bizarre.The game itself has been changed from the original circular 1/8 mile track into a nightmare collection of props that only an X-Games inline skater could love. A demolition derby-style course, with jumping ramps where the paths cross, would already make for a hazardous game IMO. Motorcycles dragging players off the steeply banked turns and up onto the clear viewing panels? Guess it had to be Central Asia since this would never fly in the US with OSHA around. Staging accidents in this version simply wouldn't be necessary.The parallels to the original with the rules changes to the game (not that there was much in the rules brought out in the plot) is the product of a premise by the director without the slightest idea of how to advance a story. There just isn't any there there, to paraphrase Gertrude Stein.Watch the original, and especially the final scenes, with the silent crowd, the dead players on the track, the game reduced to Jonathon E stumbling around the track to score the only, meaningless goal, that is film-making. The amateurish ending of this namesake says 'so what?'It is a sad waste of a tremendous idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even LL Said This Movie Sucked!! **Spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though everyone dissed this film, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and watch it. I've watched films that no one else has liked and ended up loving them (i.e. "Under the Cherry Moon," "Kingdom Come," etc.), and this movie had so much potential to be great: it had lots of action, a very interesting plot, and most importantly, the finest and sexiest man on Earth, LL Cool J. I found out the hard way that this movie was what everyone made it out to be...a waste of time.First of all, the game of Rollerball was never explained. If this were a movie about football, basketball, or any other known sport, there would be no need for explanation. However, the game of Rollerball doesn't exist, so it would've have been nice if we got some kind of idea of what's going on in the game. Instead, we see a bunch of folks riding motorcycles and skating around a rink, and we don't know what in the world they're really supposed to be doing. All we do know is that when one of them gets the steel ball in the weird looking goal, they score a point, and if it wasn't for common sense, we wouldn't know that much.Second of all, the movie doesn't flow smoothly. It's like the storyline is in a race to get to the end. One minute, LL and Chris Klein are talking about playing for the Rollerball team, the next minute, four whole months have passed, and Chris Klein is the star of the Rollerball team. Then, when the players find out that the game of Rollerball is corrupt, everything is rushed through; from the time Toba gets killed to the last getaway scene. I don't know about anyone else, but I didn't really understand how the miners really played into the story, either. They didn't spend enough time on it for me. Maybe that's just my ignorance, but I felt that should have been explained further.I didn't really mind the "infared" scene (although it was a bit odd, at least it was original), but the editing got on my nerves. I never thought I would be so nit-picky as to complain about the editing in a film (no offense to the people that do pay close attention to editing), but the bad editing in this movie was obvious. It was like they cut the actual film in half and put it back together with tape...Scotch tape, that is.In spite of the points I just mentioned, the main reason I didn't like this film is what happened towards the end (**SPOILER**)...they killed LL!! Why did LL have to die? I'm a die hard LL Cool J fan, so when he got killed, I wanted nothing more to do with this movie. Another thing I didn't like about this film was that LL's character didn't really do too much for the film (he did more for it than Rebecca Rojmin-Stamos, in my opinion. I felt she was just an extra character), and he had some dumb lines. It was reminiscent of his role in "Halloween: H20" (I don't like that film, either). Also, the ending was garbage (mainly because LL wasn't in it).The only good things about this film are the action scenes (even though you don't know what's going on when the Rollerball games are in session), the fact that LL was looking fine (as usual), and LL being the team captain. Other than that, this film has no real redeeming qualities. The actors themselves were okay, but not really phenomenal. LL did a great job, but like I said before, some of his lines were dumb, and his character didn't do much, so that hurt his performance a little. Chris Klein did okay, but he had some idiotic lines himself. Rebecca Rojmin-Stamos was alright; her accent needed work, and Jean Reno could be irritating at times. In my opinion, this movie could have been really good. I don't know where the people involved in this film went wrong. It ended up being a real disappointment (not to mention a waste of $3.00 and an hour and thirty minutes of my life!). Interesting enough, not only has everyone that's seen "Rollerball" hated it, but LL himself publicly announced on "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" that this movie sucked. That's really sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAN THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. It's the perfect badly-put-together movie that makes little/no sense and is basically a black eye on all other film directors. It insults the intelligence of the average viewer - things like plot, character development, and music are all eschewed in favor of MORE AND MORE ACTION AND SOME BREASTS. Moreover, the action is presented in incomprehensible cutscenes. You could take the entire movie reel, chop it up, throw all the pieces in a hat and then pick them out at random and splice them together and it would make just as much sense. Heck, it might even be better.And the best part is that this movie is about this sport called Rollerball. The movie spends exactly 10 seconds explaining how the game is played and nobody I've talked to really understood it. It involves some bladin', some jumpin' and some punchin' and that's all that McTiernan thought you needed to know. Oh, and there are motorcycles that zoom around for some unexplained reason.This movie is worth owning if you're a lover of bad cinema, but beware if you live in close quarters with other people - it's bad enough that they'll likely become physically violent if you watch it in their presence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rollerball 2002, the village idiot of movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*WARNING: SPOILERS*Well, you have to be thankful to Hollywood. Not only they have finally found a way to cash in without spending an ounce of time on ideas, they also have managed to find a way to destroy past films' reputation in the process.Sure, the practice of remaking older films was hardly avoided by the Studios in the past, but the trend has become so huge in the last few years that it is, quite frankly, embarrassing. Occasionally, a remake can still be a worthwhile experience, making up with professionalism and competence where lacking on the originality side. But for every good movie like Insomnia, how many hideous things like The Haunting, The Time Machine, Gus Van Sant's Psycho, or Roland Emmerich's Godzilla are we supposed to take?Whatever the level of badness of those last movies I mentioned, it still can't hold a candle to the astounding incompetence that is the 2002 version of Rollerball. While I do not have the absolute certainty, I'd say... well, screw it: this insipid, senseless, and insulting movie is definitely the worst remake I have ever seen. And while I am not what you would call a die-hard fan of Norman Jewison's Rollerball (see my take on the film if you want to see what I think about it), there were moments during the vision of the remake where I felt the urge of taking the rental DVD and smashing it into a thousand pieces, so that next generations would be preserved from renting it instead of the old one. Fortunately I had not paid for it, a friend of mine did.Yes ladies and gentlemen, after just a few years since remakes have become common practice in Hollywood, we have already reached the rock bottom: Rollerball 2002, the village idiot of movies.Like any respectable (not) village idiot, Rollerball 2002 has no grasp of philosophical or social matters whatsoever; the 1975 version of Rollerball was full of serious, at times heavy-handed, but overall interesting socio-political commentary. Considering the fact that some of the original film's themes feel much closer to our world now than back then, there was room for updating them and making them feel more alive. But 'alive' is certainly not a word that applies to the 2002 version: lifeless, boring, and moronic are much more fitting. On the sociological level, the film is simply nonexistent: none of the original film's themes made it to the new version, and there is absolutely no trace of anything deep, thought-provoking, or simply stimulating. It is as if the filmmakers watched the original version and could not understand a thing about what existed beyond the simple action. It's all the more discomforting if you consider that the original was hardly all that subtle.Rollerball 2002 exists as a simple action movie but, sadly, it completely fails on that level as well. The action is confused, the editing sloppy, the plot a complete mess; hardly anything is revealed about the chaos we see, and when something is explained, it is simply asinine. The characters are ridiculous two-dimensional (or, like some prefer to say, zero-dimensional) puppies without an ounce of common sense.The film opens up in 2005 in San Francisco, where Jonathan Cross (Chris Klein) is competing in a dangerous contest where two opponents roll downhill laying down on some sort of big skateboard. Why anyone would indulge in such an imbecilic activity is beyond me, but it is enough for you to know that, after almost getting killed in the traffic, Jonathan gets picked up in a Porsche by his friend Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J), who tells him to stop it with such puerile games: there's this new sport Rollerball in Asia, and it pays big big money.So Jonathan goes to Asia and we get our first glimpse of the Rollerball. The rules are unclear, but don't worry: we are introduced the most annoying commentator alive, who proceeds to tell us only that "the rules are too complicated to explain". Then, in an arena with a tiny playground where both male and female players dress up like rejects from Slipknot (also briefly featured in the film), we are shown the game: not much can be seen between the record-breaking fast cuts, but it suffices to say that the previous rolling-down-the-hill farce looks good by comparison.In a few weeks Jonathan becomes the biggest star of the sport, but something nasty is going on: the man behind the league, Alexis Petrovich (Jean Reno, in his worst performance to date), notices that the TV ratings immediately go up when something violent happens, and when I say 'immediately' I mean magically the same second. So he begins orchestrating accidents, and while the ratings go higher and higher, Jonathan discovers the truth. Chaos ensues.One of the worst aspects of Rollerball 2002 is the editing: entire scenes seem to have been chopped off, resulting in a story that feels rushed, awkward, or just-plain-nonsensical in many occasions. In one scene, Jonathan and Marcus are in a hospital room under strict surveillance, and in the next scene they are in the desert driving a van. What happened in between is never explained, and it feels as if the filmmakers could not come up with anything that made sense so they just decided to blow it. There is a small amount of gratuitous nudity (including an all-time pathetic sex scene between Jonathan and Rollerball player Aurora, played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and a fair amount of nudity hinted at. The sets look unbelievably cheap, making you wonder where the 70 million dollars went. All the actors give terrible performances.While things in Rollerball never fail to maintain a certain level of badness, there are at least two scenes that truly stand out and beg the viewer to ponder "what were they thinking?"The first is the infamous 'night-vision' sequence; it takes place in the desert, and the protagonists are driving a van first, then are chased on a motorbike by an airplane. Everything onscreen is green, grainy, headache-inducing, and just plain horrid to look at. Then, in what could be only called a moment of pure, unadulterated cinematic insanity, the motorbike and the airplane crash through a fence and we hear cartoons-like 'BOING!' sounds. It's surreal. This sequence last around 20 minutes, akin to being in hell for 20 minutes.The second is the ending. Oh dear, the ending. The original had a perfect ending. In this one, we have to witness the protagonist chasing down the bad guys and kill them in cold blood with an iron bar. Insulting.Avoid this film like the plague.1.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try This At Home...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this dreck its opening weekend in the theaters. I was practically writhing in my seat, but about halfway through, I had an epiphany. It struck me very strongly and very clearly, and I had to test it. So, when the movie ended, and went and rented INSPECTOR GADGET, that insipid 1998 Disney comedy that was my formerly least favorite movie. I popped it in my VCR at home, and sure enough, I was right: after watching ROLLERBALL, movies that used to seem bad to me were suddenly tolerable. To further test myself, I put in my favorite film of all time, PULP FICTION. No cinema-going experience in my life has ever matched that viewing of PULP FICTION. It was alive and beautiful. I had tears in my eyes. I used to condemn ROLLERBALL as a pointless movie, but now I see that this film serves a very real purpose. It's like that poor, fat, ugly guy you pass on the street. When you see him, you feel bad for him, but better about yourself. You say, "I may not be perfect, but I least I don't look like THAT guy." Hence, ROLLERBALL. So, if you've recently watched a bad movie and are feeling down, I suggest giving ROLLERBALL a rent, then rewatching that first film. You may be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at an exclusive showing for competition winners courtesy of a local radio station. I really went because it was at the cool Sony cinema in Golden Square and it only seats about 60 people. The cinema was great but the movie sucked big time.The original Rollerball was not too much a good film in the first place so the idea to re-make it had to be questioned. What on earth was John McTiernan on when he made this film? It was like a pop-video made up of the out-takes from Starlight Express. It was so bad. The acting was non-existent (Chris Klein is Keanu Reeves doppelganger), the script - someone is still looking for it! The first 40 minutes of the film were completely without narrative. I was utterly confused by what was going on. The remaining 50 minutes were part escape part revenge plot wise - I think? Oh! and it was so really loud that you could not think (I think that is what the movie-makers wanted). You'd have to be mentally deficient to even try and gleam any redeeming features from this film (Even if Rebecca Romijn does run around with her breasts hanging out)!I saw this film for free and thought it was a waste of my time (at least I got some free drinks before the film).Don't waste your money and time to pay and go and see this tripe. It will be appearing on Channel 5 (A low brow TV channel in the UK) as one of their Tuesday night movies.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUCH Better than expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: the original film, starring James Caan and John Houseman, 1975, was not BORING. It is, rather, a sci-fi classic- a tale of man against the system, fighting to be who he is in the midst of corporate greed, etc. This new version, while not nearly as "deep" as the original film, is still quite entertaining. I liked some of the changes to the original story (i.e the setting: an up and coming extreme sport played in contemporary Cosack nations vs. aglobal, barbaric, futuristic, corporate warfare.) I also really appreciated the witty lines- especially at the end (no spoilers.) Contrary to what you'll read elsewhere here, the editing is NOT bad. IT IS very stylistic, and I can understand how someone could mistake it for bad editing if they weren't paying attention. (If you didn't like this film's editing, then by all means, avoid Stallone's "Get Carter," another very stylish and masterful editing job.)******POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW********* All in all, the only really unfortunate thing about this film is that it is reduced to a tale of revenge. In the original, Jonathan was Rollerball. It defined him and he was the icon of the sport. Outside forces tried to change that and defeat who he was- to separate him from the game. In the end, he overcame and his victorywas symbolized by his scoring. In defiance of all that was set in motion against him, he played the game. He scored.This newer version has our character willing to bail out of the game at the drop of a hat- he's only in it for the money. Rollerball will go on without him. So his motivation becomes revenge. The end is a bloodbath (that only furtherrepresents where we now are as a culture). Too hollow for me.I give it a 6/10 - much better than I expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK IMDb junkies, if you've read any of my reviews at this point you should notice that I enjoy "bad" or b-movies. Rarely, and I mean Catwoman rarely do I turn off the DVD player. But when I saw this film, well lets just say I began to contemplate the afterlife. It all comes down to one scene, a battery of nonsense imagery set to noises that clearly lack any true direction. I seem to remember an alarm clock, a rooster crow, a ninja "heeee-yaa" and bowling pins being hit, followed by a reporter asking LL Cool J if his mother was a crack head. I immediately began slapping myself in the face, asking if what I had seen was real, or whether I had eaten the wrong pill and found myself in the 'real' world where God-awful films like this actually get the go ahead and budget to be produced, shot, and released to the public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now as bad movies go, this one is alright. This is no ageing b-movie with awful script, bad acting and pointless directing. This is a modern, big budget movie with an awful script, bad acting and awful direction.Rollerball is one of those movies that sits in the 'why did they bother' category. An eighty million dollar movie churned out by Hollywood with absolutely no effort put into it at all. The original was a classic (although I must admit I haven't seen it), and like 'The Italian job' and 'King Kong' there really was no need to remake it. But at least other remakes are at least watchable (and at best quite good). Rollerball has become an unintentional comedy of massive proportions. You probably thought it wasn't possible to make an action hero more puny than Keanu Reeves, but in Chris Klein they found it. And to top it off, his acting is even more wooden.Rollerball, being a futuristic game, is set in the future. This gives it it's futuristic sci-fi feel. Wait, wait, no sorry I'm wrong. The director did set it in the future, by a mere 3 YEARS! What the hell is the point in that? Did he expect there to be any massive technological advances in the coming years, Again, I can't admit to having seen the original, but the actual game itself seems to have the most complicatedly pointless set of rules going. Is anyone supposed to make sense of it? Let me try and get this straight ? A team member has to grab the metal ball, do a loop of the track, jump through some plastic tunnels, and throw the ball at a metal disc, whilst avoiding amour plated motorbike riders intent on bludgeoning him. And it seems to be important that whoever has the ball lets the live band know what his plan is, so they can play him a suitable dramatic soundtrack as he whizzes around. They can have fouls in the game, but considering it doesn't appear to be a foul to knock someone's helmet off and punch them in the face, I'm not really sure what does actually constitute one.If that wasn't confusing enough, The director has thrown in a 'disgruntled Russian Miners' sub plot, and a 20 minute night-vision chase scene. The latter of which is set entirely in dark green and out of focus. It's enough to make you check if your DVD player has broken.Conclusion From the 'Boing!' sound effect of a snapping fence (that sounds pretty much like the sound Beavis makes when he gets an erection in 'Beavis and Butthead' to the twenty minute 'night vision' scene(makes you feel all green and fuzzy inside!) , Rollerball doesn't relent with stupidity.It gets a 3 because I've seen much much worse. But this is bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever you do... don't ever as much as consider watching this poor excuse for a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this(well, watching... occasionally glancing at it, which, unsurprisingly, was more than enough to pick up the plot), I have to wonder about its placing as #50 on the bottom 100 list... personally, I'd have rated it much higher. It's one of the worst films ever made, without a doubt. The plot is some muddled mess about the future in which some insane sport is run, and someone finds out about there being some cheating going on in it... I don't know, I think the biggest problem was that I really didn't give a damn. Some new sport is started, and it's worse than the rest... so? Don't participate in the bloody thing. Some people start cheating in order to win or make it more interesting or whatever... so? Isn't that what all sports are about? To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been a completely honest type of sports that was completely devoid of cheaters since... well, ever. That's what we do, us humans. We challenge each other to find someone who's better at one particular thing and cheat if we don't think we can win. What else is new? In case you haven't figured it out by yourself yet, no, I don't care for sports. The pacing is awful and tries the viewers patience, whilst the editing does its best to supply him/her with a sturdy migraine, usually successful. The editing, score and dialog clearly does what it can to seem 'hip', cool and fresh, mostly just resulting in more bodily pain(now it's not just your brain that hurts due to it trying hard to understand the pure crap the plot and the film in general is, now your ears will be bleeding from the noise and your eyes will be flinching from the quick, pointless cuts that try far too hard to be stylish). McTiernan, one question. What the hell is wrong with you? OK, maybe you were never *that* talented... but Last Action Hero was at the very least solid and Die Hard was good. How did you slide so low down the talent ladder? One of the steps broke and you didn't grab a hold of it, is that it? The acting is dire. Not that it's any surprise, really... come on, admit it, LL Cool J can't act, we all know it; and apparently, neither can Chris Klein, if his performance in this mess is anything to go by(guess he just got lucky in the American Pie films). The characters are poorly written clichés that we don't care even the slightest bit about. The whole film is an unforgivable mess of a somewhat decent idea with absolutely no redeeming qualities. See the first version or just skip this one altogether. I recommend this to mindless sports fans or teenagers who like loud noises and break-neck speed editing. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of this film long before the original 1975 Norman Jewison/James Caan version it is based on, mainly because of the leading actor and the fact that it's not rated well, I am relieved I watched the original before this remake, directed by John McTiernan (Predator, Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October). Basically in 2005, Rollerball is a sport that has become hugely popular in Central Asia, Russia, China, Mongolia and Turkey, it is an extraordinarily violent extension of roller derby involving motorcycles, a metal ball, and many trappings similar to professional wrestling. Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J) invites NHL (National Hockey League) hopeful Jonathan Cross (American Pie's Chris Klein) to become part of a team of rollerball, Jonathan soon becomes the star player, and the poster child of promoter Alexi Petrovich (Jean Reno). Jonathan at first enamoured by the high- octane sport, the fame and popularity, and with female teammate Aurora (Razzie nominated Rebecca Romijn), but he and Ridley discover cynical Alexi and his opportunistic assistant Sanjay (Lost's Naveen Andrews) want to keep the game popular, through planned gory "accidents", and ensuring Jonathan and Ridley will not quit and remain high-profile stars. Aurora is almost killed in an accident, so to save themselves Jonathan and Ridley flee the country, but they are followed by Alexi and several body guards, before they can reach the Russian border, the two are attacked, and Ridley is killed. Alexi tries to stage a public execution for Jonathan, following the escape attempt, by removing all the regular rules of Rollerball for the upcoming match, however Jonathan, with the help of his teammates, start a revolution, and cause the fans to see the sport for what it really is, a violent game where blood brings in the audience figures, and Alexi is killed as a result. Also starring Oleg Taktarov as Denekin, David Hemblen as Serokin, Janet Wright as Coach Olga, Mike Dopud as Michael 'The Assassin' and Kata Dobó as Katya, with cameo appearances by P!nk, Slipknot and Paul Heyman. I assumed Klein missed being in American Pie: The Wedding to be in this, this turned out to be untrue, he lacks charisma to be the lead, Romijn just looks gorgeous and doesn't do much, and the rest of the well known stars like Cool J, Reno and Andrews are silly. Cool J admitted the movie "sucked", but did his "duty" to promote it, he really should not have bothered, the performances are wooden, the story is full of clichés, and the pacy rollerball sequences and action set pieces are worthless, there are no thrills to be had here, it is one of the most boring films I've seen in years, a highly dull and pointless science-fiction sports drama.

		<shortDescription>A dopey remake that really misses the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reputation of this film really goes before it. It was of course a remake of the 1975 original and it almost goes without saying that it is also vastly inferior. Most remakes are worse of course but this one really misses the mark quite spectacularly. What is so surprising is that it's the action scenes themselves that are possibly the most poorly executed. Director John McTiernan had been most famous for making classics of the action genre in Predator (1987) and Die Hard (1988), which makes it so doubly surprising that his action scenes in Rollerball are so poor. The game of Rollerball itself should be pretty simple but in this movie it can barely be followed nor understood. For the remake the arena has pointlessly being changed into a figure of eight shaped track that looks less like a place of futuristic violent sports combat and more like the set from the 90's game-show Gladiators. The action is fast, furious, yet incomprehensible, edited together in ways that do not help us know what the hell is going on.The story-line underpinning events is broadly similar to the original but with poor performances and a weak script. You never get very involved with the plight of the characters and it's quite difficult believing that this is the number one sport in the world of the future. Unlike the original, the events only occur two or three years in the future, meaning that the dystopian sci-fi of the original is lost and we have a drearier contemporary world in which events unfold. Although it was quite an unusual idea setting the action in Kazakhstan of all places! To be fair to the film, it does move at a decent pace and is entertaining enough if you lower your expectations accordingly. If it wasn't a remake of a cult classic I daresay it would have passed under the radar as a ropey action movie but seeing as it is a new version of an old film and one with quite a considerable budget its flaws become all too apparent.</fullReview>

The characters barely developed during the whole film and you couldn't care if they got bludgeoned to death during the game anyway.Save your money or down a few pints instead !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jean Reno Deserves Better Than This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of Rollerball deserved all the bad reviews it received. Jean Reno who has saved worse movies than this, has his work cut out here.Plot In A Paragraph: In 2005 a character played by Chris Klein joins his best friend played by LL Cool J in playing the most popular sport in the world 'Rollerball' ran by a character played by Jean Reno, it can have some pretty dire consequences like horrific injury or death if it is thought it will boost the ratings. Some of it is so ludicrous I wondered if it was originally conceived as a spoof comedy of the original movie. My advice would be don't watch it give it a miss. Avoid it like the plague. Tell your friends to pass it by. The acting is bad, bad, bad (Chis Klein and L.L Cool J included)I would rather go see a firework display on a very rainy night, than watch this again. Jean Reno deserves much better than this. As for Klein I'm not sure his character is meant to be as funny as he seems. A generous and I mean generous 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll always remember the time I went to see this movie. I went with a couple of friends figuring to see a normal, popcorn movie. Boy was I wrong. What sticks out in my mind is that when we went in the theater there were about two people in the theater beside us. I just figured that people had seen it already. Ha ha ha. The movie starts out with a teenager doing some extreme street luge down the streets of LA. Because, of course, that is legal. He is approached by LLCool J to come into this new, cool, dangerous sport called Rollerball. Boiled down it is a hardcore rollerderby with a ball and a big dish. It is the most uninteresting "sport" you could think of. There he meets a woman and they fall in love. So, as his career flourishes, he dates her. As this goes on, the president of this sports league starts to bribe teams to get bloodier in their combat, being that there are no rules. Chris Penn sees this and, after fighting for their lives, he and a few people escape...and then the movie ends. There is no scheming of plotting, they just escape. There is no closure and it's not satisfying like in Pulp Fiction or something to that effect, it's just an end. Like they forgot to distribute the ending of the film. This movie is easily the worst I have ever seen. The plot is virtually non-existent, the acting is bad, and the directing...wait THERE IS NONE. Don't waste your time with this crap.

		<fullReview>I don't know whether Chris Klein can act or not, but he's not even trying here. He has absolutely no charisma or screen presence, and that's not a good thing considering he's the lead.The movie is centered around a game you basically know nothing about, therefore you can never really understand what's going on in the Rollerball arena. That's not a good thing, considering that the game takes up half of the movie.Rebecca Romijn looks like a vampire from some horror flick. That's not a good thing, considering she's beautiful and sexy without horrible wigs and scars.The movie lacks jokes or funny moments, which is not a good thing considering that the plot is boring and makes little to no sense.Okay, some of the 'gaming' scenes are rather fun to watch, but still confusing. And Rebecca Romijn is not that bad looking in it, either. But when a movie was voted for by 4000 people, and has no entries under "memorable quotes", well... It figures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. This film is so heavily edited, it's a marvel it manages to remain even the least bit cohesive. The writing and the cinematography are lazy. The movie's rife with massive plot holes and random confusing images. The characters mean nothing. In some instances, hilarious Hanna Barbera sound effects are used in lieu of foley. I'm serious. "They're gaining on us! Punch it!" Zoink! I was rolling in the aisles. Was the editor drunk? Maybe he was just a raving loon. The movie originally had much more cursing, not to mention boobs. But the studio wanted a PG-13. Unfortunately they had no money to reshoot, so they just dubbed over the curse words. It was like watching Die Hard on USA. "I don't give (AN EGGPLANT) what you think, (BASKET WEAVER)!" See this movie only if you are desperate for a laugh; and even then, rent the R rated version so at least you'll be treated to boobs.</fullReview>

This thing has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The only thing I can think of is that director John McTernian must have been very short of money when he made this monstrosity. Avoid at all possible costs. Lets just hope that the same thing does not happen in the upcoming Die Hard 5 movie. Although, judging by the slowly deteriorating level of plots in the Die Hard line I will not be holding my breath on this one either.</fullReview>

This is one of the biggest peices of trash ever. The real problem here is it looks as though there wasnt enough footage after filming to edit together a coherent story so they just used what they had.This is a movie where the actual players of rollerball in the movie admit they have no idea whats going on. The main character complains that one of his friends chin straps was cut, yet he never puts his strap on, ever. There is also a long boring sequence shot in night vision that looks so good I could have made it with a 10 year old camera, but if you like blury and hard to watch its all you.I give credit to LL Cool J and Kris Klien for trying to work with the material. The problem is there is nothing to work with. If you love rollerball watch the original. Hell I would even recommend some of those horrible Kevin Kostner epics over this. Really folks when it comes to Rollerball (2002) just say no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I've seen a remake this terrible. There have been quite a few bad ones (most of them infact) but this is by far the worst. They took the elements of the origional rollerball and rather then updating the special effects and cinematography and making the story more relevent to the world today (rather then the 70's) they choose to make it a showcase of everything that is bad with modern films.The changes in the story from the origional were terrible, especially replacing the end with this considerably more tacky one. The special effects were highly poor, and the cinematography was a joke with little of the action being able to be made out. The film became a band wagon for any "actor" that wanted to boost their waining career and there were far too many attepts at being "clever" and "arty" that simply back fired and made the production into more of a joke. The idea to shoot a scene in night vision was just painful, and the final action sequence was so terrible (including a scene where a small stool is used to block the blast from a shotgun and ultimately defeat the big baddie) you just keep hoping the film will end quicker. It is impossible to care what happens to any of the characters in the film because they are so shallow and lifeless and the plot itself in it's entire depth could be summed up on the back of a relatively small stamp.There is not much else that can be said, the user ratings speak for themselves and I'm not sure I've ever seen a film (with this many votes) with such a low weighted average rating. Really in most cases if someone says a film is bad and your tempted to watch it your best off making your own mind up, but with this, well, you can trust the (when I last checked) 1337 people that gave this film a "1" vote. It's also ranked, on last check, as IMDB's 39th worst movie of all time and only a handful of the films considered worse have more user votes then this (Battlefield Earth being the most notable, lol).So really, just don't bother. If you haven't seen the origional cult classic, watch that instead, because that is a good film and this really isn't. You can follow the action in that, the characters draw you in and the ending is great. This film is a pale shadow of the 70's classic. If you have seen the origional, then trust me when I say you'll be even more disapointed with this remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated actioner that's much better than Jewison's pretentious original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems John McTiernan's ROLLERBALL is already generally accepted as one of the all-time turkeys, but I'd recommend it as a fun action movie that's not remotely as bad as it's usually made out to be. In fact, it's very good, and much better than Norman Jewison's pretentious original, which seemed to think it was an art house movie disguised as a sci-fi thriller, but which had neither the necessary panache nor the necessary brains.The locations are fresh and atmospheric, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and LL Cool J look great and drip charisma, the cinematography (by Steve Mason) is first-rate, and McTiernan gives us his best action since the original DIE HARD, with a particularly stunning "night vision" chase across a desert involving trucks, bikes and a plane. The bonecrunching, bloody violence of the Rollerball games and the opening street luge race will also keep action fans on the edge of their seats. Pretty dumb, but never boring, ROLLERBALL is one of those movies where you should make up your own mind rather than let your thoughts be dictated to you by majority opinion - you might be pleasantly surprised. It's too bad that the film - which bears strong evidence of heavy pre-release cutting, with missing scenes as well as trimmed nudity and violence - is almost certain never to be released in its full-length version.Still, ROLLERBALL is a blast. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh this film ends up being a mess. I can see what the director was attempting to achieve and there's some merit in his attempt ? a remake of a very good 1975 film with updated politics. Unfortunately the updated politics are too shallow to take seriously.One central trouble is there's too much frenetically paced action and not enough time spent on explaining the story or the society in which Rollerball is set. The original Rollerball by comparison is a very intelligent piece of speculative fiction which films its ?Rollerball' sequences expertly and a lot more cohesively than the updated version. A specific annoyance for me was an extended scene shot at night which uses military night view technology. Suddenly the picture on my TV went monotone and grainy. I thought my trusty 1983 Sony was finally giving up the ghost. I smacked it's side repeatedly until I realised it wasn't my dear TV's fault, it was bloody Rollerballs!Towards the end, the film becomes disgustingly violent. I was going to give Rollerball 4/10 but the ridiculously overt violence makes me subtract a point.Despite my harsh words, I will say that I enjoyed Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (what a mouth full!) declading out of her robust costume to reveal two of the most formidable and juicy looking breasts I've ever seen. If only she had spent more screen time naked, I'd raise my score a couple of notches.3/10</fullReview>

Not to want to pick holes in this film *scoff* but the film is supposed to be based on an ultra violent cross of rollerblading and lacrosse, right? So where was all the violence and blood and gore, surely this film would have succeeded if Tarantino would have directed it. At least the premis of the film would not be misleading. OK, so there is some shooting and a few killings near the end, but really this film had so much more potential in it.Klein although good as the sensitive Keanu Reeves clone from American Pie does not suit this role well, but he is not the main reason for hating this film, (he doesn't really help save it either). His range is constantly stuck between brooding and setting up to brood. Not a good characteristic if you're supposed to be an intense rollerball athlete really. Someone with more intensity or charisma would probably have made this film entertaining at least.Poor L.L.Cool.J, I feel sorry for this guy, here is a man, who clearly wants to make the serious leap from rap star to movie star and you thought he actually had a chance after watching him in Deep Blue Sea, which has been very successful, and justly so, really good film that. But here's rollerball come to knock him back down, not good. Even though he tries to make the best out of a bad situation he is really given nothing to work with, playing second fiddle to Keanu, sorry Klien and not a good script.What would have been good in this movie would have been if they had made a huge elaborate set with hard gritty violence that climaxed in a huge match which people really cared about the outcome, oh well.</fullReview>

The first thing I couldn't stand was the fact that it took place in Eastern Europe. Just listening to all those bad accents makes the movie look like a cheap wannabe action flick. Plus, as every reviewer previous to me has pointer out, that STUPID night vision scene. Maybe would have been interesting for a minute, but not 15. I remember people walking out of the theatre at this point. After this disaster of a movie was over, everybody was saying to the people they came with "what the hell was that?". I admit that I will sit down and watch films others describe as camp or cheesy, but I think even if I was watching this on tape, I would have turned it off. There is something seriously flawed with this film. Many have pointed out that it is the editing and I am inclined to agree. So the bottom line is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

There was a vague lawlessness that I would have really enjoyed learning more about ... people "disappearing," the criminal economy, the lack of respect for human life on the part of the Reno character ... I wanted more details.Sure, Chris Klein was completely miscast, the dialog stunk and even the game itself was convoluted, but there was untapped potential in the story.As a wrestling fan, I got a kick out of seeing Paul Heyman as the American announcer.

		<fullReview>No wonder this movie was such a box office bomb. They have a clean cut, moma's boy, Chris Klein, playing a tough, hardknocking, supposedly best Rollerball player in Europe. The lead actor was so miscast. And that is only the beginning of what is wrong with this movie. The start of the movie with the luge scenes in the streets of San Fran were awful and so unbelievable. If anyone did that, they wouldn't be alive for very long. Plus, in the end, Jonathan's friend, LL Cool J(Marcus), just happens to show up to give him a ride. It was so stupid because Jonathan is supposed to be this good hockey player hoping to make it in the NHL, but is risking death or permanent injury by rolling on a board dodging traffic.Now, on to Europe. The game of Rollerball looked really boring to begin with. Then we have these actors with awful accents. And a lot of it was just stupid. Like Marcus apparently gets killed, but there is no conclusion to that chase scene. I guess Jonathan just gave up. We just don't know. And the ending was just silly. The players rebel and Jonathan actually kills the owners and stuff. I mean, afterwards he would be looking at life imprisionment in jail. He was certainly no hero or anyone the audience could like. And that is one of the big problems with this movie in the first place.FINAL VERDICT: Weak acting, weak story, weak lead actor. Overall a very bad movie, so please don't watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, so this movie is terrible. There is no doubt of that. However, there is one scene worth mentioning. The action/chase scene towards the end of the movie that was filmed totally with night vision - now that was cool.It would have been your standard chase scene in almost every action movie, however it was fresh and new in that it was done with the night vision. It actually grabbed your attention and held it through the whole portrayal of the chase - and in fact it even built some tension because it helped give the eerie almost unnerving feeling of racing in the dark.So 99% of the population should avoid this movie at all costs, but if you're an action film junkie, it's worth one measely pass to check out how that sequence was done, IMO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The TagLine for "RollerBall" is "Get in the Game". All during this movie, I just wanted out. There are severaly apparent flaws with this film, all of which will be discussed further on.ROLLERBALL, the sport of the near future. It takes place in a ring that looks like a giant 8, with two sky tracks on them. One team must maintian possesion of the Rollerball for two trips around the track before jumping off of a ramp in the middle of the Arena, and throwing the ball into a big golden bowl "score".The Arena in a big bowl in figure eight fashion, as told above. The offense on a team are mounted on RollerBlades, while the Team defense has motorcycles. They zoom around the arena, knocking each other out and scoring for a specified period of time. The team with the most points wins.This sounds cool, right? Well, it is infinitley cooler in writing then it is on the big screen.Chris Klien plays the role of Jonathon Cross, a rookie at the sport that the masses just love to shower with affection. I don't see why, but they do. He comes from AMERICA and to the Russians he plays for, he seems to be a miracle boy.Jonathon Cross is supposed to be the hero, but to me, he just comes off as a big slow guy. There was no reason for me to like him, except that I am told he is good at the sport, and that I should love him.LL Cool J plays Marcus Ridley, the man who gets Klien into the sport. LL goes through the role with typical LL ease that we seem to love ans respect.Jean Reno plays Petrovich, which is not at all a stereotypical russian name. He owns the sport, or the team, or some part of the sport/team. He is just there, and I never really felt anything twords him.The rest of the cast is just there, and we seem to care very little about them. They are just there to make Cross and Ridle look good.The acting is subpar, with the exception of LL. No one seems to care about what they are doing, and it shows. Reno could have made a better movie in his sleep. He was my favorite part of Godzilla! But he just couldn't do the same for this movie.The story is weak, at best. It is all anti-establishment, media is the devil bull-hockey. Without giving too much away, all I can say is the people like the sport, the people like the hero, and I hate the movie.The directing style also irked me to no end. It was all close ups, and shakey camera. It made the sport very hard to follow, and gave me a headache. One scene was filmed entirely in Night-Vision... Very poorley.This movie tries to preach that the media is bad, and that random violence is worse. All the media cares about is the ratings. This has to be one of the most hypocrtical morals I have ever heard.A movie trying to preach against the evils of the media, and the evils of sensless violence... I can see at what they are getting at, and it seems to me that they tried to add the moral for a good reason. They tried. I can tell, but... The movie starts with senseless violence, ends with MAJOR SENSELESS VIOLENCE, and I am pretty sure there is sensless violence in the middle, too.There were some parts I did enjoy. No wait... I really didn't enjoy this mush at all...All in all, I give RollerBall a heartfelt*1/2 out of *****.Because they tried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever? Possibly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the worst update/adaption of a classic movie ever. I cannot recommend that you avoid this movie strongly enough, especially if you liked the original. Not even the extreme sports buffs could get anything out of this terrible film. It epitomizes everything that is wrong with most action movies coming out of Hollywood today. Comically bad storyline, terrible dialogue (which, for the most part, is completely drowned out by the nu-metal soundtrack), and the most bizarre and overlong night-vision sequence ever, all combine to make this the worst movie I have rented in years. In fact, it was returned to my local video library containing a single post-it-note, compiled and agreed upon by the four that watched it - "Worst movie ever!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of days ago i dropped by the video store and came across to the remake of the 1975 Rollerball. Havin watched and quite liked the original one I did a dear mistake and checked out the cover of this remake. The director and the cast seemed ok and the music was from Eric Serra so I willingly rented it. I didnt expect a master piece as I hadnt rated the original so highly anyway but this one sucked beyond imagination. I can not even call this one as a movie since throughout the whole running time it seemed more like a prolonged trailer to me. I wont talk more about how bad this thing is as other ýmbd users had covered it all. But i have to admit i quiet liked the night-vision style shoot and the band that played during the competiton (or whatever it can be named as) Some may have said that "it is so bad that it is actually good" my answer to such comments: "NO, it so bad that it is just plain bad" Stay way in all circumstances unless u dont mind throwin r 1.5 hours to garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original, but rest assured I can agree it is better than this. First of all, Chris Klein is not an action star, nor will he ever be. He is not a physical character, capable of playing an athlete or extreme sports enthusiast. He should stick to movies like American Pie.Second, what is going on? I have enough trouble figuring out what is happening half the time. The green stuff? That must have been the dust. Needless to say the only enjoyable part was Jean Reno. While incapable of playing a weak character, this was just not his movie.In terms of the actual sport, how could that be pleasant? The arena's about the size of a skate park, and not much room to move either. I would not be one to play in that space. So, in summary, don't waste your money. Watch it for free on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rollerball had it all. An all-star cast consisting of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, that guy from American Pie, and Ladies Love Cool James. The director's vision was most definitely realized in full. The strong character development and excellent plot will pull the viewer into a world they never wanted to enter... and will never want to enter ever again. This movie is action meets art.The plot would shift every time the viewer thought they had finally figured it out. There were more twists than a broken slinky, and that was only during the first 20 minutes. The movie would introduce a new character, only to kill them off several minutes later. If you listen hard enough during quieter parts of the movie, you can hear the last breaths of many of the careers of the actors in this movie. Rollerball and its stars should have been nominated for academy awards, though they should not have won any.The blisteringly average editing and the chase scene filmed in night vision (for no apparent reason) made this movie blindingly spectacular.(Read: This movie made you want to tear your eyes from your head.) Rollerball was not a complete failure, however. It succeeded at being terrible.I wonder what Hollywood was thinking when they created this movie. I wonder if the script actually read well and it was the actors and the editors and the directors that made the movie dismal. I would have to ask just one question. Why? I would ask that question to everyone who worked on the movie and I would bet that my response would be something to the tune of "Why not?" If this is a movie that did well in the theaters, then America will watch anything and I am sad for being a part of it.</fullReview>

RIGHT.... totally believable. On top of this there are parts when they would be talking and the actors face would move instantly across the screen. Baaaaad editing. the music sucks, the visuals are terrible, and there is no real explanation of why they do things. they just do it.

A brutal sport where one person on a team must capture a metal ball and throw it in a goal. All on skates. Three of the players must fight back against a tyrant who is willing to kill for his sport.You know what I think is funny? Well, it's how 2005 is only in two years, yet everything must fit into place in those years. But this is a fictional movie so let's just forget that.The movie doesn't have the fun as the first did.

And this is possibly the only movie I've ever seen where I actually heard comments on how bad the editing was, during the movie. `Oh that was bad.' `Who edited this?' `Can you believe how jumpy that was?' On the positive side: The movie did point out that the driving force for almost everyone involved with the `game' was the love of money. That was a believable motive for most of the characters. Also not take place in the US or Canada, made a little easier to swallow the idea of how popular this game was suppose to be. The actual game: Think WWF meets hockey with a motorcycle and roller blades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just one guy's opinion, but this is not a good movie. Two noteworthy elements of badness: first, the insistent jump cut/slow-mo cinematics, the likes of which could make even Oliver Stone nauseous; and lets not forget the excruciating "getaway" sequence, shot through some fuzzy night vision filter that leaves us expecting a pan to Geraldo Rivera reporting live via satellite from war-torn Baghdad. On the whole a visual nightmare. A far cry from the McTiernan of the late '80s who we came to trust for a decent action flick. But, no point in drudging up the past or the plot for that matter...was there one? Still, in all fairness a solid believable story is not what we want from a movie like this, but at least give us something coherent. This plot, with all its vague allusions and exhaustively cryptic reaction shots, provides an experience not unlike hearing an inside joke not intended for you. Which leads me to ask, was this movie intended for anyone? Well, you be the judge, but something in my gut tells me that somewhere some filmmakers are enjoying a hardy chuckle my expense; in which case, good...at least this movie has given someone some pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are quite a few obvious problems with this film. The film lacks the energy/drive it requires to pull off such an supposed intense thriller. You find yourself being dragged unwillingly through the different scenes instead of catapulted. A change in cast could possibly have fixed this if it were not for the poor direction. The cast look confused as to where their coming from, rightfully so as we are never really told as the audience either. The editing style doesn't suit the film. The uneven cuts are (I assume) meant to add an element of speed/intensity, instead they just look like dodgy editing. And finally the set is so monotone that you would be forgiven for thinking that "play school" would have been a better location. All in all this film seems to be a waste of money/film and talent.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, none of that potential has been fulfilled.What you have here is a rapid-cut, vapid, characterless and mostly humourless blur of a film. There are a couple of good ideas (the whole Russian setting being the main one) but this is one of the biggest nothing movies I've seen - and I've seen a lot!

I've witnessed such titles as Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Killjoy 1 AND 2, House on Haunted Hill and Thir13en Ghosts (modern versions) just to name a few. But this, a film that seems to have everything going for it, takes the cake. It's not the pointless nudity, the unbelievably awful script, or even the 20 minute scene that is in night vision for some reason that makes this #1 on my all-time worst movies list. It's the last scene, a scene so brutally and disturbingly violent that it rivals "Taxi Driver" (it hurts me to say that, because this film should not even be in the same room with "Taxi Driver"), that really puts it over the edge. Why did the filmmakers (especially the formerly reliable John McTiernan) think that this would work as the climax to the film? In the end, this film's message seems to be: if someone is getting you down, brutally murder them in cold blood. Don't even get me started on the part where Chris Klein (who is slowly starting to suck) blocks a shotgun blast with a stool and doesn't even flinch from the impact.Final Grade: 0 out 10</fullReview>

Between the bouncing camera, the incomprehensible game, formula action scenes, lack of plot, lack of character development (who cared about the "zero" annonymous atheletes?), lack of drama in conflict moments, much too brief and rushed climb to the "climax", its hard to say in mere English just how bad this disjointed stinker really is! Absolute trash! Ten thumbs down! What could have been "cat and mouse" between good and evil, greed and honour, was a hurried rush to meaningless violence from terrible camera angles and even worse dialogue. Only a forest could be more wooden...and more exciting to watch. A meaningless indulgence in gyro-cams. Awful! P. Scanlon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be THE worst movie EVER. Right now i feel speechless after viewing 90 minutes of rollerball. It had terrible acting, no plot, no common sense, excessive violence, and a story line that im still trying to figure out. Everything about the movie was done wrong. The sound was terrible, the lighting was terrible, the game was terrible. And what was the point of all that fighting at the end? It just was dumb. Well, at least the ending was parallel to the rest of the movie. Just plain DUMB.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS EVERYWHERE (Like anyone will watch this movie anyway, after reading this review)You know you are in for a treat when the movie opens with Chris Klein and some guy racing down a hill while lying on skateboards for a bet. When the other guy flies through a glass window (the only good effect in the whole movie) and the cops arrive, Klein gets picked up at the bottom of the hill by LL Cool J and suddenly forgets that he is owed money from the guy that went through the window. Klein then turns down an offer to be in Rollerball and then the movie throws the viewer 5 months ahead to Klein being the best player ever.Why go into that much detail for this review? The answer to this question and the reason this movie fails miserably is all in the opening. Everything is rushed throughout the movie. It's like a race down the hill is not good enough, let's add skateboards, gambling, cheating, a wreck, cops, 30 people rooting them on the street, and introduce LL and Rollerball, all in the first five minutes.The pacing is all wrong. They break your neck in the first five minutes, while none of it makes any sense, and then you are supposed to care about a game that they don't even bother to explain because it's "too complicated." Action, action, action, sex, action, action, action, action, it's like if you keep the camera on something moving maybe someone will care. Unfortunately, there is no way to even care at all, because no one in this film is likeable.This is just garbage. The acting is as bad as anything a major studio has released in the last 20 years. Klein is miscast (duh?), and the rest are either wasted (LL), misused (Reno) or should not be in any film (everyone else).The actors aren't the only ones to blame. It's hard to act when the dialogue is just grunting and occasional sentences that don't explain anything.The basic direction of the film has to be questioned. Anyone who would shoot, and leave in, 10 minutes of "night-vision" film in all of it's multiple green-colored luster, should be blamed. That was quite possibly the worst shot sequence I have seen in a movie, and it was allowed 10 minutes of time? How is that possible? I have so many more questions that I would love to ask the director: How in the world is everything else in the movie so bright, yet the shots with night-vision so green and the shots of Ms. Stamos in the locker room so dark? I saw the "R-rated" version and I thought I was watching a "PG" film, because all of the violence and nudity were kept to brief flashes, but wasn't that the draw of this film? Where is the extreme violence, because it didn't look that bad to me? How hard is it to complete a simple shot without chopping it? I mean simple panning shots were chopped several times and I don't know why? Was it to cut down on time? Where'd the plot go? Did it get cut for time, too? Was it fun making the worst movie ever made? Why did this feel like a movie version of the XFL?Obviously, this movie is horrible. Whether you are fan of any of the people involved, or not, don't bother wasting your time watching this junk. In my opinion, John McTiernan has now made the best (Die Hard) and worst (THIS) movies ever created. Everyone involved should be ashamed. What a terrible waste of time and money! They should had shelved this movie forever and everyone should had made sure Rollerball never saw the light of day.</fullReview>

While I don't think this was any kind cinematic art piece and the story was all over the place and the acting was below par, I don't think this was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some stinkers. I give this movie credit for not pretending to be anything more than what it was. About the only similarity to the original is the title and the sport. Once you get over that, it is what it is. It certainly wasn't worse that the Running Man fiasco a few years back (1987). That garnered 6.2 stars. Geez lighten up. My thoughts. Yours?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 70s, James Caan starred in the original version of this movie. That movie packed a punch with action and commentary about the social aspects of the action/violence as to how it affected society. Chris Klein (American Pie series) stars in this remake and to paraphrase..."Chrs Klein, you are no James Caan!" Klein is a out of work hockey player recruited into the newest sports attraction by his long time buddy, played by LL Cool J. The sport is played in the former soviet countries and is becoming a major force on television. Klein discovers that the owners are creating accidents on the field specifically to pump the ratings and tries to get out of the game. Unfortunately for Klein he is discovered and the owners begin an attempt to take out the biggest star in the game for the big ratings pay day. This movie, to put it bluntly, blew chucks. On the whole the acting was atrocious but that could be blamed to the incredibly poor writing of the story. The took a movie which was multi-layered and slammed it down into a MTV-like video and destroyed it. John McTiernan, the director, has down some incredible movies (Die Hard) but here all he should be doing is apologizing for the trash that he made of this movie. The only two performances that were at all decent in this movie came from Shane McMahon (yes the son of the WWE owner) who played an American Media Mogul who didn't say anything and from Paul Heyman (yes the guy who appears on WWE shows as either a manager or commentator) who acted as a play-by-play announcer. Granted he has had a lot of experience doing that before but he actually did some good here. Outside of those two I can think of nothing good to say about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, this movie sucks. Although I have never seen the original, I have unfortunately seen this... I'll just keep my words brief...Acting - Absolutely abysmal... so bad that I think Shane McMahon's two second cameo and Paul Heyman's announcing gig are pretty much the best acting in this movie. (And apparently, so did a lot of other people - as certain reviews have made mention of Heyman's exciting performance as a Rollerball announcer.) When two then-sports entertainers show more impressive acting ability than the actual Hollywood actors cast in the picture, you've got problems.Plot - Lacking. It's an EXTREME sports movie... which already disinterests me from the get-go. And yet as I watch it, I can somehow feel my soul wither away as I attempt to follow the excruciatingly awful storyline. Terrible.Visuals - Holy crap on a stick, this movie looks appalling. Absolutely terrible. There's nothing visually appealing here - even the token post- apocalyptic features have some reasonable visuals. This is just really ugly. An eyesore to say the least... especially in regards to those HORRENDOUS night vision sequences.Sound - My ears bleed listening to this noise. It's just awful.Direction - Lacking. Just... no.Editing - Bad. More emphasis is spent on close-ups and horrible acting than on the sport itself. In fact, the pacing is so bad that I often lose track of what's going on, but I'm too scared to go back and rewatch because that means subjecting myself to this horrible mess.Overall - Pure crap movie. Just pathetic.You want a better quality movie? Go watch Battlefield Earth... sure, it's bad too, but it's better than this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Write them (director, producer, etc) down, and don't ever ever ever see anything remotely associated with them, unto the fourth generation. I admit, I am a long time Rollerball fan, and I had read somewhere that such people might appreciate this. WRONG. I probably would have rented it even if I had read the comments here first, but at least I would have expected (expectorated) excrement. This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. It wasn't truly sick, and the idea of the whole thing taking place in the "'Stans" (as in As;ugousdrhstan) was kind of cool. I thought maybe it was a prequel, until they started with the Jon A Ton chant (four months into it and he's the greatest player ever.) When he throws his hat to the crowd, I knew for sure it was just a pathetic remake. And while James Caan went with his helmet unbuckeled for much of the movie, he was too cool to touch. Our (hero?) must glue his helmet (or maybe nails it on) to his head, because he keeps it on until the near end. I have a generally low taste threshold in movies. I like a good flic, but I can tolerate nearly anything and find some enjoyment. The only redeeming social value I can place on this is to see the original with all its textures and the Albionini music, and then see this to compare just how bad and wrong a remake can possibly be. I thought "The Last Castle" was pitiful as a remake of "The Hill," but it had enjoyment value. This has nothing. Nothing. Not even half way decent gratuitous violence. Nothing. Pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original had something to say, even if sophomoric (with a big point being that in the future, governments will become irrelevant, yielding their purpose to private corporations). But this??Just rented it. Really bad. Much of it makes no sense whatsoever, in that there is no motivation for, or reason behind, much of what happens during the story. The "owner" who has much, much financial incentive to keep this game going turns unexpicably maniacal in the climactic scene. He didn't get to be who he was by being that nuts, such that he gloats over the killing of the goose (the game) who would otherwise be dropping golden eggs for him. Small things: two people, travelling together from point A to point B. How do they get there? one drives a car, the other a motorcycle. Why did they not go together in one vehicle? So the car can be torched by an angry mob at point B. So they brought the motorcycle to get back to point A, I guess. Other small thing: High Greek Orthodox priest happily arrives in what is WWF type entertainment, and acts pleased to be in owner's box? Why? So he could walk out in disgust as things fall apart, to show us that what the owner staged is a bad thing.Film assumes audience is very, very dumb.Just looked at grosses. The original (made 25 years before the remake) outgrossed the remake, with 1975 dollars. I guess the audiences weren't so dumb to attend this bad film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. I've seen bad movies before (Feeders, Castle Freak, Jurassic Park 2), and rented Rollerball because I heard it was bad. But hey, it might be bad-fun, right? As in at least funny and easy to mock, right?Oh no. Oh no no no. Rollerball is an entirely different breed of film altogether. While it at least has some good lighting, and a soundtrack not ripped right out of another film, every single other aspect of this 'movie' (cause it has moving frames of still pictures running together to create a flow) is like a car accident. Some people turn away in disgust and shock, some look, then turn away, and some can't turn away because of the sheer appalling nature of what they see. That's Rollerball -- a cinematic 15 car pileup.Where to start? How about the 15 (or 30...It felt soooooo long) min stretch of film done in Night Vision? Who has the night vision? The director? God? Who is using the night vision to relay the scene we're watching? Normally, a director uses altered modes of filming to depict altered states of mind of characters, or monsters (Alien 3 fish-eye lens), etc. Here, it's just a scene done in night vision. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, like the characters were being watched by a helicopter, but that hope, that fiendish desire, faded after the night vision just stayed on the screen...WHY????!!!!!!Oh what else? What next...okay, how about the premise of the movie. Violence is bad, especially in sports...but wait...people watch NASCAR for car crashes (some of them) and hockey for fights...and I love football, partly because it's a violent sport...and isn't the whole point of Rollerball (not having seen the original) that the sport distinguishes itself from others through violence? Rollerball in the movie isn't nearly as violent as a cricket match until the incomprehensible last 15 min...so is McTiernan trying to seem 'smart' by showing that people like violence in sports and that's bad? Is Rollerball an art form, being corrupted by the violence of filthy eurotrash capitalists (sorry Jean Reno, but this was not your finest hour)?To be fair, I was drinking Maker's Mark during the movie, thinking it might help...and it kind of did. I at least began to overlook Chris 'Little Keanu' Klein's 'acting', but couldn't handle the 'editing', which seemed to have cut the original shoot of the movie apart, threw the shreds in the air, and then glued them together as they picked them up. And the plot also got easier to handle...after the insipid opening where Klein goes from homeless to superstar in one fade cut...WOW! I wanna try...I'm typing right now...gentle fade to black...fade in, and I'm Sultan of my own province in Asia! Hey!This whole pile of crap smacks of having been birthed in a corporate startegy meeting at MGM, where McTiernan was just sitting, listening to 'Think-tank' solutions for MGM's flagging profits: 'Hey,' says one thirty-ish blonde executive, 'the kids LOVE night-vision nowadays...(snaps fingers)How about a whole scene in Night-Vision!' 'Sure!' says McTiernan, desperate for a hit. 'How about we also get those bands the kids love nowadays...you know, that Pink girl, oh and Slipknot!!! The kids love Slipknot!!' 'And we'll film it like an hour and a half music video,' says another short-haired exec. 'You know, with the 'jump-cuts' (doing the whole quote-finger manuever) and all! So the kids will love it! And it'll save out on costs typing the screenplay and editing, cause the kids don't like those anyways!' (execs give each other high fives, McTiernan scuttles away to start shooting)I digress. Don't watch this 'movie'. Even if you like bad movies, you won't be entertained. Don't watch it if you like pain -- you're better off cutting yourself with a razorblade. Don't watch it if you want a trippy, incomprehensible series of images and sounds that leave you with a headache -- drink the 'milkoline' I suggested at the top here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie. I had read some comments on this site, ad I had been warned. But I confess: I love violent movies. Some people may think that that makes me a nutcase, but as much as I hate real life violence, I like movie violence. Well... I expected a violent movie... I expected the Rollerball-game to be cruel and ultraviolent. And it is violent at times, but it is also a sissy-game of jumping and posing. And the game is not the main plot of the movie... Everybody who saw Salute to a Jugger/Blood of Heroes knows what a violent futuristic game looks like... This is not it!Okay, so I was disappointed about the violence which mainly takes part in the last 15 minutes, but also the story is going nowhere. Several times I caught myself thinking what dinner I should eat tonight, and if I should go shopping.... That means the movie stinks! The camera, the editing, everything is so bad. Nothing saves this movie. Unless you have been very bad and want to torture yourself, do not watch.P.S. Since the movie has some violent action scenes, I give it a 4/10, but if you are not a gorehound, the score will be less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John McTiernan has directed many good films such as The Thomas Crown Affair, The Hunt for Red October, and Die Hard. From the quality of these films, you would think he would make only good quality movies. I can assure you that Rollerball is not good, not quality, and not worth seeing. From the opening scene of the movie to the last scene, the movie is just stupid violence and action that shouldn't even be called action. It makes a laughing stock of the original '70's film. The acting is no better than a high school play, the plot is unconvincing, and the whole story is just stupid.

Dont let somebody else ruin what could be a good experience for you. "How so true. They are opinions. I love imdb.com for this. I can listen to normal people make decent reviews. It's a good debate. I don't have a problem with Roger Ebert. Sure he's a critic. I usually agree with him when he gives em thumbs up. But not thumbs down. Leonard Malten (sp??) I do happen to have a problem with. He's rather stuck up in my opinion. But indeed. I can't get angry with people I disagree with. I'm still reeling from the cancelation of Politically Incorrect. I was usually in disagreement with Bill, but he created a great debate.So onto this movie. I didn't think a movie could be this bad considering it's a remake. Oh but it isn't. It ripped the name off. The Get Carter movies are more comparable than this. Let's get started: 1. The ring is too small. 2. oops it wasn't a ring. 3. there is no direction in this movie. 4. Jean Reno made a fool of himself in the movie. 5. Topless women doesn't prove anything. 6. this was no vision. 7. the rules are confusing. 8. hell the movie is confusing. 9. Where's my mommy? 10. there's not a single character that was in the original. Jonathon E. Became Jonathon Cross. 11. The gloves aren't deadly. 12. There's no character development. and finally 13. The story has nothing to do with the game. o_O With the original... it was the future. 2018. The lead star Johnny E was in the game for what? 10 years. This Cross idiot was here for 4 months. That and it's 2005. Indiana Jones 4 will be out by then. The original movie has great design. Was more arena like. And didn't look like WWE style. The original had to do with a corporate world with no wars. People couldn't remember the past. They had no books.This movie is about what happens with that very corporate world gets there hands on creating another Rollerball. And utterly destroys the very meaning of the first movie.

After that it's going downhill and it's going downhill fast!The biggest problem with this movie is that the director wants you to believe Rollerball is real, but the way this concept is presented to the viewer is so poor and downright amateurish, that it rather made me laugh than feeling any compassion for the characters. Let alone the plot, which seems to be a collection of random 'cool' situations added together, what a stinker!I hate it not to watch to the end of a movie, but Rollerball gave me itchy fingers. I did watch it to the end and I shouldn't have...and neither should you, I think.If you want to see a "TV-Show to the death" movie, try Running Man instead, it's really a lot better than this one!1 out of 10, exit stage left!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad acting, bad scripting and bad direction comprises most of Rollerball a remake of the 70's hit by the same name. First of all Chris Klien can not act at all. He is worse than Keanu Reeves. The movie revolves around a pointlessly confusing sport called rollerball, a violent game that mixes hockey with lacrosse. Klien is the star player of the game but he finds that things begin to smell funny and starts to uncover a conspiracy (think Running Man meets Snake Eyes). This movie tryes to be a ultra cool, sleek romp that should be lots of fun and highly entertaining. But what it turns out to be is a huge confusing mess that is suprisingly violent and with a suprsingly high amount of nudity. I don't know what John McTiernan was thinking when he through in an escape scene that was comptly shot in night vision green. Not only is this effect to stupid for words it doesn't work with the film at all. Steer way clear of this stinker if you what an entertaining good time pick up the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uncohesive piece of drudgery...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere deep inside John McTiernan's ?supposed' action fest is a tepid social commentary on the direction in which the line between sports and entertainment are intersecting. Rollerball is at best a hybrid of social commentary sprinkled with some of the worst acting, scripting, directing seen on the silver screen in a long time. Director John McTiernan has been in a slump over the past decade with the engineering of many mediocre films. Starting with Last Action Hero back in 1993, excluding Die Hard: With a Vengeance, and The Thomas Crown Affair (which really wasn't McTiernan's forte) this Director has not been consistent with his filmmaking. Therefore, skepticism was high upon screening this film. I have always admired this Director for his previous efforts and he always seems to hatch something new, yet in this film, it sinks to a new low. The film commences with its' hard rock and fervent editing in hopes of imparting upon the audience the dizzying effect this film wants to emit. Unfortunately, its' grand production values and mock storytelling cannot hide the fact that this is a poorly made film. Chris Klein stars as a young athlete unable to make a name for himself in North America Professional Sport. On a suggestion from his best friend Marcus (LL Cool J), he joins an overseas Sports Entertainment Empire called Rollerball. This mix of fast paced drudgery and furious speed leads to serious ramifications which question the integrity of the sport. Jean Reno plays Petrovich, an entrepreneur who decides to sell the sport as the most violent and fast piece of entertainment in order to land a contract with the North American market. Operating in remote and hostile countries in the Middle East, Petrovich wants to take the sport International and slowly escalates the game's danger in hopes of attracting ratings. Jean Reno does his worst to bring no class and no charisma to this awkward character while Chris Klein is just deplorable as even his beard seems painted on for how young he is to play the lead in this kind of film. McTiernan does his best to capture the ferocity of such a sport but fails horrible in what is the most taxing 90 minutes for a film. I can respect the fact that the film is not as visually a debacle as it could have been, nor is it as bad as I thought it would be ?but it still is a bad film. One can simply take a look at any 10 minutes of the film and derive their own assumptions about the film; the elements that make a film a film are lacking in this piece. The only noteworthy and experimental aspect would be a scene of several minutes duration in which McTiernan lenses the scene with a NightVision Lens (Those green, grainy images) in order to evoke a feeling of compete and utter darkness. But that soon gives way to a mockery of a scene as all reality and excitement is washed away with some of the worst filmmaking in a long time. Giancarlo's rating: * 1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched both the 1975 and the 2002 remake versions of "Rollerball", a story set in a future where the number one form of entertainment is a barbaric sport in which the players roller blade or motorbike around a small court and chase after a silver ball and put it inside a goal. In both versions, the star player of Rollerball is a character named Jonathan (Chris Klein here, James Caan in the original) who after a series of near-death accidents occurs, decides to revolt against the bloodthirsty and corrupt business officials who may have something to do with the accidents. It's obvious why the release date for this film was pushed back so many times. The reason is because people just didn't like it. For me, this is one of the first cases where I actually prefer the original to a remake. One thing I really like about the original is that even though there is very little action, it still had a running theme throughout the movie. "Rollerball" is supposed to be talking about the corruption of human beings by an oppressive government. That message is lost here in the remake largely because of mindless dialogue between the characters and pointless action sequences outside of the sport. The remake is slow, loud, and kind of boring (though not on the sleep level of boring). Of course, John McTiernan, who directed "Die Hard", directs this movie. So you know that at least the action sequences will be good. This film bares almost no resemblance to the original except for the names of the movie and the lead character. In both versions, we see a total of three games, so it's best to assume that there's only three games in a season. Also in both versions, the producers change the rules so that in the final game there are no penalties or fouls to be called, which leads to the total annihilation of the players of both teams. Predictably, by the time the bloodshed of the final game is over, only the lead character is left standing to make the winning shot and then leads the revolt against the evil controllers of the sport.P.S.: The only really good thing about this movie is the performance by heavy metal band Slipknot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is the first disaster of 2002.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball is one long smorgasbord of smash-ups, crashes and body blows. It's a big mess of a movie that fails to establish strong characters or to set up a logical design of the dangerous sport the characters participate in. The guilty party for this disaster is director John McTiernan, who previously has been reliable with such strong and intelligent action-adventure movies like Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October and The Thomas Crown Affair. What was he thinking?For those unfamiliar with the 1975 version of Rollerball with James Caan, this film will be especially difficult to follow. Watching the original film before seeing this remake is essential because the old version plays like Cliff Notes in order to follow the action. The original movie wasn't a great film but at least it established interesting ideas about corporation rule in a futuristic society which operated in totalitarian rule under CEO's. This film attempts to satirize the extent producers will go for television ratings. In the original film, the game of rollerball was a fusion of hockey, football and motocross with gladiator brutality. This time the game is interrupted by constant cutting with complete absence of clarity and the arena is so small that it's claustrophobic mayhem instead of having a big arena with competitive design like in Norman Jewison's original film.What's worse is that the casting is all wrong. Chris Klein is too baby-faced and non-threatening to play Jonathan Cross, the athlete that becomes a hero for the masses while challenging the integrity of the game. LL Cool J is his teammate Marcus Ridley that wants to help Cross get out of the game once it starts getting deadly in the arena. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos plays the love interest to Jonathan and scarred teammate in this unisex sport. Jean Reno plays the evil executive owner of this dangerous sport league, doing little but snicker from his owner's box seat or shouting incomprehensibly at his lackies.The history behind this troubled production is revealing. Director John McTiernan in the spring of 2001 invited online critic Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News to take a look at an early screening. Despite being an admirer of the modern action film, he simply stated it sucked and bad buzz leaked everywhere. The film was pushed from an August release so the filmmakers could work on its problems. The studio was concerned with its length of two hours and about the incoherence of the action. McTiernan returned behind the camera in the fall to shoot additional scenes for two weeks. What is evident is that additional photography could not clear anything up, not with the mess of earlier footage that could be assimilated in the editing. The running time was cut, and with a reported $60 million running tag, the film's blood and gore was cut to insure a PG-13 rating. Luring young teenagers into this fiasco was the studio's only chance to make their money back. The final edit remains a muddled, and discreetly tame, work of shame.There is constant noise on the soundtrack, the pacing is as reckless and frenetic as a bad video game and with constant attention to overlong action scenes, this lends to little character development. The game itself is so burdened by the suffocated design of the arena, so incoherent and undefined in athletic contest that it would more logically crumble faster than the XFL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it because I remember the original (from seeing it years ago) wasn't perfect and I thought, maybe a few things were fixed. Well, besides a motorcycle and a ball and the name there wasn't much else here that reminded me of the original. I never could figure out what they were trying to do with the plot. They took away the whole thing and set it in Russia and well. There was no plot. Some things just got lost, but then that was OK, since we just fast forwarded through much anyway. The REALLY BAD editing hurt my eyes. I mean, I mean, no self respecting editor could watch it. No self respecting 6th grader editing home movies on a VCR could watch it! I mean it was really bad. It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, as I managed to actually finish it (with serious fast forward action) but it was close to the worst movie I have ever seen. I had to comment just to help some other poor soul avoid seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with, I never had high expectations for "Rollerball". It was supposed to be released what seems like years ago, and kept getting pushed back. That being said, one would think that meant they were making it better. Thank God they didn't "fix" it any more than they did. Other than the great Jean Reno, (whom I now pity for being in this movie) I was left wondering where the hell the actors and actresses were. I couldn't find any. Did anyone else? The editing was terrible and the "Blair Witch" cameraman did a better job showing us what was going on. The supposed "action" scenes were extremely tough to follow and frustrating. Four minutes of night vision didn't help either. The cartoony BOING! of going through a fence got me laughing, as did the supposed speed of 120 MPH as we see the road passing underneath them at about 30. And how about that fight at the end? Wow... that was about as exciting as watching grass grow. When it was all over, I was amazed that it was only an hour and a half long. The ever so slight glimmer of hope of Slipknot's performance was quickly dashed by more bad acting and editing. I'm tempted to take the DVD back to the rental store and demand a refund. If nothing else, tell them to pull the copies of this abomination from their shelves to save business. giving myself a root canal while being held over hot coals with gremlins twisting corkscrews into my feet would have been more entertaining. Do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague. You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I say anything, let me dispel the myth that the R-rated version of this film made some valid artistic statement and was gutted by the studio and MPAA to achieve the coveted PG-13. Having just viewed the R-rated DVD I can honestly say there is no aspect of this film that is not stunningly bad.McTiernan seems to be attempting some sort of convoluted style that actively gets in the way of storytelling. Don't get me wrong here - there really isn't a story to get in the way of (Rollerball being the worst excuse of a film to merely be a few big action sequences spliced together since Mission Impossible). The camera work and editing are the worst elements of the film. The cameras in the rollerball arena are very static and never really draw the viewer into the action. Every dialog scene has some distracting jump cut within it. It's highly distracting and does more to bring the viewer out of the film rather than draw him in. McTiernan also uses footage of semi-dressed athletes that looks like stock footage from deodorant commercials to transition between scenes. Very few elements of the film don't beg the question "what were they thinking?" Perhaps the greatest beggar of them all is the scene presented entirely with a green night-vision effect. The effect isn't used because the scene is from the perspective of a character wearing night-vision goggles. It really just brings up more questions for which there are no answers. Am I in the scene? Did I just put on night-vision goggles? Why wasn't I wearing sunglasses during the opening sequence? Or a helmet? If the film hadn't been so bad up until this point, I would have checked the settings on my television to see what had gone wrong. All that had gone wrong was that I had rented this terrible movie.Even the stars have nothing good to say about the film. The audio commentary on the DVD provided by Chris Klein, LL Cool J and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is frequently silent. I'm sure they're invoking the "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all" rule from childhood. The only time they can muster much excitement is in regard to driving the Shelby Cobra and other vehicles used in the film.The film purports to be a cautionary tale about violent entertainment and the greedy global corporations who put their profit ahead of their employee's well being, but the extremely violent ending of this film released by multinational MGM in which many stars risked injury doing their stunts ("I had a stunt where I had to jump a ramp and save a young lady whose motorcycle was on fire," says LL Cool J, "I pulled her off her bike, but when she let go, the handlebars hooked onto the spur of my boot. So here I am riding with a burning motorcycle hanging off my leg. It was crazy.") renders the message moot. This may be the greatest on-screen irony since Kenneth Branagh delivered Hamlet's advice to the players sawing the air with his hand and splitting the ears of groundlings.My advice to those interested in seeing this film: move along, there's nothing to see here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's fun trash and dull trash...This is DULL TRASH!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I haven't seen the original "Rollerball," but the old Normal Jewison flick didn't get such glowing reviews either, so it's not like millions of audiences came forward and hollered, "The original was so much better! Why did they have to butcher it???" The previews looked really cool. And the previews...are the movie! Aside from the spectacular opening skateboarding sequence, all the coolness the movie has to offer was given in the previews, and as an added bonus set to the jamming sounds of Limp Bizkit. And for those renting the DVD, it's not a total loss. Hell, I least I got to see some bare boobs. The uncut, R-rated version is available on DVD. So for those thinking of renting this flick--only rent it if you're absolutely desperate to see some bare boobs. I feel even sorrier for those who had to watch this crap in theaters WITHOUT the nudity!I just found out that the movie was re-edited countless times because of disastrous preview screenings. That alone hints that it's gonna be a crappy movie. I could be wrong, but so far I don't recall seeing a good movie that got its release date pushed and pushed and pushed. The same thing happened with that horrible movie, "Soul Survivors." And I should've gotten a clue when a big, over-hyped action movie like this bombed, even in the first week. Even some of the crappy action movies do wonders at the box office.John McTiernan, director of "Die Hard" and "Die Hard with a Venegance," does the best he can, and even overdoes it. Some shots seem flashy for the sake of being flashy. A few of the flashy images are fetching, but most of them just look gratuitous. But McTiernan was working with such a shallow, meaningless script that he tried hard to keep this clunker afloat. So I appreciate the effort. But I gotta say, that green-light chase scene--What the hell was that about?Every square inch of this movie spells "forgettable." Take away big stars like Chris Klein, LL Cool J and Jean Reno, along with the huge production values, and you got yourself direct-to-video filler. Why did French character actor Jean Reno degrade himself in such a one-note role? How many zeros were in that paycheck? It's tragic to experience such a fine actor like him laugh maniacally and spurt out horrible lines of dialogue. As for Klein and LL--they'd jump off a 100-story building for a film if it promised a huge paycheck. Let them degrade themselves. At least I get to see the beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. She's no actress, but in such an utterly trash flick like this I wasn't a stickler for acting. Topless Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is pretty much the highlight of "Rollerball."This is an example of art imitating life. Extreme sports didn't prove successful with the XFL, and people didn't have to pay to see that! That just proves how successful extreme sports will fare in cinema.My score: 3 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how a talented action director such as John McTiernan could end up with a piece of trash such as "Rollerball." Last time I checked, movies were supposed to be entertaining and fun.One of the many problems is the sloppy editing, which was obviously made to cut the dialogue out. Now I've had experiences with poor editing in movie, but what I saw in "Rollerball" was ridiculous. Sometimes, it's literally impossible to understand what's going on. And the camerawork isn't much help, either.There are two kinds of bad movies: The kind so bad, it's hilarious, and the other kind is just plain bad. Unfortunately, "Rollerball" would have to fall into the second category. Believe me when I say I've never seen anything as bad as "Rollerball." Luckily, I only rented it on DVD after seeing so many negative reviews. And that was one of the biggest mistakes I'd ever made.Not many movies get to be as bad as "Rollerball." I still can't understand why a whole action sequence was shot with an infrared camera, and why a motorcycle crashing through the gate makes a Looney Tunes cartoon sound. The film doesn't even pretend to be serious, and still, it's not even worth watching; it had no business being at the movie theaters and has no business being sold in video stores.I don't think many movies will ever get to be as bad as "Rollerball." It seems the stunt people are the only ones actually doing their job, the rest of the characters just seem to be little more than elements of second unit. Avoid "Rollerball" at all costs.

No, certainly not. Is it even a good movie? I suppose its depends on your point of view. Here's mine:When the original Rollerball made its debut here in the 70's, I was in line on the first evening. Its been one of my favorites ever since. not because its a great movie or had some stellar acting (James Caan, at the time, couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag even if he had a sword). It was, however, entertaining. It allowed me to set aside the day's BS and just watch the carnage.This new movie is very similar in that respect. I enjoyed it. I wasn't looking for a message. I wasn't looking for King Lear or Hamlet. After reading some of the reviews on this site, I was half expecting Eraserhead or Plan 9 from Outer Space. I was pleasently surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What has happened to John McTiernan?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To preface this, I am a huge John McTiernan fan. Predator ranks right behind Aliens, in my opinion as the best Sci-Fi action movie ever. Die Hard invented a whole genre of film unto itself. Remember Die Hard on a plane? Passenger 57. Die Hard on a boat? Under Siege.Hunt for Red October was hailed as the best sub movie since Das Boot. Still is in my opinion. Thomas Crown Affair was better then the original. I hear the first cut of 13th Warrior was outstanding (Michael Crichton re-shot and re-edited much of McTiernan's original film). Die Hard: With a Vengeance was a masterful sequel.Personally, I like Medicine Man, but I can see why a lot of people did not. The Last Action Hero had a horrible story, but it was well directed.Rollerball, much like Last Action Hero, was also a horrible story. The difference was McTiernan's direction was absolutely rancid. The editing was amateurish. The music was mundane. And the direction was awful, oh wait, I already said that.The plot involves a wayward amateur athlete in the 'States hoping to get his break. He does in the form of a childish sport involving roller blades, motorcycles, steel balls and viewer ratings. For some reason he gets paid lots of money, but when a dimwitted teammate gets creamed upside the head with one of the afore mentioned steel balls, he suddenly develops a conscious, after all he's only making "100 times more" than his teammates. Why would he care if one gets knocked off?What follows is a terrible story that tries to involve the audience on some pseudo-political level, but never even gets close. Jean Reno plays the owner of, apparently, not only the central team, but the league as a whole. LL Cool J plays a throw away part as Chris Klein's best friend. And Rebecca Romjin Stamos plays Chris' teammate/love interest. We don't care about any of the characters, they're never fleshed out. And they're doing something so childish, that even if they were, we still wouldn't care.The direction is so terrible, that it looks like it was edited on someone's home computer by an inept amateur. There are silly things like an entire night scene that is shot with a green tint. I assume that this is supposed to give me the feeling that I'm watching this through night vision goggles. Basically it made me want to fall asleep. Later on in the same scene two vehicles bust through a wire fence and there is a, I'm not kidding here, "sproing" sound. Much like the sound one would hear in a Wiley Coyote cartoon. Both vehicles make this sound. That basically describes the whole movie. You sit back, scratch your head and say, "did I just see that? And if I did, that was terrible."I can't say the entire movie was awful, the opening race through San Francisco had McTiernan's usual flare and panache. An ensuing car chase scene through some dirt roads in the Ukraine wasn't bad either. But the rest can be flushed right down the commode.3 out of 10 stars. D+</fullReview>

Rollerball 2002 was so bad that it did not make it in theaters in Switzerland and was directly released in DVD. I was unfortunate enough to rent it.Do not make the same mistake, it is not worth it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree, this film is terrible. But I was wondering why the players didn't just go on strike in front of a global audience to protest at what was happening to them. Then again, that wouldn't make for a violent ending, would it?"If they want me to play, I'll play" (or words to that effect). Puh-leeeze!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the title I do NOT want to compare this movie to Ridley Scott's masterpiece but it certainly is not as bad as some reviewers say it is... in fact I found this movie to be higly entertaining. There are no 'great' actors except for Jean Reno (who is not as good as he usually is though) but the typecasting is perfect except for Chris Klein who looks way too 'nice' but who is doing a very good job nevertheless... I don't know why he looks and sounds almost exactly like Keanu Reeves though.At times the movie looks like you're watching a video clip but I guess that's just the sign of the times... The actionscenes in and out of the stadium are very exciting and never dull. There is some background information on how everything came to be but you have to pay attention or you miss it.I also loved the references to the world of professional wrestling.I give this movie a 7.5, it's not a 'great' movie but if you are willing to be entertained you'll be entertained by it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen the original ROLLERBALL, there's nothing to compare to. As a stand-alone film, it's very enjoyable. It's been a while since John McTiernan has directed a film. His last ones were the remade THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR and 13th WARRIOR. Here, it's thought that John has returned to what he does best, and it was nice to see a film that was surprisingly good. At first glance ROLLERBALL looks like it's going for the "MATRIX effects" that so many movies, shows, and commercials have been using too much, but John has stuck to his own methods of film making, and hasn't "sold out." Every action scene was not filmed in any over- outlandish style, and that was a star swinging high point. Chris Klien seems more accustomed to comedy, but here, he's starting to learn the ropes as a man of action. Though his youth is apparent within his role, he makes it through as a hero. LL Cool J has proven himself to be a compotent actor long ago, and he still has his own brand of charisma. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos also commands the screen as a tough Rollerball player who happens to have a romantic relationship with Klien's character. Another nice touch was the international casting and locations through the whole film. It gave a great mix. Especially with the great Jean Reno as the villain who always does good in the movies he's in. The rest of the villains are also great. They're cruel and it's a relief when they get what they deserve. For a PG-13 rated film, it was surprisingly violent. It's hard to believe that the theatrical version was edited from the original which supposedly has more violence.But if the MPAA is getting lax, so what? One less movie getting too much hasslement. The action is brutal and pounding. When one concentrates fully on the film, it's like actually being in the arena with all the fierce action going on all around. When someone gets struck, it's felt by the viewer. But the standout action scene is a chase through darkness where it's totally pitch black and scene through nightvision lenses. This was a great method, because the atmosphere would be ruined by Hollywood lighting effects. This added on to wondering if Chris Klien and LL Cool J are gonna get away from the bas guys. The small roles were also cool. Like seeing WWE's Vince's son, Shane McMahon for one full second. (Blink and he'll be gone.) And surprisingly, former wrestling commentator Paul Heyman had a bigger role that thought, and has some funny lines. All in all, this is John McTiernan's best film in a long time. ROLLERBALL is not something that should be thought too hard about, but should be taken with consideration and excitement.8 out of 10</fullReview>

And if the "new" viewers are so impressed, why is it still only the same 8.2% watching the beginning of all subsequent "roller games"? Why was it suggested that Aurora couldn't hear Marcus screaming at her about the trail of fire coming at her because of the roar of her motorcycle and their distance apart when they're both wearing headsets? How could Larry Ferguson (screen writer) possibly have Petrovich's lackey tell Jon-a-ton that they are deliberately keeping Aurora alive to keep Jon-a-ton cooperating, when, in fact, they had tried to kill her in the previous "roller game"? What was Larry Ferguson thinking when he wrote the line, "I don't need a political position because I own the men who do"? The men who do what? Who need a political position? If they NEED a political position, what's the advantage to owning them? Why is everyone in the stadium reacting to all the English-language statements being read in the broadcast booth, since these statements cannot be heard over the stadium public address system? Why couldn't Mystery Science Theatre 3000 stay on the air long enough to bring justice to this film?</fullReview>

And why Rebecca Romijn-Stamos did that, too, and decided to show her beautiful breasts here. Well, I hope they both got a fair sum of compensation for being part of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, it doesn't help that the script is a mess and generally that the movie is no good. But what ruined this was the editing. Not once do you get a clear view of what goes on, anywhere, least of all on the Rollerball court. The cuts are so frequent it plays out like one of those horrible "in-your-face" kung-fu movies. Makes you think that they couldn't get the actors to deliver two good lines in a row (which I know isn't true) so they just cut back and forth constantly to splice it all together.I walked away from this movie with a headache and a feeling of anger at the 3-4 hours it felt like I wasted watching it. If any of you can bear to watch MTV anymore, think of any of the horrible videos from that band Dream, where there is a cut for literally every single second of film. Now stretch that out to 90 minutes, and there you have it. 1/10 (1 for near-nudity of Rebecca Romjin)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not...not a good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball is a bad movie. It is extremely bad. It is unconscionably, incomprehensibly, horribly bad. Literally the one positive thing I can think to say is that Rebecca Romijn-Stamos takes her clothes off once or twice. I'm not joking. That is as good as this movie gets. While there are dozens of things wrong with Rollerball, it's the editing that sinks it. The movie seems edited in an amphetamine-induced haze without regard to performance, plot or coherence. It is very hard to tell what is going on from one-second to the next. Another problem is the leading man. The hero is a young American hockey player. He is an extreme sports fanatic who journeys to Russia and becomes a star player in the brutal new sport of "rollerball." He soon finds out that "All Is Not What It Seems?" and has to fight for his life. The rollerball league functions like a futuristic French Foreign Legion so the hero becomes first among a brutal, subhuman pack of desperate characters. The character has to be tough, dripping with testosterone. Vin Diesel should have been a shoe-in. Instead they cast Chris Klein. Sweet, young, apple-cheeked Chris Klein. Young Chris doesn't look rough enough to watch the sport without his mommy much head the league in broken limbs. This is not a question of acting talent. This is a question of sheer physical believability. You wouldn't cast Michael Jordan as a jockey. Seeing the other actors relate to the affable Klein as if he were a berserk Klingon pushes the movie towards parody. The other actors seem to be doing what they can but it's really very hard to tell what they are up to because of the terrible editing. There are times when the actors are cut off in mid-word! "Hacked up" doesn't begin to cover the effect. The person who bears the brunt of the editor's depravations is that most French of actors Jean Reno. Here he plays a Russian and between the editing and accent, his part is all but unintelligibleSometimes cinematography can save a movie. Not Rollerball, however. When the images aren't pumped up and jarring they are dark and dreary. An entire sequence is shot in the grainy-green style of night-vision goggles. As nobody in the film is wearing goggles at this point one would assume that the director just liked the style. It may be cool but it's exceedingly hard to take for any length of time. Here you have around four minutes during which you witness major events through a muddy green fog.Suffice it to say Rollerball should never have been released, not even direct-to-video. Honestly, you wander away from the experience wondering what caused the disaster. Quite a bit of thought and money obviously went into the film and John McTiernan is an action director of considerable talent. It should at least been an enjoyable time-waster. Instead it fails at every level. Recommend Rollerball to your worst enemy. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

Rollerball 2002 a koan? Or just McTiernan sitting in his warm cave watching the CNN shadows of the ROW turning them into one of the longest and worst music videos in history?But who cares?

		<fullReview>The original lacked many things, but it at least had a socio-political edge. The first film version had to labour under the acting of James Caan (his has improved marginally), but it did convey the essential political overtones and the de-sensitisation of the global TV audience to violence.Rollerball 2002, seemed to be trying to depict the now without comment, and use the violence to paper over the cracks created by a paper thin treatment.Super villians seeking global domination (if only in TV ratings), are the stuff of third rate comic books. An opportunity to make a movie that kept to the spirit of the original story, provide food for thought, and lead us on a fantastic trip was sorely missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.She was the reason I stayed awake throughout the film (here in Mexico the movie was rated "C", kinda R in USA, so I thought there would be a lot of nudity, compliments from Rebecca... dream on!).2. Jean Reno.An actor from head to toe, great in his performance, he urgently needs a nomination for an Oscar... obviously not for this movie.3. The night vision scene.I love all kinds of experiments in filming, that's why I love Blair Witch Project, so I thought this type of camera gives an eerie, but great feeling to movies. This scene in Rollerball was ok, I personally think it was the best of the film.That's it. I think I should've listened to my other friend and go see The Musketeer... but that's in the past. I went to see Rollerball, and there's nothing I can do. Wait, another thing. Slipknot was part of the soundtrack and they appeared in the film. THAT WAS GREAT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're into very fast cars, ultra violence, female nudity and women who are nothing more than meat then Rollerball might be just for you. But then only if you're male and under 16. And even most of them will reckon Rollerball is lousy.Rollerball is I supposed aimed at the above but it's such a mess that I'd say that it ended up having no direction at all. Apparently the makers had this thing made in mid 2000 but after test screenings have edited it for over six months trying to recover the situation. They failed.Those of us old enough to remember that excellent B &amp; W TV sports show called Rollerball would perhaps be interested to see if Ronnie Raines and his buddies has been reincarnated in the 21st century. Come to think of it I would have fitted the above snotty, nasty profile fairly well in the 1960's!A trawl of the cyber net has little mention of that marvelous television entertainment but we do find links to the 1975 James Cahn sci fi action/weepie called Rollerball. There also is or has been a television game show of the same name as well as an all in wrestling event called Rollerball, all of which would be vastly superior to this 2002 movie release.Jean Reno (Blade Runner, The Deep Blue, Nikita, The Professional) couldn't save Rollerball, nor Chris Klein (American Pie). Even the director Johm McTiernan (Die Hard, Last Action Hero) had this one spiral out of control.It's full of extremely fast edits, smirking baddies, pouting females, bad music, sports cars, roller blades, lost helmets and almost no nudity for those interested. And a plot that makes little sense.If you require anything more from your movie making than some half big body blows and relentless pointless rushing about give Rollerball a miss.No Flys Out Of Five</fullReview>

Tim Burton had yet to insult audiences worldwide with his wimpy, trash-talkin PLANET OF THE APES. Poor old Nicolas Cage at least "tried" as he stumbled through the God-awful remake of GONE IN 60 SECONDS. Now though we have the benchmark in psychotic movie re-working! McTiernan has single handedly destroyed the memory of Norman Jewison's sci-fi classic of '74 - an exciting multi-layered social commentary way ahead of its time and like Psycho - totally UN-REMAKEABLE!ROLLERBALL 2002 in totality has way less dignity and style than even the original POSTER for the James Caan epic. Set in what is now only a few years hence, ROLLERBALL is simply a corporation-hyped ratings winner. A gladiatorial roller rink with few rules, supercharged motorbikes and a healthy blood-lust. Once the viewer interest wanes, Jean Reno, in an embarrassing re-enactment of John Houseman's wonderfully understated corporate menace in the original, simply orders a spot of bovver to keep himself and his stooges cashed up, courtesy of the ramped-up audience participation!Chris Klein obviously running a Keanu Reeves line in MATRIX-styled scowling and non-acting, is way too young for the role of Jonathan, quite apart from the fact he has less charisma than the average day Manager at KFC! The script is near incoherent, evidenced early on from the savage cutting inflicted, after disastrous test-audience reaction. Filmed as little more than a 98 minute MTV clip the action sequences are so badly choreographed with low rent pyrotechnics, the makers have fallen on the last resort of a head-banging soundtrack. Even that is totally misplaced, laughably inappropriate and evidence that most everyone involved had written the thing off way before completion.This is a film should be compulsory viewing for everyone aspiring to any gainful employment within the film production industry. Not a solitary aspect of the movie, from direction, editing, script, acting even the production department come out looking half professional. It is also a sad legacy for a lost generation of attention-deficient young audiences who need headphones to replace constructive thought.To say the film sucks is way too kind. This is without argument one of the greatest duds ever put up as entertainment Do yourself a favor and go rent the original, which offers style and thought-provoking brilliance from the memorable opening scene to the very last frame!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rollerball is without any doubt a bad movie. Especially getting through the first 30 - 45 minutes will strain ones patience (and taste). It gets somewhat better when Jonathan tries to escape - here (or rather in the aftermath of the attempt) at least some effort is made to give the audience a little inside into the characters.Jean Reno is the only actor in this movie who can really act. Unfortunately he is not given much chance to do so - the only time he can really do something is once again the aftermath of the escape.Eric Serra usually is a good sign (some people would disagree, but IMHO he has never turned out a bad score while composing several exceptionally good ones), but here it takes him a long time, to find the mood. The music in the first 30 minutes consists solely of rock music; only in the end one gets to hear the classic Serra drums and synths.All in all I was expecting much worse after reading all the reviews - but nonetheless, all the time invested in making this film would have been better put somewhere else.

		<fullReview>Whomever enjoys the 1975 version of Rollerball -- a piece of sincerely offered advice: Stay away from this garbage. Way away. This is a singular slice of disaster from beginning to end. The awful reviews posted here give too much credit to the thing. Where was the director? He must have been half in the bag when directing it, and the guy doing the cutting must have been right there beside him at the bar with glass in hand. The characterizations are awful and the script even worse. Chris Klein, a reasonably acceptable actor, does an incredible job at doing a Keanu Reeves style acting demolition -- as if he were in a contest to be the worst actor on the planet, and winning.One might think that at least the special effects and the aesthetics of the movie might exceed he original, if nothing else. Nope. Not even close. In fact the original's view of the distant future comes off better than this movie's vision of the virtual present.Go into this movie with the lowest of expectations and it will still fail to rise to them. Remember that silly MTV video that you hated? This is longer and worse. The cuts are staccato machine gun attacks of extreme sports silliness, like thousands of tiny little moronic films about a millisecond long strung together.It's impossible to find even the smallest redeeming virtue in that even Rebecca Romijn Stamos is wasted--and she's absolutely wonderfully gorgeous, they managed to screw that up too.Rollerball was well worth remaking in that it's an intriguing concept and a reinterpretation would be welcome, but this was an embarrassing effort--the worst directing since my six year old nephew wandered around the house with a video camera, and the worst writing since God was born.Stay away from this bilge at all costs.</fullReview>

Perhaps this should be a warning to anyone that is thinking of going out and seeing this film, but I would have to say that this moviegoing experience has given me more respect for the craft of filmmaking. No matter how bad I thought any movie I had ever seen in the past was at the time, I now realize that the film projected onto the screen during those viewings could have been replaced by the film under the heading "Rollerball". I now have more respect for anyone who did not, in anyway, participate in the making of this film. I also have more respect for films that did not fail in the waysWatching this movie approximates doing acid. If you have never done acid, and do not wish to try, you can watch this movie to assimilate the effects that the substance does to the human brain.RollerBall is a game that takes place in the future...way, way in the future...all the way in the year 2005. Chris Klein plays Jonathan Cross, or, as his many fans in Southeast Asia would refer to him, "Jon-a-ton". Jonathan was at one time considered to be the "Next Wayne Gretsky", which I find to be quite incredible since he had refused to play professional hockey LL Cool J plays Marcus Ridley Jean Reno plays the villain, Petrovich Rebecca Romijn-Stamos plays the part of Aurora, or as the fans know her, the "Black Widow" Half the time, there was never a ball in place. Another amazing fact is that there never was a score shown.I think this movie has the greatest example of unintentional Dadaist scriptwriting that has ever been done. This film was a fantastic combination of nonsensical dialogue, plI think everyone that has any respect for the craft of filmmaking should go see this movie as soon as possible. Note that, only two weeks after the film was originally released wide into several thousand theaters, it is nearly impossible to find a theater that is still showing this film. I found that there were only two showings of this film in the entire city of Indianapolis that could be viewed. At one theater, it only played at 4 o'clock, while we see it at a different theater, where there was only one 9 o'clock showing. If you don't see this film now, you may have to wait until the film comes out on video, which would be a complete travesty. The full experience of realizing the horror of this travesty can only truly come to life on the big screen, and any disgust this movie would cause watched in the context of a 20-odd inch screen would be filtered. You owe it to yourself to see how corrupt and ill-managed the Hollywood system truly is, and you must realize that a film this horrendous was made to go on the big screen. This garbage was made with the idea that it would gross more than it cost to make, which was, quite embarassingly, an excess of 80 million dollars. Think about it. 80 million dollars. An amount of money that could have been used to build a much larger studio at MGM. An amount of money that could have been used to finance 80 small 1-million dollar budget films based on good independently written screenplays. Heck, an amount that would be much better given to charities to feed hungry people. Do you have any idea how many people 80 million dollars could feed? The fact that this mass of money, the majority of which will never be made back and is simply gone forever, was used for the soul purpose to create "Rollerball" sets a new low for the studio system. The very fact that producers at MGM thought that mainstream audiences would go for this trash makes me pessimistic in the Hollywood system, while the fact that audiences were smart enough to stay away from it gives me optimistic for the integrity of humanity. There is no reason for this film to exist. The fact that a major film studio would spend so much money on a film this bad shows that there is something wrong with the way the system works now. Wake up, Hollywood, wake up. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I'd like to just say that this review is for the first 20 minutes of this rubbish. I hated the original. It looked like it had a budget of 20 bucks. Do take note, I am a huge Norman Jewison fan. But Rollerball? What was he thinking. The new Rollerball was so hurtful to watch. It was so hard to follow. So, what are the rules of the sport? And uh, what is going on? I saw 20 minutes of this filth, and I saw the camera in reflections twice. Another amazing fact is the budget. 80 mill for this monstrosity. Where did all that money go? I guess to Rebecca's horrible accent. I hope this movie bombs. I want to meet the person that greenlighted this picture. In fact, I am going to write a screenplay, and walk over to MGM. If they turn me down, I will inquire about Rollerball. "You won't give me the hookup, but you'll re-make another bad movie into one that is worse?" Thank you MGM. Rollerball sets a new standard in bad movie. Every bad movie I have ever seen is an Academy Award winner compared to this filth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rollerball, the 1975 classic sci-fi film with enough blood and gore to fill an emergency room and with the kookiest look of the future. Now flash back to now, the 2000's where we have suddenly run out of ideas for movies and now have to remake, prequelize or sequelize every movie that's older then 20 years. Now we have the "prequel" to the james Caan classic and I guess by prequel they mean the "sucky" version. Sorry for my bad grammar but the fact remains, you cant play a neo-futuristic sport in a movie if people dont get killed constantly. That's the way it works, i dont write the rules, but if your gonna remake a movie live up to it's standards.</fullReview>

Whats with everytime an announcer says something they have to give it to us in 5 different languages?3. And i am not kidding on this one.........cartoon sounds i thought this was a roadrunner cartoon for a second4. A very annoying very long very unbelievable sequence in GREEN FILM!!!!!5. Terrible costumes6. Terrible music7. Along with half the movie in different languages, Reno who can hardly be understood in english8. The track, not because it was different, but because it looked way to small for the configuration it had and was just plain stupid. It was more of a hamster cage.9. Quite possibly the worst editing job in movie historyThe ONLY thing i remotely liked in this movie was the ending, if they had a plot to go along with the ending it would have been a good movie.I think everyone should see this so that i am not the only one to suffer1 * out of 10 *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, first off, why remake the movie? It was a good ol' movie with James Caan. Now, they re-make it with Jason Biggs and 2 Pac??? that is so wrong. I mean seriously, American Pie was great, but rollerball, THAT WAS EVEN BETTER. I would recommend never seeing this movie, unless you go to a movie theater. This movie was a waste of money, look at the budget debt and starving children and they spend millions on this horrible piece of amazingly original and creative art. As creative as copying a movie done in 1975! To everyone involved with rollerball....I love you, call me.</fullReview>

Speaking of which, John McTiernan, I gotta tell ya...You have made so much better films than this. You should go back to writing your own stories like you did with Nomads because that movie kicked ass! And also you've directed so much better epics like Predator, Die Hard, 13th Warrior and so on. Well, folks, don't waste your money like I did on this. Just rent the original version. Or better yet... if you never did like the 1975 version, go see it! You'll hate this version and will want to buy the 1975 version! Seriously, that's how bad this movie was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not know where this story was going. The only good parts where in the game called RollerBall. But the rest of this story was bland. And the acting was pretty weak. Chris Klein needs to get some acting lessons. These days he is just a pretty boy. Here On Earth was an embarsement. He bounced back with American Pie 2. But RollerBall with Chris Klein did slightly okay. But he is still young.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to find a word to describe this movie. It lacked plot, feeling and all around anything to make it worth watching. Yes there was a lot of action but you couldn't figure out the point, and I'm not sure that there was one. The crew and screenwriters didn't log the necessary time to ensure that it was believable, and it doesn't have a story to rest on. And the script is full of plot holes. You don't know what happens to LL Cool J's character. Chris Klein's part was fair as far as the acting, but he has played better parts. It just isn't believable. Through the entire movie his helmet is unlatched and even though he takes hits to the head, his helmet seems to stay in place magically. There is one shot where you see his helmet fly off then in the next shot it has mysteriously made it back onto his head. Then it is gone again. There really wasn't an opportunity to create plot in the story, and all the emphasis is on action. I say shame on you Hollywood, there are better scripts out there to turn into movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who cares what this late middle aged dude thinks who saw the 1975 version and a couple of times since? Just this, s.v.p.:There is only one feature about the "re-make" perhaps slightly superior to the original, the sociology or the social context. How violent gladiatorial sports might soon find fertile roots in the putrifying portions of the old Communist bloc is an interesting proposition. Beyond that, and not a large point, ROLLERBALL is an abortion which takes little of the good of the admittedly understated 1975 version by to-day's standards -- and makes its own contribution (bad) by an order of magnitude.Recently there was a FRONTLINE (P.B.S.) airing about the contemporary film industry a propos here. One of the interviewees said that movies to-day are made for a)teen-agers, and b) a broad international market where English skills are limited or zero, how we get so much crap under the guise of "action" films. (sic) Explosions, gun play, car chases, choppy takes, minimal dialogue, and two-bit sex.I was rather looking forward to it too. Perhaps the commentator from Germany says it better, so read him too.</fullReview>

It seems the CASTING directors are about as STUPID in picking actors for roles these days as dim witted nephews of Producers get picked to write screenplays. The problem is with the almighty BUCK. A casting director looks at the DEMOGRAPHICS of which "star" will draw folks to a film...paying NO ATTENTION to the THEME of the movie, the PLOT or what TYPE of performer is needed. I also blame the DIRECTOR...dont these "mouthpieces" ever step in a say, "hell no, he aint right for the part". But then again, they got their paycheck so why rock the boat...

		<shortDescription>Um...Mr. McTiernan...WHAT HAPPENED???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, when I first heard about a remake of "Rollerball" and John McTiernan, I nearly wet myself. In my opinion, he's one of the best directors out there (Die Hard 1 &amp; 3, Predator, Hunt For Red October)!!! So I was pretty happy about this remake. Then I saw the trailer, and was a little skeptical, but I just said to myself, "John McTiernan is directing, so it'll be good, have faith Chris".So the other day I went and saw it. "WOW...WHAT A LET-DOWN!" I won't say it was a HORRIBLE movie, but it certainly wasn't "GREAT"...I'd even have a hard time saying "GOOD". There are SO MANY problems with this movie, but here's some that stood out. The editing was god-awful! There were some cuts where there definitely shouldn't have been cuts and it was often chaotic! I think I'd have to see it again to point out particular scenes, but I'm sure you'll agree if you've already seen it.There were a number of times where some explanation was desperately needed! Or...maybe I just missed something. For instance, when Jonathan and Aurora go to "Sergei's" apartment and they were attacked. Who is Sergei? And who attacked them? What the heck did this have to do with the badly-told story? Just seemed pointless to me. ...Or how about when Jonathan's car gets destroyed because of the riot. Why was there a riot? What was that about? I didn't get the point of that whole scene either. These are just two scenes that I didn't get.What on earth was with that whole scene being filmed in the night-vision green lens? It was kind of cool for a few seconds...but not for the entire scene!*---------SPOILERS AHEAD---------*Why did they have to throw in the "Romance" between Jonathan and Aurora? It just didn't fly! I guess it would have been ok, but they just seemed to be "getting-it-on" WAY too quickly and it just didn't seem right. And while I'm thinking of it, what was with that computer monitor and all that in the friggin' sauna? That was just stupid to me.Ok, what is with the Naveen Andrews character? Why the hell did he appear all sympathetic towards the players saying to Jean Reno "Isn't that enough? Cut the feed", and then he turns out to not care about the players in the end? That was just LAME if you ask me.*---------END OF SPOILERS---------*All in all, I just have to say this, the plot to this movie was EXTREMELY BAD, and HORRIBLY told. The acting wasn't terribly great. Not to disrespect Chris Klein, but they should have got someone else. He's cool in the American Pie series, but get him out of Rollerball. LL Cool J, was ok, but I'm not terribly fond of him. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos was fine with me, I didn't mind her at all. Jean Reno, was ok, but he need to speak clearer.On the other hand, there were a few things I did like about the movie. I did like SOME of the costumes, but some of them were ridiculous. I did like Chris Klein's, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' and LL Cool J's, costumes but the rest were kind of lame and childish. I also LOVED that the band "Slipknot" was in the movie, even though it was only for a few moments. So I'll leave you with this, if you want to see this, by all means...go see it, but if you want my advise...wait till it's on DVD/VHS.And that's my two cents. Thanks for reading.-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie,I knew it would be horrible. I was right. That guy from Fast and The Furious is one of the worst (behind Stephen Segul of course)in the entire world. I'm sticking with Ebert this time,but what i dont get is he gave Escape From L.A. ***1/2 out of for. I watched it and commented on it not long ago (read it,it is quite funny)and it was almost as bad as this. This movie (with the exception of Exit Wounds)is the worst movie out right now. If you are in to these kind of movies(which are terrible)see it,if you want to be throwing up at such a script as bad as this. My advice to you is do not see it,it will give you that same queezy feeling that Exit Wounds did. Yes, it is just that bad. Thats all folks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say the Rollerball is, by no means, Oscar material. However, if you are looking for a descent smash-em-up action type movie, go for it. I enjoyed this movie for the entertainment value and the attractive scruffy Chris Klein. However, the movie editing was not up to par, and it wasn't just the movie theatre I was in. There are several rough, obvious cuts and, at times, the audio is a little off. However, keep an eye open for the little cameos such as Pink (not sure what the point was of having her in it) and Iowa's own Slipknot. If you are looking for an action flick, go for Rollerball. If you are big into the technical aspects of film, skip it. I, honestly liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"And the Oscar for worst scene produced in a movie goes to... Rollerball!" For those who are still skeptical about seeing this movie, let me decide for you. Do NOT see it. I was optimistic going into the theater, I came out with a grin wide enough to fit all the talent involved in the flick. The grin was not from me loving the movie, but a certain scene so badly produced that I could not help but to smile the rest of the movie. The rundown: first, it starts with a cheap camera and/or film shooting everything. Add a sort of a night-vision effect. Then, terrible acting by Klein and Cool J. To add to my amusement, a terrible 30 second car chase that ends with them on a motorcycle. While hitting 110 mph (since when does a motorcycle NOT flip when it is being jerked around at 110?), a car/plane comes in flying very low to try and capture the two fugitives. The fugitives go through a barbed-wire fence (notice the VERY cheesy Saturday morning cartoon sound when they go through). The plane follows (ANOTHER cheep noise). It ends with a death and more bad acting.Yes, this is the worst scene I have ever seen. It tops all of the scenes from Supernova! Just don't watch it. Don't associate yourself with anyone even remotely involved with the film.</fullReview>

Chris Klein, who is a decent comedy actor, does not make a convincing action star, and certainly is not convincing as a extreme sports star. In this remake, Klein travels to Central Asia to become a star in rollerball, a sport that makes no sense considering the filmmakers make no effort to explain the game or to shoot or edit the sports matches so that we have any idea who is winning or what is going on in the game. In fact, the entire story is such a mess that attempting to follow the plot just leads to severe migrane headaches on the part of the viewer.. ignore this film at all costs. GRADE: F</fullReview>

Who could think that the man who gave us Die Hard could give us *that*?There is nothing wrong with the acting, or the actions, or even the script in itself. Just the whole filming and putting together of that movie is totally out of it.Now, would you shoot an entire night sequence using infrared cameras, forcing people to watch 15 minutes of green and blurry action?

		<fullReview>For a primer in everything that's wrong with Hollywood movies,enjoy this 95-minute seminar from onetime action-movie maestroJohn McTiernan, who may not top his LAST ACTION HERO workhere, but comes close to a tie with TOMB RAIDER for most vapidbig-budget blockbuster of recent times.There's a granule of a good idea at work here: a WWF-style circuserected in the ruins of a post-Soviet Second World economy inSomethingorotheristan. The Vince McMahon of this scavengerecosystem is Jean Reno, whose accent totters from the Slavonianto the West Gauloise: Chris Klein is ze pretty-boy Americain whodiscovers that the x-treme game of Rollerball is really a front forcorporately sponsored murders of star athletes for highratings--and guess who's next!With LL Cool J as an unbelievably retro Black Friend Who RelaysPlot Information and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, wearing a gnarlyscar on her face as if to justify her rampant toplessness, themovie, especially in its first third, plays as if it were directed by acomputer-assembled focus group comprised of twelve-year-oldboys addicted to Do The Dew commercials. In the most obnoxious, most grotesquely produced, and most interestingsection of the movie, McTiernan tries to set up a circus ofbloodsport grotesquerie that's part manly-man cable show, partOliver Stone wigout and part "A.I." Flesh Fair. Once the moviesettles into its (absurd) plot, the bad acting of Chris Klein, whosuggests a smile painted on a broomstick, and the hideousinternational-coproduction-ness of it all (Jean Reno laughing--laughing fiendishly!) overwhelms one's sense of humor.This is not a good-bad movie.

		<fullReview>As soon as I saw the previews I knew this movie was going to be bad, but I never, NEVER, imagined it would be this bad.Let me start with the plot: unless you've seen the original you're left to guess what the plot is (if anything?). The plot is given no date, one could assume it happened 20 years ago, and it appears the old Soviet Union is still alive and kicking although the movie is supposed to be set in the future. The whole point of the movie (or at least the original) is supposed to be about individuality, happiness, and control. Forget about any of that because it's not in the movie. In fact, the entire movie would seem to suggest "if it feels good, do it" and "follow the crowd and you get these nice cars and women". The movie even ends on a ridiculous quote about having sex - it seems the writers didn't care about a moral or even writing a story.One might assume that since there is no plot it must be all action? Yes, it is action and No, it's not good. You know the action is going to be poor when the players come out in ridiculous costumes and helmets that look like bears or cats - at least the original version took itself seriously. Don't try to keep track of the action either - the track is so badly put together it is impossible. With the original version you could keep track of the action, but with this version all you see it motorcycles and people flying and hitting each other. Its a real shame what this remake did to the name of Rollerball. I highly recommend you see the original if you want to know what the plot and action is really supposed to be like. One might note that the very thing this movie is SUPPOSED to go against is the very thing it relies on for its success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something went wrong *SERIOUS Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, from about a year ago, when I first found out about it. It started out promising enough, but as time went on, I started to doubt more and more. There were too many inconsistencies in the plot, and certain minor details didn't add up. (And, it had some of the worst editing I have ever seen.) Here's a few examples:*MAJOR SPOILERS* 1) For instance, who the heck is Sergei? They went to his apartment, they got ambushed, then there was a quick mention of him getting killed. But, I still don't know who he was, or why I was supposed to care about him. And why was there a riot? No details are given, or if they are, they aren't given in English.2) Why shoot the night-time chase scene in NightScope Vision? It was probably supposed to be artistic or something, but GOD was it annoying! And even with all the green lighting to distract you, you can't miss the fact that there's no way Jonathan could have gotten on the motorcycle from the driver's seat that quickly. When it first happened, I thought he got left behind. Then, they cut to a close-up, and he's riding on the back. Plus, when they busted through the barbed-wire fence, and it made that cartoon "boing" sound, my friend and I laughed out loud. It was so wrong!!3) Why did it take four months for the first act of violence to occur after Jonathan arrives? I say that, because after the first one, we are lead to believe it happens every single game. Or, at least, every single game that has low ratings. So, what, they didn't have low ratings before? It just doesn't fit.I think the movie's biggest problem was trying to fit an ultra-violent storyline into a PG-13 rating. It's like they changed their minds after they filmed it. 4) Because when Jonathan and his boss are talking at the mines, Jean Reno's mouth clearly says the "F" word, but it was re-looped, so he says "fooling", instead. Like it was edited for television.5) At the climax scene at the end, when they are trying to beat Jonathan to death, there is blood coming from cuts on his face, and coming from his mouth. But, in the next shot, the blood and cuts are mostly gone, and there are black smudges on his face and clothes. The rest of the players who were fighting suddenly look the same, also. It appears as if there was some gory blood effects that were digitally altered to make them not so violent. Jonathan's shirt also looks like he was just sweating or something, but you know it had to be covered in his own blood at one point. How much did all the digital cleanup cost, I wonder?6) The "love" scene suffers the same fate. It has no tension, passion or anything worth caring about, not to mention that it lasted all of 5 seconds. Why put it in the movie, then? It didn't last long enough to establish Aurora and Jonathan as an "item", so what good did it do? Either make it longer and more interesting or take it out completely. Again, it's the PG-13 curse. I believe if they had made this movie with an 'R' rating in mind, it would have been MUCH more interesting, and it would have flowed a lot smoother. They screwed it up by trying to patch it up.And, I just got home from the movie, and I can't remember how it ended. I mean, I know he killed his oppressors, and he walks down a hallway with Aurora... people are now worshiping him. But, I can't remember what happens between that and the credits rolling. I hope that's not how it actually ended. That's how bad it was. There's no lasting memory, no parting shot that makes a difference.Oh, well... it was all worth it to see Slipknot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are movie companies doing this to me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the fact that it took so long for this movie to come out should have been a clue, but after Planet of the Apes I had to give Rollerball a try too. Let me sum up this movie in a single word for those who want to go see it...DON'T. If you want to see it that bad go rent it for a dollar at Blockbuster (Rollerball '75 with James Caan) but don't waste your time with the new version unless you're having problems going to sleep at night cause this one will put you out like a light. Why can't movie companies learn, the point of a REMAKE is to make it better than the original, NOT worse. So if the director and actors set out to make a vile piece of crap for a movie then they accomplished their mission in life. But it's the devoted movie-goers that have lost in this situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course I'm referring to "They Saved Hitler's Brain" a very very bad movie made in the late sixties. I don't think I have to touch on the specifics of Rollerball being awful. I think Ebert said it best when he called Rollerball "...an incoherent mess..." So I guess what boggles me, because bad movies are inevidable, is why actors choose such horrid roles. It makes we wonder what kind of dirt MGM has on Chris Klein that they would have the means to force him into this movie. I am by no means defending Klein as an actor, he makes me want to punch myself in the face with a brick. My question is, why make bad movies when there are so many good movies to be made? Why remake a movie that wasn't that good to begin with? Might as well just remake "Solarbabies", it had skating in it, but for some reason it was much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still can't figure out why there would be a remake to an obscure movie no that no one really paid attention to when it came out. Oh, wait, yes I can. Money. Hollywood's system of rehashing every book, movie and TV show they can think of continues with Rollerball, a remake of the 1975 James Caan film. Of course, what the fairly good original had in a well-scripted plot and interesting allegory to corporate power and American bloodlust, the remake tries to make up for in bombastic music, lots o' blood, and MTV-style editing. My biggest gripe with this film, though, is the way they diced up the scenes of the Rollerball tracks to the point where you can't tell what the hell is going on; the original, at least, made the game and its rules clear. I wasn't expecting much when I went to see this mess, so I was shocked when it went below my expectations. I didn't even feel any testosterone-fueled adrenaline at the finale.Okay, I'm spending way too much time on this review. Just do yourself a favor and rent the original. Or do anything else, for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad, pathetic attempt at a remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROLLERBALL / (2002) FBy Wes AlexanderROLLERBALL is a laughably awful film. It is filled with ridiculous dialogue, ludicrous situations, and some of the worst acting this side of Keanu Reeves. In case you were wondering, Rollerball is a sport. A stupid sport at that. It is where the players all skate (or motorcycle) around a giant figure eight that has ramps and obstacles in the way. The point of the game is to through a small, metal ball up against a gong to score a point. When you hit the gong sparks fly out like it was the Forth of July or something. Chris Klein stars as Jonathon Cross. He's a risk taker. In the opening scene we see him loge-ing down a city street for fun. He dodges cars and truck, but the only real thing you can see are quick glimpses and loud horn honking. The camera shots are so difficult to see, that all we get are glimpses and loud noises throughout the entire movie. His best friend Marcus Ripley (LL Cool J) informs him about Rollerball. Jonathon says that is not interested, but inevitably, four months later, joins the team and becomes the most popular player. Along with his on and off again girlfriend Aurora (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), him and Marcus become the best at the sport. The owner of Rollerball, Alexi Petrovich (Jean Reno) doesn't care about the safety of the players, but about the ratings. Thus, we get a sinister plot to kill the members of the Rollerball team and get high ratings so he can have a cable show.I mean, this is this guy's motive? High ratings? Jeez, come on. How pathetic is this? This plot had me rolling in the aisles. In fact, every stupid line of dialogue had me break out in hysterics. As I said, it's laughably awful. But nothing comes close to beating the nighttime scene shot in night vision. I guess this was added to create an effect. All it creates is the sense that they shot it on someone's personal camera. And a cheap one at that. The green tint of the screen is not only distracting, it's annoying.And the acting! Whew! Chris Klein says his dialogue like he's reading the script for the very first time. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos's character is from another country (I didn't care to find out which one) and her accent comes and goes. She sounds American one minute, then is completely not understandable the next. LL Cool J plays the ultra-cool guy who gets all the money and the girls. Now, normally I like LL, but his performance feels plastic and forced. Jean Reno must have gotten conned into this. I know he can act. I've seen him act. But in ROLLERBALL, he obviously isn't trying. It was probably just a favor he owed somebody. When we actually get to see the Rollerball being played it arrives with aggressiveness and is marked by boldness. The speakers roar and the theater shakes. And then everyone in the audience gets a headache. Do you think they could have toned it down about one or seven notches? ROLLERBALL may not be as bad as this year's other early "Worst Movie of Year" contender, KUNG POW, but it's pretty darn close. And that's too close for comfort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to go see this film in spite of the bad reviews, because it stars Jean Reno, and I'm a fan of his work. Unfortunately, this is the worst performance of his career. His character is shallow and played like he was hung over most of the shooting. He has only one good line in the whole film. And it's the only humorous line in the film too.The only good performance is that of Naveen Andrews, who plays Jean Reno's sidekick/assistant. His is the only character who has any sort of personality, and you will find yourself waiting for him to appear on the screen. Not so much because his character is essential to the story, but because the rest of the film is so horribly bad. His character brings us the only human being in the film. The rest of the actors are just cartoon characters of themselves.This film has nothing to recommend it other than the action scenes. The problem there is that the action scenes are shot too close to the action, and quick cut to the point where you can't actually see the action. If they had used a shorter lens and not been so eager to change cameras every 2 seconds, this could have been a much better film. It would at least have been watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem with this movie is that it is a remake. If this were the original movie called Rollerball, it would be seen as a slightly above average action movie. Well if it had someone who could act instead of giving a bad Keanu Reeves impression like Chris Klein does. Actually aside from Chris Klein I thought the actors did a rather decent job given the inherently weak character developement allowed by the script.The thing that really stuck out for me though was the very basic differences between the original and this incarnation. The original movie was a typical mid 70's near future movie. Rollerball being a game that was so brutal that there was never a "star" until James Kaan that is. The purpose being to strip the common man of yearning for individuality. Since individuals who stick out during the game get taken out. The new version is a typical turn of the millenium movie about greed. The movie feeds money to the evil producers of the show. In both cases the point was delivered a bit heavy handed, and very heavily doused with cliches of the time.Things to watch for: Oleg Taktarov (of ultimate fighting championship fame), Paul Heyman (prowrestling producer/commentator), and a cameo by Shane McMahon (Son of WWF owner Vince).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been a giant stink recently about the makers of "The Fast and the Furious" suing MGM for using the name of their film in advertisments. After seeing this overlong music video styled mess I can't say that I blame them. Where that movie was a fun and gulty pleasure, this one is just plain guilty. Chris Klein and LL Cool J both find themselves stuck in another loser of a movie where they both try their best to make something out of their parts that seem wholly miscast. Stamos, however, has the thankless job of being saddled with a love interest role that any actress should be embarrassed to portray. Fault of this movie sould not lie solely with director John McTirenan as he isn't working from the greatest source material in the world. Hey, look at Rob Reiner. He had "North" that he had to bounce back from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rumours of the test screenings were bad enough. This film only thinly resembles the original in the actual game. From there, it takes a hard left turn and continues to spiral downward.The remake was bad enough with a lifeless Chris Klein, who's stunningly lame work in "Say It Isn't So" must have been some inspiration for this turn in his lackluster career. Also, there has got to be some law passed preventing ex-rappers from becoming actors. It's worse than Elvis being shoved in front of a camera.However, knowing that this was once an R rated movie, and in order to recover what must have been stunning prospects of losses at the box office, neutered down to a PG-13 rating with bad digital shadows to cover up Rebecca Romin-Stamos' nudity, doesn't make it an easier pill to swallow.Add to that some of the worse editing during the actual matches that leave you with your eyes hurting from cuts away from the action, this turns into one turkey of a movie. Not so bad as to be un-intentionally funny, but bad enough to be an insult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original, but maybe that will help me to make this post into a critique rather than a comparison. Well, from the start of this movie it seemed it had nothing going for it. I was actually looking forward to seeing it, seeing as how I enjoyed Die Hard very much. But...well to start with, Chris Kline is a laughable Keannu Reeves wannabe. The movie itself is a Fast and the Furious wannabe. While I thought the latter was great, this movie...well, err...is not. As the movie progressed my patience slowly regressed, and I was happy when it was over. So, this kid Kline is a street luger (is that spelled right?), a potential hockey superstar, the greatest rollerballer ever, and a natural jackass. what can't he do??? Well, act is one thing. Quite funny how he seems like he never knows what's going on. And the ending is very bad. If you've seen it, than you can understand that by doing what he did, he lowered his standards to the "tyrant's" level, and is no better than the rich owners that controlled him. He went out to stop the violence, and caused an extremely violent, bloody riot in the process complete with fighting audience members, overturned cars, and setting fires. The only thing this movie had going for it was the previews, which offered Resident Evil and The Time Machine. Stay away, from this one, it is poorly made, strayes in all kinds of directions, and is hard to watch. 2/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS***I just saw Rollerball today on the day it opened, and it was a really cool movie!!! The movie is about Jonathan (Chris Klein) and his buddy Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J), who participate in the popular sport, Rollerball, which contains a small metal ball, and hitting domes to score points. In the game you skate on rollerblades, and sometimes you ride motorcylces. Jonathan and Marcus have made a lot of money, and now they find that the sport coaches and players are trying to kill or hurt the players on the team to get better ratings for the sport on television.This movie was ***really*** entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. This movie was truly not boring at all, and the director was great at the directing. Also, the whole story itself was written greatly. This was a brilliant action movie. Chris Klein, LL Cool J, Jean Reno, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, and Pink were brilliant and great!!! I highly recommend this movie!!! I give Rollerball a 10 out of 10!!!!!! :)</fullReview>

Let me assure you that I'm in no way unimpressionable with action movies and I sure can embrace stuff like "Terminator" or McTiernan's own "Die Hard" for the sheer fun of it. But this film is a complete disaster! The so called story involves the cruel gladiator-like sport of the original film, but fails to even begin to hint at the multi-layered social commentary of its predecessor. Instead you get loads of rah-rah-machismo and an uninspired, humorless and boring storyboard that makes the 90 minutes of the film feel like an eternity. The camera work is a major embarrassment too: fervent cutting doesn't allow you to actually see anything and the whole thing plays like an MTV-clip from hell. Oh yeah, and star Rebecca Romijn-Stamos runs around topless a lot, but without a proper context "it didn't get me excited, it just made me feel mean", as the song goes...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"...?!"This is the remake of the 1975 classic. And just like everybody else is saying, this is a movie that should have never been made.John McTiernan is one of the great directors of modern times. He was behind iconic and groundbreaking movies like "Die Hard", "Predator" or "The Hunt for Red October". A very impressive lineup that showed skill, passion and style. Sure, there were some misses too, like "Last Action Hero" and "The 13th Warrior", for example, but they were not that bad. Rollerball is without a doubt the worst movie he ever made and I can think of no reason why he would do such a thing.Making this movie should have been easy: all he had to do was take the original, remove the boring parts and improve the spectacular game of Rollerball. Just bring it up to date, so to speak. Unlock the game's full potential with the help of modern technology. Instead, he added a moronic back story, lame characters and almost no game at all. At least the original was half and half: half on the track and half off. This one barely showed any of the game and when it did it was just a bunch of clowns skating around in drag. It wasn't a game. It was a Gay Pride Parade (no offense).The script is horrible, the story is abysmal, the location is stupid, the set and the characters are just wrong and the camera work is crap. The editing is horrendous, the music is bad and the actors are worse. I've seen the movie in Italian, and that was fortunate. At least the Italian voice actors made it bearable.Rollerball. The movie that should have never been made. 1/10.</fullReview>

It's so easy for people to jump on the bandwagon and collectively dump on a movie (eg. Gigli), saying it's the 'Worst movie ever made' etc etc, clearly these people have never seen drek like "Rollerball Seven' or 'Space Mutiny' or even 'Leprechaun 4', those movies were BAD. Yes this was a remake, and the plot stays pretty much the same as the original, futuristic game played with motorbikes and roller blades, but it does not come close to the James Caan original. It's worth a watch if it's showing late one night on TV, might even be worth a rental on DVD. Watch it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

Perhaps one factor is that I did not see much of the original Rollerball - but enough to know it was excellent.The concept was modernized here - given the ESPN treatment. It's depicted like a rough Ice Hockey game gone too far. It also addresses some serious social issues. I like the combination of music with action too.It's certainly no blockbuster, but if these elements appeal to you, give it a shot. I think I own one of the 65 DVDs that were purchased nationally and it was worth it to me. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original version of Rollerball, but if it's anything like this crappy movie, it's gonna collect more dust on the shelves than all other movies. Just bad acting, bad accents, bad sound effects (cartoon "boing" sound when they crash through a gate), bad action-movie actors...just one bad film.Saving points go to seeing Jean Reno again (he's cool) and to seeing Slipknot's cameo-performance in the film. Also Rebecca Romijn's boobs. That's it. A lot of the actors seemed to be picked at random to play parts in the film. I can't see how this sport would be entertaining for anyone over the globe. They tried once with Roller Derby, and it ended up like the XFL...just crappy planning.John McTiernan had good vision in some quick-cutting shots, but that's what he's known for, not substance. This movie's a joke. Never even rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? The original had at least cult classic status. This doesn't improve on the plot or the cast. Caan had at least the right aura of subdued possible menace to handle the role, this guy Klein? izzathisname? has the same contact sport star quality as Woody Allen. Rebecca Romijn does OK in her role, don't know if it's talent or just they it's cut to fit her. Wouldn't it be interesting to have refabricated the movie around her character? Oh well. The murky supranational conglomerate politicoeconomic subtext seems even murkier in this version than the original, to the point of boredom. Or maybe it's just not saying anything more than the original said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ummm, I'm not sure why I watched this movie when I saw that it was on TV. I wish I could say that I was on something, but the only thing that I can think of is that maybe I was being tested...tested by the devil. I say this, because this movie has the eerie power of causing epileptic fits. For instance, during one of the crazy action sequences, where the camera dances around pretending to follow something and just when you think it might settle down, it cuts to some completely different random scene; well, I became extremely nauseous and passed out. The next thing I know, I'm in some hellish-looking rollerball ring surrounded by fire and rollerblading-demons. I can hear the intro to LL Cool J's, "I'm Gonna Knock You Out" blasting away on some endless loop and then WHAM!, out of nowhere I get whacked in the back of the head with a rollerball. As I look up dazed, I can make out two of the roller-demons standing over me. The odd thing is that they are spitting images of Chris Klein and LL Cool J....if they were in demon-form. They were laughing maniacally and saying, "Cha-ching!", and thats when I noticed that my wallet was missing. I think I only had like 3 bucks in there, but you couldn't tell that by seeing how Chris Klein-demon and LL Cool J-demon were carrying on. At any rate I awoke a few seconds later on my living room floor. The movie had gone off and I seemed to be no worse for wear. So anyway, to make a long story short, I lost 3 bucks and I think that I might be pregnant with Chris Klein's demon-baby? However, I only had to actually watch a few minutes of Rollerball. So technically, I won.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion Rollerball deserves a lot more credit than what it has got on IMDb. Although it's not any masterpiece and it is no where near as good as its predecessor from 1975, it is still an entertaining film that has even got a few comments on the real world.For instance the poverty stricken Russians spend most of their money on gambling when they can't even afford food (Just what happened in Albania a few years ago when a huge chunk of its populace lost a lot of money on a pyramid scheme). Parallels can also be drawn to professional sports, which are becoming more and more dangerous (who can forget Todd Bertuzzi's life threatening attack Steve More).As you can see it is better than what it has gotten credit for but still I would mostly recommend this film to fans of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scanning other user comments I noticed many people quick to point out the multitude of flaws this film has. Which is easy to do, the film is unmitagated garbage. Bad acting, nonsensical plot, the infamous night vision sequence ( i swore my DVD player broke when this was going on), but what I didn't see mentioned (although it may have been and I missed it) was any commentary on the Rollerball sport itself.In Jewison's original (a film I adore), the audience could easily follow the premise of the sport. Two teams circle around the ring, pick up a metal ball and try to place said ball in a metal hoop. And I suppose the sport in the remake follows the same rules, but... Why are there random jumps and little bridges all over the place? Are the teams suppose to race around in any order? Offense, defense...anything? Did anyone put the slightest degree of thought into the film at all? Well, the answer to that last question is pretty obvious. In the DVD booklet of the original RB, it is mentioned that the films stuntmen would play Rollerball in thier spare time. I'm sure the stuntmen in the remake were happier playing gameboy.One more complaint, though Rollerball is not the only recent film this criticism could be levied against: Why is it with this recent trend of playstation/Tony Hawk action cinema are the filmmakers so petrified of showing the brutality of violence? Don't get me wrong, I'm not a sadist, but from The Fast and The Furious to the infantile XXX, the horrific SWAT and the mindnumbing Rollerball, people are beaten, shot, knifed and mangled in every possible way, yet it never looks like they experience any actual PAIN!??!! I suppose no one wants to offend critical watchdogs and what not, and I'm certainly not asking for every film to be a bloodbath, but shouldn't fight sequences or gunfights give the viewer a sense of some sort of jeapordy? Shouldn't a protagnist see the consequences of his actions? When a character does die in any of these "extreme (!)" action films, the best any sort of intelligent person can hope for is a melodramatic stab at an "I feel cold" speech. And that sort of thing was old hat by the 1950's, and done with more craft and drama in the 1950's as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse Than One Could Possibly Imagine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball began life as a short story. It later became a semi-classic film with James Caan. Next it became this smoking pile of dog poop.The point of the movies ultimately are the game sequences.In the original they were well thought out nasty brawls of escalating violence that served as commentary on the individual versus the corporation. It is in its way the ultimate anti communist propaganda. While the original was weak but watchable off the track, we knew there was always the game to bring us back into the movie.Here the game is total confusion. It is impossible to know what is going on or why. Its all quick cuts that don't even remotely go together. I was forced to quickly turn the movie off because I simply could not follow what was going on.Worse I didn't want to.The game is a suped up mish-mash of various sports old and new and follows no logic other than "it looks cool". The plotting of the game as a banned game illegal in the civilized world is retarded.The cast is mostly good but they are given nothing to do.This is simply just bad film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll admit I've been a fan of the original movie ever since it came out back in 1975. I thought (hoped) that it would benefit from a retelling in much the same way that Gone in 60 Seconds had. Well, I was wrong. Dead wrong. At the onset I was thinking prequel. I was right. Where the original movie took us to a futuristic version of Corporate World Domination (CWD), this version goes to a world where the game Rollerball thrives in third world countries, almost in a "Fightgame" or "Kickboxer" atmosphere. This gives the game a decidedly underground flavor. This would have been, and was a good starting point for a good movie. Trouble is, we just don't have a good movie here. There is a superficial resemblance between the games in these movies. In this film, the Rollerball arena seems cramped, claustrophobic, even. With figure eights, ramps, jumps, a "bunny tube", it almost seems that the game of Rollerball started out with "feature bloat," (in the 2002 version) which was cleaned up for the future - which was the 1975 version of the movie. In the future, Roller ball will be played out on a much neater and cleaner arena, and with less confusion and chaos. Where the original "Rollerball" took us into a multi-layered and complex look at the life of a single player (Jonathan E.), this movie plays on a single level and on two dimensions. There is no depth, and the action photography is especially shallow and confusing. Trying to follow the action sequences during a single game, there seems to be no flow, no coherence, merely an blind adherence to the "3-second rule." I almost groaned - no, I DID groan at the first chant of "Jon-A-Than". I knew right then and there that the viewer was in trouble - particularly if they were fans of the first film.Do yourself a favor, watch THIS version first, THEN watch the original. You'll see that the original is much more polished, much more fully developed as a story. Then again, John McTiernan is no Norman Jewison. Where the original movie was an anthem of the value of one man in an anonymous and faceless society controlled by Big Business, this film is formulaic story of greed and violence. Where the original movie took the high road at the climax, this one sinks into a cesspool of violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...........This movie has to be seen as one of the worst remakes ever. The cental character, Jonathan Cross is a real joke compared to the original Jonathan.E, played by James Caan.Caan's Jonathan E was driven to play the game and the story centres on his struggle to continue playing the game when his paymasters want him to quit. He is potentially bigger than the game which was meant to be a method of control. No-one was supposed to ever become "good" at Rollerball as it was designed to outline the futility of individual effort.Klein's Jonathan Cross is trying everything he can to leave the game and is desperate to do so. He is blackmailed into playing by the TV bosses who are desperate to get the game on American cable TV (gimme a break!).Rollerball is a story that carries the message that the human spirit cannot be broken and that no matter how difficult the challenge, the human spirit will prevail.This load of garbage loses these key elements which made the 1975 movie an extremely valid film. It was not a glamourisation of violence like the new movie. The ending is truly stupid in the new movie and is the final nail in it's coffin. In the original, Jonathan E claims victory and rolls around the arena with his name echoing around the arena. He became what the bosses where afraid he would become, a hero. In the new movie Jonathan Cross kills the network bosses and frees himself from the game.I'd advise anyone thinking of renting this film to watch the original and not to waste their time on this pile of excrement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Rollerball" was not a great movie, but it had its strengths. The thing I liked about it most was its surprisingly complex theme: that a sport was being used to create a collectivist mindset among the public (much like, some would argue, Castro uses baseball in Cuba), and that a single man (James Caan) had excelled too much in this context and had to die.My favorite part of the old film was classy villain John Houseman's line: "It's not a game in which men are supposed to grow strong. I think you appreciate that, Jonathan."This weak remake completely misses this theme--the one thread of actual content in the original. Instead, it turns into a cheap, predictable "Running Man"-type thing about violence as entertainment and how sick we all are and blah blah blah.Of course, one could make the argument that THAT theme is more relevant to our times than the old one, which in turn raises the intriguing question of whether a remake should remake an original film's values along with its story and characters. Unfortunately, this remake is so laughably bad (and the original was no Oscar-contender, either) that perhaps it's better to have that discussion elsewhere--where it would be credible to believe the filmmaker would consciously make such a decision rather than stumble into it as is undoubtedly the case here.The original "Rollerball" is like $10 on DVD now--if you have to see something about rollerskating future sports, go get that. It wouldn't kill you to never see it, but it at least provokes a little thought.One reason to see the remake--Wrestling fans will get a kick out of ECW/WWE mastermind Paul Heyman's energetic performance as the announcer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this? Some kind of terrible joke?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a disgrace. That statement has been used to describe many movies, but in the case of this absurd Rollerball remake, it extends to many planes of meaning. For one, this movie destroys the original's plot, pacing, and anything at all that set it apart and made it a classic. This disgusting remake disgraces its original more than The Avengers, more than Godzilla, and yes, even more than Batman &amp; Robin. Beyond the initial corruption of the classic 1975 Rollerball, this remake is a disgrace to Jean Reno. Seriously, this man needs to do more research before choosing a movie. We know he can act well, we just know he can do it. Look at Leon (The Professional). This is yet another crapball to tarnish his record. The worst disgrace this movie is guilty of, however, is its absolute ineptitude. This film fails in its basic charge as a motion picture. This movie is unforgiving. If it's not hurting your brain with idiotic lesbian jokes, or attempting to titilate you with frontal nude shots, it's forcing you to observe brainless, pointless eXtreme!! sports, like death-luging or an action favorite, driving like an idiot. And don't forget the thirty-minute scene filmed with a green filter lens, to simulate night-vision. I have a camcorder, too, guys, and turning that little green thing on in the dark does not make your movie clever, edgy, interesting, or even watchable. I'd hoped I could forget this terrible film, but I've taking it upon myself to dredge up the awful memories of it once again, to warn others. DO NOT see this movie. It is not so bad it's funny, it's so bad it's painful. And if you've ever see the original Rollerball, just ignore this awful remake. Hopefully now I can sleep at night, hoping this message has saved at least a few poor souls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right, right off the bat, I'll let you know I am an open-minded person towards movies. Early in 2002, I saw the trailers for a new film called "Rollerball". The previews made it look like the flick was going to be pretty cool, and fast, a la "The Fast and the Furious".But one day, I was on the iMDB home page when I read a news article saying that MGM was in a big financial rut. Two of their big spring releases-"Hart's War" and, uh, "Rollerball" were sinking faster than a swimmer in a pool of oil.Reading both film's box-office businesses, I understand. "Hart's War" had a budget of $70 million, and it's opening weekend gross was $8 million. "Rollerball" had a budget of $85 million, and it needed a month to make $17 MILLION. In these cases, they were not even duds-they were two big financial busts.So, I waited for "Rollerball" to come out on video. When it did, I evenutally checked it out from my nearest Family Video.And from my viewing, it was terrible. The whole movie didn't seem to have any point, plot, characterization, thrills, etc. From the high-energy trailers, you might think that this film would offer that type of thrills. But the game itself makes "Baseketball" look like fun (a Comedy Central Canned Ham told us the Baseketball game itself was a very boring game to play).What was the point for the Slipknot appearance? And that scene filmed in Nightvision? It's obvious the filmmakers wanted to work on making the movie LOOK cool. Too bad the scripting was awful. I even remember seeing the camera focus on one character only to stop and then make them face a different direction! Intelligence insulting at its finest.It got my vote in the "Worst Films of 2002" list. I close by telling you, dear reader, not to bother with "Rollerball". At least I didn't go to the theater and PAY for it...I just doubt movies based on original sports will work.</fullReview>

The 2002 version is some pimplish over-testosteroned x-gamer's fantasy.The acting is hilarious.... Jean Reno is making his mark as Hollywood's token-frenchy. Casting him as a Russian is a complete joke. HE overacts so much, he looks like he's auditioning to replace Captain Kirk... Chris Klein is sadly miscast; the part was made for a James Caan tough looking s.o.b., not for some 19 y.o. teen magazine front page model. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is cute, a real nice woman, but her accent sounds ridiculous and phony. I can hear the casting meeting: "hey, who do we pick for the babe? Hummm... What's the name of the babe who showed her b***s in X-Men? Yeah, get her! Call her agent!!"Now the direction... This is a shame. I am no armchair director but the direction sucked. McTiernan can make great movies, he really can, but everything sucks in this flick. I had to rewind 20 times to understand the action scenes. The camera work is jerky, the editing is painfully fast.The script... What script? How can grown-ups come up with such a load of crap? The story looks straight out of a 15 y.o. undersexed mind. Hey, let's give them nice cars! Hey, why not have them street luge? Let's show the girl's boobs! The character's motivations make no sense... The chin strap part is hilarious in itself.Set-design and costumes... Shamefully unrealistic. This movie makes the XFL look intelligent. The track set is so visually confusing that i could not follow the action at all. The costumes are a perfect demonstration of what happens when a designer is set loose. The helmets are accidents waiting to happen. Trust me, if i was playing Rollerball, i'd wear a helmet that actually protects me, not one that increases the risk of injury.This movie is an example of what happens when the producers don't follow a production. Of course the direction sucked, but it seems obvious to me that the whole production got out of control. It's like nobody checked what the various departments were doing...The only reason this movie is not worse than Battlefield Earth is the basis of the story line. This one vaguely makes sense, BE was pure bulls***t. Minus 10 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are with your friends wondering what to do on a weekend night, I suggest you go view a movie. Don't go view one of those crappy war movies like Black Hawk Down, you should go see a movie of originality and quality plot. Yes my friends I am talking about the one and only, Rollerball. If you like action and retards whizzing by on their rollerblades dressed like Mardi Gras circus goblins, then go see this movie! Ah yes it too has a great story line behind all of the great acting and stunts. Although the plot is hidden beneath a mesh woven skating parade of s***heads, it is quite an elaborate one. It starts off in a random point in time, with people street luging and some on motorcycles presumably in San Francisco. Why San Francisco you ask? Just think about what SF is best known for! Anyways, then it progresses to unknown countries and places with the starts of the team "red horsemen," despite having women on the team. Nothing really exciting happens but the tricky camera angles and techniques like "night mode" make this film outstanding in boldness and visual majesty. Watch out! You could be hit with the "Rollerball," or pushed over, or hit with a motorcycle in a very small arena painted like an elementary school mural. But I give this movie some credit; there are some major actors in this fecally produced movie, also some all right action scenes. There is only one thing that saved this movie from me burning the theatre down, and that was Paul Heyman. Commenting in the movie with numerous brilliant lines like, "was that supposed to happen?" and "that was a hit!" As you can see from these high quality and very intelligent words from his mouth, Paul Heyman is the savior and best actor in the thriller, "Rollerball."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rollerball starts with Jonathan Cross (Chris Klein) accepting his friend Marcus Ridley's (LL Cool J) invitation to become a pro rollerball player, a sport played across Central Asia which is some sort of cross between hockey, football &amp; skating. Jonathan joins Marcus's team &amp; initially things go well, he makes plenty of money, gets a hot car &amp; has good looking birds all over him. Nice work if you can get it I suppose, however everything isn't as perfect as Jonathan would like to think as the games promoter Alexis Petrovich (Jean Reno) is corrupt &amp; deliberately fixes the game so players will get hurt &amp; suffer injury in an attempt to boost global cable TV viewing figures. Jonathan finds out &amp; wants to quit but Jonathan is a big hit with the fans &amp; Petrovich won't let him just walk away...This American, German &amp; Japanese co-production was co-produced &amp; directed by John McTiernan &amp; is pretty darn bad even by recent Hollywood big budget remake standards. The script by Larry Ferguson &amp; John Pogue is based on the original Rollerball (1975) which I have not seen so I cannot compare the two although I find it difficult to believe that the '75 version was worse than this limp, lame, boring, repetitive mess of a film. For a start the sport of rollerball itself is never fully explained so we, the audience, lose interest in pretty much everything that happens during one of the games &amp; also everything that surrounds it. I just couldn't relate to the sport of rollerball, it never made any reasonable sense to me &amp; I consider myself a sports fan as I adore the football played in the English Premiership over here. I also seriously doubt that viewing figures would go up because participants are being injured or killed, I'm sorry but that assumption by the filmmakers is an insult to all proper sports fans which I cannot make any connection with. Sure we all like a bit of controversy or a bit of a punch up on the pitch &amp; a few red cards maybe but I can't believe any so-called sport where people are deliberately (or otherwise) hurt on a regular basis would be popular, I just can't &amp; therefore the story in Rollerball went straight over my head. The character's are poor, the dialogue rubbish &amp; I personally never cared for anyone or anything during it's 100 odd minute duration although to give it some credit it moves along at a good pace.Director McTiernan was giving us classic action films such as Predator (1987) &amp; Die Hard (1988) so it is rather sad to see him turn in such an awful film &amp; an awful film on many levels. The action scenes are filmed with quick cuts, shaky cameras &amp; with next to no regard for the audience watching this stuff, to be honest I couldn't make head nor tail of much of what was going on &amp; the action scenes just come off as a complete mess of blink &amp; you'll miss it imagery. Then there's the totally baffling decision to film a chase sequence with a grainy night vision camera, I sat there &amp; thought this could have been one of the better action scenes in the film but why shoot it in green tinted night vision? Bizarre. I almost must mention the truly dire soundtrack, the horrible music was both unnecessarily loud &amp; highly annoying, this was pretty headache inducing. The violence was really tame &amp; disappointing, there's barely a drop of blood, no decent fights or anything to get excited about.I was astounded to see that Rollerball had a supposed budget of about $70,000,000, wow that's a hell of a lot of money to make such a poor film. I have no idea where all the money went. The acting was predictably terrible as well, what on earth is a usually good actor like Jean Reno doing in this?Rollerball is a bad film, a really bad film. It's a 70 million dollar turkey of the highest order &amp; it making the IMDb's 'Bottom 100' is all you need to know. The only thing that appealed to me were the cool looking cars &amp; Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in tight fitting leather outfits, other than that Rollerball is one to be avoided.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because it's missing something. The biggest flaw is Chris Klein, he is the most bland actor that I have ever seen. How does a pretty boy like him survive in a bloody, winner take all game like Rollerball? More than that, he doesn't have the charisma to lead a movie. Adding to the problem is that there isn't enough going on in this movie aside from distracting night vision scenes. There isn't any of the social commentary that the original had or the tense action scenes, it fails on both fronts. The only solace is some of the cast: Jean Reno, Ice Cube, and Rebecca Romijn. Ice Cube would have made a better lead and a much more believable Rollerballer with his body. But, as is, This is mess that is best forgotten.</fullReview>

I certainly have seen a lot worse movies recently. The story is a little confusing to say the least, but the filming styles, action set pieces and general feel more than make up for it.It's not a great film by any means, but it is good! I would definitely watch it again (as I may understand the full story a little better). Chris Klein seems a little lost amongst it all and Jean Reno is definitely under used. Considering the reviews I had read, I expected some unwatchable trash, not a great escapism movie with some good music and great action. See it for yourself and make your own decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first Roller Ball seemed like a super-violent grudge and sports movie, and nothing more. Just violence, a little sex and no redeeming value. At times I thought it was designed to invoke rage for rage's sake, with the dreaded other. Well, I watched it to the end and I think it is worth watching. If you like heavy metal music, like tough sports and don't mind some violence you'll like the movieRoller Ball is a parable for much of modern life, from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan to professional sports. From police brutality to labor exploitation. Yes there is something more, it isn't pretty, its wonderful. It seems designed to reach an audience with a message that probably wouldn't be open to it otherwise. The audience that might most gravitate to the message, isn't the one that will watch the movie to the end because it is harsh. In its own way it might even be considered uplifting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, let me explain why I hate reviews. THEY ARE FREAKING OPINIONS! Dont let somebody else ruin what could be a good experience for you. I personally hate jackasses like Roger Ebert, because they brainwash people into hating movies before they see it. Example: When reviewers bashed Battlefield Earth and said that it would brainwash the audience into joining Scientology, everybody but about 10 people boycotted the movie, and 9 of the 10 who saw it, hated it. I was # 10.But this review is about Rollerball, an intense yet somewhat dull ride through a fake sport, that happens to be a remake of a horrible, boring, dull movie. This movie is a lot better then some of the other crap that has come out this year, like Spiderman. Another case of the reviewers brainwashing everybody. The movie got such great reviews, that we have wasted millions of dollars on the trash.A little tip for the future, what gets good reviews, will SUCK, what is said to be bad, is usually pretty enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilersI think the producers of Rollerball thought, like all producers at one time or another think, that because a previous film with a similar blueprint (The Fast And The Furious) was so successful, that all they would have to do is throw together some wannabe look-alike and they would cash in on the success of that film. And while FAF was not a great film, it wasn't bad either. True, it was all jacked up on adrenaline and contained little plot, it did have one thing going for it that Rollerball doesn't. Vin Diesel has charisma. There is just something about him. Charisma is either something you exude or you don't, there is really very little grey matter in this area. When Vin stretched out his massive arms and then turned them upside down to signal the commencement of a race, he had you. It was just a simple flick of the wrist but it worked. This is just one of the elements where Rollerball is lacking. Chris Klein has as much charisma as patient with a coma draped across the hospital gurney. He has a chiseled chin, cheeks that look like they were designed by Hoover and abs of steel, yet when he talks he sounds like he is wining. When he is mad, he looks as though he is auditioning for a spot on The Young and the Restless. And when he is sad he seems as though he is trying to stifle a laugh. He just doesn't have what it takes to pull of a film like this. And although he is one of the problems with the film, he is certainly not the only one nor is he the main culprit. That has to be the lack of what is called a plot.Black Hawk Down was basically the War Departments glorification of what happens on the battle field. It had all action and very little effort was given to the humanizing of the men who were in that war. Rollerball suffers from the same lack of integrity. This is just all action and nothing else. I am quite an ardent supporter of L.L Cool J as an actor. I think in many of his films he has come off as the best part of a weak film, but when he opens his mouth in this one he still comes off as insipid and dull. The script does not allow for anyone to develop into anything that remotely resembles a character, they are more like caricatures of what you might expect the Looney Tunes to produce for Saturday morning cartoons. I was just waiting for the Road Runner and the Coyote to appear in the Rollerball ring and for the cameras that filmed everything from every conceivable angle to have ACME written across the side of them.John McTiernan is a gifted film maker. He has given us some of the best action films of the 80's. Die Hard and Predator are the quintessential action films. They have loads of action and they are filled with colourful characters that you can love and hate. What he is doing behind the helm of a silly film like this is a little perplexing. Maybe there was more of a script than what we have seen here and maybe this is not McTiernan's fault because the action in the ring was quite well done. It's just that the rest of the film is nowhere to be found. It's fate rests on the side of a milk carton. 1 out of 10....Nothing to really like about this film</fullReview>

During this part of the movie, many people walked out of the theater.

		<fullReview>I must admit that I have never really liked Norman Jewison's "Rollerball" from 1975. The action scenes are fine, but they suffer from being placed in the context of a muddled and half-baked plot about life in a future dystopian society. Having now seen John McTiernan's 2002 remake, however, I can say that it is far worse even than the original. Whereas the first film was set in the future, about forty years after the date when it was made, the remake takes place in the present. The new sport of Rollerball has become hugely popular, especially, for some reason, in Central Asia. The rules of the game are much the same as in the original, with the main exception that it is now played between mixed-sex teams. (In the first film the sport was strictly for men only). Jonathan Cross, an up-and-coming young star of the sport, accepts a highly-paid contract to play for a team based in Kazakhstan.I won't go into great details of the plot, which is often muddled and confusing. The two main strands Jonathan's conflicts with the team's owner Alexei Petrovich and his romance with his female team mate Aurora. Jonathan discovers that Alexei is manipulating the game in order to make it more violent and thus boost its television ratings. It ends with Jonathan leading a revolution to topple Kazakhstan's ruling elite, of which Alexei is a part. Most of this plot, however, is simply a peg on which to hang the gory action scenes which are the main feature of the film. Unlike the original film, the social and political overtones are very much played down.In the original James Caan made a rather weak, inarticulate hero, whom I found difficult to imagine as a charismatic sportsman, but at least he was better than the wooden Chris Klein who plays the equivalent role here. Not that the rest of the cast are any better. Rebecca Romijn is, apparently, fond of telling people that her surname is pronounced "Romaine, as in the lettuce", which seems unfortunately inappropriate given that she here shows all the talent and charisma of a wet and soggy lump of that particular vegetable. She seemed a promising newcomer in "X-Men", but here she seems to be no more than the latest in a long line of supermodels who try their hand at acting on the assumption that their new profession will be no more intellectually taxing than walking down a catwalk. There is an equally long line of singers who have failed to shine when they have attempted to move into the cinema, and LL Cool J falls into this category. He also seems to have a gift for picking the wrong films; the last two I saw him in before "Rollerball" were "Woo" and "Charlie's Angels", both almost equally bad.McTiernan will never be accounted a great auteur, but his other films which I have seen, such as his contributions to the "Die Hard" series and "The Thomas Crown Affair" (also a remake of a Jewison film), are competently made and often enjoyable pieces of popular entertainment. The dreadful "Rollerball" is neither. If Jewison's film was half-baked, McTiernan's is not even quarter-baked. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 'Rollerball' Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J) and Johnathan Cross (Chris Klein) are recruited from America to play in the Asian Rollerball League. And fans love handsome Johnathan and his American ways. When Johnathan is in danger on the track, TV audiences are glued to their seats unable to turn the channel and the ratings shoot up. The Leagues owner Alex Petrovich (Jean Reno) decides to increase the ratings by putting Johnathan in harms way, "We're this close to getting an American cable deal", he says. His life in danger Johnathan decides to quit. The League decides losing their top attraction's not an option. They'll stop at nothing to get a cable deal. Finally, they decide, if they have to lose him they may as well lose him to an injury on the track.Rollerball 2002 provides an interesting 'behind the scenes' look at entertainment. An old Star Trek episode 'Bread and Circuses' did this. In the Star Trek episode, the crew visit a planet that televises gladiator contests similar to ones of ancient Rome, and members of the crew get forced into the Arena. A stage hand there sits at a control board with his hands over dials marked 'Cheers' and 'Boos' and he turns each dial at the appropriate moment.The original movie Rollerball is my favorite movie so I had to go see this remake. Rollerball (2002) doesn't follow the same storyline. The original has a very subtle, perhaps too subtle, plot revolving around 'Johnathan E' refusing to quit the sport. Here, 'Johnathan C' wants to quit but the League owners conspire to keep him playing. Both movies do a good job taking us someplace outside our regular world, both movies have insanely too much violence, both movies initially received bad reviews, and both movies remind me of the movie 'The Running Man', in that each uses violence to promote a message that seems to condemn violence. Rollerball 2002 specifically reminds me of the original story 'The Running Man' by Stephen King. The movie The Running Man stars Arnold Schwartzenegger. 'Paul Heyman', Big-Time Wrestling announcer, plays in Rollerball 2002, and the costumes are so silly my little niece would have a hard time admitting she likes this movie, and the story is a bit jumbled, however Rollerball 2002 is worth sitting thru till the end. Can Johnathan Cross survive Rollerball? Quite amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and Rollerball as directed by Norman Jewison with James Caan in the lead role was definitely one of them. But some brain-dead idiot at Fox decided "hey, let's update the story to appeal to a generation raised on Playstations, it'll make millions!". Unfortunately, doing this requires the removal of the bloodshed and mayhem that some would argue is necessary to deliver the poignant message contained in the original.LL Cool J and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos do the best they can with what is a lousy script, but they look embarrassed to be in a film with Chris Klein as the lead. And who can blame them? Those of us who are old enough to have seen the original Rollerball will remember its lead - James Caan, the guy who played Sonny Corleone in The Godfather. Not only was he capable of acting to a degree worthy of an Oscar (not that he got it), he is also large enough to make us believe in him as the star player in the most brutal game since the Colliseum was open for business. By comparison, Chris Klein looks like he should be playing tennis. The guy doesn't even look like he shaves regularly. A sport like Rollerball would just chew him up and spit him out.However, the most important thing with a film like Rollerball is the story, and that is where this new version fails in a big way. The original showed us a world where a singular conglomerate of corporations controls the entire world, and people do whatever they are told or risk the most unkind sort of censure. The game of Rollerball was created in an effort to demonstrate to the people that individual effort was futile, and thus enforce their desire to submit to an ant-like existence. Obviously, such subtleties are beyond the writers of this 2002 version, and they instead dissolve into an extreme display of banal, pointless violence. Which would have been fine except a studio executive leaned over the director's shoulder and said "What the hell are you doing? You'll alienate the 13-18 year olds!". So blood was digitally cleaned out in post-production and the film itself was hacked apart with a meat cleaver, which is glaringly obvious even in the R-rated cut of the film. Why is America still putting up with the MPAA? Films like Rollerball do not even get a restrictive rating in Australia, which just goes to show how far behind the American system has fallen.However, what I can't get over is how the ending of the film is accompanied by the chanting of Jonathan's name. In the original version, this makes perfect sense because not only is the game designed to demonstrate how futile individual effort is, the corporations that run it are adamant that no one person is allowed to become "bigger than the game". The end of Rollerball circa 1975 showed that the people had regained some semblance of their humanity, vicariously through Jonathan E. The ending of Rollerball circa 2002, with the spectators mostly running out into the parking lot, overturning cars, and killing one another, only demonstrates that nothing has changed and no one has been saved, to quote the song.And in the end, that sums up the whole 2002 effort. It is a film with no meaning, no message, and ultimately no point. If it was intended to be a story about the most extreme of extreme sports, it missed the mark by trying to appeal to everyone. If it was intended to be a commentary about people's willingness to trade their humanity for the promise of riches, then it failed miserably by failing to give most of the principal characters anything other than a rudimentary personality. In the end, the project should have simply been shelved and forgotten. The original film will still be talked about long after this rehash is permanently forgotten.Oh, and for those who are wondering, no it wouldn't have made it into the bottom 100 if it didn't have the 1975 film to be compared to. It cannot even stand on its own two feet in terms of suckiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the original and then watching the remake of Rollerball I can honestly say that this movie seemed to be far superior to the original.This movie flowed a lot better with it's storyline than Jewison's version. I felt his movie focused far too much on character development. In parts to the point of being boring.However, this movie was a refreshing take on a cult classic. It had a stronger plot and the action sequences were great. Sure the acting wasn't Oscar material, but hey it's Rollerball. You're not renting it for the acting!I'm sure back in the day the original was great, but in modern times....skip the original and watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relentless action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was never going to be a commercial success and I'm sure Jonh McTiernan knew about it. Too relentlessly negative and violent. Watching it, one feels like Alex in Clockwork Orange, sitting in a cinema with our eyes forced open, gore on the screen, so much gore that it makes us sick. With this, McTiernan takes the action film to an extreme that I can't recall in any other film, certainly in no American film. It's no wonder it flopped, and it's no wonder preview audiences hated it. Regular blockbuster audiences like their action to be slick. They don't like to be made to feel its consequences. And in this, McTiernan makes us conscious of the pain, and more importantly of our prosaic enjoyment of this pain, as attested by the recurring images of the roaring spectators in the arena and by the rise in TV ratings whenever there is some extra violence on the field.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst editing of the year is just the first of many flaws in Rollerball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wright, who edited this movie, is not entirely responsible for the all too jumbled excuse to call Rollerball (a remake of an already bad movie from 1975). McTiernan, who made good action movies once (Die Hard and Die Hard 3 come to mind), took too many people's opinions in mind in the process of test screening this, I suppose, and the final product after it's original date being pushed is not pretty. Even the most strident of action film fans who admire the worst trash will have to admit there is just something wrong with this picture. Wrong casting (why put Klein, who looks like he hasn't shaved his entire life and has that stupid romance novel face that only really worked for him in American Pie, in a film such as this? Plus, Paul Heyman is pretty much history as far as wrestling TV is concerned and this isn't about to resurrect his career much at all), wrong camera work, and a really wrong script make a wrong movie. Period. Only thing not making it a complete failure is a few funny lines (not intentionally) provided by Reno. D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fanboys, enough already! Its a really good action flick...This is where the fan boys get stuck at, "oh no! not a remake of my favorite movie of all time!". Does that mean the "favorite of all time" always makes the remake the "worse of all time", i say no, not at all. So don't be fooled by all the negative comments by those fan boys, because it doesn't give justice to this very well done, fast pace action pack movie.OK, i have to admit i'm a fan of the original and thats what attracted me to see this movie. Although at first i was a bit shocked by the flagrant differences with the original, i've then decided to let that fact go and just let the movie drive me, and you know what, it did his job, which is to entertain me. Yes, the plot, if we can called it that, is somewhat nonexistent, and the script doesn't deliver any memorable moments, because it was intended that way, its typical with all action flicks. I was happy i give this movie a chance with an open mind(keep in mind its an action flick though). Considering all the facts, my final note: 6.5 In conclusion, i hope you'll give this movie a chance, just forget about the original, watch it purely for the action and you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rollerball needs to be steamrolled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So here it is then; the remake of a popular sci-fi film from the seventies that has a powerful, maybe political message of some sort. What the remake has going for it is that John McTiernan is directing it and it stars Jean Reno. It should be good, right? Wrong.What Rollerball is; is an absolute mess of colour, visuals, loud unnecessary rock music and atrocious plot devices. The bulk of these things are on show in the opening half an hour but first, the film hangs around a risky sport involving skateboarding down the sloped roads of San Francisco, risking life and limb for no apparent reason. Jonathan (Klein) likes his kicks and is convinced by a mentor/future team mate to travel to Kazakhstan to take up 'Rollerball'. Then we get to the conventions mentioned earlier. Up until the first Rollerball game starts, I was intrigued but then; any hopes of a film with half a brain cell completely evaporates when the mess that is the actual sport the film revolves around is introduced. Rollerball is, to me, a mix of Wrestling WWE style and Ice Hockey as the point is to score goals but to give the opposition team members a bit of a kick and a punch, pointlessly, along the way. Oh, by the way: for some reason motorbikes are allowed as well. Don't ask.There is a brief 'attempt' at the rules being explained but the American commentator does his best in screaming the point of the whole thing down a microphone in a fashion that is both quick and confusing. The bottom line is that even the writers, I don't think, knew what the rules were. What constitutes as a foul? Why don't the other team members attempt to block the goal attempts? And why the hell are motorbikes involved!? In fact, most things the players shout during the matches are quick and inaudible anyway.This brings me onto the players/actors. Reno's accent goes from Eastern European to French and then back again a few times and the lead shares some kind of relationship with a character named Aurora that has absolutely no build up what-so-ever. It's funny, because you don't see the love interest coming but at the same time: you do, if you know what I mean.Towards the end, the television ratings soar due to controversy and planned violence in the sport. The feeling of greed from the characters whom may as well hold up signs saying: 'we are bad guys' as they sit in their V.I.P. boxes dressed in suits and ties, is forced down our throats through the images in insanely narrow minded fashion. This is bad enough but then the players start having second thoughts and make plans of their own. What follows is, arguably, the most ridiculous idea for film content ever conceived: a ten minute chase sequence shot in night vision(!) Was there any need? Couldn't they be bothered to set up the lights since it was at night? Probably.With other laughable things Rollerball contains such as random cutaways to musical performances from rock bands as well as needless jump cuts and cheesy looking Eastern European TV footage; all of which are utterly pointless and given how long the film is, are probably just in there to bulk up the time. How sad.Rollerball is not worth the time but if you are going to watch it I can only recommend you do so just to see how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the movie's start, several skateboarders ride down a long hill lying down. It's not that dangerous out in the country, but when they reach the city, they must deal with traffic--including truckers who must honk their horns before they narrowly miss these daredevils! One of the skateboarders is Jonathan Cross, who had a chance to be the NHL's no. 1 draft pick. Instead, he goes to the former Soviet Union to participate in "a real man's sport".Rollerball works this way: male and female skaters and motorcyclists travel around a figure-8 track with ramps and a "rabbit hole" in the middle. Points are scored by hitting one of several bowl-shaped goals above the track with a ball--hard enough to make a bell ring.There is a lot of corruption in this sport. People bet on it as if they were betting on horses in this country. And TV ratings can be seen instantly--I haven't seen this since "Max Headroom". Ratings go up if a player gets hurt. And this is a very violent sport. The players look the other way instead of concerning themselves with the ethics. After all, the money is great, and people who try to buck the system disappear.I'm not really a fan of movies like this, but I thought LL Cool J was good, and Rebecca Romijn was beautiful, despite her scar. She also did a good job; I wouldn't have known her because of the dark hair and the accent. Both played members of Jonathan's team.The standout performers, though, were Paul Heyman as the English-language TV announcer and Jean Reno as the man who owned the team, the coal mine, the supermarkets ...I also thought it was interesting to go behind the scenes. The men in suits got so excited. And an Asian announcer had about as much energy as his English counterpart. Fans of Metallica and other hard rock will probably enjoy the background music for the games, provided by live bands. I was going to say the band in Mongolia or Siberia or wherever it was made Metallica look like The Spice Girls--but then I remembered Metallica used to rock even harder than those guys.This seems like it would appeal to fans of "The Fast and the Furious" as well as pro "wrestling". In addition to the skateboard scene, there were plenty of exciting chases involving cars, trucks, even an airplane. And of course the action on the track. One nighttime chase scene was filmed entirely in green, so some sort of night vision technology must have been involved. I will say it was pretty.What can I say? My taste in movies is obviously like 98.7 Simon on the radio--I'll watch anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't find this 2002 remake of the 1975 James Caan movie as deplorable as all the other so-called critics. In fact I found it very entertaining as an action movie. The photography and visual effects were outstanding. And talk about stunts. It takes impeccable timing to pull off the spectacular stunts called for in this dog eat dog blood sport. My hat's off to those that designed, supervised and executed the action. A special mention goes to Rick Miller who did Chris Klein's stunt skating.Written by William Harrison, who also penned the original, and directed by John McTiernan, the DIE HARD director and HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, this flick is a decent remake. Heading the cast is Chris Klein, who seems to be taking a bad rap from other critics. I found him quite appealing and certainly a handsome dude. He carries the film. Action films don't always give their leading men any quality moments. Most of the time is spent carrying out the action required, Klein does bring what he can to make his hero believable. He is joined by Rebecca Stamos as the female lead, another team member in the rollerball game. Together they spark up the screen. LL Cool J plays the "best friend" and Jean Reno does and admirable job getting you to hiss and boo his villain.I enjoyed this movie. Hats off to Klein, Stamos and Reno for a good job. Poo poo to the other critics.</fullReview>

No lingering on extraneous backstory or exposition. The "corporate" message from the original is solidly packed into a screamin' 90 minutes.Any holes? Who the hell knows? There isn't time to consider any before you're swept off into the next awesome sequence. Anyone who doesn't like this can go rent THE PIANO and save the seats for the rest of us.</fullReview>

Also it isn't unfair to say that Jean Reno delivers such a performance it rivals his own performance in LeonWithout giving too much away i have to say Bravo to the person who came up with the night vision scenes, they successfully envisaged scenes of the futuristic world in 2005Finalyy ...

		<fullReview>No matter what others say but i managed to view both the versions of the movie, no wonder old one is a good one but other version is a great one. I am an action junkie so what i believe that this movie has more action than the older one and has a correct story line than the old one since the character of Jonathan never wanted to retire in the first one but in this one he becomes a part of a gambling ring from which he wants to be free. I believe that this movie has a great action sequences than older ones especially black widow which the first movie lacks a lot. I recommend watching this movie first and go for the other before making any judgment.Thanks</fullReview>

Rollerball is a much better movie than most people would give it credit.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and found it to be a great piece of escapism. The only let down in the movie was the confusing story line which was far too complex at times. However, at the heart of it is a well crafted and filmed story which does not seem to be as far fetched as the original Rollerball seemed to be upon its release.This re-make is a far more human version of the story and far less idealistic with its core meaning. If you enjoy sci-fi and action - go see it! Ignore what you have heard!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I know most will think I am nuts for rating this movie so high but I will give my reasons why I don't think this movie belongs in the bottom 100 list. First the action of the game is cool and probably harder then anything most people can do. Second it still shows the typical elements you look for in a sports/action movie and wasn't so dreadful like some people make it out to be. My final reason is a personal preference. The American broadcaster was played by Paul Heyman. For you non-wrestling fans he use to run a company that many say is one of the greatest of all time and that is ECW. He used his famous manager character and made me enjoy the movie when I first saw it and hated it like many others. It takes more then one viewing before I got a good feeling about the movie. Thats just my 2 cents.</fullReview>
