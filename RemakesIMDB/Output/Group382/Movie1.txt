		<shortDescription>As remote from the average film-goer's awareness as 2001: A Space Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In deference to Stanley Kubrick himself and the wondrous achievement that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is, was and forever will be, I do not speak of ROLLERBALL in the same breath. Having said that however, here is a film that although lacking the scope, budget and monumental depth of its compatriot, is a totally brilliant piece of film-making, equally awesome in its implications and social comment. Norman Jewison created a masterpiece with Rollerball - understated, misunderstood and undervalued both at the time of its release and later. Perhaps ultimately to its its greatest benefit - the release of the plebeian 2002 re-make which will stand for all time as the most nauseatingly insulting and tastelessly gratuitous reminder to recall the original with perhaps more relish than might otherwise have been the case. No purpose in re-hashing the plot - anyone reading this will already know it. Suffice to say, James Caan's Jonathan E stood for that most basic of human principles - the rights of the individual! As John Houseman, the corrupt and ubiquitous head of the all-powerful Corporation that owns and operates ROLLERBALL inc worldwide, tells Jonathan at one point, "Rollerball was meant to demonstrate the futility of resistance, no man was ever intended to become bigger than the game." This was a society (set in 2018) with media censorship in place to such a degree a centralised computer stores the worlds' entire literary knowledge (physical books being a thing of the past as in FAHRENHEIT 451. Marvellous interspliced sequence with Sir Michael Redgrave as keeper of the world's centralized computer to which Jonathan is drawn, seeking answers to questions he was never supposed to ask. You have to really watch and LISTEN to ROLLERBALL to EXTRICATE from it, what the makers are offering you in terms of reflective contemplation. So many saw the film's middle section as "boring!" So is looking at the sky if you have no knowledge of cloud formation, atmospheric beauty or even indeed WHY there IS a sky and what it means in the grand scale of things! Caan's gradual self discovery as to his own identity and purpose is hand-crafted for you during these middle scenes - THIS is what the film is about..not merely the superb action sequences which are so richly photographed and presented in that gladiatorial arena, a colosseum for the new millennium, no more no less! The highlight of the film, if you are able to see it, is the party for Jonathan E, supposedly to mark his resignation but which in fact might be seen as the Energy Corporation's Last Supper! The scenes of the amphetamine-fed yuppies, destroying the trees with the flame-gun has always made me cry, not because I'm a wimp, a greenie or even an anti lobbyist for hand guns, but because of what those terrible scenes stand for and bring to my own emotional recognition...a directionless society that we are right now so unerringly headed for. Look at the expression on the face of Jonathan's ex-wife as she comes to realise where its all gone wrong - not just for herself but for them all. Now tell me this is boring!!!! As has been recognised by some fellow critics, the absolute last scenes of the movie are perhaps the greatest. The point being less subtly made as we see Houseman staring through the glass at Jonathan E, the last man standing, his corporate outline encircled by the reflected flames on the track - hello? does anyone understand this? One of the greats! Watch this film...don't just see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rollerball is another of those great 70's cult sci-fi films. It features a great cast of actors and a smart script. It was notorious at the time for its violence, although that was greatly exaggerated in comparison to some professional sports and entertainment. It features a futuristic reimagining of the Roman Empire, with gladiatorial games to distract the populace from their bleak existence. It also predates cyberpunk literature, with ts depiction of a world controlled by powerful conglomerates, a world not too different from the present one.James Caan is fantastic as Johnathan E, the Michael Jordan of Rollerball. He continues to succeed in a sport designed to show the futility of individual effort. The sport is constantly changed to stop him, yet he continues to overcome every obstacle.John Housman is electrifying as the head of the Energy Corporation, owners of the Houston Team. He has conspired with his peers to keep the masses down and use this sport to both distract them and show them that the individual can't succeed. He grows more desperate as Johnathan E defeats his schemes. He tries every trick without success.The supporting cast is filled with great actors, like Moses Gunn, John Beck, Sir Ralph Richardson (not John Gielgud, as one reviewer stated), Maude Adams, and Shane Rimmer.The film demonstrates that the individual can triumph over insurmountable odds and cautions against corporate control of society. It uses both allegory and speculation beautifully, and packages it with thrilling action. The remake was destined for failure because it couldn't see beyond the action. The action was only window dressing for the greater themes. If only more recent sci-fi films were this thought-provoking, or other films for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original and still the best of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a classic. A brilliant adaptation of the future and that is way better than the updated version that John McTiernan released which to this day cannot hold a candle to this science fiction masterpiece that was released in 1975. The year 1975 brought out some of the best movies of that year and some to this day still holds its own. From "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest",to "Jaws","Shampoo",the rock musicals "Tommy",and "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" to the performances of "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" to "Dog Day Afternoon",and not to mention "Nashville" and the sequel "French Connection II",and "The Eiger Sanction",these films represented what a year it was in motion pictures especially in the year 1975.The film "Rollerball"(United Artists,1975),was screenplay by William Harrison and directed by Norman Jewison,who was Oscar nominated for his brilliant direction in such films,"In The Heat Of The Night",and the musical "Fiddler On The Roof",is no stranger to science fiction material. The film is set in the year 2018 where there are no wars and no crime,but there is only....the Game. In a world where corporations rule and no one asks questions-the vicious and barbaric sport of Rollerball satisfies the violent impulses of the masses. Tuned to their televisions,the people watch the sport of the future which is a brutal mutation of football,the Romanesque gladiator fighting,motorcross and hockey. Jonathan E.(played brilliantly by James Caan) is the champion Rollerball player-a man too good for his own good. The corporation has taken away the woman he loves(Maud Adams),but they won't take away his soul even if the diabolical corporate head(John Houseman)tells him he'd better retire..or suffer the old-fashioned way.With some surrealistic imagery,Orwellian theme,and tense action with some of the best action sequences ever filmed,this picture will grip you from the moment the ball rolling out and zooms into the stadium to its chilling cilmax,this movie has haunted audiences as it takes a look into the future and what the future would become,and has a stunning effect. James Caan's performance is something to marvel at and John Houseman's performance as the diabolical corporate executive is a chilling and stalking cold and with some of the strong support from its cast including John Beck,Moses Gunn,and Ralph Richardson.The 1975 version is worth seeing..it is the original and still the best of its genre...Don't even bother with the 2002 version with was directed by John McTiernan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controlling the beast within</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why some people have called this film shallow, I will never understand, considering it focuses on character more than most all sci-fi films, especially those action ones made today. Not surprisingly, the recent remake dwelt more on action than character, and perhaps it's significant that director Norman Jewison normally avoids making science-fiction films. Also, I personally don't interpret ROLLERBALL as an anti-sport drama. It doesn't attack sports per se as much as violence. In his audio commentary to the DVD, Jewison, like many Canadians, admits he's a hockey fan, and once, while witnessing a game get bloodily out of hand, he was inspired to adapt Harrison's marvelous short story. All in all, I think of the movie as a plea for all of us to find our own basic humanity (and those who say the film lacks humanity really baffle me). In our present competitive world, where the U.S. speed limit is 65 MPH but everyone drives 75 or faster, this motion picture reminds us to control the anarchistic, power-driven beast within. To offer one example, in its final scene, Jonathan E is about to murder the last opposing team player...but relents. If the film were truly anti-sport,then I think Jonathan would drop the ball and leave; he would mock the game as Mandy Patinkin's character does hockey at the end of SLAPSHOT. Instead, Jonathan E still plays it: he baskets the ball to earn his point because, though he may have touched his humanity, he still retains the drive to win and the thrill of the game. Unlike other--often more sentimental and simple-minded--anti-sports dramas, ROLLERBALL represents the positive aspects of sports (such as ethical aspiration, etc.), while at the same time its negative aspects (such as triumphalist violence, etc.). Afterwards, as the crowd roars, the film might have concluded with a standard, comforting triumph-of-the-human-spirit message, but instead it freezes on a deliberately distorted shot of Jonathan with Bach's portentious music indicating what awaits. Yes, he may be a winner today, but in this world, where the corporation is everything and the individual nothing, his future is dim indeed. A shallow film? Nonsense! I think this movie taps into ones humanity more than most of the sentimental tripe hyped as significant drama these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action Classic With Brains!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on HBO at the age of 14 and I sensed immediately that it was a classic, a combination of action, sports, sex, and social commentary. All the years of viewing other films have only made me more and more appreciative of this movie's many strengths.On one level, I believe this is the best sports movie ever made. It is miles ahead of more "realistic" films like NORTH DALLAS FORTY or SEMI TOUGH or even critical favorites like COBB and EIGHT MEN OUT. The very fact that Rollerball is a make believe sport adds believability to the action sequences. Watch a baseball film and you can see at a glance that Robert Redford or Kevin Costner are not real athletes. But since rollerball has never been played, James Caan as Jonathan E really looks like the best in the game. There are no "clichés" like home runs or long passes to spoil the danger and excitement -- every crash and goal is new, never having been seen before. And there are no clichés about the fans, the athletes, or "win one for the Gipper" or gamblers or shady ladies trying to make Our Hero throw the game. From the beginning we sense the stakes are higher -- Jonathan E will either conform or die.That brings up the fact that ROLLERBALL also shares a central theme with a lot of other powerful movies, like FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, COOL HAND Luke, and even A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS. What happens when a uniquely gifted individual refuses to participate in a corrupt system? This movie is so powerful as a drama you hardly notice the sci fi trappings. The rugged action scenes are so real you hardly notice that rollerball is a make believe game.James Caan as Jonathan E turns in a sensitive, nuanced performance, deliberately underplaying the tough guy side as much as possible. Michael Beck as Moonpie is the foolishly overconfident one, playing Frank Sinatra's Maggio to Caan's Robert E. Lee Pruitt. But unlike the hard luck privates in this man's army, these rollerball stars get to have glamor, luxury, and unlimited sex between vicious games of rollerball. The movie captures so much sensuality and glamor that you can see why men risk death game after game to be known as "great rollerballers who bash in faces." This movie is spectacular -- an action classic with brains!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated 70's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie presents a dark, disturbing look at a possible future. The movie portrays a cold, sterile society where humanity is generally absent. Corporations run the world and the global pasttime is a violent sport reminisent of the Roman Coliseum. The rollerball scenes, which get more and more violent as the film progresses, are disturbing enough. Equally disturbing is a scene where a group of drunk partygoers blow up trees with some sort of gun. The citizens of this future society are really lacking feeling and humanity. Despite the film's dated look, it's still a future that seems quite possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't watch it, you can only re-watch it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that demands repeat viewing. When I was a kid, my brothers and I used to just fast-forward all the slow, `talkie' scenes to get to the action. We couldn't understand why the whole film wasn't just composed of game sequences (a criticism also leveled by at least one reviewer on this site).Now, having just watched the movie twice in a night, the second time with the director's commentary, I have finally got to grips with the scenes between the action, and discovered that I like it more than ever. The view of the future is not highly original; tipping its hat to the stratified societies foreseen by Orwell and Huxley, amongst others; but nevertheless the portrayal is engaging. Jewison astutely realised that only by filling in the image of the future society, the characters, and the political background against which the tournament unfolds, would the game be seen as truly REAL for the characters. In the meanwhile, he also has the chance to build suspense, upping the stakes for both the heroic gladiator/combateur Jonathon, and his would-be puppet master Bartholemew. In this way, when we come to watch the actual contests, our enthusiasm is whetted, and by making the rules progressively more dangerous with each passing game, the stakes grow ever higher.The central themes of the movie are (i) loss-of-soul/nihilism/sensual-vs-spiritual-happiness, and (ii) individuality vs state control. Perhaps the best scenes elucidating these themes are the famous `tree killing' scene, and the conversation between Jonathon and Ella in the forest. The use of imagery and metaphor is widespread; I will mention only the terrific concept of the roulette wheel as game arena, with the players INSIDE, instead of outside; and the Circus Maximus parallel. You may draw many interesting conclusions from this about the director's and writer's intent.My final word is: watch it once, soak up the action, and be bored by the rest. Then view it again, feel yourself in Jonathon's dilemma, experience his wrenching disappointment with the people in his life who betray him, and try to tear yourself away if you can as he is pushed inexorably to his fate in the arena of ROLLERBALL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated Look But Top-Notch Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rollerball" is one of those classics of sci-fi that I somehow managed to miss for all of my 30 years. Whilst browsing the local store, I found the DVD for ten dollars and figured I had nothing to lose -- to rent it, if I could even find it on DVD, wouldn't cost THAT much less.I had some vague notion of the storyline, but I tried not to read the case or liner notes and take in the movie on a first impression. Released in the summer of 1975, there are definite and readily apparent influences of earlier films, not the least of which being Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange." The colors, the film stock, the editing style are all reminiscent of that earlier, similarly-themed master work, yet I don't believe it detracted from this film at all.Supposedly set in the year 2018 (though this is never established in the movie, that I could tell), corporations have replaced governments and managed to eliminate war, poverty, disease and bad hair days. People don't have too much of a say in what goes on around them, but they're all very physically comfortable. Of course, the violent nature of the human beast must be satisfied, and it is -- in the gladitorial ring of the world's most popular sport, Rollerball. The game consists of two teams (from cities all over the world) skating and motorbiking around a 1/8-mile track, trying to get a steel ball into a goal. As the course of the season progresses, more and more limitations as to what constitutes fair play are removed, and by the final, the melee is total.James Caan plays the Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and Joe Montana of Rollerball, Jonathan E.. He's the biggest star in the world, but he's also a thinking man, and when the corporation which owns his team wants him to retire, he refuses, wanting to know first why they'd want him to retire when he's playing at his best.The rest I leave to the viewer to find out. I can only say it is a very well-crafted script with plenty to say about violence, the spirit of the individual man, and the bloodlusts that a happy and idle populace can muster. Very well-filmed with touches of brilliance in editing and framing.A detraction which really couldn't be helped involves the portrayal of the future. Director Norman Jewison couldn't know what the world of forty years in his future would be like, so he took the wise route of not making it all that different from 1975, but with subtle changes (such as the interesting but impractical "multivision" concept in which all TV sets have a large screen and three smaller screens above it, each showing different but related pictures). The result, though infinitely preferable to lots of neon and superfluous antennae, is that the place looks like 1975 with slightly cooler gadgets. I can't tell you what 2018 will look like, but it won't look like that.Interestingly, the "corporate inevitability" concept of the future, which I believe Jewison meant earnestly, plays out much more as a satire of the opposite, a communist world. Much of what the coroprate culture says, as personified by John Houseman's Mr. Bartholomew, sounds much like the rhetoric of communism -- people are fed and comfortable and happy, but the individual is beholden to the group at all costs. Indeed, some of the words of description of the culture seem lifted straight from Marx and Engels.The DVD leaves something to be desired, though. The picture is a lot dirtier than I'd like, especially in still-shot scenes. The color is muted, though this may be part style, and some shots seem positively muddy.The remastered 5.1 soundtrack is a disappointment. The rear speakers get very little play. One particular effect of note, I must concede, is one moment when you can hear the ball roll all the way around the arena, and it's as though you're standing in the center.In all, it's an excellent movie, which I can't recommend enough, but if the disc had been any pricier than it was, I would have felt as though I was somewhat taken. Perhaps after the release of the upcoming remake, there will be a better special edition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is the don/Ubermensch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought id right this as some other comment said it was disappointing, and i had to put them straight.This is a flawed masterpiece, yes. But still a masterpiece. The slow bits that other commentators point out are in contrast to the super fast game scenes. And what a Dirty Little Game it is.But hey thats life, I think this ranks up there with 1984, as one of the few films that realistically depicts life as it really is.I think the strength and ultimately the weakness of this film is the simplicity it achieves. Strength, as usually a film with this sort of scope becomes rather convoluted and philosophical; but this film uses some visually stunning symbols and very little dialogue - remember those fools who say that there is no depth of character, this film is based in the world of "the last man", where everyone is a weak victim of the state, they don't have any depth of characture. Thats the point, the state has achieved its ideal.Its weekness, as people don't get this film (people generally don't get many films), as in the case of Donnie Darko, but DD is so obviously complicated people think that they are missing something. With this film blink and you miss it - its so simple people don't see its masterful and sublime use of symbols. Also you get the feeling the directer thought his film would be banned for glorifying violence, so he made a special effort to hammer his point home(take the losing an epoch scene). And at worst think its some film about violence. I first saw this film when i was 14, and it opened up my eyes to the use of symbols and structures in films. Watch it, it changed the way i view films and life.Not an exaggeration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming out as it did right after the Vietnam War ended, it seems that "Rollerball" accurately reflected the sense of cynicism - inherent in the idea of dystopia - that had taken over the country. It portrays a corporate future in which the only entertainment is an ultra-violent sport called Rollerball. The thugs who have taken over are able to use this sport not only to control their players, but also to control the population. But one player, Jonathan E. (James Caan), is seeking to change all that...Aside from looking at the use of violence for entertainment, "Rollerball" also employs some interesting camera angles (mainly in the zooms). Apparently, director Norman Jewison got part of the inspiration from "A Clockwork Orange"; you can certainly see it here. A great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charismatic Authority Will Defeat The Corporate Slime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:My header is from the greatest sociologist who ever lived: Max Weber. To quote him, let us shine some verstehen upon this film. Weber was quite worried about the rise of rational authority especially paired with scientific business methodology he was sure it would lead to the "iron cage of rational authority." It is obvious that Jewison had read lots of Weber. This was before the modern age of basing all of our films upon comic books. See, decades ago people actually read books; I know, how quaint!! The film will now be completely understandable to you. The game is designed to show the futility of individual effort; Bartholomew states this to the other corporate slime. They fear Joanathan E because he embodies the only weapon Weber said could wipe out the iron cage of rational authority that is charismatic authority. This is why they are terrified of him. He has survived for ten years in a game that was designed to destroy individual players while promoting collectivism. They all rise for the corporate anthem; they love to watch Rollerball and blow up trees to relieve the awareness that they are all slaves. They traded their freedom for security. In the words of Benjamin Franklin: "Those who trade freedom for security deserve neither." That is why the game is so gory and cruel. The same reason the drunken idiots shoot and blow up trees; they are such pathetic, impotent slaves cowardly obeying whatever orders are given. They sold their freedom for comfort and their minds are so wasted away that we have Maud Adams looking incredulously at Jonathan,"Why, comfort and freedom are the same, they always have been." Did everyone notice how all access to books is now gone everything is on computer in edited editions? Starting to worry you perhaps a bit? You know that instrument of divinity, the computer, you worship well look what good use it was put to here. Yes, Zero, the supercomputer that Ralph Richardson exasperatedly starts beating up, that is what truth you will get from the computer: ZERO.Jonathan must be stopped for these slaves must never realize that an individual can say no. This is how it starts. One individual says no; he starts thousands, then millions saying no. Charismatic Authority, Weber said, was the only escape from the iron cage of the corporate slime. The movie moves well; it is expectedly violent but quite tame from the debauchery of films made 40 years later. I subtracted two points for some bad acting. Caan and Houseman are excellent actors. The supporting cast has some real weak spots. Moonpie, also seen in NORTH DALLAS FORTY, is a dreadful actor. Maud Adams, while very beautiful, shows why she should have staid in the Bond movies. The action scenes are well done and exciting. The scenes with Houseman and Caan together are worth the price of admission. James Caan, unlike his dreadful, midget son, was one of the greatest actors of the 1970s. Nobody else could have been Sonny in THE GODFATHER. He also shines in the only good film by Michael Mann: THIEF. I recommend the film apart from my analysis; it moves well, has excellent action scenes and some great acting, directing and writing. I am not a fan of Norman Jewison: I hated MOONSTRUCK, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR and AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. This is the best movie the man ever made. It has a depth far beyond the action narrative; it is obvious to me the man read and was fluent in Max Weber. Ask anyone who knows their sociology, Max Weber is considered the greatest sociologist who ever lived. His ideas were well displayed with great power and skill. A Great Movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Action Scenes Are Good But The Message Is Heavy Handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2018 corporate capitalism has abolished war , sickness and poverty and the masses of the human race watch Rollerball a violent sport . The world's greatest star of the sport Jonathan E finds himself being manipulated by a global corporate company Believe it or not after THE GODFATHER films were released it wasn't Pacino or DeNiro who was going to be the biggest star from the films but James Caan . As ridiculous as it may seem now you can understand that his manly , rugged all American physical features would be ready made for New Hollywood unlike the somewhat ethnic background of Pacino and DeNiro . As it turned those two Italian Americans became two of the greatest actors of their generation while Caan quickly disappeared in obscure forgotten films like FREEBIE AND THE BEAN and THE KILLER ELITE . This film by Norman Jewison ROLLERBALL was probably Caan's career highlight ROLLERBALL is another dystopian science fiction film popular from the period where the future vision of humanity has seen the upside where war , illness and poverty has been eradicated . The downside is that with it individuality and democracy has effectively become a thing of the past too and world is ruled not by democratically elected governments but by corporate companies who control the population by giving them what they want but on the corporate terms This is a persuasive idea and one that's not really exaggerated . George Orwell described sport as " War without the shooting " and as someone who grew up in the west of Scotland I can testify that most peoples obsession revolves around two football clubs Rangers and Celtic who attract a lot of sectarian pond life and there's a blackly comical joke that there's only six letters in the West of Scotland alphabet - IRA and UVF , so the idea of corporate companies controlling the masses wasn't a ridiculous idea when this film was made The problem is that the message is a bit too heavy handed to be entirely credible . It's true that people belong to tribes and this never truer than where sport is concerned but you have to think why would a sport like Rollerball make headway in to Europe or South America where football or soccer as it is known in America be the world's most popular game . Likewise would Rollerball be popular in the third world like Africa or Asia or any failed state ? The more you think about the premise collapses that the concept of war and poverty has been abolished Where the film works best is the scenes of the game itself . I'm not entirely sure what the rules of the game are but it's certainly an exciting sport that might best be described as " carnage porn " . Director Jewison tries hard to make the game scenes spontaneous via the use of editing and sound mix and probably tries a bit too hard to make it appear spontaneous but the action scenes are exciting and it's this that makes the film a success . Compare it to the wimpish remake from ten years ago to see what I mean</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do Bach, Princess Ardala and Fiddler on the Roof have in common?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance you'd never guess the same director who did the wonderfully charming "Fiddler on the Roof" would turn around 2 years later and do the dark, dystopian chiller "Rollerball". But he did.But in both films, we see the same powerful strategy: a complex, philosophical brain-twister beneath a deceptivly simple exterior. "Fiddler on the Roof" was seemingly a linear story about a struggling Jewish family's good &amp; bad times. But the real meat of the story was about the conflict between old ways and new (tradition vs. progress). Here in "Rollerball" we have another seemingly linear story about an athlete in a violent, futuristic sport. But the real meat is the conflict of brutal human nature vs. suppression (again, a sort of "tradition vs. progress"). As with "Fiddler on the Roof", director Norm Jewison doesn't hit us over the head with any preachy sermon but instead leaves us to digest the situation."Rollerball" has the same powerful, brooding quality that we see in many of the 70s scifi masterpieces, like "THX 1138", "Soylent Green", "Planet of the Apes", "Blade Runner" (yeah I know that one was 1982), and the one that started them all, "2001: A Space Odyssey". Cold, sterile sets, disturbing situations and powerful use of silence characterize these films. By today's standards they might be considered slow, but depending on how you like your scifi, that might be right up your alley.In a nutshell, the story is about a futuristic society that has largely done away with civilian violence. It has done this by "subsidizing" violence by way of a global pasttime: a hyper-violent sport called Rollerball. Note: as a parallel story, we learn that cut-throat corporate competition has been similarly squelched by the government creating monopolies. And thus society finds peace. Or does it? You can probably see the brilliant metaphors being woven here. This isn't an ordinary scifi romp, it's a powerful socio-political allegory. It cuts to the heart of human nature the way the great writers H.G. Welles, Mary Shelley and George Orwell did. No, you won't see a lot of laser battles, spaceships and aliens. But here you'll see an excellent example of what scifi was designed to do: comment on our current human condition by creating a fictional (extreme) scenario as a cautionary tale.Excellent, and I mean EXCELLENT performances by James Caan (The Godfather, Misery), John Houseman (The Paper Chase, The Fog), Maud Adams (3 James Bond films), Moses Gunn (every 70s TV show from Hawaii 5-O to Shaft), and a particularly gripping performance by Pamela Hensley (Princess Ardala in "Buck Rogers" homina homina) make this an all-star powerhouse of 70s talent.The music deserves a special mention of its own. From the opening notes of Bach's Toccata in Dm (the creepy "Dracula" theme) to Albinoni's haunting Adagio in Gm (check it out on YouTube... saddest song ever), "Rollerball" doesn't hold back.They don't make 'em like this anymore. But there are a few modern scifi films that come close: "Moon", "District 9" and "Solaris" come to mind.If you liked the films I mentioned in this review; if you liked the 70s classics "Catch-22" and "Coma" and "Stepford Wives"; if you like films that are both entertaining and works of art, do NOT miss Rollerball.For laughs, after you watch Rollerball (1976), check out the remake done in 2002 ...and see how far we've come :/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The music of this version makes the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One late night while staying at a friends house babysitting their kids, I was flipping through the movie channels looking for anything decent and came across this movie.What immediately struck me was the music that was chosen - the writers chose some of the most darkest and haunting music ever written by the great masters - who could teach some whippersnapper kids a thing or two about writing music.As another reviewer pointed out already, this version makes total sense and the remake doesn't at all. It was like the people who did the remake had to try and out-do EVERYTHING the original did with disastrous results. Had I not known the rules of the game from this movie, the new version would have been even worse.My favorite scene in the entire movie is at the end where he survives everyone and then picks up the ball and stuffs it in the goal. It is totally quiet and you hear a loud CRANG, the scoreboard then adds to the goal total, and then he starts skating around while the crowd starts chanting - first very lowly and then louder and louder his name. He builds up a huge head of steam as he whips faster and faster around the track, and then goes right for Bartholomew.In one of the most brilliant moments in cinema, they don't show him actually attacking him - instead they freeze him in mid-flight as he leaps into the stands and they fade out and then the music starts to "Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor" by Bach. You undoubtedly have heard this piece on Halloween and they don't credit it, so you don't know what organ player they used, but it is HAUNTING. You can literally feel the creeping doom as they roll the credits and the music continues until the piece is complete which is over 8 minutes long.It's the touches like this that make this version much better than the remake. The remake reeks of badly done heavy metal and lacks any punch whatsoever and they even changed the ending.I was so taken away by the music I went out and bought a performance of "Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor". And for you "so called" keyboard musicians out there, if you can play THAT piece on a real pipe organ and play it properly, then I will give you your due. It is the most technically complex organ piece ever written ( try 9 simultaneous parts which each finger playing a part plus your foot playing pedals ). For writing and performing this piece, Bach was nearly permanently exiled from his job of music director at the church and the equivalent today would be every employer blackballing you and not giving you a job. It's amazing given what the church thought of it that it survived.I didn't sleep the rest of the night - that music haunted me until daybreak due to that movie. I thought this movie was far scarier than anything I had ever seen - it totally freaked me out and then add that music to it - they should have left this movie alone.Hopefully you can get a copy of this version as opposed to the new one, don't even bother with the new one - it's not even worth the 5 cents it cost to make the disc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "Rollerball" today provides an interesting perspective if you've been around say, since the 1950's or so. Every time I see a picture that has relevance to the present day I have to wonder whether the film makers were making a futuristic statement or were simply reacting to their times. When this picture came out in the mid-Seventies I would never have given a thought to the threat of globalization by a handful of dominant world bodies like the U.N., or corporate entities like RCI Energy, the company depicted here sponsoring the Houston rollerball team. But here we are, and the threat of statism and global governance has never been more palpable.At the core of the story is Jonathan E's (James Caan) fierce determination to find out why he's being forced out of his starring role with the Houston team. As his team owner Bartholomew (John Houseman) makes clear, the elites at the top make global decisions for the greater good. That greater good requires allegiance to an authority that keeps the masses subjugated by means of a classless society whose attention is diverted by a game in which the rules constantly change. Jonathan E poses a threat to a society in which individual effort must be extinguished and never rewarded. It sounds a lot like liberals versus conservatives to me.Rod Serling took up this theme in a number of his Twilight Zone episodes, and those were done in the late Fifties/early Sixties. I'm thinking of a couple of stories that tread on similar ground - 'The Obsolete Man' and 'Eye of the Beholder'. The whole idea of conformity and group think is one that just drives me crazy and yet we see it every day with stuff like reality TV (which isn't) and the growing chasm between the major political parties. The film that really makes the point came out a little over a decade later, and if you want a real good two and a half decade sneak preview of where we are today, check out 1987's "The Running Man".One quick observation before I close with this film. In the opening minutes of the picture, the scoreboard for the first rollerball match is shown being set up for the game between Houston and Madrid. You don't know that at the time, and all you see are the graphics 'HOU MAD'. By the time the story's over, I had to think, 'HOW MAD' indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:While most of us worried about nuclear war between capitalists and communists, Norman Jewison and William Harrison depicted a future of corporate monoliths which ran society. War and poverty were abolished and the masses need for bloodlust was satiated by the gladitorial sport of Rollerball.Jonathan E. was the champion of "powerful Houston," the "energy city." The "executives" around the globe, fearing Jonathan E.'s popularity decide to set him up for the fall, the rest is the plot of the film.What strikes me is how insightful this film was. I know many people who live where their corporation tells them. Congratulations, you are going to love Columbus. And they go! As for Jonathan E., it sounds like an e-mail address to me (e.g. JonathanE@www.corp.com). In addition, all information in the film is kept on a central computer. Sounds like modern servers to me. I personally know people who buy books based on their appearance, not content (i.e. "that book will look nice in my new bookshelf").The drama and acting by Caan, Adams, Houseman, et. al., make for a top shelf film. Why they are remaking this film, I haven't a clue. The original is par excellence. I should hold back, but I won't. Rollerball ranks 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is "Rollerball"? An action movie? A science-fiction movie? A social-critic movie? I guess a bit of everything. And it succeeds on every level. It is an action movie for its well made action sequences, but it is also a sci-fi movie and at the same time it is a critic of our society, especially the society we have today which comes nearer and nearer to what is described in "Rollerball".Yes, "Rollerball" isn't really about the game and the action. "Rollerball" is about the worth of individuality and individual effort and a warning about not letting higher powers in the economy take our freedom away. "Rollerball" is about a globalised corporate society and why this isn't good for humanity. Guess where we are today... Right, in the globalised corporate society. Or at least almost. They just have to abolish the governments now.Therefore "Rollerball" is not a film about violence or just a stupid action flick, it is a deeply philosophical and sociological films. One could also say that it is about heroes, for what are heroes than individuals who stand out from the masses in a positive way? Freedom cannot be achieved through collectivism and that is where Karl Marx got it all wrong.And that is where we have to watch out. For our globalised, capitalistic, free-market-society can easily lead to oligarchy and dictatorship of the rich. I even fear that this is almost the case in the USA. Both ways can go wrong. Capitalism is good, as long as there is really a competition and when it doesn't go to far (for then we have oligarchy and predator capitalism). Socialism is good, as long as it only protects the individual from exploitation by other individuals and doesn't try to control everyone (for then we have totalitarian socialism)."Rollerball" gives us a warning. Best we take it seriously, or else "Rollerball" might come true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far superior to any "future sports" film that has been made since...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and that includes its own remake. Rollerball circa 1975 chooses a much more logical starting point, to begin with. The game has been in existence for a good decade or three, enough so that a firm sense of its purpose in society can be created. It is here that the writers of the 2002 remake so utterly failed - they didn't realise that the game itself only existed to move the greater plot along.In this unspecified point of the future, nations no longer exist. In their place are corporations that control every aspect of human society. The upside to this is that citizens have everything they need to live - food, energy, a place to work, and so forth. The downside is that they are not allowed to seek any knowledge the corporations don't want them to have, and they must accomodate every whim of the corporation's executives or risk serious consequences. Rollerball star Jonathan E, as played by James Caan, knows this all too well - his wife was taken from him by one of the corporation's executives.The game known as Rollerball fits in as a sort of enforcement of these rules. As Jonathan is told several times, the corporation masters created the game in order to demonstrate that individual effort is futile. They also make it pretty clear that above all else, no one player can become bigger than the spectacle of the game. But because these same corporate heads have given Jonathan too many reasons to not believe in them anymore, he is determined to defy them, regardless of the cost. He is told by the head of his team to retire or suffer the old-fashioned way. One of his star pupils gets it in the neck, and yet he still persists until the grand final, where almost all the rules are discarded.Unlike the 2002 production, where one announcer contradicts himself in the description of the rules within three minutes, the 1975 production had a clearly defined set of rules that became self-explanatory as the game went on. So much so that the players could play the game (minus the well-staged attempts to kill one another, of course) in between takes. The difference this makes is obvious in every single frame. The simulated matches make sense, the tactics that each team use are very distinct (and they make sense), and Jonathan E's story makes sense.You might wish to skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the film. Go get the DVD and watch it, it is well worth it. The ending is another major point where the 1975 original shows its superiority to the 2002 remake. After all the fuss about the game being created to show individual effort as futile and how no one man is allowed to become bigger than the game, Jonathan does just that. After a match in which the corporate masters do everything shy of giving Jonathan's opponents chainsaws in order to ensure he will not survive the game, he not only survives, but he refuses to descend to the level of the game by killing the last opponent, despite the fact that this is the same belligerent idiot who was rejected from Jonathan's team for not being able to follow his instructions. Unlike the remake that had to end in a typical action film style, the original ends with Jonathan putting the ball in the goal and doing his victory laps as the audience chants his name, signifying that not only has he become bigger than the game, but that the audience has regained their humanity as a result. A truly satisfying conclusion, and not a single Hollywood cliché in sight.I also like the manner in which Jonathan's thirst for knowledge is suppressed by his corporate masters. Instead of simply denying him the reading materials he seeks, he goes to the one big computer that stores all the knowledge and records, and asks it who makes the decisions in society. Said computer throws a hissy fit, and it soon becomes clear that nobody knows who is truly in control of this society except they themselves. The party at which Jonathan is supposed to announce his retirement on a previously recorded television show is a good example of this. The guests wander off into the forests, shooting down trees with what looks like a really powerful flare gun, and the night rolls on with everyone drunk on their belief that there are no consequences, or that they don't have to face them.The sad thing about Rollerball is the same sad thing about the real Black Sabbath's music - that it has grown more relevant to our society as time has gone on. We are told to recycle our packaging material, so we put it in seperate bins with no idea of what actually happens to it. We are told to filter our water or install taps that restrict the amount of water we use, but little or no research is done into the simple chemical process to create synthetic water. All it would take now is a sport or a game show in which the losing contestant is killed, and we'll have the beginnings of a Rollerball society. Here's to hoping that things might stop where they currently are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The game must show the FUTILITY OF INDIVIDUAL EFFORT...in the end you must lose"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those words, spoken by John Houseman to Jonathan, are the heart of the movie, and its explanation: Why Jonathan must not be allowed to continue to play since he always wins.His individual effort and bravery must not remind the docile citizens that they too can win against the control of the corporation, if they fight hard enough. Jonathan was willing to give up everything, for the right to do his best-he was giving up his life thinking he would die in the last game, and gave up the woman he loved for years, when he understood that to have her he had to obey and stop playing. The movie made that clear, when he erased her video in front of her, after watching it one last time. His face had an expression as if he was telling her ...."You're not on my side like I thought, I was in love with my image of you"....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This much neglected futuristic film from the 70's deserves a second look. Like "A Clockwork Orange" the amoral violent future "Rollerball" showcases is in reality a projection of the amoral violent present at the time of its creation. The movie lampoons the dress, fashion, and look of the 70's decade, spoofs the Texas cowboy ethos of the period, and takes jibes at the deification of athletics, in particular football, which dominates American culture and to some extent world culture. Comparisons can be made between Rollerball mores and the mores of the hedonistic Romans where humans were gnawed to death by hungry animals in the arenas and gladiators fought to their deaths in the Colosseum as crazed spectators cheered and slobbered as they ate their daily bread. "Rollerball" even foreshadowed the political correctness of the 1990's with the generic Bach-like Corporate Anthem played before each game.When the film was produced, roller derbies were hot items on TV and attended by large gatherings of blood-thirsty fans who egged on the pugilistic elements participating. Jim Croce even had a hit record parodying the game, "Roller Derby Queen." Add bikes, spike-studded gloves, the roller ball, change a few rules and there's Rollerball.One of the more interesting elements of "Rollerball" is how it differs from the futuristic societies depicted in the two classics, "1984" and "Brave New World." Rather than Big Brother watching you, an anonymous board of directors who run a corporate global conglomeration rule the world. No one, apparently not even their spokesperson, who is also the manager of the Rollerball team, Bartholomew (John Houseman), even knows who the directors are. The vote is taken via closed circuit TV. A soma-like substance is taken to induce dreams and visions but is used sparingly, unlike in Brave New World. And instead of book burning utilized by traditional totalitarian governments, books are hidden away. The only way to read one is to view a summarized and sanitized version, ? la "Reader's Digest," on a computer.Acting honors go to the consummate Thespian John Houseman as the corporate spokesperson. His facial expressions alone convey what few actors can communicate with all their skills. James Caan as superstar of Rollerball, Jonathan E., gives one of his best performances on the big screen. John Beck incarnates a Houston redneck appropriately named Moonpie with all his pride and prejudices. The weakest part of "Rollerball" is the lame attempt at romance in a nondescript relationship involving husbands and lovers. Therefore, the women roles are ill defined and not well written. The only important part for a woman in "Rollerball" is when a pistol is used to set trees ablaze making the depletion of the rain forests seem like child's play.The story concerns Rollerball idol of millions, Jonathan E., who for some unknown reason the corporate ladder orders to retire at the height of his career. The big game between Jonathan's Houston and Tokyo is coming up to determine the world championship. The global conglomerate suspends the penalty rule and limits the substitutions making it a fight to the finish. Disobeying the command to leave the game, Jonathan E. puts total effort into winning, even causing a small riot of the Japanese fans. Will Jonathan survive his assault on city hall (the Conglomeration), or will he die in the quest?The dazzling camera work by Douglas Slocombe with emphasis on icy white interiors and cold shades of white exterior structures delivers the images director Norman Jewison intended. The angles and movements during the games as well as the closeup shots enhance the viewers enjoyment of the action scenes.Oh, and Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor is as mesmerizing as ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original "Extreme" Sport</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is outstanding for several reasons. The first being, it's view or "guess" at the future. This film was made in the 70's, and takes place in the "future." Rather than the usual post-apocalypse scenario, or the trite "there is no violence in the future" theme, there is little in the film (other than clothing and hairstyles) that dates it as a 70's film. The concept of giant corporations becoming more powerful than governments is nearly a reality today, some would say. The sport of rollerball itself is no more dangerous or extreme than many events televised on ESPN2 or FOX sports today. Don't think I'm going overboard here. This is not a masterpiece or anything. However, it is FAR superior to the recent remake and holds up very well in contemporary times even though it's over 25 years old. As you watch the movie, think about this: can you imagine how much fun those stuntmen had while practicing for the movie? I have no way of knowing, but I'd be willing to bet that there were several "real" games of rollerball played by those guys, and I bet they had a blast! At last check, the DVD was available for $9.99, and it's well worth every penny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a corporate-controlled future, an ultra-violent sport known as Rollerball represents the world, and one of its powerful athletes (James Caan) is out to defy those who want him out of the game.So, the film is known for its stunts and being the first film to give credit to the stunt performers in the credits. This film is also known for its classical music -- an idea borrowed from Kubrick's "2001" and "Clockwork Orange", which allegedly stops the film from dating. (This concept does seem to be true -- the lack of 1970s music does make it harder to pinpoint as a 1970s film.) There is some social commentary here about corporations, the violence of certain sports and more. How seriously we should take any of this is unclear because it really does just end up being a lot of fun, and one could actually see a game like this being invented (is it really all that different from roller derby?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed gem of a film that nonetheless makes great viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball is an intriguing film that makes excellent use of symbolism, dialogue, aesthetics and decent all-round performances to convey a chilling message, yet a message which ends on a high note and not a depressing one.In the future, there are no wars and no crimes. The whole world is ruled by a multitude of faceless Corporations (which all seem to be part of an even larger whole), and apparently exists in a state of utopia - almost everyone lives in luxury without poverty, disease or famine.There is a dark side to society however - both the violent tendencies and thirst for entertainment of the populace are subjugated by a violent blood sport known as "Rollerball." The game takes place in a large domed stadium, around a banked circular track. The players all wear skates and various items of protective clothing (none of which are truly adequate for keeping them safe). Some players on each team are allowed to ride motorcycles (futuristic looking mopeds) which of course is extremely dangerous.Added to the mix is the heavy metal ball, which is fired at high velocity from a gun at the beginning of play, and nasty spiked gauntlets. This all adds up to a recipe for destruction.Indeed, the game is designed to kill the players, with the rosters for each team constantly changing - the game is designed by the Corporations not only to keep the masses entertained, but also to make them realise that individual effort and thought is futile, and so keep them suppressed.Jonathan E (played convincingly and with feeling by James Caan) essentially breaks the purpose of the "sport" by living through a ten year long career, apparently the longest ever, and becoming a superstar whose name everyone chants. He is loved by the people and is a shining example of the individual's triumph over the system.This obviously makes him a thorn in the Corporation's side, and so they attempt to get him to retire. When he refuses, they use everything in their power to force him to do so.The film has a surprising number of themes and symbols for its at first simple appearance - and has many moments that are sad and thought provoking.One of my favourites is the scene in which a group of drugged-up revellers use a futuristic weapon to destroy large, aged trees for no reason at all other than for a quick jolt of mindless entertainment.Somehow the scene, which could have been boring or confusing, manages to be a grotesque and almost horrific symbol of the excess of such a society.The 1975 imagining of the future also manages to avoid feeling dated. Even the old grey panelled computer banks are believable - many supercomputers today look very similar still.The action sequences feel believable and brutal, in a way I enjoy them far more than the CGI-infested stuff in almost all films these days.My one criticism of the film is that occasionally the themes of the film are unnecessarily laboured, and some scenes are a little slow as a result. This clumsiness takes a little impact out of the punch of what would otherwise be a fantastic film, but ultimately the depth is there more when it isn't being obviously stressed.People over than Jonathan and his teammates are also almost universally cold and unlikable, but there is a deliberate point to their characterisation.Finally there is the ending. I won't spoil it here, but it is a masterpiece of tension and ends the film on a real feeling of hope. Even though we don't see it, we get the impression that Jonathan may be the one individual that spurs the rest of the world into action. I highly recommend the film to anyone who fancies a film that is both viscerally exciting and yet has room to toy with deeper and darker themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a big soccer fan like me and you have been following the fortunes of a certain Mr. Beckham, then it is worth giving ROLLERBALL another look and seeing the film in the context of the hero worship the English football scene's most significant player since George Best has been getting ever since he scored from the halfway line in 1996, prior to securing the affections of Ms. Adams.What makes this film even more amazing is that the original short story it is based on, ROLLERBALL MURDER, written by the co-screenwriter of the film, William Harrison, is a mere 18 PAGES LONG!!! and focuses on the thoughts of one player before he goes onto the playing track and there is no indication of the action that he participates in.I saw it about 20 years after my first video viewing during a season honouring the film's costume designer at the National Film Theatre in 2002 and it is even more startling to watch on the big screen and compared to the recent remake, which misses the point of the first film, it is a true masterpiece.It is also an interesting critique of the nature of violence and the way a passion can overtake you (I know this myself having been a film fan for the best part of a quarter of a century and seeing STAR WARS four times at the cinema in a short space of time). Along with some of the other futuristic films of the 70's, it makes it's mark and Andre Previn's classical orchestrations of familiar themes complements the action superbly. It is also the best showcase for James Caan's talents and ranks alongside THE GODFATHER and MISERY as his best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, to 21st century eyes, upon first impression, this appears a dated sci-fi movie. But let's face it, it's nearly impossible for any movie to not appear dated after 30 years. But stick with it and you will be greatly rewarded. Few films have shown such a nuanced and true-to-itself vision of the future. Kudos to Norman Jewison for spinning a convincing tale while treating his audience as intelligent adults - this kind of film-making is lamentably rare today.This movie is impressive on so many levels. The sets - especially the rollerball track - are nothing short of perfect, especially considering that no CG, green screens, or other special effects are used in the movie. The choice to keep the off-the-track sets minimal was wise, and save the movie from being fatally dated. The physical performances of the actors and stunt-men is nothing short of astounding, again, especially considering there were no special effects - these were real performances. As an inline speed skater, I'm blown away by the skating in this movie. The Rollerballers have amazing form, speed, and agility on the track especially considering they're using "quad" skates, not the faster and more agile inline skates. And the tactics and "plays" used in the game are subtle and astounding considering no one has actually ever played this game...it shows impressive intuition and vision.Much is made about the slow pacing of this movie, but the dynamic between the fast paced game and the measured pace of Jonathan's quest for understanding is, in my opinion, greater than the sum of its parts. This thoughtful direction gives a sense of the "vibe" of life in this future world, and elevates this movie beyond the action-flick genre.And I cannot close out this review without mentioning the power of the final scene. Jonathan is forced to decide what the game means to him, and in doing so forces the world to consider what the game itself means. It's one of the best movie scenes ever made. Jonathan...Jonathan...JONATHAN!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Visuals and Game But a Little Deep for a 15-year-old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Rollerball at 15 years-old the first week it came out at a theater in downtown Boston (I grew up in the suburbs). The opening music and visuals of the game and the players with spiked and studded uniforms and equipment were all as if ordered up by one teen aged male for every other one in the world - dripping with testosterone.The plot was fine, if not a little deep, for me at that age. Being crazy about playing sports and going to the games, the treatment of the Rollerball players and their status as "rock stars" with women, booze, and drugs made it seem almost real.As an adult I kind of get a kick out of the various titles assigned to the cities in Rollerball (Houston, the energy city) and the suggested future with mega-corporations. Nah, that couldn't happen...After watching Rollerball recently on a pretty decent home theater installation, I realized the memories of a teenager can't be met by a 30 year old film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enigma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film defies classification or easy description. It's science fiction, but not really. It's social commentary, but not really. It's an action film, but not really. It's a cautionary tale, but... Are you starting to get the idea? Well, not really.Rollerball is a story set in a near future where nation states have destroyed themselves via war, and have been replaced by corporations providing social services, structure, and governance. A classic description of dystopia. But not really, because everyone's beautiful and well provided for. But not really, because corporate executives wield absolute authority over every aspect of people's lives, so there's no freedom. But not really, because everyone's happy with all their luxuries and easy living, and no one bothers to test the bounds of their lives or ask any questions.Enter Jonathan E (James Caan), an uncomplicated man who's starting to get the idea that something's amiss with this world. Jonathan E is an athlete in a game called Rollerball, an amazingly violent, brutal distillation of football, hockey, roller derby, motocross, gladiatorial combat, Unreal Tournament 2004, and jumping into a chipper shredder. Jonathan is the best player the game has ever seen. And that's a problem for the corporate executives, who designed the game specifically to chew people up, to reinforce the concept that individual effort and achievement was futile.Jonathan E is summoned by Mr. Bartholomew (John Houseman), Executive Director of the Energy Corporation, which owns the Houston Rollerball team for which Jonathan plays. Jonathan is politely asked to retire from the game. Bartholomew says the corporation is merely looking after his own best interests. But Jonathan is already soured on the idea of corporate benevolence, as they took away his wife some years ago and gave her to an executive. He was never told why. He seems to have accepted that indignity with great difficulty. But for this newest request, he hesitates. He doesn't understand why the corporation would want its best player to retire, or why he should be forced to compromise again. He starts asking questions. He wants to know why.And that is simply Not Done in this corporate-run world.The corporation retaliates by changing the rules of Rollerball to make it more brutal, more dangerous, presumably in the hopes Jonathan will be injured or killed. But it is Jonathan's closest teammate, Moonpie, who is seriously injured and rendered brain dead. It's here when Jonathan realizes that there are no "rules" in corporate society; that executives will change things around at whim to serve some unspecified ends.Jonathan decides to seek out the highest authority he knows: a computer named Zero which is the central index of all human knowledge and history. He asks it how corporate decisions are made and who makes them. Jonathan gets essentially gibberish in response, despite the computer technician kicking the machine and yelling at it to answer the question. Whether the computer is actively refusing to tell Jonathan, or it simply doesn't know, is left unclear.Not even Jonathan is sure of his motives at this point. But the idea of simply walking away, as everyone around him has pleaded with him to do, is even more of an anathema to him as he enters the final game of the Rollerball season. The rules have been changed again, essentially to ensure that no one will leave the Rollerball rink alive. With essentially no rules, the carnage is total. All pretense of sportsmanship and fair play are abandoned. Jonathan is badly injured but plays on. Jonathan smashes the only other remaining player from his motorcycle. He is about to cave his face in with the game ball, but relents. He seems to discover, in that moment, that his enemy is not the player before him, but the game itself. With labored effort, he stumbles toward the goal and plunges the ball in -- the only goal scored in the game. The scoreboard reads 1-0, with him as the last man standing. Jonathan has not won the game. He has defeated it.This film leaves you asking lots of questions: How could a corporate state succeed in comprehensive economic prosperity where previous governments failed? Why did the corporation see Jonathan's removal from the game as their only option? Why was Rollerball the only public spectacle available? Surely you want multiple spectacles so that you can diffuse popular interest, so that no single spectacle or emerging personality can dominate the popular consciousness.Perhaps that is the hallmark of an important film -- one that keeps you asking questions. Rollerball doesn't neatly slot in to any of the common cinematic genres. It's not flashy, it doesn't have a rich score or very quotable dialog. The acting is restrained. It has a few good action sequences, but nothing compared to modern spectacles, or even other action movies of its time. The look of the film is dated, due to its heavy 1970's jet-set vision of the future (for which I have a nostalgic attraction). There is not one single thing that you can point to in this film that is its stand-out, defining quality.And yet, the film as a whole seems to demand to be seen. As you watch the film, you can't help but get the feeling that Something Is Going On Here. That there's something important and significant about this film, and that you should pay attention.And I guess that's what I have to say about this film: Find it, watch it, and pay attention. Because it's that kind of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The old heroes never die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic tale of one against many, this film stands out as one that provides a true hero then everyone can look up to.Rollerball is a game set in the not to distant future. Corporations run everything and Nation states have been dissolved. Rollerball is the main sport of the day, a sport designed to pass on the message that everyone must work together if success is to be achieved, a sport that has this by being designed so that no stars can emerge to be idolised for an extended period of time. No Peles, Lance Armstrongs, John Elways, Michael Jordans or Wayne Gretzkis would survive long enough to shatter the message.Yet Jonathan E somehow manages it. 'The Champion', as his superior refers to him, has become the very thing the inventors of the sport feared, he has become the Icon.In order to restore the balance, they try to force him to retire, first peacefully, and then with ever increasing desperation, through threats, bribery, comatosing his best friend on the team, and finally through killing him outright on the court in games with ever more dangerous rules about substitutions and penalties but our hero's refusal to submit and to leave the people he love is only re-enforced by the executives' ever growing desperation to remove him. His honour meaning that the rule changes only make quitting more difficult as he won't leave his team mates in the situation he feels he has gotten them into.Although this film is as old as I am and the effects have dated, the tale holds true now as much now as it always has If you come across a title called Rollerball, make sure it is this version and not the highly ill conceived remake</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Dystopia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball (1975) is, of course, a Dystopia. If you do not want to watch a dystopia, or if you are seeking the thrill of violence without painful emotion, you won't like it. Instead, watch The Terminator (BTW, a great movie).Thus, Rollerball is like all dystopias a warning of where we might go, and thus at least implicitly of where we already are. Man's perpetual need for violence, and also for security, is finally sated, and this is where it leads us. Spectator sports spectaculors are the crack and the opiate of the masses as well as the vicarious source of a castrati society's manliness.The movie is a bit dated, of course, in large part because its critiques have been repeated and become cliche, and also because we have grown used to what was then novel (like a heavy does of spectator sports).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of the seventies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the seventies there were two really popular movie genres - the critical science/social fiction movie (like "A Clockwork Orange", "Soylent Green", "The Omega Man", "THX-1138" and the "Planet of the Apes" series) and the car chase cop/action thriller ("Bullitt", "French Connection", "Driver", "Bandit on the Run", "Cannonball" or "Convoy"). So it was no wonder that it led to a crossover of those two genres - and it was Norman Jewison's turn to create the ultimate chase'n'fight science fiction drama of the mid-seventies.Filmed in 1975 in the then futuristic setting of the Munich Olympic Stadium, it shows us a time in the early 21st century when there are no governments and wars and crisis anymore, but big companies ruling the world. The most popular hobby to keep people busy and satisfied are rollerball races, a mix of roller blades, ice hockey, rugby, American football and motorcycle racing with a large amount of seriously hurt and killed players.The most brutal star of the game, Jonathan (played by James Caan), is a big media hero, just like in our times. The problem is that the companies don't like any hero worship and individual stars, just like in most totalitarian systems, and so Jonathan has to retire from active sports just two matches before the end of the winning season. Jonathan refuses to stop and wants to continue - so he's got a big problem as the presidents of the companies change the rules of the game and send killers into the arena....There are only three Rollerball matches - one in the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the movie, each becoming more brutal, bloody and deadly as the one before. The Rollerball sequences are shot brilliantly with great camera work and editing, while the rest of the story has a rather laid back tempo, but always a menacing atmosphere. There is a yuppie party sequence with some drunken guests destroying the last few trees in the surrounding senselessly with a rocket gun just for fun, and some hints and remarks that this whole brave new world isn't as perfect as it seems.The music is also fitting well, with classical pieces by Bach, Albioni and others introducing the fighting sequences like a religious mass in the church-like arena with Jonathan as a new media messiah. The party sequences have some very surreal and groovy blaxploitatition funk tunes by Andre Previn in it. The much sought sound track has just been re-released recently.All in all a thrilling, well shot and scary vision of a possible future with one of the most impressive endings in the history of movies. Check out the breath-taking silence in the arena just after Jonathan's last fight with some thousand spectators starting a religious-like mantra chant for their surviving hero, and Caan's last rounds with a freeze-frame close-up on his mad and disillusioned face. Skip the remake and watch this great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth seeing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the reviews here have been positive. One possible reason is that, to actually sit down and write a comment about this picture you really have to think about it a bit. And this is not your average action or sci-fi flick...much more thought-provoking than the Road Warrior, Logan's Run or other acclaimed movies of the genre, Rollerball contains a lot more food for thought than I bargained for. That's not to say it blew me away, but I did find it interesting. For those just looking for some mindless action, go rent the Running Man. However, I think this movie will appeal to readers of Alduous Huxley and Ayn Rand as much as anyone else.The classic conflict here is really man v. the gods. Bartholomew is like old Zeus on Mt. Olympus (his huge office tower), and Jonathan E and the other Rollerball players are his pawns. Not only does the game serve the bloodlust of a bored, lackadaisical public, it also quenches the idea of individuality; the tough, bloody sport of Rollerball is not a game where players are supposed to get better over time. Enter Jonathan E., star player for 10 years and getting stronger all the time. A bit of a worry to the corporate higher-ups that rule this world, a champion and symbol of individuality to the people. What dangerous ideas does Jonathan E. represent to this Brave New World?This is a movie that can mean different things to different people, as the comments here suggest. Well-made (although not perfect). The scenes where he confronts Bartholomew and his women show that he is just an average man being swept along by greater forces. However, Caan's character is most watchable where he excels: the Rollerball arena.The DVD is pretty weak except for the Director's commentary...no trailer?? I hope they re-release this one on DVD. I also hope the remake doesn't simply focus on the violence of the game. Some will say this movie is no longer relevant today...I heartily disagree, especially as far as corporate conglomerates using television media to stone the public. Just turn on MTV or the WWF to see what this is all about. Surely the dark side of globalization if ever there was one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A summary of the evolution of sport and man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball is a futuristic glimpse into the not so distant future. It shows us in depth the trials and tribulations of Johnathan who is a star in the extremely violent game. Rollerball is an ever-changing game that was specifically designed so that no one can excel at it. The game is ran, as the world is, by corporations. Johnathan is confronted by the leader of the corporations(and thus Rollerball) and asked to retire from the game. Johnathan refuses and continues to play, even when the rules are changed so that penalties and time limit are erased. But he receives a rude awakening when he finds out exactly how much power the corporations have. These events lead up to the final glorious game, where Johnathan proves that no matter what the rule change, he is still the true Rollerball champion.Rollerball is an amazing look at not only then evolution of man, but the evolution of sport as well. It shows that corporate sponsorship of sport will only grow, and eventually control our whole lives. As well, that although we have evolved, the gladiator style of sport still yearns to entertain us. This is amply shown by director Norman Jewison, who creates a Romanesque atmosphere circulating around the Rollerball arena.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated, surpassing High Noon in intensity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm a sci-fi fan, I ignored this movie since the trailer gave the impression of a cheap hybrid of sci-fi and sports...and sports of all types bore me. Much later, a friend almost forced me to watch it on late-night TV, and I was riveted from the opening scene. There are a lot of insightful descriptions and comments at this same site, so I won't duplicate them -- but do look them over before you see ROLLERBALL since it'll give you some interesting aspects of this masterpiece. As a celebration of individuality, character and personal freedom, it compares well (and I believe far surpasses) both 1984 and HIGH NOON. It's easy to see why such superb names (Jewison, Houseman, Maud Adams, and Sir Ralph Richardson in a glorious bit part) signed on to what seems to have all the makings of a straight-to-video potboiler.I watch movies for enjoyment, not moral messages or spritual claptrap, and I thoroughly detest having a message shoved down my throat (as Gene Roddenberry's later work always did so clumsily)....and I dislike those who try to dredge such underlying threads from perfectly enjoyable movies. However, the powerful themes woven so artfully into this gem only add to the visceral thrill that even a sports-hater like me gets from hearing the organ thundering out Bach's shimmering chords and seeing the silver ball slammed home.Twenty-five years later, as government steals more and more of our individual freedoms while placating the masses with socialist bread and circuses, this movie's strong, jarring themes ring truer than ever. And the beautifully-crafted ending, where silence gradually soars into .... well, words fail me at that point, but it is unforgettable and magnificent.I have never been so wrong in my expectations of a film. If you have not seen it, you are in for a rare treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The future is scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite easily one of my favorite films of all time. The future is real scary if this is what people imagine it to be! People often forget it's not about the future of sports, it's a comment on everything becoming an industry. About living under a huge set of rules. But people don't know this- their provided with food, wealth, pleasure, anything they want and because they're satisfied they think they're free and living in a world where they can do or be what they want. It's very clever. We think at one point the thing that will redeem James Caan is if his wife, Maud Adams, comes back to him. She does but nothing has she changed. She admits, her life is misery (her current husband has a 'lover') but she gets on with it because of the system under which they live in- they think they're being satisfied.It's brilliant. Maud Adams and James Caan are great, and watch out for an appearance by the wonderful Ralph Richardson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting, but sometimes dull movie set sometime in the 21st century about corporations controlling the world, where violence in nonexistent (how?), and that people vent out their anger by attending Rollerball games, which is a variation of roller derby to score points. The general populace lives off a diet of narcotics (Prozac or Zoloft I suspect) and fire flare guns at trees for entertainment. James Caan gives a very subdued performance as the star of the Houston Rollerball team whom the executives want out of the game permanently because of his fame. The sets for this movie are very interesting, with Frankfurt, Germany doubling for a futuristic Houston. I pretended that was the Astrodome they played in. No mention was given of where the country homes were located that Jonathan E.'s house or the cocktail party were, it looked like Europe to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed yet Prophetic and Memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall the general reaction of the audience when this first came out: the sport was simultaneously horrifying in its violence and fascinating in details bizarre and familiar. Motorcyclists and skaters team up to vie for the aircannon-launched steel rollerball. NFLish colorful helmets and jerseys, the NBA/NHL-ish air-horn signaling play, the pregame anthems. The lines between government and corporate power structures are blurred into one. Technology has made it possible to sustain life without regarding the resulting quality of that life. It's a future we'd like to avoid but it's already too familiar, and seemed so even in the 1970's.That said, the movie lacks depth and humanity. The overview of this future society and how it came to be is just that: an overview. It's a cursory, cliched telling and it feels tacked on. James Caan plays a dull, shallow hero ("the great Jonathan E") who tries in his own thickheaded way to learn the hows and whys of his world--but largely to get back the love of his life, a woman even more shallow than him, and ultimately far less appealing. His unrequited love is tragic and pathetic, and at the same time not completely believable.Nevertheless, it's believable when the Powers-That-Be see great danger in the heroic Jonathan's runaway cult status. In this future, individuality has no place. So they alter the rules and raise the stakes of the game in the hope that Jonathan E will either retire voluntarily or die on the field of play, and in doing so will serve their purposes one last time. It leads to a rousing, then quietly unnerving, climax...</fullReview>

Then ?who can symbolize that power?. The Corporations. From 1984 (and olders) to Public Enemy (i.e.) going thru thousands of movies, Corporations means the enemy to defeat. Check it out: Banks, Chemical, Oil and Weapon industries, Genetic labs. Even Vatican and some bizarre brotherhoods ("We'll rule the world" style). A real zoo of vicious and twisted organizations that, every time, will try to manipulate, implicate or kill our heroes.But, what am I trying to say?. Rollerball, folks, is one of the most perfect examples of the good/evil infinite fight. One man alone, discovering the truth behind is comfortable life, losing is goods and privileges, gets himself in a life-or-dead final battle against the real enemy: the Corporation (?who else?). The image of James Caan skating alone into the game arena with the crowd claiming his name louder and louder is simply unforgettable. GREAT movie.And remember: Take care, there are many powerful Corporations around you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the futuristic year of 2018, giant corporations rule the Earth. They control people by providing easy access to sex, drugs and big screen television sets. Entertainment is provided by the popular "Rollerball" blood-sport, sponsored by corporate executives. Audiences vicariously stroke their violent impulses through the "Rollerball" games. The players skate around on a circular track, "Roller Derby"-style and try to get a silver ball in its slot. To make the sport more dangerous, a few players ride motorcycles. Teams are permitted to disable each other in any way possible, and deaths are routine...Athletic star James Caan (as Jonathan E) commands attention from crowds in the stands and TV viewers. He scores the most goals and is leading his Houston team to championship victory. Then, something strange happens. Smug corporate executive John Houseman (as Bartholomew) asks Mr. Caan to resign from the team. He will live in comfort with plenty of money, alcohol and a succession of beautiful female companions. But Caan likes the game and wants to keep playing. Houston, we have a problem? "Rollerball" succeeds in creating a simple anti-utopian future with parallels to the present.******* Rollerball (6/25/75) Norman Jewison ~ James Caan, John Houseman, John Beck, Maud Adams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The future of Mankind is always speculative. Hollywood has strived to put to film, books which depict the future. Some of their efforts are dreary, others are black and still many other are deadly and violent. This movie is called " Rollerball. " Originally a futuristic short-story written by William Harrison entitled 'Roller ball Murder' it morphed into a cinematic story of World domination by Corportate Executives. Accordingly, it became the story of a player named Jonathan E. (James Caan) Over the last decade, since he joined the Huston team, Jonathan has not only become very popular, but has become a national hero, in an era where Individualism and hero worship are not only discouraged, but frowned upon. Nearing the end of the season and his tenth year with the team he is summoned by Bartholomew (John Houseman) the C.E.O of the Corporate World, to discuss his retirement. He is reminded, the game is not designed to produce heroes, but the opposite. Opting to negotiate his retirement, the player states he wants his wife Ella (Maud Adams) back, whom he was forced to divorce. Bartholomew cannot deliver her yet reminds the player the game will be changed to force his retirement. Now the course is set, Jonathan will either quit or he will be killed and that includes his team. John Beck, Moses Gunn and Ralph Richardson offer memorable parts which in the end gives this futuristic movie Classic status. The dramatic roller action and over all physically combative scenes highlight what has become a cult film and a very surprising hit movie. ****</fullReview>

Quintessentially American in attitude and values.The game and even the violence are merely the surface manifestations of this triumph. This is a struggle of individual will and power. Jonathan gets as high as he is "allowed" to go, and sees he can go farther. And despite the obstacles thrown at him, he succeeds again and again, showing that although a team is generally superior to an individual, an exceptional individual can triumph against overwhelming odds.And also, although we value teams, we as a species find comfort in one person being the symbol.....This is an excellent film as far as content and philosophy is concerned -- and that is enough for me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a future society, where the game of life is just life within a game...of sorts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norman Jewison directs good movies (Jesus Christ, Superstar; The Cincinatti Kid; The Thomas Crown Affair; In Country; Fiddler on the Roof and others) and this one, like the others, explores another basic principle of the human condition: what does it mean to be free?Or, if you will: what is freedom?Today, in 2006, much of this movies seems very dated, particularly the audio/video technology and the mainframe computers. To that extent, the film failed technically to be up to scratch. A bit more imagination, however, was used when Jonathan (James Caan) attempts to ask questions of the supercomputer, Zero, in Geneva: its 'brain' is composed of water molecules! A nice touch...However, back to the story: Rollerball champion, Jonathan, is becoming too popular in the deadly game. So much so, that the Executive Committee wants him O-U-T, out of the game so that he does not become too powerful, and upset the status quo, where personal freedom is totally subsumed to Energy Corporation, the current ruler of the world. Got that?This, then, is a metaphor for the human condition when ground under the heavy heel of Authority. And, authority has many forms, but in this future world, it's the Executives who control the world game and economy. And, everybody must play ball...er...Jonathan included. The public mess ? er, mass ? must go along for the ride and view.It's a bleak view of what can happen when too much power devolves to Big Business, especially if Big Business also takes the place of Big Government. But, it's no different to the view held by Kirk Douglas as Spartacus (1960) or Mel Gibson as Braveheart (1995): the freedom of the individual is paramount, and any thwarting of that principle is the death knell for society: you may as well be dead. So, Jonathan sets his own ball rolling, to set himself free...Obviously, this film can also be seen (no pun intended) as an indictment of the then, and current frenzy, obsequiousness, and media attention paid to all high profile sports figures, or any public figure, come to think of it. For Jewison, there's no question: in much the same way the citizens of long ago Rome paid homage to Caesar such adulation inevitably leads to abuse and excess. The roller rink is, of course, a symbolic gladiator stadium where, eventually, nothing is barred and it ends only with the last man standing.The supporting cast is very good, notably with the creepy John Houseman as Bartholomew, and the inimitable Ralph Richardson as the Librarian for Zero, the super-computer. And the soundtrack is just stupendous: soaring, roaring pipe organs and classical violins presenting well known classics ? with the occasional Musak thrown in.By today's standards, the violence is muted, although there is blood enough for most thinking viewers. The greater violence, of course, is that done to people's minds, and their spirit. From a brief look at the 2002 remake, it seems that most think this is the better movie. The first one usually is, every time...Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie because, while the back-story was minimalist, there was an underlying story line that still has interest. Any movie that depicts violence takes the chance that the action glorifies that activity. But if you can view the movie without assuming that the main protagonist is correct, then the back-story presents a couple points of view that have current interest. Other movies showing the future as a way of commenting on current society have kept the characters from verbally emoting all the time. Two movies that come to mind are '1984', directed by Michael Anderson, and 'THX1138', directed by George Lucas. James Caan plays his role with understated confidence. I imagine the director is trying to let viewer fill in the details. I may be guilty of over-interpreting, but the director, Norman Jewison, has been involved with movies that have depth ('Moonstruck', 'A Soldier's Story', and 'In the Heat of the Night'). I was surprised, when watching the DVD version that I recently bought, by the stark beauty of some of the settings. Sir Ralph Richardson makes an appearance in one of these locations that is memorable. If you do not agree with any idea that the movie presents, it at least presents some ideas, some action, and some beautiful, though stark settings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the silly remake and the fact it was made into a real sport. This is a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly when people hear the word Rollerball, there may be a stigma attached to it. Reasons may either be the association with the awful movie released several years ago and the silly stuff on TNN. However before it was a lame attempt at being a "hip" and "cool" LL Cool J movie and before it was the second favorite sport of rednecks nation wide, behind Nascar of course, it was a darn good film from 1975. James Caan stars in Rollerball and if you can forget the silly remake and the fact that audiences completely missed the message and that the thing was adapted into a real "sport" then you're in for a treat. This another one of those movies that dabble in the future with a utopian or dystopia (depending on your view) world. The setting is 2018 and big cooperations have taken over the world and left countries and nations a thing of the past. There's no violence or war, but there is rollerball. Rollerball is a brutal sport where almost anything goes and the players are expendable, but it does draw huge crowds. Jonathan E. a 10-year veteran of the sport, rises above the norm and becomes an icon, bigger than the game itself. The cooperations don't want the individual player to be the important thing nor to advance into upper "executive" social class, so they scheme to get him to retire. Rollerball doesn't pull any punches. James Caan is great as the weathered veteran. The action sequences are tight and thrilling and the set pieces and futuristic designs still look fresh today. It's not only a fun action movie, but it does have a message warning against violence in sports and the danger of commercializing them. Unfortunately it's all too clear that the message of the film was all but ignored. A real sport came of it, companies are paying millions for a few seconds of time during the Superbowl, the commercials are as important as the game, and championship boxing fights can only be seen on payperview. Yeah this movie wasn't far off.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless message more relevant than ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in the theaters when it came out in 1975 and was far too young to appreciate not only its message, but its treatment of that message. Thematically, this is an important film and joins the camp of several films from the time which used science fiction as a carrier for ideological discourse. Rollerball, more so than just about any movie I've ever seen, re-affirms the essence of the American ideology in a world where individuality has been neatly replaced with the perfect order of corporate utopia. (An interesting twist on the typical governmental utopia - but the idea is the same.)The story development here is sublime, beginning with an adaptation of roller derby in an almost comical version with motorcycles that never seem to have a real purpose. But this sets the stage for a powerful allegory later in the film.The real story here is the struggle of one man against the forces of society, all of which conspire to deprive him of the one thing he loves: the game. At first, he is bemused and doesn't understand, but as the movie progresses, we see him simply refusing to change as instructed while seeking the answer to why he is being asked to give up the one thing that gives his life meaning.For those of us (myself included) who may not understand the message buried in the dialog, we are eventually told the simple premise behind the game itself, its role in a perfected (though far from perfect) society and the stunningly simple answer to the question as to why this man is being told to conform.The dramatic development of the political theme and the characters make the actual game sequences meaningful and interesting, not because roller derby with motorcycles is in any way compelling, but because it brings the inherent struggle of the story to a pique and engulfs both ideas and characters that are extremely well set up.I cannot help but think that in modern times, as we witness the (attempted) manifestation of many of the Utopian ideas presented in this film, that it is a timely reminder of - and a timely warning against - the essential forfeiture of liberty that seems more and more unavoidable.This may be billed as an action film, but it's actually a thinking film and will challenge you intellectually even as those motorcycles which never seem to have any purpose race around the track.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in my teens and like many people I loved the action scenes but was bored with the rest of the film. After re-watching it recently I now understand the fundamental theme of the film &amp; actually found the non-action parts more interesting than the games.There are plenty of reviews here describing what the movie is about, so I won't go into that. What I found most interesting was the portrayal of a society much like the one in Brave New World. Carefree yuppies, subdued by pills and reduced to amoral children as a result. Relationships between men &amp; women are forcibly casual &amp; the Corporation routinely replaces Jonathan's female partner. His longing to see his original wife is repeated throughout. The game fits into this sterile society by providing a gory spectacle where individuals are totally disposable. Only the team matters and it is therefore a great analogy for the corporate utopia depicted.Rollerball looks very dated now but I'm sure modern films that depict the near future will also appear dated in 30+ years. My only other gripe is that Jonathan E should have been written with more personality. Some of his teammates appear to be far more interesting characters &amp; considering that the film is about individuality, Jonathan should have been more charismatic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baseball great Yogi Berra once said, "The future 'aint what it used to be." As inane as this sounds it actually makes brilliant sense when pondered closely. In the 1970's there were a series of films that were obsessed with depicting what the future would be like: Death Race 2000, Future World, Westworld, Mad Max, etc. All of them had violent themes and foreboding outlooks of nightmarish societies and dystopia. Yes, technology and knowledge may improve, but mankind doesn't. Rollerball in 1975 depicted what the world would be like in 2018 with a completely negative outlook.Jonathon E. is the all-star player of this blood sport. He's charismatic, has plenty of sexy women at his disposal and plays the sport with ferocious skill and precision. During games he cuts through the track leaving a heap of opponents bodies in his wake. He scores points to win the games and often beats up many opponents, even in pairs with his powerful hits, flips and jabs. Jonathon is the best and most formidable player in the world. The game sequences especially make this clear by revealing the rough nature and brutality of the sport accompanied by the prevailing skills of Jonathon and the Houston Rollerball team. Their is one particular vivid scene where corporate executives, hookers and star players are invited to a dinner party. As part of the entertainment they replay highlights of Jonathon's career basking in the glory of his remarkable and overpowering carnage on the track and basking in the glory of his point scoring. Watching the sexy gown clad women faint and sigh from the violent images in slow motion add to the sexy element of this movie.Rollerball is vivid, colorful, sexy and brutal. All these elements combined to derail a society where corporate America has created an impersonal and morally depraved world through violent entertainment for the masses.If you want to see an interesting 1970's flick, with violence, hot babes, or to just watch James Caan pulverize people into hamburger, then Rollerball is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in many ways a film that is very typical for its kind in the late 60s and the 70s it is a relative of "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Fahrenheit 451", "SilentRunning", "Logan's Run" and "Death Race 2000". It is a social critical science fiction movie masked as straight action/sci-fi. First for the good things: It is a thought provoking movie with some riveting Rollerball action sequences, it is well played and well made with a non-standard classical organ score. The flip side is a middle section, that although it does offer thought-provoking look at a future dystopia is sagging badly. The design is as minimalistic as in "Fahrenheit 451", making it clear that this movie was made on a shoestring budget (whichexplains the padding in the middlesection). I feel it is too early to make a remake of this movie for the sake of updating it technologicly or otherwise, it is simply not needed, "Rollerball" is still a very stingy critical sci-fi movie that's hitting home. A remake is however required to make the ultimate "Rollerball" movie,with a healthy budget, allowing "Rollerball" to rise above minimalism anddeliver in the crisp &amp; crunchy Rollerball game department. Rollerball 2002 was a dud, so this is still a challenge for a gutsy studio and director. For all its shortcomings the original "Rollerball" is an above average movie holding upvery well even today. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a young teenager when I saw this film and felt both disgusted and excited with the violence in the film. I had never seen action like it in a mainstream movie broadcast on tv. Rollerball is a game of the future designed to satiate the hunger for violence of a sick and twisted society. War is no more but instead there is Rollerball. The scene is set in a velodrome where players, who are a cross between American football players and hockey stars attempt to score points, no holds barred. The teams are international e.g Houston v Tokyo.James Caan is made for the part. His stocky build and cool nature gives him the menace and believabilty needed for the role. He is a good guy manipulated by his Corporate bosses who feel he may be getting bigger than the game itself. The games become increasingly violent as the film goes on, culminating in a quite disturbing finale unseen in any other sport film genre.The cinematography and sets are very seventies Sci Fi and at the same time impressive. It is evident this film had a decent budget and Norman Jewison has made good use of the money. Rollerball won't be to everyone's taste and it's probably a guy's film. Girls stay away!

		<fullReview>Rollerball is a downbeat and cerebral attempt at science fiction. The film centers around a type of deadly roller derby enjoyed by one of those societies in the "not so distant future". In this future, corporations are in charge (as if they haven't already been in charge for many years) and individual glory is strongly discouraged. A game like Rollerball is supposed to show the futility of individual achievement, and punctuate the need for teamwork. But when one veteran player knows as "Jonathan E." (Caan) becomes too popular, the corporation bosses decide to ask him to retire. When he declines, they decide to force him out. Since simply murdering him or making him disappear would be bad for public opinion, the corporation has other ideas. The game is made to be increasingly brutal, and he is targeted on the court by rival players. Still, Jonathan is a complicated fellow who can't seem to take a hint. He has no intention to retire. Does he crave the spotlight so much? Does he feel he has unfinished business left in terms of achievement within the sport? Perhaps, but this is never made clear. The only thing we know is they want him out. Badly.Rollerball is not a bad film, but one can't help but see it as a missed opportunity. The game itself is a blast. Game action is spectacularly filmed considering the time this film was made. The sets look good, even though one rink was obviously used for each city. Too bad so much of this film is just dialog and forlorn longing for the days when corporations weren't so much in control. There are some laughable scenes, such as the one where Caan journeys to Geneva where supposedly all of the world's knowledge is stored on some master computer. Thankfully they didn't name him HAL, but clearly this and other computers in this film were inspired by Clarke and Kubrick's ideas. Anyway, the computer looks like some kind of aquarium you might see in a trendy club in Omaha's Midtown Crossing development. Of course it won't give Caan any answers, and this causes the human in charge (was that Ralph Richardson?) to beat on it wildly! Such a cheesy scene! Much of the film's inflated running time is filled with Caan acting forlorn and confused. His performance is downbeat and unconvincing. Most of the women in this film look like soap opera queens, but this is intended. Everyone in good graces with the energy corporation apparently gets his own trophy babe that has to be turned in every six months. But that wouldn't necessarily be so bad, would it? I didn't think this society looked all that bad, frankly. We don't learn much about how the masses live, however. We only see them as mind-numbed chanting sports fans.Rollerball has some interesting ideas, but the film just lasts too long and doesn't have as much action as you'll probably want. The acting is often unconvincing, and the message a tired one. Corporations are ALWAYS the enemy in movies. Even as governments grow more and more powerful and intrusive. The corporations are always the problem. Always. The film does have some neat sets and some great stunt work during game action. For these reasons, its worth about 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sporadically Brilliant But Unsatisfying Sci-Fi Drama Of Sick Future Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a future society governed by powerful corporations, a violent spectator sport called Rollerball is immensely popular worldwide. Jonathan E is a veteran Rollerball star, but when he is given orders to retire he starts to question what is behind the decision ?Rollerball, like a lot of seventies cinema, is an interesting and thought-provoking film, but not without some problems. It has lots of intriguing themes going on; what gave rise to the corporate apolitical structure, why are dangerous gladiatorial sports so popular, are people so materialistic they would really give up freedom for glamour, and why are the power brokers so threatened by Jonathan's hero status. But for every interesting idea there are also scenes that fall flat; the boring society party full of pretty people we don't know or care anything about, a ridiculous bit with Richardson about a senile supercomputer, and almost all the parts with Jonathan's floozies (though Hensley, as the first one, at least has a personality). The other problem is the villain, Bartholomew, who is well played by Houseman but never allowed to actually do anything nasty, so we never feel Jonathan is in any danger and the tension is lost. Caan is strong in the lead, and handles both the physical performing and the internal angst with impressive skill, but is left floundering in a movie that is much too serious, unstructured and long for its own good. Shot in the UK for some reason, with a talented British crew, notably the excellent production design by John Box (Oliver!, Sorcerer, The Keep) and a heavy classical score featuring Bach's Toccata And Fugue In D Minor and Remo Giazotto's Adagio In G Minor. What is of course faultless in this film is the bone-crunching stuntwork, as the Rollerball players are smashed, mashed, crunched and thumped around the arena. A movie with good ideas, which could perhaps learn a lesson from Tank Girl, a more recent film about a future world controlled by an energy corporation; it has just as many imaginative notions, but is funny, exciting, fast-paced entertainment all the way, with vibrant, dynamic characters. Rollerball is an iconic sci-fi classic, but just a little too portentous and self-absorbed for my liking. Written by William Harrison, and remade (badly, by most accounts) in 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violent, sexy, philosophical,... yes, it was all those and more. But,.. scary?! Oh, yes! Very, VERY scary! Scary like NOSFERATU (B/W starring Klaus Kinski) and that was terrifying! In that flick, nothing jumped out and yelled, "BOO!!" Oh, no. You could see where it was going,... and going,... and going,... and in your mind you kept stomping on the brakes, trying to turn the steering wheel, screaming, "Stop! No! Don't!," but nothing worked! You were taken headlong into disaster and death!Well, ROLLERBALL is scary like that! It tells a tale that, here in 2009 with the global financial crisis, rings horrifyingly true. The Corporate Wars have just begun and we get to watch them,... real-time!I read a LOT of the comments in this IMDb thread but no one has hit upon the real (IMO) plot, so even if I'm not completely right, I'm original! The game of ROLLERBALL is merely the vehicle for Jonathon E. He is the Reaper come for the Executives! If they had not taken his wife, all would have been cool, but the Executives were too greedy and too dumb to be so powerful. They awoke the Demon below! Jonathon E. was just a jock, a pawn, but his burning desire to know WHY the Execs had to take HIS wife opened the Mother-of-all-Pandora's-boxes!Just what the Corporate Wars were had been redacted from any records,... after all, the victors ALWAYS get to write the history books. Nonetheless, Jonathon E. wanted to know what had happened. He kept running into dead-ends, walled-up corridors, empty bookshelves, freshly deleted memory banks. Who were these Executives who had summarily taken his wife?! They were the Oligarchs: you were an Executive or you were a worker. Jonathon E. was very well-paid worker, very good Worker, an extremely famous WORKER, but that's all he was and the Execs took his wife!Soon you'll want to start testing the brakes,... So, why were the Corporations trying to silence Jonathon E.?... Their very existence was on the edge of a chasm because of Jonathon E. The Corporations had overthrown the governments of the world to claim their place as the Oligarchs of Plato's REPUBLIC. (Remember that horrid piece of writing? There was a sequence of events that showed how the Kingdom degenerated into the Timocracy; the Timocracy to the Oligarchy; Oligarchy to Democracy; Democracy to Tyranny. Sound familiar? When the Founding Fathers of America declared independence, they took the first step back UP the sequence of Plato's events, a Democracy in place of the Tyranny. Somewhere around SOYLENT GREEN, the Oligarchs were just getting a foothold.)ROLLERBALL is the end of the age of Oligarchs. Jonathon E. is the Timocracy-to-be. A Hero honored by the entire world, Jonathon E. was a death knell to the Executives. They HAD to squelch him but in their hubris, power and ineptitude, they recognized him too late. The world would surely blame them for Jonathon E.'s untimely death: that much they knew!So the Execs kept changing the rules of ROLLERBALL, trying to scare Jonathon E. out of the game,.. or kill him. Whatever works! It didn't work. (Movies are funny like that!) He beat all comers, on the track and off! That's what the final scene is all about. You must realize that he had just destroyed the Executives,... the Oligarchs. Jonathon E. was now the most important man in the world. It had cost him everything,.. his teammates, his wife, his friends,... but he had won!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** The futuristic movie "Rollerball" starts off with a piece from the 18th Century organ music, by Sebastian Bach, Toccata &amp; Fugue in D minor as the two Rollerball teams, Huston &amp; Madrid, get ready for combat in the skating rink. Leading the Huston team is the greatest player in Rollerball history Jonathan E.,James Caan, who together with his fellow teammate Moonpie, John Beck, bashing heads and breaking bones in no time at all demolish the Spanish team beating it 3 to 1 with Jonathan scoring all the points for Huston.After the game in the locker room Jonathan is asked by the Huston team owner Energy Corps. CEO Bartholomew, John Houseman, that he needs to see him at his corporate office about something very important that has to do with his future as the Huston's teams top scorer. Jonathan's later told by Bartholomew that his playing days are over and that he's to announce his retirement at a party that he's throwing for him that will be broadcast all over the globe. Being in the game for ten years, more then any other player, it's felt by the worlds top corporate executives and CEO's that it's time for Jonathan to call it quits. Not that their so worried about his health or him ending up crippled or dead playing the game but because he's defeating the very purpose of the game Rollerball. Which is that life is futile so accept whatever is given to you, by the corporate elites, and don't complain about it. Which is the kind of massage that the game is supposed to instill in those tens of millions of fanatical fans who watch it religiously day after day.In 2018 wars have been completely eliminated by the nations of the world replacing them with the brutal and violent game of Rollerball. Being that man is born with an almost hypnotic and uncontrollable taste and desire for war, as history has so sadly proved, it was decided that the game Rollerball would placate the publics blood-lust for war and violence. Still it was supposed to be a game that in the end nobody playing would survive it, alive or dead. Jonathan in his not getting killed or baldy injured but winning championship after championship for Huston was doing exactly that!Given the choice to retire and live a life of luxury and pleasure for the rest of his days by the corporate elite Jonhatan instead, in a sign of rebellion against his masters, chooses to continue to play the dangerous game of Rollerball for Huston and lead his team to the world Rollerball championship, thats to be played in New York City. Which set into motion a plan to get him, and his teammates, killed by the corporate controlled sports commission changing the rules of the game. It's determined that there would no rules at all with the only winner being the last player left standing alive on the blood-splattered skating rink.The movie "Rollerball" was one of the biggest box office successes of 1975, it grossed $30 million dollars, but was both overlooked and not taken seriously as a thought-provoking motion picture like most people watching it now. The film has do with major corporations, like the military-industrial complex, controlling and giving orders to our elected and unelected leaders. It was back then but now some 30 years later it's easy to see now, in retrospect, of how ahead of it's time it really was. With everything being done to have Jonathan killed off in his next game, the semi-final against Tokyo, he again survives beating the Japanese team. Despite his superb performance Jonathan's good friend and teammate Moonpie ends up with a near-fatal injury leaving him practically dead, actually brain-dead, to the world.It now comes down to the championship game against the tough and no-holds barred New York Rollerball team that has been declared, by the corporate giants, to be a last man standing event. Everything is now riding on Jonathan not surviving by not being someone to look up to admirer and even emulate the final game becomes something far more then just a major sporting event. It becomes a giant class struggle between the controlled masses, represented by Jonathan, and those who control them, represented by the corporate elite. The result will be for the people and cooperations to see if in the future if they can either both co-exist together as equal partners or revert back to where they've been since the dawn of recorded history as slave and slave-master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonathan E: Hero or Villain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>50 years in the future, Johnathan E (James Caan) is the biggest star of the biggest sport (Rollerball) in a world, run, not by governments but by Corporations.Energy Corporation Director Bartholomew (John Houseman) throws a party for Johnathan E, Rollerballs biggest star. At the party Bartholomew asks Johnathan to retire from the game. The Corporation has begun to fear Johnathan's popularity. Johnathan is not the simpleton he appears, for, as Bartholomew continues to insist he retire, Johnathan steadily raises the volume of the TV special airing in the background on his behalf complete with cheering crowd noise. As this conversation (between Bartholomew and the rising crowd noise) goes on, thru a window, you can see party guests burning down the trees outside with a flame-gun. Finally Bartholomew nearly yells, "You can be stopped Johnathan". During the entire scene Director Bartholomew has his back turned to the window completely unaware of the scene outside. He doesn't need to see it. Corporate Director Bartholomew spells it out clearly, "We have eliminated war", "We have eliminated disease, and hunger" - we simply ask to be allowed to make executive decisions. Trying to convince Johnathan to retire from Rollerball, he says, "It's an ugly social spectacle. It's a nasty brutal game. It serves it's purpose. It teaches the futility of individual effort." Unable to win Johnathan's cooperation, the Corporation rigs the game so he will lose. On the track Johnathan makes an amazing individual triumph against all odds. I assumed Johnathan's triumph heralded regime change (I'm going along with the movie here). In fact, at the end, you can see a dejected Bartholomew sitting behind the protective glass of the arena, and in the glass you can see a reflection of the Corporate Logo down on the track surrounded by flames. One reviewer compared the scene at the dinner party to the last supper. Younger audiences miss the complete 'regime change' angle to the story I think. It may seem too hard to believe. At the same time, when the movie came out, some had a problem believing corporations could become as powerful as they are portrayed here (at least according to the man introducing this on Turner Classic movies). Is this truism true? Are corporations more influential than they were in 1975? Unfortunately (for working Americans), corporations in America have less influence now than they did then. I was rooting for Johnathan all the way in the movie. But I was left to wonder if regime change was going to be a good thing. Is Johnathan E Hero or Agent of Decline? At least one reviewer's noted: in the future sport Rollerball, sport is used to curb individualism. In the real world, sport has come to promote it. And the idea there's no point to collective action. Depending upon who we are of course, we are on our own. Just the way we like it. Perhaps it's a testament to our conditioning (and this movie is part and parcel to that?): few see Johnathan E in other than the heroes role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dystopia or utopia? probably neither...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to recall a tag-line for this film when it first came out, on a poster, something like 'In the Future, there will be no war, no crime... but there will be ROLLERBALL.' I may have just cobbled that together in my own mind, but just the same, it spelled out a conundrum that this film addresses. If one proceeds further with that description - no war, no crime, no poverty, etc. which have indeed been eradicated in the time-frame of this film, then we should be looking at utopia, a paradise world. But... there is that 'but' - which sends a little chill down one's spine. The plot hinges on a sudden demand by the corporate powers who rule the world that the star player of THE GAME and captain of the Houston team, Jonathan E (Caan), retire. Despite Jonathan's status (he is treated like a rock god - picture all of professional sports today rolled into one with him as the undisputed superstar), it's very evident that certain corporate execs hold complete power. It's telling that when Jonathan enters the odd office retreat of the most prominent exec (Houseman), he cuts himself; then the toughest athlete in the world needs a handkerchief from the executive - he needs his help. The execs manage business and manipulate to ensure the status quo. When the exec enters the players' locker room, he extols the virtues of THE GAME, how great it is; when alone later with Jonathan, he calls it a stupid game, an awful game. His goals, of course, are different for each situation - this is how execs manage the world to their own ends.The best science fiction extrapolates from a proposed thesis, creating worlds based on certain past events, i.e. if events progress in a certain way, then the resulting world will be 'like this.' If certain changes occur at certain times, there will be certain repercussions, perhaps unexpected. Rollerball presents a world where, as mentioned, there is no poverty and, therefore, all citizens are well off in the material sense. But it stops there, doesn't it? With no wants, no needs, no new worlds to conquer, what does a society do? The result is, Rollerball explains, it stagnates; it degenerates; it stoops to the easy thrill (like burning down a stand of trees with a lethal toy gun) - it turns to an extreme to avoid pervasive boredom. When I first saw this film about 25 years ago, I didn't like Caan's performance; he basically mumbled his way through and appeared too lethargic, too dense to be the hero. But that was the point - almost everyone in this world is half-asleep, whether thru strange narcotics or self-delusion, and doesn't get it. They're all wrapped up in self-satisfaction and perennial smugness. The only ones who get it are certain execs - but now Jonathan is beginning to get it. Of course, the execs aren't too thrilled with that prospect. Free will on this world is an illusion - that's a secret to be kept tightly wrapped. (In one scene, it's stated that no one is sure who the 'Directors,' the Executive Board, are anymore; it's as if no one in the U.S.knew who the President or V.P. were - is it Bush? Kerry? Who cares? As long as I get my sports night, right?). With free will absent, that describes a population of sheep - more like drones, not individuals.The extreme, the outlet for most of the populace, is a very violent sport. I confess, even after seeing the film many times, I'm not too clear on all the rules, though it's the least important question of the film. To score, players need to toss a metallic ball into a hole before crossing a line (non too subtle, a red line). A reflection of the entire society, THE GAME is played out on a circular track; thus the players really go nowhere very fast. Rules seem arbitrary and change quite a bit; Jonathan's buddy, Moonpie, just contents himself with surprise attacks on opponents with no regard for real tactics - he's like a rowdy kid, clueless like everyone else. It's all just an outlet for aggression (Moonpie derides the Tokyo team and ends up, ironically, the way Jonathan warned him he would in a joking comment, the one genuine tragic moment). When this film first came out, it faced indifference and derision. Not many bought into the concept of extreme sports shaping a society and danger posed by Jonathan's individualism. I believe Rollerball was at least 30 years ahead of its time, probably more. It's taken this long to gain the appreciation it now has. It'll probably be a few more years until it's regarded as a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best sci-fi films. What makes it so great is that, like the best sci-fi, it is a metaphor as well as a warning for today. Unlike the stupid and pointless remake of Rollerball that was all action and NO message, this original is far smarter. The writer obviously felt that within us all is the inclination to be turned on by mindless violence and thus able to be controlled as a people.In this movie, the opiate for the ignorant masses is a mindless game that does NOTHING to improve mankind. Because, it turns out, the corporations that now rule the Earth WANT the public to be stupid and easily controlled through this sick and violent sport. This sounds a lot like pro sports (or Jerry Springer) TODAY! There were several scenes I particularly enjoyed. One was the party in which guests had fun burning down trees with a flame throwing pistol. Although destructive and pointless, it was a "wonderful time had by all". Another was the deliberate juxtaposition (GREAT WORD--I wish this was SCRABBLE) of some of the most moving and beautiful pieces of classical music with violent images. In fact, the soundtrack alone makes this movie a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I approached this movie as an action flick, and in that sense I was not disappointed. The scenes where the sport of Rollerball is actually being played are top notch; gripping, involving and fast moving. The scenes in between where we see what the main character's personal life is like, those kind of dragged. And the film's attempt at social commentary, well, that just sucked.A good deal of the problem rests with the main character. When he is not playing his sport, he spends a lot of time moping about his palatial estate, moaning about how being rich and famous isn't so great. And yet, like so many rich and famous people who find themselves in such a funk, he doesn't seem the least bit inclined to give up his wealth and fame. Thus, he comes across as a self-absorbed jerk who has everything and laments to a work-a-day audience (i.e., us) "is this all there is? Poor me, poor me!" Yeah, I really feel for you mister rich-and-famous guy.And then there is the theme of individuality in a world that demands absolute conformity. The misfire of this message really comes across in the movies' final scenes. Before the final game begins, we see Johnathan's team glaring at him. They know that they are all going to die because the corporations have arranged this game specifically to get at him. And yet, he survives, and the film ends with a big cheer for the individual, as he is surrounded by the dead and maimed bodies of his friends and teammates. This isn't a vindication of the individual, this is a celebration of solipsism. We are supposed to feel inspired because, although Johnathan may have lost his friends and the people who backed him up, he got what he wanted, and that's what's really important.I will agree with most of the other reviewers that this movie's message has become more relevant as time has gone by. I will disagree though that this has happened in the way the producers intended it to. Modern America has come to celebrate the individual to a point where narcissism isn't considered a problem, but a gift. "Rollerball" truly captures the spirit of narcissism and expects you to rejoice in it. personally, I couldn't.</fullReview>

Man Has forgone questioning 'WHY', for the comfort that has been afforded to everyone on earth, and has even forgotten to question it, that is until Jonathan E comes to the fore, in a game which was created to show to mankind that individual brilliance is futile. This film truly is magnificent with beautiful imagery, and a gore-fest to attract the male audience. There arn't that many films anymore which have this tone, which is a pity!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world of the future, if it was run by a corporation and its executives. In many ways I think this movie is still very relevant. The world is one where a select group of "executives" decide everything for the "good" of the people and the world at large. The corporation believes that everyone should listen to them and follow the system without question, because they're providing people with what they think everyone would want and need. The corporation has even gone so far as to take all information and digitize it in computers, which return the information in a summarized and abridged way for use by the general population. The world is one big corporate machine, full of corruption, censorship, and devoid of all freedoms.James Caan plays Jonathan E. (which I think might be Evans, but I'm not certain, the movie makes it kind of ambiguous by only referencing it once indirectly) the star of the corporations' ultra-violent Rollerball league. Rollerball is supposed to supplant everyone's desires for violence and war by channeling all those energies into the games. Caan is a ten-year veteran of the sport, whose popularity has risen so high that the corporation's executives are beginning to fear him. As a result, they want him to retire because the corporation has decided it is time. I think it is fair to assume they want him to retire so his influence will diminish and he couldn't actually use his influence to upset their delicate structure of rules and regulations. Their plan to remove him backfires. It actually does more damage then just letting Jonathan play on would have done, because he becomes, in the end, more popular than ever.This vision of the future is very plausible to the audience because the use of science and technology isn't out of reach versus what you see today in everyday life. The action is intense and brutal throughout the film. The images of tomorrow are sharp and crisp using architecture and interior design to highlight the very homogeneous look of the corporation's facilities further embellishing the idea that the corporation suppresses all forms of personal display outside of the Rollerball arenas. This is a great movie. Go watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Best Si-Fi films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made Science Fiction films so popular in world cinema industry during these 25 years? The commercial impact of "Star Wars"series, its followers and optical special effects,which began to be replaced by CG.But in 1970s, things were different. SF films of that time has "dramaturgy", "theme", "acting" and, most important things--directors' "thought" and "art".To achieve the proper combination of visual realism and fable-like structure of the story is not easy,because they often contradict each other. In "Rollerball"this is achieved successfully, without any exaggeration of the situation where characters live. Jewison's direction is so delicate, W.Harrison's screenplay is so concise that the depth of the drama may be properly understood only by second viewing.Amazingly enough,this film says nothing about the revolution of people against the society totally controlled by measure corporations,but "implies" and "suggests" it so emotionally at the last sequence that no audience can remain indifferent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's movies like this that make the 70's my favourite decade for film.It's the story of one man's refusal to accept his assimilation into a society run by corporations. Jonathan E is a participant in a violent sport called Rollerball. He becomes so successful and popular that he begins to supersede the sport itself - comparisons in the twentieth century can be made to figures like Muhammad Ali or Michael Jordan. The corporations that run the world also run Rollerball and use it as a method of control. They see people's violent instincts as a threat to the status quo and use the sport as a social tranquiliser. As such, the game is excessively violent, the participants risking death. The spectators support their teams aggressively and frequently enter into near riots. When it's all over, they return to their homes and jobs, Rollerball having provided an outlet for their frustrations.Then things begin to go wrong. If Jonathan E becomes too popular, it threatens the efficiency of the mechanism. Rollerball must reflect the way society works - nobody can succeed as an individual.The heads of the corporations get nervous and decide to force Jonathan to retire. He doesn't understand why and refuses - as a consequence, they change the rules so that each match gets more and more deadly in the hope that he'll be killed and the anti-individualistic ethos will be restored. The more violent the games become, the more violent the spectators become...It's a thought provoking plot that makes one consider the role of television, sport and social control. It reminds me of what happened to Ali when he spoke out against the Vietnam war - the powers that be tried to discredit him. He scared them as he had so much influence on public opinion.Take a moment to consider the popularity of so called 'reality TV' shows like Survivor and Big Brother. Are they so different from what is depicted in this movie? Like Rollerball, their essential ingredient is human suffering. If we're truly honest, we want to see the people argue. It's even better when we get a closeup of the pain on their face right? If they need to go without food for a while to get to a stage where they're at eachother's throats - all the better. Sure - we all say we're not like that - but why do we watch? It's an uncomfortable thought isn't it. To keep ratings high, the traumatic things the participants have to go through are getting worse and worse. How long will it be before national humiliation isn't enough to maintain the viewers interest? Does anybody really believe that the program makers wouldn't include shows with violent aspects if they thought they could get away with it?? What will reality TV be like in 20 years?The acting in the movie is excellent with James Caan, John Houseman and John Beck doing great jobs. Like the society in which they live, they come over as cold - distant. It's pitched just right.The sets are fantastic and are mostly real buildings that were specially selected to create the look. Again, they're sterile and perfectly put over what's going on.The cinematography is great, especially when we get to see the three Rollerball games. Closeups and fast cuts work well giving a good feeling of speed and brutality. The shots of the crowd are especially effective and look like a real riot (just look at real life scenes of soccer violence from here in the UK and you'll see the similarity.)To summarise, if you're a fan of 70's cinema or Sci-Fi, Rollerball is an absolute must. Some say the middle part of the film is boring, but if you watch properly and give it some thought, it's integral to the meaning of the whole picture. The three games of Rollerball are breathtaking and if you just like action movies, it's worth seeing just for those. With the new DVD giving it a fresh lease of life, it's well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for an action film, meaning one with LOTS of action, keep going. The film is NOT about the sport ROLLERBALL. Its ideals, however, are very similar. This film is not about the game, its about the corporate. It is about heroes and having an icon. its about the inspiration to stand up and fight against the corporate. Its ideals are "If you want to play hardball, be prepared to get hit hard." Rollerballers dream of sitting in the big chair and making the big decisions. Which Caan does in the film. Executives dream they are great rollerballers. They have muscles, they bash in faces. But money isn't muscle enough against human spirit, drive, fight and need for competition. In a corporate world, you can not have heroes. But that is about to change.... And this is where the new film is going to suck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a better movie than most. Considering the political climate in the 70's, "Rollerball" had alot to say. I do not think the story background of corporate governments is thin, Jonathan's own ignorance to how they function is the theme. No one really remembers how or why, just that there are. And their fear of his popularity brings to mind Orwellian suggestions. Brutish as the ideal maybe, Jonathan's stands for individual freedom, and identity. The world is portrayed as peaceful, then why such a brutal sport? Can there be no serenity without chaos? I believe the great message from this film is that despite all the technological advances, man is still in the cave, fighting for right to survive the next day. Primitive and harsh, despite the calendar date we thrive on some form of bloodsport, a way to rekindle to the long buried past. A world of luxury, paid for in bones and flesh. I think that all of this went into Jewison's direction, America was still living with Viet Nam, Watergate. Jewison's track record is filled with character's like Jimmy Caan's, Pacino, McQueen, Walken, even Harold Rollin's in a Soldier's Story. Jimmy Cann plays the ball kicker like very few actors. Beck was great too, just loose enough to convey the idea of live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse. And Houseman was perfect casting, his performance is subtle terror of what Jonathan means wrapped in a blanket of envy. This film is always underated, and if I had a top 100 in would be in it.</fullReview>

It is set in a world where corporations have replaced the world's governments, and all the people are subject to the corporations demands. All facets of life are controlled by the board; your mate, your job, when you have to quit. One man, a sports star, refuses to quit when told, and Rollerball is about his struggle to stay alive as a result of his obstinacy. James Caan delivers a sensitive performance as Jonathan E., the Rollerball star of the world. He is haunted by the absence of his former mate, Ella, played by Maud Adams, who was ordered away after a member took a fancy to her. When he is confronted with a forced retirement, Jonathan E. embarks on a quest to find information about the world before corporations, to keep his place in the Rollerball hierarchy, and to regain the woman he loved. The director's commentary on the DVD is outstanding.</fullReview>

The sports action is more credible than the over-dramatic Any Given Sunday; and the use of Houston as the hero's franchise indeed points to the current trend in pro sports of placing teams in Sunbelt markets. Interestingly enough, it also touches on aspects of current arena sports, the globalization of pro sports, and reality tv.

		<shortDescription>An excellent exploration of violence and tyranny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similarly to Death Race 2000 and The Running Man, Rollerball is a fairly big-budget American film concerning a future in which a tyrannical government attempts to eradicate violence by giving its support to an ultra-violent competition in which humans frequently lose their lives. Rollerball is partly a film about people's (men's) apparent need for violence and in this sense bears similarities to Fight Club. Rollerball also bears similarities to 1984 and Brave New World in that (unlike DR2000 and The Running Man) it seeks to explain the development of the all-encompassing government rather than simply accepting its existence. And who is to blame? Corporations of course! This subtle assault on globalisation and international capitalism will bring a smile to any lefty's face.Rollerball is a violent film. The scenes where we observe the sport, 'Rollerball' are disturbing and upsetting, particularly when we watch men on motorcycles and rollerskates unnecessarily risking and losing their lives simply to win a championship. Rollerball is hugely underrated. James Caan delivers, relaxing into his part and and his supporting cast (as the film centres on his character, Jonathan E) are excellent whether portraying brainless citizens or the power-hungry elite. Anyone who enjoys a 'shock' film with a genuine message, question your leaders as well as the morals of capitalism, will love Rollerball. It is simply superb and if, as I did, you vow you will never watch it again, you'll find yourself drawn back to it. Watch this, ignore the re-make.</fullReview>

Well to tell you the truth, this film may have excellent action scenes, but the other 90 % of the film looks like something out of a Francis Ford Coppola (spelling?) film, only in this one the dialogue isn't as ambiguous...sort of. To truely understand what is going on you need to watch this film two or three times and really pay attention to what is being said by the characters.Unfortunately, many people who read the plot summery on the back of the box will be expecting a hardcore action flick...not a long "thinking man's" film.

		<fullReview>One of the grimmest and most effective projections of the corporate future, Rollerball is unrelentingly dark in its portrayal of a high profile athlete(Jonathan E.- James Caan) who begins questioning the assumptions holding his world together. Jewison's visual flair is fully evident in this film, not only during the stomach churning Rollerball sequences, but also in the film's many textured close-ups which reveal the inner states of character's vaguely distressed with their shallow surroundings but still complacent due to material comfort and narcotic sedation. The corporate fuedal structure of the culture isn't explained in detail, rather the viewer is immediately thrown into Jonathan's world. We're not quite sure how the global corporations retain control because Jonathan and the rest of the citizens don't seem to care. Gradually we learn more of the executive ruling class as Jonathan begins probing the layers of the corporate hierarchy. Rather than explicitly and clumsily explaining away everything, Jewison shows the nature of this future world through visual metaphors and startling vignettes. The most memorable of these occurs when a throng of young executives, after a night of inebriated decadence, spend the dawn running through a field, randomly firing a high powered laser gun at trees and setting them on fire. This film is moody and cerebral from start to finish, opening with "Tocatta En Fugue" booming on the soundtrack while the deadly rollerball track is prepared and closing with a haunting, ambiguous close-up that lingers long after the film has ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rollerball is very much a comment on 70's society. It is not shallow when watched in depth. On the surface it seems to be about a violent sport but there are many different layers. Jonathan (the main character) has to face up to reality in a big way, and its not very nice. Watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Rollerball is a must see science fiction classic. The story is what makes this film good. Although the special effects and sets leave a lot to the imagination the inspiration of seeing one man against a whole system is exhilarating. The movie is not about Rollerball but instead is about individual freedom and what happens when it is taken away. The icing on this cake is the rugged character played by James Caan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ever feel that you're living in a world run by Reebok and Coca-Cola, and you're sure that those in charge don't know what the hell they're doing, then check out James Caan as he heads out to kick some corporate keisters. In the future, corporations own the cities and each city has its own Rollerball team: Rollerball is like a Mad Max style of roller derby with motorcycles and spikes and steel balls used to smash faces before getting shot into the goal to score. James Caan's "Jonathan E." (sp?) has gotten too popular for a game where individuality is supposed to be eliminated, and the head honchos want him to retire. But Jimmy loves the game too much, and he's wondering why his bosses have been screwing up his life. What he finds out about his society is ultimately what most good sci-fi is about: realizing that power lies with the individual....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sport that Caligula would have grooved on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the action is set in the year 2018 for this 1977 film you have to ask yourself just how close are we to the world that Rollerball projects for our future? Decisions in corporate board rooms are becoming more important than those of elected and unelected governments and we are truly in the more civilized sections of the globe becoming obsessed with diversions. Back in Roman days they called it bread and circuses. But even in Roman times certain individuals rose to the top by dint of their skill in the arena. Just look at how Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd were acclaimed for their skills.But the corporate powers as signified by John Houseman have devised a game in which the individual must ultimately go down and bloody enough to satisfy the most rabid fan. Rollerball takes some of the most violent elements of football, motocross, hockey, and roller derby and have fashioned a game where death in the arena is almost as common as in Caligula's time. In fact Caligula would have grooved on Rollerball and Commodus might have participated.James Caan is Jonathan E who because he has survived far longer than any other player is in danger of becoming that most horrible of all things, a star/celebrity. That the corporate world can't permit so he's got to leave the game one way or another. Caan can't quite figure out why his corporate masters want him out so bad, but he learns because in addition to being tough, he's not stupid. He and Houseman are an unmatched, but interesting set of adversaries.Some other interesting performances in Rollerball are Maud Adams as Caan's ex-wife who was taken from him because some corporate big shot had more pull. She's the ultimate dangle put in front of him to quit the game. There's also John Beck as is teammate and best friend and Ralph Richardson as the keeper of the ultimate computer housed in Geneva that knows all that humankind has learned, but gives out knowledge on a need to know basis.Rollerball is a look at a sterile world we may have in store for us where individual achievement is a relic of the past. Let's hope we're not headed there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>satire as protest as entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people think satire has to be funny. They confuse satire with parody. Satire can be grim, and usually has a very serious point. Parody by definition is supposed to make you laugh. As such, the hapless remake of "Rollerball" is unintentional parody - an imitation of quality that doesn't mean to make fun of itself but does. The original found gallows humor in exploiting a ridiculous trend of the period - roller derby - and using it as a metaphor for the consumer culture.The 1975 "Rollerball" is a hugely competent satire of American society, especially its relationship to the media-driven sporting event cycle that, as Noam Chomsky reminds us, only exists to distract us from things that are really important. In "Rollerball," what's important is the fascist state. The libraries are full of Cliff's Notes; corporate executives can take your wife anytime; the only thing on TV is a murderous circus of motorcycles and rollerskates, an orchestrated auto-da-fe of individual achievement whose theme song is Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. Now that's pretty funny.While he also plays an excellent fast-talking wise guy ("Freebie and the Bean," "The Gambler"), James Caan is very credible as a not terribly eloquent brute ("Godfather," "Thief"), and he makes a great superjock. The pain and confusion in his performance may be partly due to his 70s cocaine addiction, but so what? His face is watchable, emotive, lovable, credible. His body is properly muscular and hairy and just a little beat-up. And if his wardrobe is a little silly, again, so what? This is a world in which the suits drop MDMA at black tie affairs and blow up trees for amusement; why shouldn't the famous athletes walk around in bolero outfits and funny hats? The choreography and photography of the actual rollerball games is surprisingly effective thirty years on, the stunts more viscerally interesting than the guy-wire acts of modern HK-influenced action movies. And John Houseman is even better here than in "Paper Chase," as a man with such jagged morals that you can't enter his office without cutting yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overall good film but could have a little more clarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1975 version of Rollerball is an overall reasonably good film, but it probably could have a little more clarity about the setting of the plot. In official summaries, advertisements and trailers of the film which I have seen it says that it is set in the year 2018, when as a result of the "Corporate Wars" there is a global corporate society which takes precedence over all governments as we know them rendering official government titles like presidents and prime ministers and the birthright of Kings useless. In this future corporate society a new sport called rollerball takes the place of other team sports like football, soccer and basketball as well as of war. The whole aim of rollerball seems to be to control the population in the hopes that the players will eventually die. However, Johnathon E. seems to be a bit too good at this game, lasting 10 years in professional rollerball, longer than any other player ever. Therefore, the corporate executives fear him as someone who could lead to the demise of their entire system of society, and they want him to retire and when he refuses they change the rules in the hopes that he will die. Once again one of those evil sci-fi cinemas about futuristic totalitarianism that always gives me a somewhat scary feeling.The film is as I said basically a good movie, but it could have a little more clarity about the plot. At the beginning it says "And now, our corporate anthem." and that is probably the only clue you get that something is amiss in the film. All throughout the film you get the feeling that more should be revealed about the society which the people of this futuristic corporate state live in and how it came to be, but it seems to be just hard to follow for the lack of details. If the film had a few more details about the background of the setting it would probably be much better, but because it doesn't that brings the quality down considerably, so I have to give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a dark under tone to it; it's more applicable to today's world than it was in the 70's. Its more applicable because today's world is ever closer to being controlled by big business. Government's are in hegemony with big business to a greater degree than ever. Government troops all over the world even depend on big business like Haliburton to be fed. Whatever happened to Army cooks? So our armies would starve without Halliburton and the likes. There was influence decades ago, today, that influence is more like control. Still, like in RUSH 2112 music of the same past era, can one man defeat the giants? Will his passion and love for his friends and family long since passed be enough? In reality, no is the likely answer, we shall see in the coming decades who will control out resources.

		<shortDescription>the rumbling nightmare of Rollerball,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid growing up in rural Snohomish, Washington in the 70's i was a big fan of this movie; I was thrilled, involved &amp; excited by the furiously nasty snap of the game, which is not at all what the director Norman Jewsion intended; ( sorry, i was only 8 or 9!) Then a few years ago i read the short story by William Harrison and was struck by its sense of poetry, nostalgia and loss and also its sense of danger and foreboding--it really makes the game seem scary-- its quite a nice piece of writing. Then i watched the film again and was struck by how much of that melancholy tone from the story Jewison was able to capture in the film, without sacrificing any of the punch of the Rollerball games themselves. Ah, the 1970's! The last decade before sci fi got blanded-out and watered down for mass-consumption. While watching this film you get a sense of intelligence at work; a sense of something being communicated besides crass marketing of toys and tie-ins. This is one sci fi film that looks remarkably contemporary-- no one wears anything made of silver spandex-- and the themes--of depersonalization in the face of consumerism, of corportate-ruled societies filled with a drugged-out leisure class, of the slick and cynical packaging of violence as entertainment in modern sporting spectacles--are as timely as ever. I hate to say this but if you want to see just what an intelligent, thoughtful and well-made film ROLLERBALL is all you have to do is watch the incredibly stupid, insulting and uncalled for re-make; Its garbage, totally worthless. This one is a gem. And special mention must be made of JAMES CAAN who seems so perfectly at ease in the role that you'd think he really was a professional athlete in a dangerous future sport; he inhabits the role in a way that makes it impossible to imagine anyone else playing the part. He is especially good, oddly enough, in the quieter, more reflective scenes where he manages to suggest his character's loneliness and isolation with a mimimum of expression. Its a nicely modulated interior performance, perfectly countered by his furious grace and power when he is dispatching foes on the Rollerball track. Also excellent is JOHN HOUSEMAN, who has one of the biggest roles of his career here as the all powerful Mr Bartholomew, head of the ENERGY Corporation; he has an air of the tired aristocrat about him-- suave, jaded and menacing-- perfect for the role. The DVD edition offered here is a great bargain; the film hasn't looked this good since it was released in theatres in 1975! And Norman Jewison provides an interesting and enlightening commentary. I am glad to see that MR Jewsion seems to have a certain fondness for this film because in my opinion its one of the best science fiction films that has ever been made and it joins SOYLENT GREEN and PUNISHMENT PARK as one of the benchmarks of 1970's cautionary sci fi film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Rollerball again. Haven't seen it in years. It still holds up as one of the very best SciFi films. It's well made, the acting is good, the message still works. Now that I'm older, I find the film even more sinister than when I was younger. The party scene where the women are really into the violence on the TV screen is just chilling. I listened to the director's comments and I really think that he achieved what he intended: a film that decries violence and the trend towards a corporate dominated world. He thought then (and this is the a point made in the short story) that sports were becoming more and more gladiatorial. That sports stars were becoming more important and were earning higher and higher salaries, and what does that say about how we value intelligence, creativity, and community service? That was 1975. Look where we are now. And the music was perfect. Still one of my favorites some 29 years after it was released. - markmcf</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Film For 70's Enthusiasts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a fine line between subtle political commentary and heavy handed, over bearing rhetoric. This film walks that line and dips a toe into both realms, which results in a film that is rather wishy washy and somewhat pointless. There are times when director Norman Jewison captures beautiful images in the style of Stanley Kubrick and occasionally the mood is strikingly similar to A Clockwork Orange, but the similarities are superficial for the most part. On the other hand, this film cleverly uses sports as bait to get more viewers to come along, even though this film really has little to do with athletics and considerably more to do with human rights and government control of the media. James Caan was the only reason I watched this movie, and for all his talents, I could not become interested enough in his character to really care how it all turned out. The film suffers mostly by being too long and misleading as far as the sports aspect is concerned.Though, really the actual rollerball derby scenes are very cool and are the main reason to watch this, but for the length of this film, those scenes are few and far between. Anyone interested in past blockbusters will enjoy it one level or another anyhow.6 out of 10</fullReview>

And Jonathan does not want to let his team down. James Caan gave a great performance has Jonathan E. I liked how he refused to give up. The character was very well written and nobody could have played that part better then he did. Not even Chris Klein. This film is better then the remake. And had a better ending.

		<fullReview>A possible future. Corporate executives are the superstars. To them, fame, fortune, and their hearts desire. It is the ultimate achievement. Rollerball is the panacea of the masses. They are "cow-ed" by constant reminders of the futility of individual effort. The sporting arena is used to channel man's animalistic nature. The world is mesmerized by "ROLLERBALL". There are no heroes, ultimately. All that matters is the game (and the "tame" mobs of fans, after the games ("tame"), of course). Jonathan E. changes all that. He is the best of the best. To put him in his place the game degenerates from ritual combat to gladitorial warfare (to the death). Jonathan E. has enemies in "high" places, but in the Rollerball arena, he rules.An interesting tale of "A" man against "the machine". I very much enjoyed this on the big screen (small screen doesn't do it). It's a believe-able sport created for this movie. I never understood why it never caught on. Not only would I have attended games, I would have gladly played.Even if the story doesn't "grab" you, the game scenes are "electric" and worth the cost of a rental.

		<shortDescription>overlooked classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An overlooked classic from the mid-seventies, Rollerball took elements of escalating violence of the NFL and NHL, the emergence of corporate global domination, consumerism and the encroachment of network television and repackaged it for domestic consumption. " There are no rules..." On the surface we have a fairly simple story of a future sports star athlete in what might be his final season, yet beneath there are elements of a far greater story being told. It is only a shame that this underlying story is told perhaps too obliquely. For example, listen to the awful corporate anthem played at the beginning of the game; a pathetic meandering combination of sounds- completely heartless, without spirit- it is just there to fill a void where it saw one, and it has no purpose beyond that, and so it fails to inspire. We have a team of men united together playing a sport that is so dangerous it frequently kills them. This is where when we consider why they choose to do this we can begin to see the outline of an underlying story. Rollerball is a fairly exciting movie to watch on any level. Not nearly as mystical as the Matrix, but the warning is perhaps far more ominous because the reality is already here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rollerball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about the apparently rubbish 2002 film with American Pie's Chris Klein, but I had no idea it was a remake, so it was only right to watch the original 1975 version first, directed by Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, The Thomas Crown Affair, Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck). Basically in the not too distant future, the year 2018, the world is a global corporate state, society is controlled by corporations, there is no more crime and there are no more wars. A violent sport called Rollerball has become globally popular, two teams in body armour on roller skates, three are on motorcycles to tow fellow team members, travel on a banked, circular track, to get possession of a small steel ball, fired from a cannon, to throw and hit it on the goal, a magnetic, cone-shaped area on the wall, there is close contact as the opposing team try to take possession of the ball. Energy Corporation sponsors the Houston team, Jonathan E. (James Caan) is the veteran star of the Houston rollerball team, but Energy Corporation chairman Mr. Bartholomew (John Houseman) wants him to retire, he offers him a large sum if he agrees to announce retirement on a special programme about his career, Jonathan struggles to understand why. Jonathan continues playing, despite threats from Bartholomew, the game of rollerball changes as the rules are made more dangerous, in order to force Jonathan out, there is also a point where the sinister corporate forces attempt to kill him, he even gets a surprise visit from his ex-wife Ella (Maud Adams), who confesses the corporation ordered her to convince him to retire. As the game of rollerball reaches the Final, Jonathan is still willing to play, despite many players being incapacitated and killed, the crowd are raucous and energetic, subdued by the building carnage, after violent struggles, the world watches in silence, until Jonathan scores the final point and wins the game for Houston against New York, Mr. Bartholomew exits the arena, knowing that the purpose of the game has been defeated. Also starring John Beck as Moonpie, Moses Gunn as Cletus, Pamela Hensley as Mackie, Barbara Trentham as Daphne, Ralph Richardson as Librarian, Shane Rimmer as Rusty, Team Executive, Burt Kwouk as Japanese Doctor and Richard LeParmentier as Bartholomew's Aide. Caan as the loner champion going against the system is good, Houseman does well in his moments as the vicious corporate villain doing whatever it takes to get rid of him, most of the film is a bit slow with chatty sequences about corruption and politics, but the pace is just about kept up by the energetic and brutal games of rollerball, a lethal mix of hockey, roller derby, motorbike racing and gang warfare, it's a reasonable dystopian science-fiction sports action film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched this film for the first time in many years, probably over 25. I remember it as being violent but compulsive viewing and it remains the same.The film is futuristic but clearly reflects the world of its time, the mid-1970s. No doubt many will be able to draw a range of pseudo-philosophical meanings from it but I prefer to be a little more simplistic. One man stands out against the corporation which aims to control both the game and the people who watch it; he threatens to become bigger than the game and the bosses want rid of him. Yes, this can be seen as an allegory for the Vietnam War and in general for the feelings of a significant part of the population of the USA at the time. In the end, the 'hero' wins, for the moment at least.The film is undoubtedly powerful and, despite a few slow moments, it is exciting; it's also quite brutal. However, by the standards of the 'cgi' world of 2015 it's actually pretty tame and there isn't really that much blood and gore. I have no idea what a modern youngish audience makes of it, but I still find it an interesting and oddly enjoyable offering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future, the world is run by corporate monopolies after the corporate wars. Nation states have been long gone. Jonathan E. (James Caan) is the veteran star of the Houston rollerball team. Rollerball is a game with motorcycles and rollerskaters on a circular track that is played around the world. Corporate leader Bartholomew (John Houseman) tells him to retire. He refuses and tries to investigate the history of the corporations which has mostly been scrubbed. The rules of the game are relaxed and the games become more dangerous.James Caan is great but this world is an unconvincing mess. If the world is such a dictatorial world, it should be easy to get rid of one man. Bartholomew's reason for his method is so academic that it makes no sense for the everyday Joe. This near-future world doesn't have enough realism. The film seems to be trying to make a point about individuality which is completely lost on me. The game itself is a chaotic vision of gladiatorial sports. It's fun violence but it does get repetitive. It's not like the rules are explained and the results matter. At least, it's more fun than the story.</fullReview>

But seeing it again nowadays it is a strange flick. It takes place in the future and you can see that with the excellent settings used. The story itself is a bit weird and the main reason, why Jonathan E (Caan) has to quit isn't explained at all. The took his wife away from him and the only thing he wants is to see her again but things turn out differently. The rollerball game itself do offer some nasty shots, nowadays it is laughable but back then it was a rather rough flick.

Anyway, I finally sat down and watched this uninterrupted?it was okay.I really liked the sequences showing the game of Rollerball (even though I still laughed at the skates and people looking like they are on the verge of having the skates come out from under them at any moment) and I felt the story was fairly decent with its themes and such. However, the film definitely feels dated and I wasn't really that into James Caan's performance.

Story takes place in 2018 and the world is a global corporate state, a hegemony of six ruling cartels. There are no wars, poverty and etc, so the cartels provide the antidote to pent up frustrations with Rollerball, a bloodthirsty arena sport where no quarter is given or taken. But when the sports number one star, Jonathan E, becomes a free spirit and too big for the sport, the corporations aim to retire him?Headed by a superb James Caan as Jonathan, the performances are from the high end, the photography superb and the action during the games themselves is beautifully choreographed. The use of classical music to run concurrent with the themes in the narrative is smartly rendered to the tricksy plot, while the writing is sharp and deserving of the utmost attention from the viewer. It's folly to suggest that when the film is away from the Rollerball ring it sags a touch, so patience is required and a respect of literate posturing is also expected to get the most out of it.A deftly crafted dystopian sci-fier with literate smarts and lusty blood letting. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, visionary, intelligent sci-fi of the type they don't seem to make anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this as a kid and was totally engrossed in the game, really wanted to play Rollerball for real although I'm a lousy skater (maybe I could have ridden one of the motorbikes?). Reputedly the cast and crew actually did play Rollerball (presumably with penalties, substitutions and time limits rather than the ultimate no holds barred version we see at the end?) in between takes and really got into it. I wonder if there's any film of that? In the 70s 2000AD magazine had a comic strip 'inspired' by Rollerball where the players wore jetpacks which is about the only way you could make the game more exciting.What makes it special though is that it's not just a glorification of a brutal futuristic sport but a study of the role of the individual in a civilized society. Thomas Mann would recognise the concept although he probably wouldn't have included motorbikes in it. The future is depicted as a quasi-benign dictatorship as Plato always advocated. We have no wars, no crime, no poverty, corporations run the show and conflicts are confined to the boardroom and stock exchange. People are free within the system as long as they don't question the established order. Some have described it as fascist but actually it strikes me as more communistic, the individual sublimated for the sake of the greater good. However mankind never changes so an outlet is needed for aggression and populist entertainment. Hence we have Rollerball. Problem is in a society which values conformity Jonathan E has become an individualistic superstar and that threatens the whole nature of society. Great performance from James Caan and equally great from John Houseman who isn't exactly the villain, it's very subtle on his part, you can't really be sure who's right or wrong in all this (noticeably Houseman's character doesn't want Jonathan to have an 'accident'). Also like Shame Rimmer as the team manager, the obedient corporate stooge who tells it as it is but still cares about his team, trying to prevent an injured Jonathan E from going back out to probable death during the final game (the New York manager noticeably succeeding in doing the same for one of his players). Fantastic music too, the classical influence contrasting with the sheer brutality of the game. And it is still shocking after all these years, the scene where the injured player slides down the rink leaving a bloody trail behind him still makes you cringe. You're so happy that Jonathan spares the final New York player and then goes on to score the final point, to him it's still all about the game rather than the violence. No offence to Star Wars but it rather killed the more thoughtful sci-fi we had in the 1970s, Silent Running, Dark Star, Logan's Run, THX 1138, Westworld, Solaris, The Omega Man etc. The only bad thing is Jonathan's trip to the the computer bank in Geneva which is utterly baffling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Present predicted...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't have to tell anyone who's made it this far that ROLLERBALL, in retrospect, seems prescient. Corporate team sports have become the norm, with athletes proudly adorning themselves with corporate logos and tap-dancing to the tunes of their corporate masters as fast as they can. (There may come a time when the corporations will require the athletes they sponsor to tattoo the company logo on their hides...) Individuality (of the sort found in sports like boxing) has pretty much fallen by the wayside, for the most part (the odd fight turns up on cable or pay-per-view, but NEVER on Corporate Networks any more; and only superstar fighters with Brand Names are known to the general public). Jonathan E is the Muhammad Ali of his era, an individual who stands out- and, like the proverbial nail that must be hammered down, he finds himself under assault from The Corporation(s). Like the so-called Rules of Engagement meant to lessen the murder(s) in warfare, there are penalties in Rollerball, but those penalties are waived in response to Jonathan's celebrity to allow for greater carnage- which the Rollerballers promptly deliver (like the grunts who kill nowadays in the name of Corporations). Whether it's Team Sports like football or basketball or the military, it's ALL carefully designed to foster The Group Mind approach to winning. It's the individual who's NOT a Team Player that must be hammered down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!, no, the crowd is not cheering at a March Madness tournament game. This crowd is cheering for the greatest rollerball player from Houston Energy, and in the game, Jonathan E. Rollerball is the only sport left in this futuristic society. It's gladiatorial combat with players on roller skates and motorcycles wearing crash helmets and spiked gloves. The teams are run by corporations, who also happen to control the world. Or at least they control what is left of the world after nation states were dissolved and the corporate wars ended. Is the world a utopian society where everyone's needs are met,or is it a dystopian nightmare where corporations destroy free thought and action while sucking the soul out of its denizens?At first it seems like Jonathan has it all. He's the greatest player in the only sport in the world, and on a defending championship team. The Houston corporation has him set up in a bucolic house, where he sits in the futuristic lap of luxury. He has a stable of hot women that the Houston Energy Corporation rotates every six months so he does not get bored. As a rare non-executive power player, he seems to be one of the few people sitting at the top of the success pyramid in this corporate society.However, Jonathan soon begins to question his place in society and society in general after he is suddenly asked to retire by Bartholomew, the executive running Houston Energy. In world where the corporate interests don't value individual achievement and success, it seems that Jonathan has become too big for the game and too popular. This request/order also seems to reignite in Jonathan some anger he has buried, about an Executive stealing his wife from him when he was a younger player.With only a few games left before the championships, the corporate overlords start tinkering with the rules of the game. In a bizarre change of the rules, penalties will no longer be accessed and substitutions are limited. The more Jonathan questions what the executives and their sycophants are doing, the more they attempt to force his retirement by any means necessary. Will Jonathan quit the game he loves and retire to his blissful corporate provided horse ranch, or will he stand by his teammates in the quest for another championship?Rollerball, follows in the footsteps of the Kubrick films 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. While it pays homage too and is similar to those films, it gets tripped up along the way. The rollerball action scenes in the film are spectacular and fun to watch. It's pretty much a sci-fi gladiatorial combat film. The films failings mostly lie in the message the film is trying to put forward with regards to society run amok, with no free will and a lack of morality. Although a few scenes about this aspect of the film work, a lot of screen time is spent listening to Cann mumble, reflect upon his past, and fly around the globe trying to get to the bottom of things.Jewison, speaks about not wanting the film to be too violent, because he did not want it to distract from the larger message of the film. However, the best parts of the film are when the mayhem starts in the rollerball oval. If the film had focused a bit more on the rollerball action, and retooled the message about society, so it wasn't so rambling and disjointed, this would have been a stronger film. Rollerball seems to suffer from a bit of editing problems, as in, they took out too much action and force fed too much introspective drama.Rollerball is a good film, but not a great film, it has some obvious flaws. It is certainly worth checking out even if just for the rollerball action scenes. While the larger message of the film gets a bit lost with some heavy-handed screen writing and direction, the theme does resonate today. In an era where some politicians and parts of the government have deemed that "corporations are people", the film may appear prophetic. At its core Rollerball is a science fiction film with a man vs society message. You will find yourself unable to not root for Jonathan E., as he skates around the track and battles his opponents, be they opposing players, or corporate overlords.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder and mayhem at the roller rink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rollerball" is a movie of ideas, presenting a dystopian future in the style of "Logan's Run" (though with a lot less camp). The world is under complete corporate control (cities and countries are owned and maintained by megaconglomerates), while the bloody and dehumanizing Rollerball tournaments pacify the enslaved populace.James Caan is the athlete extraordinaire of the brutal sport (a game that's little more than a fight to the death). But the game was designed top show the futility of individualism. So when Caan's star shines a bit too brightly, his fat cat slave-owners want him out of the game.When watching the actual Rollerball matches, the game is rather silly. Grown men rolling on skates in a circle throwing punches doesn't live up to the wicked image of Caan's spike-gloved fist on the movie poster. And it's not just Caan's performance, but everyone involved comes off as rather subdued. That, coupled with the sparsity of the matches (given the film's 2-hour runtime) and the film tends to drag.So the ideas take center stage. People are provided for but are also complacent, while the suit-wearing executives are at the wheel of it all. Depending on one's level of cynicism, the themes in this movie may hit a little close to home. Hell, make Rollerball a reality show, and you've got something very close to "The Running Man" (which is not far off from our current state of affairs).6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but commendably ambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mixture of speedway, roller-skating, basketball and raw gladiatorial combat: that's rollerball, sport of the future, opium of the people, and the subject of Norman Jewison's eponymous film, which tells the story of Jonathan E., the star who becomes too big for the game. There's much that can be criticised in this movie, but also much to admire. On the downside, the future is rendered very much in accordance with a now-dated 1970s vision of modernism; the crowd scenes never truly come to life; we never really get an impression of how people who are not rollerball stars actually live; and most crucially, the players seem to possess an unexplained indifference to the imminence of death. The last point is actually quite important - the psychology of facing extinction is an underplayed element in the film, when a plot is launched to kill Jonathan, it's impact is diminished by the fact that people seem to die, largely uncared for, as a normal result of conventional play. On the other hand, the movie stages several games of rollberball for us, itself an achievement in an age before computer graphics; foresees the sybaritic lifestyles of contemporary sports stars; and paints a bold, impressionistic vision of future society - the details may be missing, but Jewison is quite audacious (for a director of a mainstream movie) in how he uses images and (mostly classical) music to reveal the essence of the world. Moreover, there's also something of the feel of 'The Parallax View' and other classic 1970s conspiracy thrillers about this film; the sense that the truth is always hidden behind the next corner (that's not my phrase, but it better describes the Kennedy/Watergate-inspired mood of the best of American movies of this period better than any I can create myself). 'Rollerball' is by no means perfect, but it does seem reminiscent of an age when Hollywood was more adventurous; it was recently remade, but surely what today's studios should have been doing was not copying the formula, but making a 'Rollerball' of their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame Nixon for gems like Rollerball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In that not so distant future corporations rule our lives, nations have been eradicated and everyone watches a violent sport called Rollerball. So is this a science-fiction vision or a documentary about modern life? The 1970s were a trying time for sure because this genre exploded during the entire decade with such films as A Clockwork Orange, Logan's Run, Soylent Green, Death Race 2000, A Boy And His Dog (a personal favourite), Silent Running, THX 1138, Mad Max, Sleeper and The Omega Man.Why? Blame Nixon. Cynicism was rampant after Watergate (even though some of these films were made before 1974). The Vietnam war which was ruining the moral of the United States was a major contributor to dark visions of the future with endless wars and oppressive government bodies.Further evidence of this is shown by the resurgence of dystopian films in the 2000s (post Iraq war). All it takes is a Republican president and a vastly unpopular war to spawn many classic dark and satirical gems like Rollerball.Dystopian films from the 2000s which are worth a look: Equilibrium, Idiocracy, A Scanner Darkly, V For Vendetta, Children Of Men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a teenager when I saw this movie for the first time at the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles and my head would duck real fast each time that one of those chrome cannonballs was shot out of those big guns into the gutter on the upper rim of the track. It was so realistic to me that I was dodging the chrome cannonballs from my theater seat, very bitch-en film-making. Corporate executives keep changing the rules of the increasingly violent sport of the future in an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the greatest player of all time. I like the theme that... "No man can be bigger than the game itself" ... No man, except for... Jonathan E. , Rollerball Champion! Jon--a--than, Jon--a-Than, JON-a-THAN, JONATHAN!!! I left the theater so pumped up and so fired up, I was ready to kick everyones ass! Too bad I was just a shrimpy queeb back then that couldn't kick anyones ass, oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this again on TV last night. One reviewer wrote "the film might have concluded with a standard, comforting triumph-of-the-human-spirit message, but instead it freezes on a deliberately distorted shot of Jonathan with Bach's portentious music indicating what awaits." I seem to remember seeing this film long ago with a different ending which was something like this: Bartholomew is pressured to commit suicide, as a Samurai would, for his failure to get Jonathan out of the game. My memory is quite old. I could be wrong. The theme seemed more the threat of centralized power to freedom of human emotion and relationships as well as human worth. There was the trafficking of women ...and those pills. Did the pills help control the "unwashed masses" somehow? I consider it a good film which could have been great with a little shift of certain emphases and detail alterations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie where athletic skating men play the most rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the beginning of the movie is very, very dramatic. It would be perfect for Halloween, as you hear the "Toccata and Fugue in D minor for Organ" by J.S. Bach over a darkened roller arena. (It is the same music that ends the movie too.)Soon, the arena's lights and scoreboard are lit up, as the arena crew, their fans, and the skaters themselves--- prepare for what I call "extreme roller derby." The pre-game fanfare which involved a fictional corporate anthem played on an organ was powerful. And the test ball firing before the game is like baseball players going onto the field in a ballpark.This roller derby environment was almost similar to the short-lived TV series called "Rollergames", which had the usual illicit fighting like what happens in "Rollerball", and even an alligator pit, as well as the famous "wall of death", which looks like a skateboard halfpipe where a skater who goes on it can earn extra points.But no "wall of death" occurs in Rollerball, although the simple circular arena can feel like a "wall of death." It was a "wall of death" at the end of the movie when New York and Houston squared off in a championship match with "no penalties, no substitutions, and no time limit"--all with Jonathan E's request!!!I especially like the scene where the Tokyo team warns the Houston team that they will use "karate and hapkido techniques." The Houston team responds to Tokyo's warning by shouting the name "Houston" in a repeating chant that increases in noise so much that it feels like a quick version of Ravel's "Bolero" in the famous crescendo that is the big hook of the piece.During Tokyo-Houston match, I had pulled for Jonathan E. to intimidate the Tokyo team with Jonathan's niche for fighting off even those skating opponents who are into martial arts. But when a Tokyo player "death blows" Jonathan E's teammate out of commission....leaving him brain-dead, I felt sorry for Jonathan, who couldn't do anything about him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be fooled, one of the BEST films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball is one hell of a movie. It masterfully combines great action with big ideas. Many people nowadays are turned off by the slightly dated feel of the film, but that passes quickly once you give Rollerball a chance. Rollerball is great film-making and you can watch it over and over and still find something you missed. Amazingly the film's message is getting more and more meaningful over time, unlike so much of older sci-fi. The gist plot is that in the future people have sacrificed all freedom and responsibility in return for comfort. No one cares who makes decisions or makes policy because they are smothered in diversions: drugs, parties, and of course the shockingly violent game Rollerball. Most memorable are the actual game sequences which are pulse- pounding and gory...but the devil is in the details. The fantastic party scene (actually an homage to the great party scene from Renoir's "Rules of the Game') is so full of brilliant detail it brings this future world to life. And I have to mention actress Maude Adams. She plays Ella, a secondary character, the ex-wife of the great Rollerball player Johnathan E. Johnathan has lost Ella (I won't give away this particular futuristic twist) and spends most of the first half of the film pining for her. When she at last appears, for a very small part of the film, she does not disappoint. Maud Adams looks better in this movie than in any other, she appears nearly ethereal, and her performance is wonderful. The audience not only understands why Johnathan, who has everything a man can want, can not get over the loss of Ella, but the viewer gets caught up believing in Johnathan's fight against society. Not to belittle the other actors at all, though. John Houseman is perfectly awe-inspiring, and James Caan is perfectly cast as the disillusioned sports idol. Rollerball's sets and costumed may be right out of the 70's, but most of the clothes and furniture are back 'In' and very high style decades later. Anyone can watch this nicely paced film, and many will be jolted by realizing that once upon a time directors were artist and studios made art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A contradiction of Plato's "Criton" and Socrates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When William Harrison made the short story that influenced the making of this film he had to have read Plato's "Criton", since this movie is the exact contradiction of that masterpiece. In "Criton", Socrates is unjustly in jail, where he awaits the death penalty, when Criton comes to tell him that he should escape, Socrates tells him that he can't do that because then everything he preached all his life, to obey laws, would mean nothing, hence the estate of Athens would fall to the ground, and it would make it okay for other citizens to break laws. And Athens gave everything to Socrates, hence Socrates owes everything to Athens. Now how Jonathan E. contradicts Socrates: In Rollerball there is a fascist state where every social accomplishment is a result of collectivity (team-play) not individualism. The game has been designed to make these collectivity values real and apparent. Jonathan E. is refuting the purpose of the game, which is a political purpose. The game has a political aspect in its structure, and the paradox is that in order to keep the game, they prefer to take away all the rules to show that there is no individual success in rollerball, only collective success. In Rollerball, there is the conflict between the citizen and the state. The state maintains the subordination of the individual when it destroys all history and information. Also, the state denies all decision making. The equilibrated ideology of Bartholomew is that all dreams and aspirations are capable inside the system, hence he talks to the team in the beginning saying that the players want to be executives, and the executive players, which is possible for everyone. In Ella and Jonathan E.'s conversation, she tells him that all former history was to find a comfortable style of living, which is something people have now, where all vital things and necessities are covered, so Jonathan E. asks himself what is he giving up in exchange for commodities, where liberties are taken away. You see, Socrates would have just been thankful to the state for everything that they have provided for him, and even if it was unjust he would have retired when asked for, yet Jonathan E., isn't only not thankful, but also challenges the state by not retiring and ::::::::SPOILER::::::::: making the final goal in the final game, where even without rules nor TEAMMATES, his individualism destroys the state's point of collectiveness and corporate society....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very interesting and well-made, but James Caan is surprisingly tentative and dull as the lead character. There are a number of memorable scenes, though. John Houseman is great. His presence adds a lot of authority and seriousness to the movie. The violence is presented in such a way that it glamorizes the very thing that the film is supposed to be preaching against. But that glamorized violence is one of the memorable things about the movie. James Caan is interesting in the movie, because he seems kind of foggy and hazy, and although he certainly looks macho and masculine, he seems to be kind of unfocused in his dialog and facial expressions. Compare this with his focus in the Godfather and it's a noticeable difference. I've seen this film a number of times, and while there are some interesting qualities, it seems like it could have been more developed and memorable than it is. John Beck is especially good as a macho colleague of James Caan, and he gives the film a much-needed freshness and sense of humor and jocularity. He saves the film from being too dry and serious. All in all, it's definitely worth seeing, and has the feel of a movie made in the 1970's, when they made violent films that were also thoughtful. Nowadays, a movie with this kind of theme would undoubtedly be made for a much younger audience, and would be very watered-down, more superficial, less experimental and more MTVish. It's too bad they don't make movies like this any more (unless it was an independent movie, in which case the lower-budget would affect the look and realism of the film).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this movie has recently been remade, and I'm sure that the remake will be much, much more violent, with a driving rock sound-track, and that it will be perfectly awful. The thing I like about this film, which I saw when it first came out, and again recently, was the nice contrast between the violence of the game and the classical music soundtrack. The scenes outside the game all showed an attempt at great cultural refinement. The opening scene, which was of the team filing into the empty arena to Bach's "Toccata fugue in D minor" was absolutely brilliant. Some of the stuff seems silly now, the "futuristic" scenes, which worked in 1975, are incredibly dated. John Houseman gave a wonderful performance as the amoral executive, as did Ralph Richardson as the batty librarian, with a computer that rivalled the "Hal 2000" in Kubrick's 2001. James Caan, who plays the lead character, was at the height of his acting ability, and his methody treatment of the athlete who got too big for his own good is just right. He also has the broadest shoulders I've ever seen, but Oh! those leisure suits with zippers were too, too much....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The legendary Cowboy seems to emerge as an easily identifiable Hero for the movie fan. From the classic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to the more contemporary Easy Rider(Peter Fonda, the spur wearing biker, riding an iron horse with sidekick "Billy the Kid") to the futuristic type in Rollerball. James Caan, plays a sports hero, a Cowboy from Texas with a sidekick named MoonPie. Two teammates that are the best there is at the game of Rollerball. Strong characters that seem to fear nothing, facing certain death with each game, they blow it off as a fun time. Possessing a true love of the game, Johnathan E.(Caan) is not only a likable Good Ol Boy but is seriously loved and admired by his devoted fans. Which, unbeknownst to him the big boys are feeling a little uncomfortable with his popularity, causing a power play against him. This movie is like a good book, from page one you will be hooked, it is a great story with great acting, it will pull you in and take you for a ride. Stick with it, this is a film that intensifies as it progresses. It is not cluttered with long drawn out dialog. It is well directed with perfect casting. Take note of the fantastic cinematography of the last game, starting with Johnathan E. walking down the hallway to the arena. Notice the glowing red walls, the image of a man alone, walking straight into Hell. Then notice after the explosion of the cycle, the reflection of fire wrapped around the face of Corporate Head (John Houseman), synbolizing the Devil himself. A person can purchase this movie on VHS for about $6, I suggest you do just that, watch it a couple times then put it on the shelf until those rowdy buddies of yours come by, perfect flick for open comments while your pounding down beers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise to Rollerball is good: set in the near future, war and hatred have been defeated, and all violence is channeled onto a corporation run ball game. The problem is it takes an hour before any real action starts, the writers being too interested in Caan's personal conflicts and the corporations desire to see him retire (otherwise it might mean the end of the game as they know it). The most effective scene in this first hour is a group of upper-class revellers (who you wouldn't normally associate with violence) having just seen one of the games, start blowing up fir trees in a fit of drunken bloodlust. It's quite a dark film in a Pre-Robocop kind of way, and similarly entertaining (the fast paced, well staged rollerball sequences were interesting, and reminded me of Solarbabies and Mad Max, but they are few in number). More effort should have gone into the editing: there were a lot of pointless scenes, needless panning shots, and over use of baroque music. It will really test your patience, despite some brilliant acting. It's worth the wait in the end though: a deadly showdown in which the sport becomes all out war where only the strongest will survive</fullReview>

		<fullReview> In the year 2018, The World is unified under a corporate global government. Peace prosperity and plenty for all in exchange for blind obedience to the Mega Capitalist World nation state The World's favorite game is no longer soccer, but Rollerball, a hybrid of Rollerjam (former Roller Derby) and Flavian Amphitheater style survivalist bloodsport. James Caan portrays jonahthan E., a 10 year veteran of the worldwide Rollerball circuit, who is ordered to retire by Mr. Bartholomew (J. Housemann) prior to the world semifinal Rollerball match in Tokyo. When Caan refuses to do so, the Rollerball rules are changed to integrate the purest form of survivalist sport (2018 A D ) with the already brutal Rollerball, and Caan turn violently anarchistic (on track) .  Culminating in the World Rollerball Championship of 2018, in which Caan appears for the Houston team (following the Tokyo Game, in which caan also appeared) , the rules revert to total barbarism. no rules whatsoever in the most absolute literal sense of the term. Houston ' s opponent is New york. Last Man Standing in the most absolutely literal sense of the term. Forget these LMS matches in pro wrestling. Will Houston repeat as Rollerball Champs? Watch and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being born in 1981, I cannot say that I was one of the people waiting in line at the theater to see this movie, however, Rollerball still delivers all the hard hitting action you could want, even by today's standards. With a great leading actor (James Caan) in his prime, a good plot for a movie like this, and believable death scenes, this movie literally has it all! (no nudity though. oh well) Now don't think that just because it was made in 1975 that it won't be good, or that you could let your kids watch it, sure there was no PG-13 back then, but this movie is a hard R. I've watched it to death, but I still get into the action scenes. I cheer for Houston as if I were one of the sport's bloodthirsty fans. The main strength of this movie is the fact that it is completely original. The writer made a whole sport for this movie, a believable sport too. The depth of the sport just shows how much care went into making this movie! Well to sum thins up: If you like James Caan, action, football, people killing each other, whatever, rent or buy this film. Every video store that dosen't suck has it. To put it best,"This movie is like Braveheart on eight tiny wheels!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the not-so-distant-future, nations have been abolished and giant corporations?Energy, Food, Luxuries, etc.--rule. The masses are kept distracted with drugs and a deadly game called Rollerball: think roller derby crossed with gladiator sports. Motorcycles, spiked gauntlets, and a steel ball the size of a grapefruit and fired from a cannon are involved. Jonathan E. (James Caan) is the league's leading scorer, who has incongruously survived ten seasons. Bartholomew (John Houseman) is the evil executive who wants Jonathan either retired or dead. The purpose of the game, he intones, is to teach people that individuals don't matter. Ella (Maude Adams) is ostensibly Jonathan's love interest, but his closest relationship is a bromance with teammate Moonpie (John Beck). ROLLERBALL is one of a whole string of "message" sci-fi flicks made in the 1970s; others include SILENT RUNNING, SOYLENT GREEN, LOGAN'S RUN, and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. It is also director Norman Jewison's sole entry in the sci-fi genre. Watch for the scene where the supercomputer Zero that stores all human knowledge loses the thirteenth century: "just Dante and a few corrupt Popes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that Rollerball is `Fun but shallow entertainment' is to completely miss the point. I first saw Rollerball at the theater in 1975 and several additional times on TV and each time I have noticed something that I had missed in previous viewings. The setting is that of a future where corporations control the world, there is no war and very little individuality. If you are not a corporate executive you are a second tier citizen as Jonathan E's wife is taken away because an executive wants her. The `Game' satisfies the masses need for violence while reinforcing the futility of individual expression. Jonathan E. is told, not asked that he will retire. He tries to find out why his retirement is `for the good of the sport' but fails. On the other hand, to the savvy viewer it is apparent that the reason is because the `executives' fear his popularity. They fear that Jonathan E. could become a hero of so great a stature that the people will love him as almost a god and follow where he leads. We find that in their efforts to kill him by changing the rules the executives only bring about the very thing they most feared. They can only watch in silent horror as he skates passed the bodies of his teammates and foes alike to the chant of Jonathan, Jonathan....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future the world is run by corporations. Violence is outlawed and the only outlet is Rollerball--a VERY violent game sort of like roller derby where men try to kill each other to score. The star of the game is Jonathan E. (James Caan). After 10 years the Corporation wants him out with one of their heads (John Houseman) telling him. But Jonathan doesn't want to leave and the Corporation gets angry...The film LOOKS great with some stunning set designs and costumes. It's also well-directed by Norman Jewison and has a great soundtrack. The acting is very good also--Caan and Houseman are just great in their respective roles. And the games (three are shown) are exciting, fast and very violent (this film got an R rating just for the violence). But I don't like this movie. I saw it when I was 13 in a theatre--I was confused and bored and just thought the best parts were the games. Seeing it now my feelings haven't changed much. The story is muddled with many unexplained events and actions. With the sole exceptions of Caan and Houseman no characters are given depth or motivation. Also the film is slow (this doesn't have to go over 2 hours) and depressing. Sc-fi fans might like this. It's too bad--the premise here is interesting and the film looks fantastic but it's badly done.However I heard this is a masterpiece compared to the 2002 remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This wasn't meant to be a game!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me make this clear, this is not a review of the Rollerball remake that came out in the theaters recently. I am not very interested in remakes. I believe that a movie should avoid simply borrowing ideas: since many remakes do just that without adding anything new or interesting, they end up being not only unimaginative, but often also irritating in their lucrative purposes. That said, I have no idea whether the remake of this movie is bad or not; although there has been a lot of critical lambasting against it, I simply do not blindly trust critics. Especially mainstream critics. Maybe the remake is terrible, maybe not, but since I have not seen it nor I have intention to spend money for a ticket to see it, I simply can't tell.Ok, enough with the rant. Let's talk about the original.Rollerball is one of those pictures that are stuck in a limbo: it never became a classic, but it never got completely dismissed and forgotten. The reason is quite simple: although undoubtedly not without flaws, and probably pretty far for being an immortal masterpiece, at the core Rollerball has some insightful ideas that, despite the years gone by since its initial release, are probably more valuable and worth discussing today than they were when the movie came out in 1975.On the surface, Rollerball is simply a movie about a violent sport that takes place in a not-so-distant future, and a warning against violence sold as entertainment. In a way it is, but seeing it only on that level is missing the movie's much broader agenda; with themes like globalization and corporate power being so present today, it would be inadmissible to do so. If one doesn't stop at the most superficial level of analysis, the experience of watching Rollerball is a rewarding insight on the value of individuality and choice, and on the true meaning of progress. Sure, these themes have been treated in many books and movies before and since, but the film puts a nice spin into them and, although probably not completely original, it still delivers some unique and strong moments.The movie opens in year 2018. After the so-called "Corporate Wars" that threatened the stability of people's lives, all competition has been shut down and now everything is run by a big trust of companies that provides the world population with everything they need. An unquestioned authority, the "Board of Directors", makes all the decisions. There are no more governments and no more big problems such as hunger and wars; people can rely on the corporations for many comforts, and they are asked back loyalty and conformity.The most popular form of entertainment is a gladiatorial-like sport called "rollerball", which mixes skating, American football and motocross. The rollerball is a violent sport: injuries are common, and there are even occasional deaths. The crowds attending matches of rollerball are often drawn into the excitement at the point of behaving somewhat violently themselves, yet in a world that keeps such tight control over the population, this is the legal way (and also, promoted by the corporations themselves) to give the masses the escapism and crazy excitement they want.Jonathan E. (James Caan) is possibly the most popular rollerball player in the world. He has been on top level for over ten years, and to this day he still is seen as a hero by thousands of fans worldwide. In the film's opening match, he leads the Houston team to yet another victory. But his joy won't last long: Bartholomew (John Houseman), head of the corporate power and supporter of the Houston team for quite a long time, wants him out for reasons he doesn't feel like explaining.But Jonathan has no intention of retiring: the rollerball is everything he has. And since he feels the corporation has been influencing his personal life in the past, he simply doesn't want to blindly obey without knowledge about the reasons this time. The problem is, the corporation thinks that the reasons are better left unanswered, because they would expose a flaw in the sociological environment. Jonathan's popularity, it seems, could lead people to think that their own individuality is more important than conformity and complete collaboration. Jonathan's refusal to retire will open a path of paranoia as he further tries to discover more about the world he is living in, and as the corporation will do anything legal in their power (including modifying the rules of the rollerball itself, hoping that Jonathan would experience a permanent injury) to take Jonathan out of the business.As I said, some of the points of the movie are very relevant today; the rollerball is a form of entertainment to keep the masses happy, but the corporations promptly try to modify it when it might offer thought-provoking (or even subversive) ideas; when Jonathan is offered a deal that would have permitted him to live a wealthy, "happy" life in exchange for leaving the rollerball business, he claims that progress is not how many comforts we are provided with, it is freedom and the possibility to choose: it is particularly interesting to see him debate this point with his ex-wife, who has instead decided to completely conform to the comforts that society provides. In a world where mass media and entertainment are often in the hands of a few people who decide for the masses, these are points we should not forget.The movie is very Kubrick-ian in its visuals (probably too much): there are some elements of A Clockwork Orange, but it is clearly 2001: A Space Odyssey that influenced the director Norman Jewison the most. Like in those Kubrick's popular movies, there is an amount of classical music (the film opens and closes on Bach's Toccata and Fugue) and a lot of cold-looking scenes through the use of white and music in that mood. Rollerball is not the visual masterpiece that 2001: A Space Odyssey is, if anything for the much smaller budget, but it manages to deliver good visuals especially in the scenes where the actual game of rollerball is shown.James Caan gives a good performance, and the rest of the cast is satisfying. However the slow central part does detract from the movie a bit, as insightful and interesting scenes are alternated with slower, more monotonous (and ultimately, unexciting) ones. Fortunately, the movie ends on what is probably the strongest scene of them all, an exciting climax where the point is made very clearly.Overall, I do recommend Rollerball. Yes, it could have been a better film. But it's still good and intelligent entertainment, and despite being a little bit overlong and not without flaws, in the end it is a rewarding movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is Rollerball, an accurate view of the spectacle that sports would become. It's basically full contact Roller Derby. James Caan plays the star who wants out. The best part of the movie is the action scenes, including the thirty minute final match scene where the other team is literally trying to kill Caan's character, on orders from the head of the league. If not for the final scene, the movie probably would never have gotten the reputation that it has. The rest of the movie doesn't reach that intensity, it is a typical story of power and excess that hasn't aged well. It's a prime candidate to be remade, it's unfortunate that they remake doesn't hold a ball to this, roller or any kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three things make this interesting: the camera, the edits, and the design.Possible spoilers...I'm certain Oliver Stone studied this for his "expose" into the world of sports, but he missed on several points. The player's personal lives aren't necessary. We aren't supposed to bond with them or create any sense of camaraderie. Only James Caan matters and he's his rigid self.70s sci-fi suffered a lot from this sort of stuff (see also 'Soylent Green'). Simple writing, often involving "the individual" over "the system", and bad actors. In that context, even 'Rocky' fits here. However, 'Rocky' was athletes as people. Here they are mindless warriors: the gladiators returned.The design of the court is interesting. Rather than the modern rectangle that implies a finite game, we get a circle. This subliminally tells us that what we see is both fun and unending. Slocombe and Gibbs caught on to this, hence the eye is more focused on the action than the individual. Notice how the game is monitored by 30 cameras. Too bad many times the camera is stuck in "zoom" mode.Good attempt at advancement and avoiding the "feel-good" plague of modern sport films.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"No. There is no brain wave at all."This is a story about the game that everybody loves. This is a story of a corporate world, where everything is controlled by a handful of executives and everybody else does what they're told. Until one man does not.I personally didn't understand this movie. If it had any higher meaning it was lost on me. I found it pretentious and boring. Illogical, too.The direction was not that great. Aside from the action scenes, there wasn't anything interesting about it. Nothing. Maybe the director did that on purpose? Could be, but that would be really stupid. But so was the story.The story wanted to be a rehash of the old Roman Empire, only this time there were executives instead of Patricians, Rollerballers instead of gladiators and spiked gloves instead of proper weapons. The women were just happy to play the bimbos for hire, with no mind and no ambition of their own. Even in Roman times women were known to have poisoned a husband or two, but not these girls. "You want me? Great! You're done with me? Excellent! Who's next?"The star of the movie is the game and it is also the weakest part of the movie. It is illogical and it doesn't make sense. If you play a game where the adversary is a cold blooded killer, you don't turn your back on him. No matter what the coach says. And even if there would be such a game, the game play, the strategy would be totally different and far more elaborate then what they presented. The idea is great but the implementation is not that great. Or perhaps it was, 40 years ago.The camera work is excellent, when it is about the game, and totally flat when it isn't. There is always a camera where something is happening and there are a lot of closeups. There are also a lot of studies in how to frame the perfect shot. Maybe a little too many.The music is terrible. Classic, but terrible. The actors are overacting a lot. The sets are great. The costumes are interesting and the choreography has it's moments.Rollerball. A movie with a message. Just not a very logical one. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roller Disco meets NFL and then some ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Futuristic tale of a bloodsport, a sort of hybrid roller-disco and NFL, follows the trials and tribulations (mostly the trials) of its all-star American team as it plunders its rivals for the benefit of an insatiable commercial appetite for ultra-violence, at the expense of its personnel. James Caan is the philosophical captain whose profile is a deity amongst the devotees, but who struggles with the increasingly abhorrent approach to the principals of gamesmanship, in contrast with his sponsors and administrators. John Houseman is unexpectedly cast as one of the ardent administrators, exploiting his minions to satisfy the ever burgeoning audience clamouring for blood.Fatally overlong, but visually striking and littered with moments of grandeur that would otherwise benchmark this as a sci-fi masterpiece. The cast is first rate right down to the bits - Gunn, Beck, Rimmer and Sir Ralph all leave impressions. Maud Adams is given too little to do, as Caan's ephemeral love interest, but provides some necessary gender balance to the characters. Jewison's picture is a complex character study within a societal commentary, giving gladiatorial combat a persuasive sci-fi rendition. Costumes and sets paint a not too distant future impression, while there's a good scene in which Sir Ralph grieves for the edification of mankind, replaced by a mindless thug who craves carnage more than evolution. There's a similarity with "Soylent Green" here, and that's not a negative comparison.While some audiences will see of bit of "Any Given Sunday" in "Rollerball" with its message of corporatisation subsuming the existence and purpose of sport as a revenue-based commodity, others will dismiss this as an overlong allegory that fails to crystallise its central theme. Caan's iconographed conclusion to JS Bach's 'Toccat and Fugue in D Minor' might also be a bit much to swallow, but it's a nice try, with some effective touches and plenty of character depth for interest. Not a keeper perhaps, but well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked this story better when it was called The Hunger Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see what this movie was trying to accomplish, I really can, but it doesn't come through at all. All I knew going in was that Roller Ball is a violent game controlled by the government that is used as a means of exercising control over society, and it's technically true, but that's all there is, and it's barely there at all. Despite watching three matches and a practice, no rules are laid out at all. We know a ball goes into a goal to score a point, and the game consists of three twenty-minute periods, and there are motorcycles on the track, but otherwise, we know nothing. Penalties are disallowed for the final two games, but we don't know what constitutes a penalty. Death is established as a risk in normal games, so where is the line drawn for penalties? In the last game, there's no time limit, yet the clock is still counting down. Are they literally just playing to the last man? Is that the only criterion for ending the game? No one seems interested in scoring, just slaughter, yet at one point New York's coach screams at Houston for their brutality. We do get a few speeches about how society has changed and corporations are in control, but we never really see society. We only see Jonathan E. and his friends. He moans about being controlled, but the only sign of control is that the Energy corporation is firmly suggesting that he retire after 10 years as a star player. He thinks they stole his wife, but then we find out that she left on her own, so we have no proof that the corporation is evil except that evil music plays when we see the executives and they make evil facial expressions. At one point, one of the executives spells out that Roller Ball is used to demonstrate that individual effort is fruitless, one man cannot succeed alone, and therefore one man cannot challenge the system and win. Jonathan E. is a threat because he's been successful for 10 years and he's surpassing his team in glory. The only symptom we see of this is that the fans chant his name instead of his team. There's no subversion. There's no discontent. We never see him as the face of a rebellion. There's never any indication that anyone in society is even thinking of rebelling, regardless of what Jonathan E. does. And yet, despite being evil and threatened by Jonathan E., the corporation does nothing but politely insist that he retire and vaguely threaten him. When he time and again refuses, the executive just looks angry and acts as if his hands are tied. Removing the time limit seems to be the only card they have to play. They do say they don't want to kill him, for some unspecified reason, but that doesn't mean they have no other options. There are people he cares about: his ex-wife, his friend Moon Pie (yes, that's his name), his old trainer. They're expendable. Even when Moon Pie is injured, it isn't because of anything the corporation did, and they don't then tell Jonathan E. "You'll be next." It seems more incidental than anything. There are good concepts in there- a corrupt government exercising control over its people through forced participation in a blood sport where death or glory are the only options, and even if you survive you're still their pawn for the rest of your life- but they weren't put to anything resembling good use in this movie. Suzanne Collins handled it better in The Hunger Games. Even as much as I disliked that series, it left me asking serious questions, not "What is in those magic future drug mints?" or "Why haven't they just killed this guy already?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge waste of talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball is really two movies in one. The first is an unbelievably boring and dull story of "corporate" evil, and the second is the incredibly exciting game of the film's title.Director Norman Jewison does a horrible, horrible job here directing this great array of talent. James Caan, who is usually always great to watch, sleepwalks through his role as Jonathan E under Jewison, as does everyone else in the cast. The most lively character under Jewison is old guy and corporate bigwig John Houseman, and all he does is sit around. But at least he looks somewhat interested. And John Beck is wasted as "Moonpie," a potentially interesting character. And forget all the women - under Jewison, they do virtually nothing but give a little eye candy, that's it.This is all in great contrast to when the game of "Rollerball" is actually played. All the Rollerball sequences are very exciting and filmed excellent. You never suspect that each individual Rollerball scene was filmed individually, it all seems as if it all happens during a real-time sporting event. And the final Rollerball game at the end of the film is especially exciting to watch.But the non-Rollerball sequences are all so dull, and the film so long (just over 2 hours), you have to wonder just what was Norman Jewison thinking. There are some scenes where literally nothing happens, and every second is excruciating.The "plot" involves some corporate types (who run the whole world obviously now) who don't want Jonathan E, Rollerball's big star, to play anymore. It's not really clear why they want him to retire, and it's not that clear just what the purpose of the game is even. There's something about how no individual should be bigger than "the game" but still, nothing is really clear. And it's not unclear where you are expected to use your brains to figure it out - the whole film is just fuzzy and direction-less plot-wise. And Jewison's extremely poor direction and handling of the cast off the Rollerball track doesn't help at all.This is definitely good for a single viewing just to watch the Rollerball sequences, but you'll really have to keep yourself awake when the camera is off the track.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great stunts. Weak plot. Futuristic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the near future corporations own the world and eliminate war and crime by creating a super violent game, roller ball, where men on roller skates and motorcycles kill each other to shove a softball sized metal ball into a goal, all to vent violent tendencies. Snore.James Caan is the Jonathan E, the games greatest player. The corporate executives want him out. John Housseman is an unconvincing heavy who tells Jonathan E to quit. Jonathan E refuses to quit and this slow movie plods on to a perfectly predictable ending. A little over 2 hours long, but it feels like 4 hours. Action addicts and liberal wackos paranoid about corporate America would love this movie, people with a brain would hate it.Three roller ball games are shown which are the best part of this movie. The stunts are violent, convincing, and very well done. According to IMDb, this was the first movie where the stunt men received a screen credit, which makes the film somewhat historic. The three games take place in different locations but were quite obviously filmed in the same rink. Little effort was made to make it look like three different rinks. The players wear standard 70's football helmets (easily recognized by the type of face mask used at the time) with a few spikes added, and don't look futuristic at all. No effort was made to make this film look futuristic, except for the politics and a handgun that can incinerate huge fir trees, this movie looks like it takes place in the 70's. It is dated and must have been a low budget film. The sets are very blah. The violent game play is only part of this movie that looks realistic.The acting by the extras is quite good, they look like drug crazed, hedonistic maniacs who live only to get high, get laid, and watch roller ball games, especially in the tree frying scene. The acting by the leading players is weak and unconvincing, there is no emotion at all. There is no comic relief, which makes a slow film even slower. The end is predictable and a real yawner. I gave Rollerball a 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half-baked Political Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fictional dystopias tend to fall into two categories, exemplified by the two best known dystopian novels in the English language. The Oceania of Orwell's "1984" is a true dystopia, one with virtually no redeeming features at all, a dictatorship dominated by a ruling elite whose only concern is the selfish pursuit of power and dominion over others. The World State described in Huxley's "Brave New World", by contrast, is what might be described as a Utopian dystopia, a society which has some positive virtues. War, hunger and disease, for example, have been eliminated, but the price which has to be paid for these advances is the loss of personal identity and freedom."Rollerball" is set in a Utopian dystopia of this sort. The action takes place in the early twenty-first century. (It does not, however, look very futuristic; like other sci-fi films of this period such as "Westworld" and "Capricorn One" it was made on the assumption that the future would look like a slightly trendier version of the seventies). After a series of destructive wars national governments have been abolished. They have not, however, been replaced by a single World Government; instead, the world is controlled by six all-powerful corporations providing food, housing, energy, transport, communications and luxuries. As in Huxley's novel, there are no more wars, no more hunger and no more poverty, but there is also no more democracy. Society is controlled by the directors and executives of the corporation; the average citizen is expected to do as he is told and to know his place. As in another dystopian novel, Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451", books have been abolished; all printed matter has been transferred to centralised databases controlled by the authorities, who can simply delete anything they regard as dangerous or subversive. (The filmmakers evidently did not foresee the internet, which has actually made it more difficult for governments to censor unwanted information).The film centres around the game of rollerball itself, the main professional sport in this society. "Halliwell's Film Guide" complains that the rules of the game are never explained, but we can learn all we need to know from watching the film. Rollerball is played between two teams of players who travel round a circular track on either motor bikes or roller skates. The object of the game is to obtain and keep possession of a metal ball and then to score goals by throwing or placing this ball into a hole in the wall on the side of the track. Physical assaults on opposing players are accepted as all part of the game; serious injuries are commonplace and deaths far from unknown.The hero of the film is Jonathan E, the world's best-known rollerballer and the star of the Houston team. Jonathan, however, has become too famous for his own good. The purpose of the game is not merely to provide violent entertainment for the masses; it is also designed to "teach the futility of individual effort". (Collective effort is the only sort approved by the ruling elite). Jonathan's very success and celebrity undermine the political purpose of the game, so efforts are made to persuade him to retire to a comfortable life. When Jonathan refuses, the authorities try to deal with him by changing the rules of the game to make it more violent, hoping that in Houston's next game against Tokyo he will be seriously injured or killed. When Houston win and Jonathan survives, the authorities arrange that the final of the World Championship, between Houston and New York, will be a free-for-all bloodbath, played with practically no rules.The problem is not that we do not understand the rules of the game. The problem is that we do not understand the rules of this society. The filmmakers could have set the film in a state controlled by a single Party or by an all-powerful dictator, but chose not to do so, possibly because, during the Cold War, this could have been seen as a satire on the Soviet Union. This is meant to be a specifically capitalist dystopia, but it is never explained how a society controlled by large corporations actually works or how it differs from the sort of collectivist dystopia envisaged by Orwell and Huxley. In the real world, corporations exist for the sole purpose of making money for their shareholders and are happy to leave the administration of society to governments (provided, of course, that those governments are pro-business rather than socialist). It seems strange to criticise capitalist societies (which generally pride themselves on being meritocratic) for discouraging individual effort; a much more common criticism is that capitalism places too much emphasis on individual effort with no regard for those who lose out in the rat-race. In any case, no-one can succeed in top-level sport without immense effort, so it seems perverse to use sport in an attempt to teach people that effort is futile.James Caan, who had been so effective in "The Godfather", makes a rather weak, inarticulate Jonathan, whom I found difficult to imagine as a charismatic sporting hero. The other characters are all little more than ciphers, apart from John Houseman's Bartholomew, a senior executive with the Energy Corporation who sponsor the Houston team. Bartholomew plays the "raisonneur", equivalent to O'Brien in "1984" or Mustapha Mond in "Brave New World", whose task is to persuade the rebellious hero to conform to the values of his society. (Jonathan equates to Winston Smith or John the Savage).The most effective parts of the film are Houston's three rollerball games, but the film clearly has ambitions to be more than an action movie about a violent sport. It also wants to be a political satire, the cinematic equivalent of a novel of ideas. If it fails in this ambition, it is because the ideas it is presenting are half-baked and not properly thought out. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the love montage on down, POOR.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered edgy for its time, it doesn't really hold water. It feels like it was made in 1965 but it was actually made in 1975. Its futuristic feel is really antiquated and cliché'. The repainted football helmets, shoulder pads and baseball catchers leg guards were a cheap cop out. The skates look like rentals from the roller rink. As far as overall story, it's symbolism was strong and had truth but it gets under-minded with a poor package of cheesiness and predictable plot line. The action scenes were poor and felt contrived. Some of the game sequences were insultingly weak.The acting was one dimensional with almost every character. Houseman was good and so was Gunn but again cliché'. Caan was never a great actor but in this role he is blah at best. His character arc is so overdone and predictable. Certain places were dying of dialog, others there was too much. Maud Adams was beautiful and the camera loves her but she is only passable as an actress. The good symbolism get lost in the mix of mediocre characters, lame action, child-like plot and pathetic sets, props and wardrobe. And what's the symbolism in a blurry freeze of Caan at the end and then zooming in on it TWICE! With horror organ music underscoring the blur-face. C'Mon. It's almost comical to watch now. From the crappy love montage on down a flawed predictable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why isn't Dick Enberg given credit for his role as the main play-by-play announcer? A prequel or sequel would be OK. The problem with that is, the film world is littered with post-apocalyptic films and most are bad. Like Death Race 2000, for ex. Besides, John Houseman is dead. His role is important in this movie, so it would be important in a prequel or sequel. Or you can just watch Robocop, Demplition Man and THX 1138 for more futuristic movies with fascist/communist visions. There is talk of a new Terminator trilogy; where does it end? And all you have to do is watch a Nascar race, to see real life similarities, what with constant thanking of sponsors. Plus Nike and other companies in College sports, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is truly an unappreciated gem from the 70's. Although the character development is not great, the underlying tension of the individual versus the collective rule is overwhelming seductive and ultimately extremely entertaining. Roller Ball is the rare 1970's futuristic film that can stand the test of time. The triumph of the individual versus the will of the collective governing body is the underlying theme. Although set in the not too distant future the film belies its roots in the spirit of Ayn Rand's novels. Jonathan E. is a compelling protagonist. Seemingly with everything on the surface but haunted by unresolved heartache, he is driven to find the underlying truths of society while preserving his individual desires for self actualization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Futuristic thriller about a violent sport and the players who participate. James Caan plays Johnathan E., a star of the game which is run by corporations who has gotten too good at the game. The Rollerball sequences are quite well done...with a lot of carnage and hard-hitting violent action. However, what goes on between games is a complete letdown, as the rest of the film has no development whatsoever, and what's up with that gun that blows up trees? These gaps in the story leave this flick to be nothing but the game sequences, which is fine, if somewhat confusing and disappointing. Watch this one just for these action sequences, but don't expect much of anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen Rollerball for the first time a few days ago I didn't know what to expect. After seeing the movie I suppose I can say that it delivers- but only just. The three lenghty Rollerball game sequences are fast, hard and exciting. Behind the game, of which there is a society run by corporations without poverty, we see and learn very little. The film-makers have choosen to ignore basically everything but the game of the title. This is fine to a certain degree but you come away wondering exactly what they could have done with the premise. Fun but shallow entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, What can you say, about this monumental mid - 70s classic. I rest my case already. Norman Jewison's, Kubrick style homage' sporting classic, based on the short magazine story by William Harrison. I was at school at the time and my seniors were raving about it, along with other 70s icons of fear and intrigue. James Caan, John Houseman, Maud Adams (Probably the most beautiful, talented actress, ever on celluloid). John Beck, (Later Dallas fame). Even a short cameo from Ralph Richardson, which was a classic understatement in itself. The game, well what prophecy. oh yes! realistic in its entirety. Buy the DVD and watch the extras on it, the conversion of an old Olympic sports pitch, into a futuristic marvel. Whatever they were taking in the film, depicting the recreational substance of the future, must have rubbed off on the artistic genre' to the creativity, of this classic wonder. Can I have some please? The acting was first class, not a cringe in sight. Oh why can they not make movies like this anymore? !!! As for the 2002 remake dear oh dear, someone forgot the plot and I don't mean the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifeless but better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Ancient Rome of emperors and gladiators the fundamental strategy to control people was to give them "Bread and Circus". As long as they have some sort of entertainment, food and great and violent shows they were happy yet controlled, without defying their government. I guess we can say that about now the period in which we live, except for some differences here and there, there's some escapes to this control, you don't need to be restricted to the brainless entertainment, after all there's real art to clear and free our weary minds so filled with information. In the future the "Bread and Circus" will be the "Rollerball", a game played by this updated version of gladiators who walk on rollerskaters and motorcycles killing each other to catch a ball, score goals on a game that always keeps changing rules, delight their audiences in order to please the new form of government of the future, the Corporations (who are we kidding, they are the current governments of now, the difference is that they use politicians to do their dirty work). The Corporations mission is to control people and to say to them that every kind of individual force is useless, and only the group effort is valuable. The dystopic yet somewhat closer to the truth "Rollerball" not only present such ideas but also an opposition to that when a Rollerball player, the fearless and handy Jonathan (James Caan), is forced to retire from the game because of unknown reasons to him, but clearly known to us. Bartholomew, the Chairman of the Corporations (brilliantly played by John Houseman) knows that this man is a threat to his policy, that player is too famous, he's cheered by the crowd who adores his moves while playing as leader of the team and winning all the time. The individual must be weaker than the society, weaker than the group therefore Jonathan must be removed. However, the player wants to know why he's getting retired, challenging everything and everyone to stay in the game at the same time he gets some truth of why things are the way they are. Once in a while a dystopic film or book comes to shock us at the same time they reveal some painful truths about our condition as human beings. "Fahrenheit 451", "1984", "V for Vendetta" and "Brazil" are notable and perfect dystopic examples and they really work their ideals with futuristic societies that appear to be perfect but with distorted values. Some alienated minds think it can only happen in the movies without noticing that they do happen in real life as well. This science-fiction made in 1975 almost got a good result. Its idea of corporations controlling people through a dangerous game is interesting when you hear about it but its presentation is weak, very plain and utterly lifeless when you watch this movie. I wanted more answers about what kind of corporation runs the world and more reasons on the way they act. Opening the discussion of its adventure/thriller aspects this is even weaker than the serious ideas. The movie never creates tension enough in putting Jonathan in danger, we've only see the Chairman making threats to the player but that's it. The only credible thing about the 2002 remake (which is one of the worst movies of all time) is this fact in which the hero gets kidnapped, suffers a little for not paying attention to the threats. Not to mention that it breaks the fundamental rule of dystopic films: it features an happy ending (or something very close to that) that looks so inconclusive and ridiculous that is beyond belief. No lesson is learned here when the hero is the last man standing and no visible change is done. The game will go on? Who knows? Painfully dated and boring to its chorus, the good things about "Rollerball" are some of the game sequences, perfectly edited altogether, fast, violent and a little bit vibrant (the last game being the best) and John Houseman's performance as the villain, an eminent character that dominates everything and everyone. Norman Jewison's film is better than John McTiernan's remake because it tries to say something meaningful about societies instead of being just an action flick with frantic Rollerball sequences. Both films are tied as being good ideas turned into weaker films. Mistakes can be easily corrected on another version maybe to come, I don't know, in the year of 2120. But I won't be able to see it, so until then double thumbs down. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great classical music pieces do not a movie save.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under the usually mediocre direction of the vastly overrated, politically correct (hence why he's overrated) Norman Jewison, I had expected a far weaker movie. Nevertheless, far from me to imply that this is a very good movie...There is an atmosphere of deadness in "Rollerball", which should not be mistaken with futuristic grimness, glumness, so successfully put on the screen in many other, better movies of the genre. ("Zardoz" comes to mind.) The movie is meant to be thought-provoking and even touching (all those great classical pieces seem totally out of place as a background), but its basic point/message is as old as George Orwell novel: in the future we might have an all-controlling tyranny which hinders man's individuality. Yawn. Even sillier, this tyranny offers a very comfortable existence and has corporations at its core. Evil, evil corporations. The much-hated corporations, much like all those corporations that finance nearly all Hollywood movies! (I never cease to be fascinated by this hypocrisy/irony, so typical of left-wing Hollywood.) What kind of a dictatorship could possibly result in a luxurious lifestyle for all involved? Whatever little worth the movie had intellectually was killed off almost totally with that absurd scene that involves a bumbling Ralph Richardson (a "scientist") arguing with a useless "super-computer". It wasn't even funny; merely dumb. Caan's attachment to his former wife (played by unattractive-as-ever Maude Adams) is there only on paper, i.e. in the script: we don't get to see it on the screen. In "Solaris" a man's past love is portrayed with utter conviction, but in "Rollerball" it is as convincing as a soap-opera plot-twist.The basic premise also lacks credibility. If these corporations are so hell-bent on preventing man's individuality from coming to the forefront of society, then why would Houseman &amp; co. wait for an entire DECADE for Caan to become an established celebrity? Why not retire him after one year of great playing? In fact, why even give the masses a game with survivors i.e. potential heroes and sports idols? Why not just establish gladiator games? After all, (mass) murder is allowed in rollerball, so it would make more sense for this future society to create a game that is far more likely to kill off most of the game's contestants, on a far more frequent basis.Still, clocking at two hours, I was expected to be more bored by "Rollerball". I was not totally rollerbored, at least that much can be said...Is it just me, or does the old guy, John Houseman, look a lot like 21st-century Elizabeth Taylor, i.e. post-massive plastic surgery?...</fullReview>

The movie was just flat out boring and stupid. Why is the film labeled and "brutal" and "gory"? You want brutality and gore in a movie? Watch Starship Troopers. This was nothing but overrated trash.I really wanted to like this movie as it seemed to be a combination of fast action and a thought provoking story. In the end it was a dull, poorly written, and poorly acted film with three weak as a hell action sequences and a bunch of no talent actors(Except Houseman. I feel sorry for him that he was in this. Poor soul.) Maybe if the story was more thought provoking(As in they explain why everything in the future is the way it is. I mean, the Corporate Wars sounded interesting. Why didn't they elaborate on it?!?!), the acting better, and the action sequences more fast and exciting, this would be at the very least, a decent film.As it is, it's a film with weak acting, dismal action sequences, and a paper thin story.*out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise but lazy on the execution and complacent with violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The structure of Rollerball is pretty simple: three games (Quarter-Finals Houston vs. Madrid; Semi-finals Tokyo vs. Houston and the championship final in New-York) mark the beginning, middle and the end of the movie. Three games increasingly violent (rules are being removed along the way) and pretty dull scenes in between. Hence violence is brought forward as the interesting thing in it. Does violence mean something, especially to the degree it reaches? No, it's gratuitous violence, both in the game and in the storytelling.Jonathan E. does not rebel, he just seems to wake up from years of celebrity build on a successful rollerball career and concessions to the Energy Corporation. That he starts to wake up is a very good starting point indeed, but he starts waking up during all the movie, vaguely feeling melancholia and a surge in personal power somewhere between matches. Sure you can't ask a modern gladiator to start thinking about philosophy and life (the part when he goes to Geneva to learn about books is as good as dead wood put aside for next winter) so why not have him run amuck?Rollerball is utterly uninteresting. The premise was original but the execution suffers from pseudo-intellectual approach to the hero's position, and the way violence is depicted has to be labeled an irresponsible approach to debit from the already poorly-skilled Norman Jewison. Unlike violence in A Clockwork Orange, violence in Rollerball is not the subject matter, it's only a prominent feature stretched ad nauseam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Personal battles fought in a public arena. Success in the public arena feeding those problems. Gladiator? Men of Honor? Dozens of films in fact.A couple things make this film interesting:--A remake is imminant. It is supposed to be pure action, no `message,' Its always fun to see and know the original before the remake. I only saw the original Limey after Soderbergh's great translation, for instance. The remake in this case will be just precisely what the original warms against.--Some real talent is involved in this effort, well before scifi became common in film. Houseman was one of the key geniuses behind Citizen Kane, Sir Ralph is with Gielguld the father of modern Shakespeare. Jewison has given us some real turkeys (Hurricane) but Agnes is great -- Moonstruck is highly competent. Caan was still a great actor at this time, before his problems.So it is with some wonder I wade through this. It's not science fiction except in the purest early pulp tradition. Instead, it is a simple story of a gladiator, with the context fluffed up out of cardboard. Never mind. There's some woman stuff in there. More cardboard. What's fascinating is how stupid is the character -- Caan plays the sort of clueless jock that would have thought this film was deep. The computer room in Geneva is a gas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Circular Dated?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though set in the future, ROLLERBALL is one of the most dated sci-fi films imaginable. James Caan is a professional rollerball player (a demented mixture of roller derby, lacrosse and wrestling) who slowly learns that he (and most of his friends) are highly disposable pawns of big business. He attempts to do something about it. But first he attends a lot of "swingin" parties (one features blowing up things on the back lawn as entertainment). This movie is a major disappointment considering the talent behind it. In addition to leading man Caan, the cast includes John Houseman, Maud Adams and John Beck...all very good in other, better movies. Shockingly, the direction is by Norman Jewison (whose spotty resume includes Jesus CHIRST SUPERSTAR and BOGUS amongst such remarkable films as A SOLDIER'S STORY, MOONSTRUCK and IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT). Jewison's direction here lacks any style, when it really should be ALL STYLE. ROLLERBALL is the type of movie whose premise really cries out for the gaudiness of a John Boorman or even a Ken Russell. It really give LOGAN'S RUN a real RUN for its money as the worst sci-fi film of the 1970s. The only uncomfortable afterthought one has is the knowledge that in the future men will be wearing a lot of really bad bell bottoms and sombreros!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lackluster action film from director Norman Jewison (not my first pick for a gut-busting action flick set in a decadent futuristic society!). James Caan is well-cast as the star-player of a vicious, brutal sport called Rollerball (sort of a cross between basketball and roller-derby, with the addition of motorcycles). Backers of the game are pressuring Caan to retire, however he has other plans. The Rollerball sequences themselves are wildly imaginative and well-filmed, but almost every scene off the court is a drag. Worse, this film's vision of the future is puny in scope and expression, and rather laughable in its naiveté. Remade in 2002. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie after passing it by on the shelves for years and years. Today, I finally rented it, and it is a decision I regret. Before anyone jumps on me... yes, I get the movie. I just think the message was very poorly delivered. The movie is a cautionary tale about the power of corporations and the public's thirst for thrills. But the movie really fails to show us the consequences of either, and when it does it is confusing and half-hearted. Yes, there are vague allusions to it (the library scene and the party scene). But there is a certain passivity about James Caan's character when it comes to his own destiny. He is told to quit. He doesn't. Instead of the logical step of forcing him out, the corporation that owns him lets him continue playing. Thinking that his status as a legend will eclipse the popularity of the ruling corporations (a stretch of logic within the film I really disagree with; you would think it would be in the best interests of the corporations to have a player like Johnathon E., if the true goal of Rollerball is to distract and pacify the population. The theory that nobody in Rollerball should actually be good at it is ridiculous. Why choose any sport for such for the purposes mentioned, when sport is all about achievement, and the recognition thereof?) So Johnathon E. ends up spending half the film brooding over his wife, and half the film trying to figure out why they want him to quit. I found both very tedious, I found the dinner scene inexplicably dumb (and yes, I do get it, it just looked idiotic) and the game scenes were poorly directed and the mechanics of the game itself hard to understand. Of course, Norman Jewison is not primarily an action film director, but the action sequences look sloppy and boring. Again, I understand that he doesn't want to glorify the violence, but that is no excuse not to be able to coherently film and plot the sport.In all, while I found the premise intriguing, I was thoroughly disappointed by the execution. It seems to me nothing is really followed through. There is a difference between letting an audience figure out a story idea from clues in the story and half-telling a story that doesn't add up or make a lot of sense. Unfortunately, Rollerball is the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Stunts, Weak Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the not-too-distant future, and society is faced with a problem. How to get rid of James Caan? Transportation advancements have done away with toll booths, so that's out. Billy Dee Williams can't tell him he's got cancer, especially since they've probably managed to cure it by now. So why not stick him in the middle of a brutal, bloodthirsty game, take away all the rules, and see if he can survive? It's so crazy, it might just work!"Rollerball" is one of those exciting benchmark films for those of us who are male and grew up in the 1970s. What could have been cooler than big burly guys in studded leather gloves driving chrome-plated motorbikes and smashing into each other in a roller rink while chasing a giant pinball? How about setting it in the not-too-distant future? Wicked!I wish I could say "Rollerball" is a wicked film still. To start with the best part, the stunt work and camera work in the arena are crisp and sharp, visceral to the point of having you standing up and cheering along when Jonathan E. bashes in the face of a Toyko opponent. The idea of remaking "Rollerball" a few years ago with better special effects was ridiculous when one realizes the live-action footage we see here in the original would trump anything CGI can cook up. It's real and ungainly action, the kind you see in the last quarter of a tough Monday Night Football game, and it works.The problem with "Rollerball" is everything else. Not the idea of a corporate-dominated world where individuality is discouraged; that's an arresting dystopian concept even if it's delivered ham-fistedly by director Norman Jewison. What's really at fault is a lack of engagement when it comes to the characters. That Rollerball is such a brutal sport is made abundantly clear in the first game, but we don't get a sense of anyone's compensating humanity that would allow us to root for them. Jonathan doesn't seem bothered by anyone being injured, while his teammate Moonpie is just a thick-headed thug. It's hard to care about the movie when you don't care about the people in it.John Houseman makes for a weird heavy, especially in the opening scene where he passes out psychotropic Tic-Tacs and makes strangely leering comments like a high-school coach who likes hanging out in the boys' locker room too much. That might be interesting if it, or anything else unusual, was pursued, but it isn't. I get that he's corporate and corrupt, but there's no real logic behind his demands that Jonathan, his star player, retire before the end of the season. With only two post-season games left? That's like Shaq dropping out before the NBA Semis. Maybe there's a fear Jonathan represents something scary and alien to the system, as is posited by many other posters here, and Houseman's Bartholomew character wants him to quit so he will be disgraced. But Jonathan doesn't grab me as the iconoclastic John McEnroe or Muhummad Ali type, even though he seems to have the makings for a real grudge when they took his wife away. Instead he kind of goes along with just about everything that's presented to him, until they make this unrealistic demand he suddenly retire.Drop-dead Maud Adams is haunting as the wife, Ella, a woman who doesn't really seem to care about the pain Jonathan felt from losing her (she left voluntarily, to remarry an engineer in Rome). She's not evil, unlike another female character named Daphne played well by Barbara Trentham. Rather, Ella speaks for the status quo, telling Jonathan that the society is good because it provides security and leisure. For all her radiant beauty, and sympathetic understanding for her ex, you kind of understand it and like it when Jonathan responds to her defense of the system, and her appeal for him to quit, by erasing her videotaped image on the wall.There's another nice scene in "Rollerball" where Jonathan explains how the game works and shows up a cocky rookie in a winning, low-key style. But that points up another weakness of the movie, Jonathan's inarticulateness outside of the arena. If you want your film to explore deep concepts, you either need a better plot or a protagonist who can throw up the occasional two-syllable word. Jewison seemed to go overboard in making Jonathan a dumb jock, to the point where it cuts down on James Caan's considerable charisma. Obviously the director was influenced by Caan's performance as a football player in "Brian's Song," but there Caan's character had cancer, which would dampen anyone's personality. Here Jonathan seems like a guy whose interested only in male-bonding and inflicting pain. No wonder Maud left him. Why we are supposed to stick with him is a mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like it at all, overrated as far as I am concerned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollerball is set in the near future &amp; starts in Madrid in Spain as the latest round of the violent sport Rollerball is held, it's Houston against Madrid with with Rollerball Champion &amp; star Jonathan E (James Caan) playing for Houston they win &amp; go into the semi-finals against Tokyo. After the game company executive Bartholomew (John Houseman) tells Jonathan that he must retire &amp; that the Tokyo game will be his last. Jonathan questions the reasoning behind his forced retirement but gets few answers, Jonathan defies the company executives &amp; continues to play &amp; continues to win as Houston reach the Rollerball final against New York. The executives change the rules to make an already violent sport even more brutal where whoever steps into the area is not expected to make it back out alive in the hope that Jonathan will either retire or be killed but he has other ideas...This British production was produced &amp; directed Norman Jewison &amp; was based on the short story 'Roller Ball Murder' by William Harrison who actually wrote the script for this film adaptation although I not read the original story so cannot compare the two, regarded as a bit of a cult classic amongst many I am at a loss to understand why as I didn't just think it was a terrible film it's also a film that I just hate. Much is made of the future set story in which the world is run by a global corporation, the idea of countries are gone (why?) &amp; Government rule is a thing of the past as are libraries &amp; many claim that it was ahead of it's time &amp; foreshadowed many things but I disagree. Global organisations have always been dominant &amp; powerful, even back in the mid 70's &amp; while the film suggest they have control over every aspect of our lives we never see this, not one scene is set in the real world with real ordinary people as far as I can remember. The corporation is also against free will &amp; individualism as Rollerball was created as a means of championing the collective &amp; not the individual &amp; when Jonathan E becomes that individual the executives have to get rid of him, well surely there lots of sports already in existence that champion teamwork so why devise a new one &amp; are you trying to tell me every single human being on the planet loves Rollerball &amp; what it stands for? The whole film acts like it's some piece of social saviour &amp; the ultimate warning but at over two hours in length I found it a complete total &amp; utter bore from start to finish. The ideas about individualism being bad, the eradication of free will, the systematic devaluing of libraries &amp; history along with the whole big business is bad morality are laid on so thick the filmmakers used a bulldozer to lay it on (the scene where the rich executive guest's callously set fire to trees is a blatant message &amp; parallel about big business &amp; the emotionless corporate destruction of nature) &amp; it gets very repetitive &amp; tiresome &amp; to be honest I don't think the message here in Rollerball is particularly relevant at all. While many comments here exclaim how good Rollerball is I simply couldn't see it, I certainly got what Rollerball was about make no mistake about that but I just didn't like the film on any level or for any reason.Apparently the game of Rollerball was so realistic they played it on set between takes which amazes me, I thought it was a crap sport that made little sense &amp; had zero tension or excitement. To me Rollerball seemed like guy's roller skating around an oval track trying to get a ball into a hole &amp; there's a few guy's on motorcycles riding around too. The rules are never made particularly clear, I mean during the Houston Tokyo game two Tokyo players openly kill a Houston player on track, is that in the rules? Is it an anything goes sport? If so then it's very much an individual thing as it would become every man for himself, right? There are three Rollerball matches &amp; while thankfully there's none of that fast fire editing that ruins so many modern films not much happens in them, guy's skate, the crowd cheers &amp; a few fall over &amp; that's about it. I didn't think there was much pace or excitement to the Rollerball games at all, they just didn't engage, excite, intrigue or grab me at all like any good sporting spectacle should. Set in the future Rollerball still feels like it's set in the 70's, science fiction generally dates quite badly &amp; Rollerball is far from th only or the worst offender but it does look dated.Actually filmed in Munich in Germany &amp; in Pinewood Studios back in England, the production values are good &amp; it's well made but I still didn't like the film. The acting is fine, I can't say I liked anyone particularly but they do a decent enough job.Rollerball is a film that many regard as a classic but I don't, far from it in fact &amp; I actually really disliked it. I think people are seeing too much here to be honest but having said that if they want to waste over two hours watching this dreadfully dull moralistic tripe then they are more than welcome, just as long as I don't have to watch it with them. Followed by the equally bad remake Rollerball (2002).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ponderous and pathetic profile of sports and corporate totalitarianism. Moving at a snails pace it unfolds uninteresting athletes and even less interesting chieftains.The game itself is a little more energetic but even that becomes repetitive and wearisome. A combination of Roller Derby and Basketball the sport unfortunately is a poor substitute as a metaphor for teamwork and the defeat of individualism.The New World Order and its environs are laid out as a sterile, environmentally unfriendly, computer controlled commune that is as unexciting as it is excruciating to watch.A failure on almost every level, the least of which is the mumbling, expressionless, Hero that has taken too much soma and acts like a somnambulist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm not old enough to truly appreciate a 1975 science fiction movie. This movie was recommended by a 40 yr. old friend as much better than the remake. My husband nor I (in our 30's) saw no redeeming qualities in this film. I have not seen the remake, but I can only hope it is not as fragmented as the original.I normally enjoy a movie that makes you think. However, I spent more time trying to figure out the plot-line and characters than thinking about all the supposed allegorical qualities of this film. The movie starts out with almost no explanation as to when, where, or who, and continues this route through to the end. It's almost like starting a movie in the middle and then trying to figure out what's going on. Additionally, it has extremely long, repetitive sequences that only left me thinking "Okay. I get it--let's get on with the movie".Maybe in 1975 this was cutting edge, but unless you enjoy what I would call cheesy, B-rated movies, you will probably fall asleep waiting for something to happen in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was created to demonstrate the futility of individual effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If given the opportunity to walk on hot cinders with gasoline drenched feet or watch this horrid science-fiction, heavily symbolic film again, I would choose the first. Gasoline isn't that bad, is it? From the muttering of un-impassioned lines from lead actor James Caan, to the "IN YOUR FACE" symbolic nature of the film, all the way to the random unsolved moments between Johnathan and his estranged wife, we (the viewers) are left with nothing but a sloppy film that reeks of symbolism for the deeply involved masses and a old sci-fi film that only has a cult status because it was released in the mid-70s. Nothing more, nothing less. For those that will sit here and argue that it was a huge film due to the visuals, the elements about the strength of government, and the power of one man to topple such a corrupt way of living, I cannot buy it. What I witnessed with I watched this film was nothing more than a campy sci-fi film that attempted to be as smart as 2001, but instead just seemed recycled with the director Norman Jewison reading too much into "1984" and "Fahrenheit 451".I don't want to sound like I hate intelligent cinema, when in fact I crave it each and every time I place a film into my DVD player, what I don't like is cinema that is blatantly symbolic just because it knows that it is trying to reach the opportunity to be thought of as a cult film. With Rollerball, I feel like scenes were too contrived for the overall nature that it attempted to represent. This needed to be a simple film about resistance against a controlling government all tightly rolled into the game known as Rollerball. With Jewison's adaptation, I felt that the game Rollerball got the wrong end of the stick. I didn't feel like there was enough time or dedication spent on the game. What really irritated me about this film were the scenes between the games which tried to look artistically like a Kubrick film, but failed, but also didn't have enough cohesiveness to hold the film together. Jewison could not "connect the dots" with our characters when they were not on the Roller Rink. I mentioned this before, but I couldn't keep my eyes open long enough when Caan spoke because he mumbled his lines (providing little to no emotion behind his character outside of the fact that he can really roller skate!) and could not guide us through a tunnel. As a central character, I felt that he was the wrong fit for this film. We needed someone strong, yet with the ability to demonstrate verbally what they were doing to fight the Corporation. I also couldn't follow the scenes at the party, the scenes between Caan and Maud Adams, and the eventuality of Moonpie. Jewison left us guessing and wanting more, but instead of answers he would just throw us back on the Rollerball game. It was a cheap move, and I felt cheated by him in this film. By the end of the movie I saw some opportunities and chances that Jewison didn't take, and it angered me because this film could have been great, but at every level it just fell short.I have read other reviews that say that Caan was an excellent choice for this film because he represented the aging sports star very well, but for me he just fell flat. His acting, especially his speaking, seemed mumbled and unemotional. I couldn't tell if he was actually doing this to fight the Corporation or just because Jewison was behind the camera yelling "ACTION". I know that Caan is capable of so much more; I just don't see why he didn't feel the need to give everything for this character, unless he didn't see the value in him either. The final scenes between him and Moonpie were laughable at best, and it just made me consider this film with a stronger emotional actor instead of just your typical "man's man" that helmed this project. The same can be said for the cardboard-esquire representation that we witnessed from Maud Adams. Emotionless babble. If Jewison didn't have us watching a very loud and mundane game of Rollerball, then he was forcing us to turn our volumes up and down trying to listen to this emotionless babble coming from the mouths of our actors. Why didn't Jewison get better actors? I couldn't tell if it were the acting itself or the direction that just fouled this film. Also, why does 2018 look quite a bit like 1975?Overall, I cannot sit here and recommend this film to anyone. As I read other reviews, I notice a growing trend. You are either going to love this film or adamantly hate it. I seemed to fall in the latter category. I was willing to give this film a chance because I admire science fiction projects, but my hatred towards sports themed films got the best of me. There were not surprises in this film, there was an apparent lack of innovation in creating the future, and overall, the game that Caan played wasn't that great. I watched one match and had trouble watching the rest. It seemed tedious and boring to view as a spectator. I realize that hidden deeply within this are symbolic references towards violence, the media, and Corporate rule ? but honestly, if you would rather see a film that demonstrated that better, you should check out Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and avoid this film at all costs! Thankfully, I have the remake here at home to watch later tonight. I know it will be horribly worse (which seems impossible), but at least it will eliminate any remembrance that I have of this utterly diabolical 1970s piece of cinema.Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those who might apreciate James Caan's acting or have a liking for 70s cult films, this is one to steer clear of. Supposedly making a point on the excesses of violence in a futuristic corporate scenario, the movie falls short of being even remotely intriguing or watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing in the original Rollerball are the scenes where they're playing the game. The rest of the movie is James Caan and the other cast members sitting around talking. I found myself pushing the Fast Forward button on my remote until something more exciting happened. I can only hope that the upcoming remake with Jean Reno will be ten times better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this movie because I saw Pamela Hensley was in it. Don't waste your money because she doesn't look the same as she did on Matt Houston. As far as the movie goes I loss my interest 10 minutes into it. It's about how the local big wheels settle there deputes against each other. Usually when you watch a movie, you watch it because there's either and actress or something that catches you attention. Sure, this movie has Pamela Hensley in it and that in its self should keep you tuned to it. However, you barely even saw her and that in its self was a major disappointment. This was a bad, bad, bad, movie and that's being kind. Don't waste your money buying this because the movie just isn't worth it. I give this movie 1 weasel star only because I couldn't give it a zero.</fullReview>
