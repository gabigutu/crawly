		<shortDescription>A meandering, multi-genred film that ultimately rewards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yogen begins with a tight sequence full of foreboding. A married couple with their young daughter are driving home from vacation when the father, Professor Hideki Satomi, needs to send an email. To get an internet connection they stop at a phone booth, and whilst waiting for his email to connect Hideki receives a shocking premonition. He discovers a newspaper depicting his daughter Nana's death: she dies in a car explosion, alone, after an impact by a lorry. He spots the date - it's today's - he sees the time - it's now - it happens right behind him, his wife Ayaka having tried unsuccessfully to release Nana from the back seat. This opening is suspenseful and subsequently sets a high expectation for the rest of the film.We now travel three years into the future where Hideki and Ayaka are divorced, their marriage not having survived the horrific experience and aftermath of Nana's death. Their continuing relationship is explored with surprising depth: no character is wholly blamed for past events and both leads are written believably and with sympathy. Hideki soon becomes haunted with other premonitions, and with his ex-wife's help finds some answers about his own fate and others. This leads to the most disappointing part of the film, the meandering middle section, where audiences fidget and become eager for a pay-off.It's worth the wait. With a journey into hell, one shocking sequence in particular and some genuine 'jump' moments, Yogen also manages to incorporate familiar concepts from films such as Groundhog Day and The Butterfly Effect. Despite this, the premise still feels fresh and the last twenty minutes deserve full attention.I wouldn't classify Yogen solely as a horror, as the conventions of mystery, thriller and even some romance are also apparent. This film relies more on character development and a well thought-out (albeit sometimes slow) script than cheap shocks or blood and gore. With strong acting (most notably the stressed-out and suitably skinny performance from Hiroshi Mikami as Hideki), nicely crafted sequences and a pervading score, this film is predictable and unpredictable in equal measures. Admittedly uneven, if a viewer has enjoyed films of a similar premise, they can be confident Yogen ultimately delivers and entertains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncontrolled power is not power at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skillfully edited and highly tensioned, Yogen is one every so often discussed psycho-horror. It's been produced from the idea of the same titled Japanese comic book of 1950s' and follows the storyline of a solid Japanese novel from the same decade. The comic book creates a heroic theme out of a psychic family man who saves his family from a traffic accident, while the novel focuses on precognitive newspaper delusions seen by ordinary people.In the opening scene, giving a little clue of the main idea, we're being introduced to a middle-aged female victim of a paranormal incident taken from a newspaper article. She is being tested over her newly acquired supernatural skills at an university research laboratory. The second scene, where main characters are introduced, has the heart-wrenching traffic accident that gives cause for a chain of more alike accidents. The common trait of each accident is that they both have precognitive warnings to their survivors. The survivors of this first accident were parents to a 5-year-old singleton, who got killed in the accident. To their surprise their daughter has been the only vein that holds them together. Atfer the death of their daughter they get parted. They both keep receiving precognitive warnings for next alike accidents of their colleagues, disciples, friends and relatives.Over the last few years we've seen likes of this idea in Hollywood. With Sandra Bullock, also with Nicolas Cage there were either action or drama based films displayed. Among all, Yogen has the most influential message: Everyone has tremendous abilities hidden inside that might become surfaced once in a while for everyone. But we're not born to behave like angels or daemons. To have psychic skills is no means of becoming stronger or wiser. Uncontrolled power is not power at all, and we're not born to have such powers.With extreme usage of melodrama and surrealist pen-portraits, Yogen is a one-way ticket for travelling into a metaphysical world of limitless secrets, symbols, dreams and intuition where time has lost its permanence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consequences for altering history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very creative Japanese horror movie, in the style of Ju-On. It's fairly slow-paced, being character and plot driven, but this is the right approach due to its clever, intelligent, and emotional script.A man starts receiving a newspaper which predicts tragic future events, sort of the "Early Edition" TV show's premise, except in the case of the E.E., the purpose was to give the paper's recipient ample warning to prevent the tragedy. Here, by contrast, the intention is clearly evil. The newspaper appears in an always sinister way, even "chasing" the man sometimes, and forcing him to see future events, which he learns he is not allowed to interfere with; if he does, he will unleash grotesque consequences. Then the paper torments him with a story about his own family.The characters are very easy to identify with as innocents who have been cast into this danger, and have done nothing wrong, rather than the usual horror movie victims who are evil and/or stupid. The story unfolds in a the fashion of learning new information along with the main character. The terror of the people in jeopardy is well defined, and the story reaches a touching and poignant denouement. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much horror, but very emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having children myself, this movie struck me in a very emotional way. In fact, I was ALMOST moved to tears. That does not happen often.If you're looking for a Ringu type horror flick, this isn't it. At times, Yogen moves rather slowly and doesn't pack the creepy punch I was expecting. That being said, I found the "creep" to be replaced with "emotion." There could have been disappointment from the lack of scares since I was looking to watch a horror movie, but was pleasantly surprised by how moved I was. The ending is just perfect.If you're a parent or simply know the feeling of emotional bonds, Yogen has the power to move you more than typical horror would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another decent, if still not excellent, J-horror flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following closely on the heels of 'Kansen' (aka 'Infection'), 'Yogen' in the next J-horror flick in the planned series. Arguably better than it's predecessor, it still fails to achieve greatness.While on a family vacation, a man finds a newspaper clipping detailing the death of his daughter moments before she dies. After the incident, the man and his estranged wife try to understand how this phenomenon occurred and possibly how to use it to change the future.The opening scene makes a promise that much of the film doesn't live up to. It's a tightly filmed piece of suspense that yields a great pay off, yet sadly the scenes that follow dwindle into monotony and tedium as the audience must wait for the characters to figure out what has already been clearly stated. I hate to say it, but I had a hard time sitting through much of the film. Not until nearer the end do things pick-up again, when the father begins a twisted time traveling scenario that borders on sheer lunacy and is so deliciously entertaining.Technically the film is competent. Camera work, color, and the like are good. The actors are also quiet capable even if the writing is dull. All in all no better or worse than most Japanese horror flicks.A quality opening and a bizarrely satisfying conclusion bookend an otherwise ordinary tale of loss and the supernatural.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While driving through the countryside with his wife and daughter,Hideki Satomi stops at the phone booth to send an email.There he discovers a scrap of newsprint with his daughter's picture on it,and an article describing her death in a traffic accident.With a sense of horrible premonition and foreboding,he witnesses the terrifying automobile accident that had been accurately described in the article.The grieving father becomes obsessed with uncovering the mystery of the newspaper."Yogen" is the second installment in Taka Ischige sponsored "J-Horror Theater" series.The film is not as effectively creepy as "Kansen",but the acting is great and the beginning is truly powerful.The climax is pretty satisfying,unfortunately the middle section of the film leads to nowhere.Still if you like sophisticated horror films that deal with fate and its consequences give "Yogen" a look.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a horror flick -- moving dramatic performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a horror movie, "Yogen" does disappoint -- the effects are hokey, and many aspects of the plot are poorly laid out (or not dealt with at all). But what impressed me about this film is, the human relationships are so real and moving, I kept forgetting I was watching a horror movie. I've rarely seen such powerful acting in a genre flick; the protagonist and his ex-wife are incredibly vulnerable and rawly expressive. I loved this movie in spite of its weaknesses. It emphasized the REAL reasons why horror scares us: because we fear the loss of love, because we feel guilty when bad things happen, because we fear being alone.Never mind horror -- I cried when Hiroshi Mikami (the extraordinary actor who plays the protagonist) thought he heard his dead little girl calling his name, and his reactions -- shock, terror, disbelief, slowly rising hope, cathartic joy and sobbing relief, followed by horror, grief and anguish -- just broke my heart. Noriko Sakai, who plays his ex-wife, is equally powerful, especially in the scene where the estranged couple finally stop blaming themselves and each other, and come back together.I very much hope we'll see more of these two wonderful actors, in films more worthy of their talents than this one. But this one isn't bad, by any means -- the screenplay, in particular, is a lot better than you usually get for a genre horror movie in translation. (A Japanese speaker might disagree with me there, but despite clunky subtitles, you could still get the gist of some pretty subtle and humane dialogue for a horror flick.) I'd recommend this movie for the acting, and again, I hope to see Hiroshi Mikami and Noriko Sakai in more, and better, films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Premonition is only average - you've been warned!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norio Tsuruta is one of those journeyman directors who has gained work from the recent reinvigoration of Asian horror. His Premonition is watchable enough even if, like the other work from this director, it hardly reaches the heights of more celebrated titles from the same source. Despite effective moments,it suffers from an atmosphere more often glum than truly terrifying, as well as structural disorientation in its last part which is at best a welcome change of pace, and at worst slightly incoherent.Premonition's Twilight Zone-type central idea (even the source story's name, 'The Newspaper Of Terror' is reminiscent of pulp fiction) is of a demonic publication, extracted from the 'Akashic Record': "a place in the cosmos where all events, past and present, are recorded." The Record appears at disconcerting and unsettling moments to those with sight to see it and offers, to those few at least, dire warnings of the future. Its exact provenance is otherwise unexplored except in a couple of hushed conversations, but the ominous paper appears in time to offer its unfortunate recipients the chance, if at some personal cost, to change the destinies of others. In one of the more effective scenes, the Record is first seen and read by one Hideki Satomi (Hiroshi Mikami), a college lecturer who learns of the impending death of his three-year-old daughter. Unable to believe his eyes and use the foresight allowed, the tragedy duly occurs. Flash forward three years and the still distraught and distracted Satomi, now estranged from his wife, finds that the Record reaches him again, this time with news of a murderer's next young victim. Meanwhile his wife's scepticism is overcome when, through a medium, she discovers independent verification of the spectral broadsheet...After the initial loss and the shock it engenders, for the most part the film now settles down into a mildly disturbing rut of dread and guilt brought by the expected off-world news. Satomi and wife, now brought back together by events, track down the earthly remains of a psychic who previously also had the curse of precognition. Working amongst his (amazingly dust-free and neatly racked) effects to reconstruct his warnings - a process including the use of a video as a moment of shock, a by now stock-in-trade of Japanese horror - the two soon confront the narrative's central dilemma: whether or not to change events, even when to do so inevitably leads to physical deterioration and madness.The principal suspense factor of the film is thus predicated around the newspaper's expected arrival, which duly arrives in a few suspenseful moments (my favourite is of the publication, hovering like some bird of prey, hunting alongside a desperately speeding car) and there are some spooky moments set in an asylum. But a sustained atmosphere of terror is a difficult trick to pull off, and ultimately the film suffers in comparison to more effective productions with similar, dark atmospheres - like Dark Water for instance. Perhaps recognizing this, Premonition's most notable creative decision occurs in the last section of the drama when, as a climax to the piece, Satomi undergoes a series of frightening spatial and temporal experiences. It's rather a shock, especially after the linear construction dominating the rest of the film and, frankly, internal logic is a little strained. But these few minutes, right up to and including the end, have the merit of finishing with a much needed flourish. They also inject something of the disorientation of fear into proceedings, bringing a sustained and necessary sense that the human is at the mercy of a capricious cosmos that was missing previously. And, if this reviewer wished that matters had come to an end more darkly than the final, slightly-too-happy conclusion offered here - bringing up the credits on the abrupt death of a major character for instance, would have been more disturbing - these last, fast-moving scenes offer tension in a way which aptly harks back to the beginning.The acting of the principals is adequate, even if there are no scenes that require complex emoting. The UK copy seen by this reviewer was cropped uncomfortably from what looks like an original ratio of 1.85:1. For a genre in which fear often lurks at the edge of the frame, this is an unfortunate choice, especially when some relatively undistinguished cinematography needs all the help it can get. No real extras either. If you're a fan of this sort of cinema, then the overall package will remain entertaining enough, and it will certainly serve until something better comes along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy spin on 'butterfly effect' theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An effective combination of 'change the future'-style sci-fi thriller and traditional Japanese horror. PREMONITION tells the story of an ordinary man caught up in some extraordinary events?and the dark avenues to which he is eventually led as a result of this.Things kick off with a shocking set-piece in which a young girl is killed in one of those accidents that are filmed so well in Asian cinema. Years later and the father blames himself for not saving her, as he was warned by a newspaper article in the moments before her death. Soon he becomes convinced that he can go back in time to save her, and becomes involved with various psychics who claim to be able to see the future.What follows is both familiar and unpredictable at the same time. Director Norio Tsuruta, hot off making RING 0, shoots this as a horror rather than science fiction film, so incorporates various scare sequences that end up being very effective. There's little to no gore here, just a creeping psychological approach that pays dividends as the story progresses. I defy anyone not to jump in their seat at the 'faceless ghost' scene.The pacing is rather slow ? when isn't it in a J-horror? ? but it gradually picks up as the film builds momentum, culminating in a blistering climax involving our protagonist hopping through realities at a dizzying pace. It reminded me of the hilarious extended fight climax of Wes Craven's SHOCKER, although of course it's treated seriously here. Hiroshi Mikami is excellent as the haunted protagonist ? think of the calibre of Hiroyuki Sanada in Ring and you'll be close ? and the film as a whole never pulls its punches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Premonition" is an exceptional horror film--with a very original plot that kept me on the edge of my....well, actually, it was not my seat--I was actually watching while walking on my treadmill! But either way, it's a dandy film, that's for sure.The film begins with a family coming back from a trip. The father, Hideki Satomi, is too busy with work he's doing in the back seat of the car to pay any attention to his wife and daughter. When they stop at a pay phone, things get VERY strange. Hideki sees a newspaper on the ground under the phone and something grabs his attention--a clipping that talks about his daughter's death!!! And, the article tells the time she was killed--just a moment away! Hideki tries to run from the phone booth to the car parked across the road--but he's too late. An out of control truck careens into the car and kills the little girl.Several years pass. Hideki's marriage has crumbled and he's divorced. It seems that his story about seeing the article has ruined his marriage--ask she doesn't believe he saw this weird prescient clip--and it was lost in the confusion of the accident. And, he's simply obsessed by it--as well as quite depressed. The wife returns to him, however, when she realizes that there are others who have described similar things---claiming to have knowledge of deaths JUST BEFORE they occur! There is much more to the film--but I really don't want to ruin the film. Suffice to say, it's extraordinarily creepy and original. And, although technically a horror film, it's also a wonderful film about love and sacrifice. Well worth your time, that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't know what to expect....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly good movie! When I first saw the box I didn't know what to expect. I figured it would be a low budget looking foreign film with blood and guts oozing everywhere. What I saw though, was a well crafted, suspenseful, chilling and bizarre film. At first the thought of a "killer newspaper" was kind of corny, but after watching this movie, it only makes the movie more appealing.A guy is haunted by a newspaper that is called the "paper of death", which shows itself to random people detailing horrible deaths of people who are in their communities. A demon newspaper if you will. The main actor finds a newspaper clipping in a phone both that details his daughters death, that happens that same day. In horror he watches as his daughter is crushed in their car by a dump truck and explodes. From that point on the movie takes off on a bizarre trip into the supernatural while this lead character and his ex-wife try to uncover the source of this newspaper and the reason for their daughter's death.There are some shocking images in the movie, like his wife being smashed by a truck on the side of the road, or when dead people start to contact him in all their gross dead states, one scene in particular shows a girl that has just died appearing to him in a hallway with her face ripped out of her head.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good foreign horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A newspaper from beyond foretells the fate of others to schoolteacher Hideki(Hiroshi Mikami)who was an unfortunate eye-witness, along with wife Ayaka(Noriko Sakai), to his daughter's death in a car explosion. This fateful day occurred when their car was pulled over and another vehicle came crashing into it with the poor child's seat-buckle locked into her dress. He had received an ominous news article claiming his daughter's death while making a call in a phone booth. This scene sets up what lies in wait for our poor hero. The couple, divorced but very much still in love(..but after any death of a couple's child just looking into each other's face brings back that horrible memory of the explosion that killed their little girl), try to understand this gift of premonition..should Hideki, who receives prior knowledge of the casualties that beset others, assist in stopping fate's course? When Hideki researches others with the same gift of prophesy from the ominous newspaper, he uncovers the horrific truth of their own demise..the one who stops an act of death that is charted pay with their own health and life. When Hideki receives a newspaper foretelling his own ex-wife's death(..after they decide to become lovers again), should he interfere?Clever gimmick really works as a paranoia thriller as we follow the terrors of poor Hideki as he bears the knowledge of foretold deaths of those he knows. We also see that Hideki receives visits from those who perished..including his facially scarred daughter(..and a poor friend who dies in a terrible subway accident that tore her face off..he sees her after the fact)which really is jarring. The film works well as a portrait of agony as two parents remain haunted by their darling daughter's demise and how they couldn't stop it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While stopped at a roadside phone booth, Professor Hideki Satomi finds a scrap of newspaper with a picture of his 5-year-old daughter, Nana, under a road accident headline. He sees his wife, Ayaka, trying to release their daughter from their car, when an out of control truck hits his car killing Nana. Three years later, Ayaka, who's now divorced from Hideki, is researching paranormal events where some people claim to have read an "evil newspaper" anticipating the future. Her research reveals that these people are cursed to foresee the future, but are helpless when trying to save the victims. The more she researches, the more Ayaka believes Hideki's accounts on what happened three years prior, but when Hideki tries to change the future, he becomes seemingly trapped in a Hell from which there's no escape.Asian horror films usually have something in common in one way or another....they can be quite strange, pretty creepy, and confusing. Premonition falls into all these, and as long as you can follow it, it's actually a pretty enjoyable film. It's quite a slow going film as well, but you don't really get bored of it because you get drawn in. As long as the story is an interesting one, and you can follow it, then a slow going film isn't too bad. For me, Premonition is exactly like this.As I mentioned before, there are some creepy moments and when you add in the atmosphere of the scenes, they do a very good job of creeping you out. A couple of scenes may disturb some people namely the car crash scene and another scene that involves Nana, but they are not there just for the sake of it as they are obviously vital to the story.The story has a Final Destination feel to it as well, and while Final Destination concentrates more on the visual "jump scares", Premonition concentrates more in the psychological aspect. Overall, Premonition is a pretty good film to watch and if you're a fan of Asian horror, then I recommend giving this one a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Japanese genre example.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Japanese horror movies are often being praised for their originality. And compared to Hollywood genre-pieces they are original but to be perfectly honest, all Japanese modern horrors are more or less being the same, so I wouldn't call them original at all. Only thing that can make distinct themselves is having one effective and original main premise and this movie luckily has that. This movie is a good example of what the genre is all capable off.In its style and build up this is really being a typical Japanese genre example. It's all about its creepy atmosphere and often slow build up. And this movie does have some more slow moments than other genre examples but I really didn't mind that, in this particular case. It seems like the right approach for this movie and its story, that is being a bit more 'clever' than just having a couple of ghost appearing every now and then. This movie is still being more of a supernatural orientated one than anything else, though it definitely is not without is typical horror moments as well.The story is quite engaging and well written. It makes the movie an effective one to watch, also really with its horror themed moments. The main premise of the movie is really great and they handled it quite well throughout in this movie. Yes, it does combine several themes and elements from other genre movies but it simply does this well and at an original way on its own.Because the movie is being somewhat slow at certain parts, it becomes all the more effective when things are really happening in it. Such as the last part of the movie, that is simply just being great and quite hectic.Overall this movie is being a really good watch. Nothing too special or impressive in the end but it simply is one that really satisfies and is being a quite original one to watch as well.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premonition is one of my Top 20 horror films that I have watched. I love the idea being used in this film, I love the originality of this movie. This movie is really very very original about fates. This movie is about a man who can see the future and when he tries to stop the future, terrible things starts happening to him. This movie is slow paced at times, but just let it grab you because for the last 20 minutes, I just could not stop watching this movie. In comparison to butterfly effect, I thought this ending was much better. The mystery elements used in this movie were just great. The scares used in this movie by the flying newspapers were great. This movie is not extremely scary, but is a show with a solid storyline. Though I had one major complain in this movie. The scene where the passengers board the train and the main character pulls his wife back and the train starts to move. I was expecting something to happen in the train but nothing happened. This movie is terrifying and scary psychologically. This movie is very original. I highly recommend this movie if you like shows such as The Time Machine or The Butterfly Effect.

		<shortDescription>Another Japanese horror movie that's more creepy than terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premonition is one of those Japanese horror movies that focuses more on being creepy than terrifying. And outside of one guffaw-inducing moment, it mainly succeeds.The story starts with a Japanese family driving home. Mom Akaya (Noriko Sakai) is sweetly singing with little daughter Nana (Hana Inoue) while workaholic dad Hideki (Hiroshi Mikami) is typing away on his computer, finishing up some work for the office. Hideki's laptop loses its internet connection, so they stop at a phone booth. Apparently, pay phones in Japan have internet uplinks. Anyway, while Hideki emails his report back to the office, Akaya and Nana remain in the car parked on the roadside. While in the phone booth, Hideki notices a ragged scrap of newspaper in which he finds a story about his daughter being killed in a roadside accident. He freaks out as Akaya leaves the car and comes to his side?at which point a truck plows into the car and kills Nana.Flash forward a few years and Hideki and Akaya are divorced. He's a burned out high school teacher living in a crappy apartment. She's a university researcher studying psychic phenomenon, particularly a professor who can make images appear in instant photographs. Akaya's studies bring her to the work of Rei Kigata (Kei Yamamoto), who wrote about something called "The Newspaper of Terror". He describes people who claimed to receive news reports about tragedies before they occur. Meanwhile, Hideki starts to see more ragged newspapers and other signs of future disasters. When he learns one of his students is destined to die and he fails to save her, Hideki and Akaya are reunited in an effort to understand what's happened to them and why their daughter had to die.Though it features very little violence or gore, Premonition does contain a decent amount of scares. Like similar Japanese films, it concentrates on creating a mood of fear and uncertainty, eschewing the adrenaline-pumping plot dynamics of American horror flicks. This is the sort of film where the audience repeatedly sees the characters react to something and then the camera moves and the audience sees what they're reacting to. That storytelling distance produces more of an intellectual anxiety, instead of a visceral reaction.After building up the mystery of "The Newspaper of Terror", the story doesn't really pay it off. No questions are answered by the ending the movie offers up, which deal with more of an existential horror that doesn't quite seem like it fits the first three-quarters of the film. It's effective on its own, but I'm not sure it dramatically or thematically flows from what comes before it. It's like taking the conclusion of a good episode of The Twilight Zone and stapling it onto a different but vaguely similar episode of The Outer Limits.Outside of a single scene that is unintentionally hilarious, the acting and direction of Premonition are very nice. That one scene, though, is laugh-out-loud funny. It involves Japanese funeral rites, so the humor may be the byproduct of cultural differences, but I almost couldn't stop laughing when it happened.As long as you're prepared to accept an ending that fails to resolve any of the issues raised by its story, Premonition is worth seeing?if only for the most terrifying scrap of newsprint in cinematic history.</fullReview>

If you don't want to know about the basic plot stop reading NOW - A family man has breaks down on the side of a scenic road. He goes into a phone booth to call for assistance &amp; finds a newspaper that has articles about events that will happen in the near future. That's all I'm saying about the plot! The drama &amp; horror that happens to this guy throughout the rest of the film is frightening, frustrating, &amp; heartbreaking. This is an excellent example of how many Asian horror films have a deep rooted sense of family bonds and loyalty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Final Destination meets The Butterfly Effect in this lingering supernatural thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On his way back from a family outing with his wife Ayaka, and their young daughter Nana, Hideki - an intelligent and well respected high school professor - stops off on a lonesome stretch of road to use the payphone. Whilst waiting in the phone booth for a connection, he finds a strange scrap of newspaper foretelling of his daughter's imminent death. As he contemplates the page in absolute horror, Nana struggles to unbuckle her seat-belt. Seeking assistance, Ayaka crosses the street and taps on the glass. Hideki looks up, startled, when suddenly... a runaway truck ploughs into the couple's stationary car with their daughter still inside. Ayaka and Hideki run to the car, only to watch impotently as a fire ignites and the car bursts into flames. This startling opening sequence sets the wheels in motion for an enthralling supernatural thriller that deals specifically with the notions of guilt, fear and the broader implications of fate; as Hideki and Ayaka are left to join forces to further understand the mysteries of this seemingly spectral newspaper in light of a series of new and perhaps even more damaging premonitions.The thing I like best about Japanese horror films of this particular type is the sense of atmosphere. The use of lingering, slow burning tension when a character approaches a closed door, and we know they shouldn't open it, but we still want them too, regardless! For me, it's everything that horror should be. No gratuitous gore, no shock MTV style montages, just a slow, lingering feeling of dread that grows with intensity from one scene to the next. It also helps that the majority of these films are directed with flair and imagination, while for the most part, offering us intelligent characters and interesting scenarios.For me, Premonition (2004) is up there with some of the best supernatural/psychological horror films of the last ten years; with its combination of eerie plotting, gloomy images and emphasis on character as opposed to cheap thrills. You could always argue that the plot isn't entirely original, seeming like a veritable patchwork of ideas previously developed in films as disparate as The Dead Zone (1983), Final Destination (2000) and The Butterfly Effect (2004); with the usual themes and motifs recognisable from other, more iconic "J-Horror" films, such as The Ring (1998), Dark Water (2000), The Grudge (2000) and Reincarnation (2005), as well as other non-Japanese productions such as The Eye (2002), The Quiet Family (2000) and A Tale of Two Sisters (2003); all of which add to the overall sense of drama and suspense. Regardless, despite the familiarity of the plot and some of its ideas, Premonition still rewards the viewer with an air of creeping mystery, dread, fear and paranoia; as well as some skilfully executed moments of subtle horror and white-knuckle terror.As with many Japanese films of this type, the central concept seems very much rooted in the traditions of old Japanese/Buddhist folktales; the kind of stories and fables that acted as the starting point for classic Japanese shock-cinema such as Kwaidan (1964), Onibaba (1964) and Kuroneko (1968), though with a modern-twist that recasts the idea of a newspaper that can predict future tragedies as more of a serious, unstoppable force; one that perhaps points to deeper, socio-political interpretations pertaining to the current state of Japan in the twenty-first century. Whether or not you choose to approach the film on any deeper, sub-textual level, will be entirely down to the individual, though there's still much to enjoy and take away from the film, even when approached as a straight, by the numbers horror.Like all the great Asian horror films - or any great horror film at all for that matter - it is the story that pulls us in, but the great use of atmosphere that keeps us enthralled until the very end. Although some critical opinion has been mixed; no doubt due to the over-exposure of Japanese/Asian horror cinema over the last five or six years - and in particular from tepid American re-makes - I feel that Premonition is a genuinely good supernatural shocker that should appeal to anyone with an interest in "good horror" that doesn't involve buckets of blood and severed limbs. Alongside Premonition, you can also find two other films from the same producer, Taka Ichise, both of which cover similar stories and ideas as the film in question. These films, Infection (2003) directed by Masayuki Ochiai and Reincarnation (2005) directed by Takashi Shimizu, were meant to be part of the larger "J-horror" collection (involving different supernatural-themed films directed by some of Japan's most creative genre filmmakers), which, at the time of writing, has subsequently been aborted.Regardless, if you like Premonition and appreciate the slow-burning sense of psychological and supernatural dread, then Infection and Reincarnation are both worth checking out, with both of those particular films capturing a similar, sinister mood that unfolds at a slow, lingering pace and works great, especially when experienced at around two o'clock in the morning; of course, just like the film in question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>satisfying but not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much criticism is being pointed at the new(ish) crop of Asian horror, due in part to a lack of originality. Yogen, aka Premonition, can at least be spared this criticism - not one grumpy long haired female spectre in sight! The story itself is also fairly original, with our protagonist stuck in an eternal hell as the curse of the 'Paper Of Death' weaves its evil spell over him and his family. Unfortunately, the director never quite delivers on the scares the premise promises, and too many missed opportunities to strike genuine fear into the audience leave us with yet another Asian Ghost flick that, whilst it has its moments, overall will disappoint those looking for genuine creeps.Having watched the film several times, along with its J-Horror Theatre predecessor 'Kansen' (amongst others), one criticism I do have of the 21st Century glut of Asian horror is that most simply aren't that frightening, and Yogen is no exception.The reason I began collecting Asain horror DVDs was that they brought a genuine breath of fresh air to a genre long since left stale by a seemingly endless run of American slasher flicks, with their annoying, half naked teen protagonists, cartoony killers and cheap 'scares'. The Japanese showed us that horror lurks, not in 250 litres of fake blood, but in the darker corners of the imagination. Using intelligent, often sensitive stories, minimal special effects and striking imagery, fans of the genre were buoyed by the knowledge that the Horror film was not, after all, dead. I quickly began to buy the films that I had read about; Audition, Ju-On, Dark Water etc etc and eagerly looked forward to new releases, only to realise quickly that I already had the creme de la creme of Asian Horror. It is with each new release, and subsequent purchase that I again look forward to, if not stunningly original, then at least frightening films, and can honestly say that that hasn't happened in a while.Yogen appears (for the moment at least) to be the last of the J-Horror Theatre releases, the promised remaining 4 proving elusive. It also continues the trend of heavy atmospherics, interesting visuals and mainly scare free script. Not that Yogen doesn't have its moments, but the majority of the film follows the usual 'investigation' plot, where our heroes must find out 'why' the events are occurring. Surely much of the fear factor is 'not' knowing? Anyway, suffice to say that Yogen still entertains on a level, it's just that that level is more psychological than genuine horror, and with a (literally) big bang start and intriguing conclusion, the mid section drifts through a desert of scare free exposition and ubiquitous, sometimes dull plot development that sadly, I have come to expect from more recent releases. I'm just hoping that the next in the series, the writers and director remember that they are producing a 'horror' film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Found this thing in a used DVD bin. Since I hadn't heard of it (everybody knows for Grudges and Dark Waters, but not this one), I had low expectations. Being wrong about that was only the first of many satisfying surprises.I've seen plenty of weird tales, and sometimes it angers me when I can see the twists coming. But Premonition? I've never seen a movie where the predictable twists are just red herrings that distract from real twists. (It's sort of like how an eighties horror movie plays a fake scare, pause a beat, REAL SCARE.) Maybe some of the twists get silly toward the end, but come the end itself I found this movie much more satisfying than other new horror movies I've seen lately. I was impressed by some creative image framing during a dialog sequence near the beginning. I'd gladly recommend this movie to friends who might like a few low key surprises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant kick of genius in the last third of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Premonition" seems to be a rather ordinary psycho thriller in the beginning that deals with paranormal activities, family dramas and destiny. The actors are very credible and add a lot to the dark and desperate atmosphere of the movie that has no lengths and develops very well with a slow tension that rises more and more. Hiroshi Mikami convinces as desperate broken hearted man that faces destiny while the beautiful and charming Noriko Sakai does a very authentic job as a desperate and seemingly strong woman that is broken underneath the fragile surface.But the true reason why this movie gets such a high rating from me are the last thirty minutes or so of this flick. They are mysterious and disturbing and you don't know what is nightmare or reality or both of it anymore. At this part, the tension rises to an extreme height, the images are intense, the acting is truly addicting and the whole movie gets an awaited kick of genius. For the experts of the genre, the final conclusion might not be surprising but that doesn't change that the whole development is well thought and crafted.I would ultimately say that is movie is maybe one of the rare Asian psycho thrillers that could be understood and accepted by the masses without losing its charm and uniqueness and that's a quite unique thing which I would like to underline. The story is not too strange and slow paced but the weirdo and high amount of creativity and atmosphere is nevertheless heavily present. I would suggest this movie to anyone who would like to slowly get into this genre. It might be an intense but not too complicated introduction to a brilliant world of horror and creativity. I'm looking forward to show this movie to some of my friends to convince and tell them of my passion for mysterious Asian psycho thriller or horror flicks and will surely adore myself watching this again to discover the high amount of stunning details in the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Final Destination-style tale with a J-Horror twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Norio Tsuruta's Premonition, a malevolent supernatural newspaper selects victims at random and reveals to them disastrous headlines from the near-future. When family man Hideki Satomi finds himself haunted by the evil rag, he enters a nightmare world from which the only escape appears to be death.Like Final Destination, the US horror hit that also dealt with foresight and cheating fate, Premonition is a supernatural chiller that opens with a bang: protagonist Hideki witnesses the death of his young daughter in an auto accident immediately after learning of her impending fate via a mysterious paper. It's an excellent beginning to the film: suspenseful, exciting and very harrowing.Unfortunately, after this promising start, the plot slowly begins to lose momentum and despite great performances from its cast and one or two outstanding scares, the whole film looks set to be a huge disappointment. To his credit though, director Tsuruta picks up the pace again in the film's dying moments for a crazy finalé which sees Hideki leaping through time and space in a desperate bid to change history.All in all, I found this inventive slice of J-Horror to be a reasonably fun ride, despite leaving me with a ton of unanswered questions (Why does the paper like to torment people? Why does it choose Hideki? Who prints the bloody thing? If it turns up on a Sunday, do you get supplements?) and fans of the Asian horror scene should still give it a go if they get the chance.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comes on like a creepy, higher budget episode of Outer Limits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premonition is good fun. Whether it's a 'great' horror movie, well it's your choice, in many ways it's more surreal than scary. But never let it be said this movie isn't an enjoyable, entertaining horror flick. Whether it's the surreal lead-up to it's final conclusion that gets you, or the brilliant rubber-faced, terrified and bereaved performance of the main lead, this movie is entertaining creepy fun throughout.Don't get this confused with the J-Horror 'onryo' vengeful ghost style of films. If you want a ghost flick this isn't it. Premonition is like the previous 'J-horror Theatre' installment Infection in that it's a straight psychological horror flick, more in keeping with western films like Mothman Prophecies and its ilk.Premonition concerns a couple who lose their daughter in a horrible car wreck. Seconds before, the father reads a newspaper informing him of the event, but he's too late to react and stop the accident. 3 years later, he begins to get new papers informing him of more horrific events. He attempts to stop them and unravel the mysteries surrounding these papers with the help of his now ex-wife.The strange events are excellent, each revelation regarding the papers chilling and spooky. However, the events he's informed of are maybe not as scary as they could be. Because of a low budget, most of the events happen out of scene, and at times the effects are a little shaky. For instance, the return of the father's child as a hideously burnt ghost is a shocking scene with great prosthetics and brilliant acting, but a later scene where a colleague appears to him with no face just looks silly. Worth noting at this point, though not a hugely tense movie, Premonition is quiet sick and macabre at points, definitely not for the squeamish.Where Premonition differs from the earlier Infection is a strong story and great acting. Infection was quite ropey in these aspects, but Premonition has a very strong cast and a powerful yet warm script. This makes it a very watchable and enjoyable movie to sit through.On the negative side, the ending is a little bit scattergun and at points kind of silly, but other than that, I can't think of much to put it down over, it's a very good horror film.</fullReview>

Along with this shouldn't the daughter have been on the cover? Before watching I thought the student on the cover was his daughter.The overall thought I had was that the movie had been longer originally and had been cut down to meet a certain time limit, causing the illogical rifts to form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one who cannot make it through much of Kurosawa beyond Rashomon (and even that took discipline), I was pleasantly entertained by this. I love horror books and movies, while being not the fan of slasher or "monster" types. Within those bounds, I found this wholly watchable, and I was quite caught up in the last 15 minutes. Recently I have discovered other Japanese horror movies, some with American counterparts. I can't say that the Japanese originals were significantly better in the main, but I believe the difference resides in the details. Sometimes the premise of the original Japanese simply worked better in the light of the Japanese culture (I am thinking here of "Dark Water") I am looking forward to seeing more by this director. I have not yet seen the original "Ring" and would love to compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yogen also known as Premonition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family of 3 [ father, mother, and daughter ] are returning home from a visit with their family. The father needs a payphone with a jack for his computer because of business reasons, so he makes them turn around back to a payphone. While the mother and daughter wait in the car on the other side of the road, the father finds a newspaper under a book in payphone booth.This newspaper, known as 'The Newspaper Of Terror', is a premonition. It lets you see future accidents, such as auto wrecks, murders, suicides, before they actually happen. The newspaper of terror only appears to certain people and those certain people are cursed, for if you do nothing about the future accidents you go insane and die, but if you do happen to do some thing about the future accidents you get a strange skin virus and die.When the father sees that his daughter is going to die in an auto wreck, he is in shock. The mother comes over the to payphone complaining about their daughters seat belt. When they turn around their car with their daughter still in it gets hit by a truck and explodes. The father and mother divorce and both are obsessed with finding out about The Newspaper Of Terror. They begin to see each other again when suddenly the father gets more premonitions and he has to choose between doing nothing or doing something. Finally he gets the chance to go back to his first premonition and set things right.This is my all time favorite movie. I wasn't expecting this movie to be horrifyingly scary with gruesome murders, but I was expecting this movie to be able to fill me with a little fear and to make me want to keep watching, which this movie completely did. But what I wasn't expecting was for the movie to have some very tragic and sad scenes, such as the accidents on the highway next to the payphone in the beginning and ending. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was amazing. He had the chance to go back and fix what happened. Although what he did was terribly sad, it was what he wanted. Like I said ; This is my all time favorite movie.</fullReview>

No doubt this movie was made with the intention of being a horror, however after viewing it, it is blatantly obvious it would be better classified as a drama. The movie is good none-the-less, though it can be a bit long-winded at times. There are points when you will find yourself with the finger on the fast-forward, not wanting to press it, but wanting to at the same time. The acting and story in which the movie follows will keep you sitting through the entire movie. If you should happen upon this movie, it will not harm you to view it, however, don't bother going out of your way to watch it. Overall, the movie receives a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A typical Japanese family is return home from a visit to the in-laws when the father asks to go back to the payphone that they had passed awhile back so that he can jack his laptop computer into it for business reasons. While in the phone booth, he reads of his daughter's impending death in a mysterious ripped newspaper page. Now, both parents are understandably obsessed with the phenomenon of this newspaper. But the rest of the film can't really hope to live up to the promise of the opening scenes. Yea, the acting is alright, but it works more as a melodrama than a horror film, and as such will likely put anyone off expecting that type of film. Conversely those that think "J-horror" is only synonymous with base "jump scares" are likely not to really give the film a chance due to the marketing. So the movie is stuck in a short of celluloid limbo with it's feet in both genres, but not really belonging totally to either. Which is a shame as the film is an alright for what it is. Just too bad that it's trapped by the perceived connotations, both good and bad, of the genre.My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: 6 Subtitled interviews with the director and various cast members; 6 Making of featurettes; 4 &amp; a half minute clip of a press conference; a 6 minute piece on the visual effects; and Trailers for "Undead", "the Devil's Rejects", "Infection", "Ju-On", &amp; "Alone in the Dark"</fullReview>

The creepy story about a cursed professor that blames himself for not saving the life of his daughter, destroying his own life, is very weird, original and scary. The scene with the car accident is very impressive, and when Hideki is trapped in hell, the slow pace of the film changes to a frightening sequence.

Kind of your basic Japanese horror, better made than say Ju-rei, but not quite as much horror in it, nothing compared to Ringu or Ju-on of the Japanese horror movies I have seen so far. The movie starts out showing a family coming home from a vacation. Tragedy ensues...a tragedy that was predicted beforehand by a mysterious paper. The father sees this paper right before something bad happens. Then the movie flashes forward three years and it sort of doesn't make sense. This "newspaper of terror" is mentioned, but it seems more like a movie about clairvoyance. The paper is never explained either, what it means or what supernatural event is behind it, I mean I don't want everything handed to me on a silver platter, but this movie just went everywhere for a while. Mysterious guys locked up in loony bins writing predictions on walls, guys who change the predictions but get really bad welts. Then the movie goes into the stirring conclusion that is pretty good, cause you don't know when the end will be. In the end this is a somewhat interesting movie with a rather sad tone to it.</fullReview>

Actually, J-horror doesn't exactly define Premonition all that well. A little bit Twilight Zone and a little bit Kiyoshi Kurosawa, it has plenty of that impending doom feeling, immediately followed by goose pimples. There was at least one scene where I wanted to turn off the movie because it shook me bad enough to rattle my nerves, so that's good enough to warrant a recommend. I'm sure if I went back and watched this again anytime soon, I'd probably bump it up higher. So for now, let's just call it a day and say 7 out of 10. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing really, but has some merit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norio Tsuruta's Yogen (Premonition) had quite an interesting premise that drew me in. (Off topic for a bit) I first heard about this movie on a "Top Ten J-Horror Movies" video on Youtube, and this title got number 8, but it's premise left me wondering for so long. It wasn't until a year later I was able to get a DVD for this movie, and when I finally sat down and watched this movie I was severely underwhelmed. I don't know what I was expecting, but what I got was a rather predictable, melodramatic boring film.First of all, there are some effective moments. When Hideki first touches the newspaper in the phone booth, there is this creepy chilling moan that gave me a good scare, then after that the ambient horror music started to build and he first read the paper, revealing who was going to be killed. This also scared me, and then what follows is a inevitable jump scare, but a rather good one nonetheless. This is all in the beginning of the film so I was psyched to see the rest of the movie. After all it had such a promising start, the rest would have to be good right? Sadly, the film falls flat shortly after, by making a cliché "3 years later" cut, that shows Hideki coping with what he encountered years before. I had a real problem with this, because I was much interested seeing him developing during this time period, seeing him cope with what happened. Instead we see him act like a down on his luck, brooding cop from a cliché action movie.The inclusion of psychics just seemed so trivial to me, why have them? What is their connection to the paper? That sub-plot doesn't go anywhere. This is a minor spoiler, but Hideki gains the ability to see into the future (like the paper) but if he tries to prevent his predictions from coming true he gets giant ink stains on his skin and eventually this would kill him (if he kept doing it). There were other psychics in this movie but why were they there!? Couldn't they just be people who encountered the paper as well? Could they not afford more scenes of the CGI newspaper? The acting was average, bordering bad.The CGI Paper looked really silly (especially in the scene where it's chasing a char).Really bad dialogue, "It came. The Newspaper." Or "Whenever I see a paper, I remember that day." Intelligence insulting story telling.The ending was predictable, I saw this coming from a mile away, I wont spoil it but its a corny bitter-sweet ending.Other things that bug me, is why hasn't Hideki seen the killer paper at all during the 3 years span? Why all of a sudden does this happen to him at once? Why is there power in a dead guy's house when he died in 1992? Why at the end he didn't just drive away (if you see the movie you will know what I am talking about)??? What the **** was the deal with the god **** psychics!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Japanese horror film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Premonition was a great Japanese horror film from the director Norio Tsuruta. It is about a man Professor Hideki Satomi who has stopped at a roadside phone booth so that he is able to transmit his work through Internet to the university where he works at. Suddenly he finds a scrap of newspaper with the picture of his five years old daughter Nana in the obituary column He sees his wife Ayaka Satomi trying to undo their daughter from the seat-belt, when a truck without steering hits his car killing Nana. Three years later, Hideki is divorced from Ayaka, who is now researching paranormal persons who have said to have claimed to have read an evil newspaper anticipating things that will occur in the future Ayaka,still trying to believe on Hideki, and she finds that there are people are cursed so that they are able to see the future but not to be able to try and find a way to save the victims. I thought that there was a lot of great action happening in this film i also thought that it had a good supernatural feel to it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing change - a film that should be appreciated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yogen aka 'Premonition' I feel has been considerably under appreciated. I perfectly accept that the film is quite slow and steady, it's not action packed and revealing gruesome images every 5 minutes, but that's what adds to the appeal of the film. These days so many Hollywood films are utter BS that are made for one purpose only; profit. Which is done by using useless, repetitive entertainment. Yogen is a horror/thriller so obviously horror fans are more likely to watch the film, but also through out the film we are presented with a story of love between a husband, wife and daughter. This way the film becomes much more enjoyable as it contains a real story line, we get close to the characters and feel empathetic for them, which draws us in even more and makes it more exciting and scary than it already is. There's always the thought of "imagine if I was in that situation" which makes it much scarier. Personally I thought this was a great film, it definitely exceeded my expectations. If you are one to simply watch a film for pure entertainment without having to think, then this probably isn't the film for you. But if you are the type of person who can read a film, understand it and appreciate it for what it is, then this is a definite 'must see'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say the women who played the wife of that skinny Japanese guy is way overshadowed by that dude even though she obviously headlined the movie and demonstrated professional acting and dominated most of the scenes other than the last 10-15 minutes. His ultimate sacrifice was noble although the reality of the illusion created through the newspaper overwhelmed him to the brink of insanity which is quite pathetic indeed. His wife is very beautiful and she was definitely the star of the movie probably her bringing in 75 to 90% of viewers. MY point being the guy was a coward, and a bad actor but the girl (Hiteki) was incredible and my obvious concern is why is she not headlining the credits? That guy is (46) a nobody so i give 7 of 10 stars, and a 5 of 5 because of the wife's reminiscent familiar beauty of stars such as Misaki Ito.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese Fantasy-horror flick lacks suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We learn from the DVD extras from an interview with the Director, that "Premonition" is based on a 30 year old Japanese horror novel titled "Fear Newspaper". The plot involves people who are sent newspapers from unseen forces that foretell the calamitous events or murders in the near future. Premonition reminds me of the 1944 American film "It happened tomorrow" where a man receives a copy of tomorrow's newspaper which predicts his own demise.In this Japanese version, the protagonist is Hideki Satomi. He's a high school teacher obsessed with his work so when traveling on a vacation with his wife, Ayaka, and 5 year old daughter, Nana, the power fails on his notebook computer and he insists that his wife turn their car around and backtrack to a pay phone a few miles away where he can plug the computer into a power source and recharge the battery. As he's waiting for the battery to recharge inside the phone booth, his wife is having trouble extricating Nana from the car as the little girl's dress has gotten stuck inside the seat belt. Meanwhile, Hideki is dumbfounded when a burnt up piece of newspaper comes floating from the sky and rests in front of him inside the phone booth. The newspaper has a picture of his daughter with a caption announcing her death in a horrible accident. Seconds later, as Ayaka leaves the car and goes across the road to get Hideki to help her get Nana out of the car, a truck plows into the car, causing it to catch fire, explode and kill the hapless little girl.Flash forward three years later. Hideki and Ayaka are no longer together (we later learn that Ayaka no longer wanted to hear about the mysterious newspaper that Hideki kept harping upon). Ironically, when the 'fear newspaper' (otherwise referred to as 'newspaper of terror') suddenly starts popping up in Hideki's life again predicting ghastly events, Hideki wants nothing to do with 'newspapers' and is oblivious to their clues; but Ayaka is now a researcher of psychic phenomena at the local university and is intent on getting to the bottom of what might have happened with the 'fear newspaper'.Ayaka is working with an older woman, a psychic who uses her power to produce images on Polaroid (instant) film. The psychic tells Ayaka of a researcher, Rei Kigata, who has disappeared but prior to his disappearance discovered there is a place in the cosmos where all thoughts and memories coalesce. Certain people (like Hideki) become privy to incidents in the future through the fear newspaper which appear (as previously stated), out of nowhere. This is perhaps the weakest aspect of Premonition's story. Unlike the aforementioned "It happened tomorrow", where an old man delivers the newspaper, and there is some kind of relationship between the old man and the protagonist, the 'fear newspaper' arrives as a result from an unseen, vaguely defined force in the cosmos. It would have been much more compelling if there was some kind of devil-like figure that was delivering the newspaper instead of the random delivery which simply wasn't suspenseful.Ayaka soon finds the psychic dead in her research laboratory. Meanwhile, Hideki is powerless to stop the murder of one of his teenage students despite receiving prior notification that the ghastly event will occur. Hideki continues to receive warnings of catastrophic events (such as a landslide) through the fear newspaper and again he's unable to do anything. We're even past the midpoint in the film and the central question is not asked?what can Hideki do to reverse the events that led to the death of daughter? Finally, Ayaka's research assistant finds the address of the mysterious Rei Kigata and Ayaka and Hideki go to visit him. However, when they arrive the house is deserted. By watching various old videotapes (some 12 years old), they see that Kigata attempted to alter the future interfering in the very events that are predicted to come true. We can see that Kigata begins developing plague-like symptoms on his body as a result of his meddling with the future.Finally Hideki realizes that he can change fate but at a cost. Three quarters of the film is already over and finally a suspenseful event occurs. Hideki (after receiving another newspaper) prevents his wife from getting on a commuter train before it crashes and kills most everyone on board. However, Ayaka's research assistant was with her in the train and Hideki doesn't realize it when he pulls his ex-wife off onto the platform right before the train leaves the station.Now Hideki finds himself caught in some kind of vortex where he's going backward in time. Before he knows it, he's back at the scene where his daughter was killed. He tries to interfere, saves the daughter but this time the wife is killed. Then he finds himself inside the cab of the truck with the truck driver who's had the seizure; again he can't stop the truck from plowing into his car. Finally, he remembers what the psychic had told him: you can change your own fate. This time 'he gets it'. He's able to save his daughter but must sacrifice his own life to save the little girl.There's a ton of great material on the DVD extras including numerous scenes that show us how Premonition was made. I was impressed with the degree of cooperation between the director and the rest of the cast and crew. Nonetheless, director Norio Tsuruta resorts to introducing too many horror clichés (e.g. the drooling serial killer) at the expense of a tight and suspenseful plot. Without a clearly defined antagonist and the failure of the protagonist to be proactive throughout most of the film, Premonition fails to accomplish its goals: consistently scare its audience and keep it in a state of suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If you see it...you will die."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ Much of the power of Asian films is to take something ridiculous and make it absolutely terrifying (i.e. a killer video cassette or cell phone). Premonition fails at this task. Then again, a killer newspaper is a bit of a stretch, even for the Japanese. It is ultimately not scary at all and becomes quite laughable. The lead actor was not helping either. Take a look at the scene where the daughter is blown away. He was trying to convey the horror of the situation but instead was making me laugh. A stronger actor was needed in my opinion. A stronger storyline would have helped as well. It reminded me of Final Destination by way of Early Edition. A man finds newspaper articles that tells the future (which is always bad) but he is unable to stop the events from happening. If he does attempt to change the course of events, he causes "a ripple in death's design" so to speak and puts himself in danger. And it all falls apart in the end. The main character is trapped in a hell-like series of events and it leads inexplicably to the denouement. It's too convenient. This film could have easily been made here in the States, so there is no reason to remake it Hollywood! Infection was the first entry in the J-Horror Theater series and this was the second, so I won't be sticking around for a third. It seems now that we've named it J-horror, we're just trying to exploit it. Taka Ichise needs to put some of the money he's made into smarter films. Hopefully he will learn from his mistakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Premonition" Is A Shadow Of What Once Was...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone feel free to call BS on this, but it seems that as soon as J-Horror became self-conscious (and subsequently donned the moniker J-Horror), the genre films coming out of Asia have become less and less effective...interesting...engrossing...OK, scary.For evidence, all you need to do is watch the two self-consciously titled J-Horror flicks, "Yogen" and "Kansen," and compare them to earlier Asian horror entries (any of the Kurosawa films, "Uzumaki," "Temegotchi," or even "Jisatsu Circle"). I guess it's the same cautionary-evolutionary tale of "alternative entertainment" becoming the Walmart-driven norm. (Uh-oh, I've blown my cover; I am a bitter old man after all.)At the risk of sounding clichéd and nostalgic, once upon a time, contemporary Asian horror was largely uncharted territory for us folks in the US. It was a wild landscape, filled with dread and darkness (and some real characters and some real sadness). As non-Hollywood product that had to be procured carefully and watched on a region-free DVD player that you couldn't buy at Walmart, Asian horror flicks had that ineffable, mysterious WOW FACTOR. I remember thinking, 'Supernatural horror is BACK!' Seven years ago, I called it that "Omigod that longhair chick is not actually going to climb outta that damn television" effect. Horror was new again, it had teeth again, and I could watch a horror film made by someone other than Wes Craven or one of his idiot minions and actually get the crap scared out of me. YAY!But I guess all good things must come to pass. For example, I bought this DVD at Walmart. (OK, that is entirely irrelevant.) To its credit, "Yogen" (Premonition) tries very hard to embrace that real Asian horror of a decade ago. It conjures up vulnerable characters as best it can; it slathers in the pathos of burnt-children-ghosts desperately calling out their parent's names at midnight; it infuses itself with jump shots of trucks appearing out of nowhere to pulverize innocent pedestrians; it even has people turning into black, ashy marks on the walls and floors as they mysteriously pass from this world into oblivion (I hope Kurosawa gave permission for that one!).But regardless of its flawless twists and turns, fine acting, and solid visuals....it just comes up flat. Don't get me wrong: "Yogen" has the melodrama, detailed apocalyptic storyline, and even a little bit of the "ick" factor. But when it comes right down to it, "Yogen" simply does not have the chops. Yes, we've got the wide-eyed male protagonist who is at turns weepy and angry, the steely female lead who is determined to understand the supernatural secret of the "fear newspaper," and the victims who have nasty things happen to them (acts which are never entirely justified or understandable of course--gotta love that hopeless, random Asian horror!).But "Yogen" ends up being only a shadow of the many truly terrifying films that preceded it. I realize that my comment here may be less a movie review and more a statement about my own jaded plane of existence. In fact, there may be nothing wrong with "Yogen" at all. Those discovering the newfangled-named J-Horror for the first time will probably be swept into its depressing, hopeful, sad, unpredictable realm. But for those of us who have been riding the wave of Asian horror (which some say crashed to the shore half a decade ago)--well, we just need to make sure we don't get pulled down by the undertow. (And Jennifer Connelley was absolutely fine in the "Dark Water" remake; but I still prefer the convoluted original...apologies.) EPILOGUE: So, I hear that Kurosawa's "Kairo/Pulse" is being remade by an American director and is being cast as a "punk" flick of some kind. Hmmm, I hate to say it, but methinks I've got a lot of heartbreak coming down the pike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty much the only saving grace of this movie was the performance of bug-eyed, scenery-chewing actor Hiroshi Mikami in the lead. Beyond that and some unsettling dream-like sequences at the end of the movie, there's nothing to recommend here. Premonition is slow, the effects are nearly all laughably bad, the story is obvious, and the antagonist of the movie is (MINOR SPOILER HERE) a badly-animated dirty newspaper. (END SPOILER) Viewers of American TV may be aware of a rather insipid syndicated show about a man who somehow gets the next day's paper delivered to him and then goes around trying to prevent trouble from happening. This is basically the plot of Premonition (and about a billion other bad science fiction stories). Mixed in with this is a very soap-operatic story of the protagonist and his wife trying to get over the loss of their child. The supernatural events which occur in the movie are never really explained, which would be fine if they were more mysterious to begin with, but since they are rather mundane anyways, the lack of an explanation seems like a let-down.I could go on (in particular, about a scene where someone is stabbed, and the filmmakers decide to use CGI to show blood spreading under this person's clothing -- what, were you afraid to get fake blood on a sweater? Is there some kind of terrible sweater famine in Japan? Come on, people, this is the most rudimentary possible special effect, and it looks about a million times better than slapping some red on the film via After Effects or something). Suffice it to say that this film is a waste of time, and along with Infection (2004) represents an exceedingly poor start for the "J-Horror Theater" franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more A-Horror titles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am just getting into A-Horror (Asian-horror) flicks, sorry for being tardy, but I was wondering if any of you could suggest some titles for em to watch. I saw the "Eye" movie last year and I thought it was great, I hear Tom Cruise is going to make it American style, probably will turn out to be a load. I had heard about a trilogy of A-horror flicks that came out earlier this year, but I cannot remember the names. I know there was one about cannibalism, I would really like to see that. I did see Pulse, the Japanese version and the American Version, the Japanese version sucked egg rolls and the American version wasn't any better. I had a difficult time telling the characters apart in the Japanese version and I also had the experience where I wasn't really sure of character motivation either. I uttered several exclamations of "Why did they do that?" Oh well I guess that goes with the territory. I cannot find any horror movies anymore that scare me, is it me? and I jaded? or are they no longer being made? Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an interesting (though seen before) opening, this film sinks into blandness. It tries to be moody and foreboding without going for the cheap scares, but the proper tone is never really established. That may be because the very conceit is just a little over the top. Every time the newspaper appears, the spooky music cues, the actor's eyes get wide, and he steps trepidaciously towards the ill omen and you feel as though you are waiting for something to jump out at you...but the truth is, there's nothing really that scary about a newspaper. I don't believe that everything in a movie needs to be explained or make sense, but when things are left unexplained, it should be done to good effect. That's an effect this film never achieves, try as it might.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this was a horror movie which seemed to be different, I watched the trailer and I liked it, so I went today to see the whole thing. And this is what I found: The acting is so bad, the timing is so slow, the ideas behind the plot are so poor... and maybe Japanese movies use to be slow, but for me it's the worst movie I have seen this year. It doesn't scare at all. At some points you can see that the director wanted to remark a detail with the only purpose of scaring you, but fails, at least for me. Only the ending scenes are dynamic and catch your eye, but that's not enough. The rest is dull. And there's too much Japanese writing for an European viewer, I think.Ah, and just one detail: they used the same computer effect to make disappear the ghostly newspapers and also... the title credits... weird, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Premonition' - The movie I thought 'White Noise' was going to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about the J-Horror Theater collection the premise sounded awesome and was eager to view whichever installment came my way first. I still have high hopes for other titles in the series mind you, but upon completion of Volume 2: "Yogen" (Premonition), my enthusiasm has been shaken.Not that the basic premise of "Yogen" is all that bad or the movie suffered from awful production value - its just the base narrative is so fractured the stronger points are suffocated. And I love fractured narratives; Ju-On: The Grudge, Memento and similar flicks thrill me like nothing else can. Like these movies did, "Yogen" too takes drastic left turns to introduce key facets of the plot, but lacks even eventual explanation of newly introduced elements.Remember, this is just the opinion of an uneducated geek here, so if I am way off base feel free to call me on it.Sometimes it amazes me just how far off base expectations can turn out to be though: "Yogen" turned out to be the type of scare-free feel-good failure I assumed 'White Noise' was going to be. I bring this up as the two story lines are very similar, so if you have any reservations about "Yogen" I recommend skipping it and checking out the far superior Michael Keaton flick if you haven't already.Thanks for listening!</fullReview>
