		<shortDescription>Premonition - Through My Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel as though I perhaps see more into movies than either: a) what may actually be meant or b) what others may see in the film. This could be true with this movie as well, but I think it is the latter. With many movies it is difficult to give a real review without giving away much of what needs to be experienced first hand. That is definitely the case with Premonition. So, first I will say that the exhausting but powerful performance by Bullock was commendable. She was in every single scene and the toll must have been heavy. She pulled it off with gold stars. The story was very unique. The dialogue did not stand out as incredible, but you have to understand that this is almost a one woman show. So far I see no flaws in the writing. I will watch it again, but I think that most of the common confusions with the stories lines can be explained. The movie goes back and forth and you really need to pay attention and have a great sense of time. It can be tricky to figure out if what is happening is past, present or future. But if I could figure it out?I am sure anyone can. Now, I want to discuss what this movie said to me. It may however be a gateway to spoilers. So, if you plan on watching this movie and want to do so with a fresh head?do not read any further. Just know that it is a movie worth watching, you need to pay attention and definitely open your mind. Bullock's character in the film was a housewife with a husband and 2 daughters. She was a stay at home mom and it was clear that she had been experiencing some depression prior to the news of her husband's death. Through out the movie you go back and forth through moments when her husband is dead and alive. After she learns of his death, she experiences lapses in time when she seems to jump through timelines in her life changing little experiences here and there that impact the next timeline. Does that make sense? Anyway. She learns he was about to have an affair and for a moment, decides she prefers him dead and that even though she thinks she MAY be able to help avoid his death, she wonders if she should even do that. We learn during these times that their relationship was on its last breaths. They seem almost resentful and bitter towards one another. She then has a conversation with a clergyman and asks his opinion on what she can/should do. He basically tells her that she needs to find something to fight for?something to be hopeful about. She finally decides that she wants to not only save her husband, but their marriage. The night before she thinks he is going to die she explains to him (in very little words ? mostly tasteful and romantic actions) that she wants their marriage to survive. They end up making love. The next day she wakes up and it is the day he is to die. She does what she can to stop it. She finally gets in touch with him on his cell phone and tells him that she knows all about the affair and that she doesn't care ? she loves him. They exchange 'I loves yous' a few times and she sees his car ahead of hers right at the spot he was suppose to die. She tells him to turn around ? thinking that will change the course and he would survive. But when he does this, a gas tanker hits his car ? obviously killing him. She wakes at the end, you know it is months later and she has a pregnant belly. She was able to changes the details in her life. She was able to forgive her husband before he died; instead of him dying while they both lived in contempt of one another. She was able to come to terms with the possibility of his death; instead of the sudden shock. She was able to allow him to spend some quality time with his children; knowing she may not be able to stop his demise. And of course, she was able to create another child ? one that would have never existed otherwise. But she was not able to change his ultimate fate. She was not able to stop his death. This is how the film spoke to me, being a depressed housewife and mother whose marriage has seen better days? We can change how we behave and react in our lives right now. We can decide to make our lives better for the moments we are in presently. We can make little changes that can affect us forever. But we truly have little control over our ultimate fate. And when it comes down to it ? we all have the same fate; death. It can come when we least expect it. It can come after a long, hideous illness. But it will come. What we need to do is live our lives for the happiness and love that sit in our paths right now. RIGHT NOW. Not a new theory. Nothing I am saying hasn't been heard a million times before. But perhaps this needs to be drilled into our heads ? though movies, music, books, news?we need to start living the way we deep down know we should. You want to know the meaning of life? This is it, my friends. As simple as that. Life is short. Live, love, give and appreciate. Period. Most of us won't have the opportunities the characters had in this movie. We need to take those opportunities now because instead of waking up to yesterday?we may not wake up at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than some reviewers have suggested</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some negative reviews of this movie before I went to see it. They were completely misguided! The movie is both intelligent and emotionally appealing. The actors are excellent. The literary symbols are consistent and right on the mark for the destination of this very well-made film. It is important to keep in mind that the movie is made on a time-line of contingencies, so that what would otherwise be inconsistent actually can make sense in light of changes introduced by the non-sequential experiences of Sandra Bullock's character. I suppose those looking for some kind of horror movie or brain-blank thriller (both of which can be enjoyable in their own light) might not have enjoyed it. But those looking for a narrative worth following, a message with some significance, and a generally well-made movie ought to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot holes, bad acting, and one bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had expectations for what this film was going to be like. It fell short horribly. Maybe I had too great of expectations. The movie starts out really well and is strong for a while. As it progresses, there are plot holes. It goes through all the days in a week, and there are inconsistencies between the days. A lot of the occurrences work out as the days progress, but some of them don't, and just leave you wondering "why did they think that? they knew what really happened." Even if Sandra doesn't know what happened in the previous days, everyone else does and at points they blatantly don't seem to know about things they should. Also, Sandra will do things on a later day of the week because of something that happened earlier in the week. Why is she doing those activities if she does not know about the earlier events yet? It's tough when dealing with time, to work out all the kinks. At some points it seems like the movie works out, but then some things don't. I thought Sandra's acting was solid, she gave a good performance. The daughters were also good little actresses. McMahon's performance was bad. He puts out nothing until the very end where it looks like he is actually showing emotion. I don't think he was well suited to the role.The ending seemed to negate the entire point of the movie. It's the only ending that could make sense I guess, and yet it did not fit. It left all of us in the theater wondering "Is that it? That's how it ends?!" It resolves nothing and leaves you with a bad taste. The very end of the movie is also a huge cliché that I wish the movie would just have avoided. Over all, I thought the movie was entertaining for a while. Then it lost its steam. I will probably not see it again, once is enough. It's a good movie if you don't analyze things. If you simply want to watch a movie, then maybe you'll enjoy it. However, if you prefer to also think about what you've seen, this probably isn't the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a clue on how to watch this movie: If you're looking to be disappointed based on any inconsistencies, pay closer attention to the movie. The so-called "inconsistencies" are actually based on a series of events that combine to actually change many of the things you end up seeing happening early on in the movie. Remember: The events that you see happening on the screen aren't happening linearly. The calendar hops all over the place throughout the movie, so it is possible for events that transpire one day to effect what ends up happening in future days. There are two days that are especially noteworthy in terms of what would change the events of the future and they happen toward the end of the movie. Think of how these events will affect the other events that happen in the future and remember that as you see what happens at the end of the movie.I think the reason this movie hasn't been garnering a lot of critical praise is because movie critics don't really want to have to utilize logic while watching a movie. Another poorly reviewed film starring Sandra Bullock, the truly brilliant The Lake House, was an even bigger victim of movie critics' pathetically anemic logic processing skills. In watching both movies, you really have to keep your faculties alert and not lull yourself into a sense of "okay, I can just turn my brain off now." And really, even though this movie isn't as good as The Lake House, it is equally blessed with the beautiful, talented Ms. Bullock, on top of featuring the beautiful, talented Nia Long, the totally likable Julian McMahon, and some very good acting by the child actors. And the film is very beautiful to look at, too; I now understand why Bullock was raving about the cinematography and direction.So please do see this movie and don't be dissuaded by the negative remarks. You really do have to pay attention to this film in order to enjoy it, but once you do pay attention, you will be richly rewarded. I'm glad I went to see it and so should you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I walked into "Premonition" today expecting the worst based on the low rating here on IMDb, but throughout the course of the movie I felt my smile growing bigger and bigger.It started off smoothly and nicely, and had some of the best directing I've seen in a while. The suspense was held together well, and all of the acting was great. There were a few good scares even.The moment I saw the title on the poster a few months back, I thought to myself, 'How can this do anything different that the Final Destination series hasn't?' Well I was proved wrong. This movie was put together amazingly and seemed very original to me.The only flaws I see with this movie is that you seen the end coming from 3/4 through the movie, and I sympathized more at the beginning of the film rather then the end. But all in all, PREMONITION is a must see. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was an 8/10 until the ending came around... what a letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Premonition" is one of the few films I recall seeing where I left the theatre infuriated. Not because the movie was bad. Rather, the movie was very good until the utterly annoying ending.This film had it all. The script for the most part was mature and well paced. The direction was superb. The score was excellent. And Sandra Bullock held herself quite nicely throughout the film, putting forward one of her better performances.That being said, the entire film comes to a screeching halt with one of the sloppiest endings I have ever seen. It was bad enough that I could see the crux of the finale from a mile away. But what pounded it in further was that this crux comprised the entirety of the conclusion. Not only is it not enough to be the ending, but it resolves nothing. When the screen faded to black and credits began to roll, the entire audience where I was began to chuckle and I could hear a chorus of, "Is that it? That's the ending?"This is one of those films that could be enjoyable so long as the viewer stopped before the final scene. Even that might leave the viewer feeling let down, but not nearly so as having to watch what is surely the sorriest excuse for a finale I've seen in a professional film in a long time. "Premonition" showed lots of promise and delivered throughout, but collapses just before the finish line. A wasted opportunity for all those involved, and sadly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the bad critics and definitely not the low rating on IMDb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Premonition yesterday and I enjoyed it very much, so I can't understand why people say that this is a bad film. It's a good psychological drama with top acting and good directing. It's a movie on which you have to focus, but that goes automatically and it's not so hard to follow when you don't think "What the hell is going on" during the film.Sandra Bullock is very convincing, as always, and we also get some good performances by Kate Nelligan, Nia Long and Julian McMahon.So please, don't listen to the critics, they don't know what they're talking about. And as for the rating on IMDb: the only explanation I can think of is that a lot of people don't get this film because it's too complicated (although it's not), or because they didn't like the ending, or maybe because they expected too much. But this is definitely a very good drama, and it's one of those movies that make you think about how important life is.Everyone who wants to see this movie: see it without any expectations and prejudices, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting premise combined with spooky mood and tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this in the cinema last night with my girlfriend. First of all, this movie was not even close to as bad as pretty much every review has said. This was a very interesting movie and worked upon an original idea and executed it in an above average manner. The only gripes I had with it were that the priest in the end and Dr. Roth were casted very poorly and detracted from the punch in the end. Speaking of the ending, it wasn't nearly as a let down as people say on here either. Not quite a movie I'd see more than once, but it kept me interested and entertained until the end- what more could you ask for? The scenery and cinematography were excellent and the whole movie seemed like it took place either at sunrise or at sunset, which added a serene and quiet backdrop to it, which I noticed right away. The soundtrack was fantastic and right up there with the Sixth Sense in terms of effectiveness; none of it got in the way of the action.I highly recommend this movie to families and couples- it's a great way to forget about the outside world for an hour or so! Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the loosest script ever put on film... Atrocious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The major flaw of this movie is it's script. The idea's involved are not well thought out and at time's it feels as though there were parts of the movie that were written out. The character that Bullock plays is a tool of destiny, meaning that she receives this information (we'll get to why in a bit) and instead of trying to prevent it she takes every step she can to move towards it. For example, early on when she flashes to after her husband's death she finds she has been prescribed lithium and the doctor who prescribed it to her would in fact commit her. When she tries to find this doctor in the phone book she finds that the page with his name has been torn out. Now, flash forward to the past before the husband death and logic should dictate do not contact the doctor but of course this does not happen. Instead she immediately goes to the phone book and ~(mock)shock~ rips the page out goes to his office and tells him that her husband is going to die and that she knows this because she is living her life out of order and ~(mock)shock~ the doctor prescribes her lithium. This is about the time where a normal person would think maybe I should try to change this... Once again, no. In fact at no point does anyone try to discover if this can be prevented. Bullock, more or less, hurdles towards the end where ~(mock)shock~ she finds she is the reason behind the husbands accident and she can't save him because everything she has done was the cause of it. Now on to the truly ridiculous. The reasoning that we're giving for Bullock's problem is her loss of faith in god, however, we never see where she looses her faith. In fact other than the priest saying it's been a while since he's seen her we have no reason to think she even had faith in god.The inconsistencies in the movie are even worse. The daughter of Bullock on Tuesday of this insane week. Runs through a pane of glass slashing her face up however on Wednesday when we first see the girl there is no sign of this at all. Also, Bullock is at the scene of the horrid accident when it occurs which begs the question why did the cops have to come and tell her. Finally the only person who believes her at all is in fact her husband proved by that fact that he triples his life insurance policy the day of his death... but he doesn't even ask how he dies!!! No one, not even the man who dies, tries to prevent this from happening until 5 minutes before it happens. The list does go on but I'm afraid I'd have to publish a book in order to list them all. Simply put the script was awful, the characters were beyond stupid, the camera work brought back thoughts of the Blair Witch and it was extremely predictable. This is basically a glorified Lifetime movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piecing the Puzzle Together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Relative newcomers, writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo, have concocted a testy little conundrum of a movie titled PREMONITION: whether the audience decides to step into their little nightmare or reject the premise that powerful emotions can drive the brain to peculiar directions of functioning will be the divisive break in acceptance of the film's premise. It is a fairly well done, thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast.The Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and wife Linda (Sandra Bullock) buy their new home. Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls (Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness), a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim. Abruptly, Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend (Nia Long) and mother (Irene Ziegler) help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy. Yet Linda continues to 'relive' moments: one day Jim is dead the next he is alive, and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda's mind become clues to investigate information she doesn't want to know. She encounters a warped psychiatrist (Peter Stormare) and a possible 'other woman' in Jim's life (Amber Valletta), and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense, she learns about the possible 'why' of the mental state in which she is trapped.The film has problems holding credibility, but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps. Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely, gains our empathy, and in the end the film works because of her. She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well. No, this is not a great movie, but it is a well-produced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination, and that is a good thing! Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>above average assembly line thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the rather thorough drubbing it suffered at the hands of some of the nation's most prestigious critics, "Premonition" is actually a pretty well-thought-out and tightly wound thriller, given emotion and heart by its star, Sandra Bullock. It's not a movie I would be wiling to go to the mat for, but as throwaway thrillers go, this one is really not half bad. Bullock plays Linda Quinn Hanson, a suburban mother of two, who receives the shattering news that her husband has been killed in an auto accident. However, when she wakes up the next morning, she finds him, strangely, sitting in the kitchen, suddenly alive and well, benignly sipping coffee before heading off to work. The question quickly arises, did she dream the story of his death, is she dreaming now, or is she undergoing some sort of mental crisis precipitated by the shock of her loss? Or is she caught in some sort of bizarre time warp that allows her to jump back and forth between the periods before and after his "death," and, if so, might she be able to step in and alter the course of events to prevent the accident from happening in the first place? In both concept and form, "Premonition" is pretty much an assembly-line thriller designed to tweak the audience's brain cells for a couple of hours before sending everyone home with not a whole heck of a lot left to think about once it's over. Still, it's intriguing enough while it lasts and only the true nitpickers among us will feel compelled to put its twists and turns in logic under the scrutiny of a critical microscope. Despite a few weak moments in her performance, Bullock actually makes us care about the character and the very strange thing that is happening to her."The Premonition" is by no means a classic - or even first rate - chiller, but those with a few spare hours on their hands and a penchant for brain-puzzlers could do worse than check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bullock Stands Out In A Below Average Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though 'Premonition' is a remake, it starts off quite well by creating the suspense but as the story proceeds, we are presented with more plot holes (the scar on the daughter's face was absent on Wednesday but she crashed into glass on Tuesday) and towards the end it all becomes ridiculously messy. It is quite well shot and Sandra Bullock does a commendable job carrying the whole film. However the writing is a letdown and the background score acts as a spoiler. The supporting cast does not stand out much as they are not given much to do. Julian McMahon is quite okay. 'Premonition' pretty much turns out just to be another one of those thrillers that one can watch once and then forget. Towards the end, the writer throws in the religious angle (Bullock's character was not portrayed as someone religious or one who lost faith, thus this does not quite fit) which looks forced and of course the usual Hollywood ending. It is not exactly a boring film as one would sit through it till the end. Mostly because we are interested to know what happens to Linda (Bullock makes us care about her). Other than that, the film creates a mood that keeps the viewer somewhat involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really had no interest in seeing Premonition, the trailer in itself looked very confusing, but it was my friend's pick tonite, so her, me, and a few friends saw it and it pretty much lived up to our expectations. I mean, it was a little better, but the story just in some ways did not work and not to mention that the ending was a disappointment. Because I do not want to give any spoilers, I'm not going to give away anything, but there is a daughter who is injured in the movie and her injuries are a continuity problem throughout the film, like the first scene, but you'll see what I mean.Linda is a mother and wife, pretty typical days that usually involve taking the kids to school, working out, and cleaning house. She is also involved in a marriage that has lost it's spark, but unfortunately one day she finds out that he was killed in a car accident. But the next day, she wakes up and he's alive! Day by day, it changes where he is dead, then alive, then dead, then alive; but slowly she puts the pieces together by writing herself a day by day diary and finds out truly what happened.The acting was alright and the story just could have been better. The ending was a little off, you'll see what I mean. But the story just had some flaws that I couldn't get by, it was just an average thriller that you could figure out in the first hour if you are used to the "suspense thrillers". So, I would recommend you wait this one for a rental, it's nothing exciting, just an alright movie that you might enjoy at home.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premonition was a great movie. Everyone is complaining that there are plot holes and the movie is confusing and it could never really happen. You guys, don't you realize that this movie isn't even really about the premonition it's what stems from the premonition. Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) realizes that no matter how bad the situation may seem, there's always two sides to every story. Watching it you realize that we are all human, and we all make mistakes, and in the time watching the movie you feel what the character is feeling. You want to save Jim just so that things can go back to normal. And when you hear his heart felt apology and she realizes just how much she loves her husband only to have him ripped away from her you feel AWFUL. And then you realize that it was better for Jim to die with her knowing all of those things than it would be for him to die and her not know those things and never know what really happened to her husband.Premonition isn't just a suspense... it's a romantic tragedy. And I think it was well worth my time and money to go see it. And I think that if you just stop thinking about all the stupid technicalities, you'll feel the same way, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot holes in this movie were so annoying that it just left a bad taste in the mouth. Yes, I understand that she lived the days of that week out of sequence and as a result she was a bit confused about what was going on. But why was everyone else confused? Why was her mother asking what happened to her daughter's face when it had happened 4 days previously and she had been with her since the accident? Why had she no scars in the first scene of the movie - that through me off completely. I gave the movie more credit than it deserved for the first half hour because of this - I thought that she might somehow be influencing the events of the movie but no - she makes absolutely no attempt to change anything until it is too late. Why not tell her husband to avoid that highway? No that would both be too simple and intelligent. And of course, it makes the seemingly obligatory reference to the fact that if you don't believe in Jesus, your life is empty and you have no soul.Avoid, avoid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problems with time consistency and consistency of "message"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since others have already mentioned the numerous plot holes in this mess, I don't feel it's necessary to repeat them here. I will add, however, that plot consistency is crucial when a viewer is given the task to try and figure out what is happening. I love movies like Memento and Butterfly Kiss that screw around with time. I am good at keeping track of the time (immediately noticing the time problem with the daughter's face cuts) and enjoy the challenge of trying to figure out what's happening. The lack of consistency in this movie was incompetent and lazy.Another problem with the movie was its feeble attempt to present a deep message without providing it. Although there was a pretense about the importance of love and faith, it was her decision to honor her love for her husband that led her to attempt to save her husband's life. Ultimately, this love resulted in his death. The decision to honor this love was partly influenced by a discussion about faith with her priest. So her faith caused his death. If what happened to her happened to me, I'd throw faith out the window and never set foot in a church again.Simply put, this movie shows a lack of respect for the intelligence of audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is bad. Worse than bad.Firstly if you have seen the trailer then you already know the plot of the entire film, so you don't have to bother watching the whole film. Also the film is very predictable, you can probably watch the trailer and guess how it will end.Also for time travel films of this nature continuity is so important. It must all add up so that there are no plot holes but half way through the film the writers and director drop the ball and make a large continuity error which ruined the film, from there on in a lost more interest as the film went on.The characters were also not likable and you really don't care what happens to them, i had no vested emotions in anyone...except maybe the husband who i felt sorry, because he was married to such a wet blanket.In the end you are left feeling depressed and wonder why they bothered to even make the film. Avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid storyline and silly characters -- BAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a great fan of Sandra Bullock, I had high hopes for this movie. Part of the big letdown is that the trailer made out the movie to be a thriller or a mystery, but the psychotic jumble of out-of-sequence of scenes became tedious instead of interesting.The husband's character was lame and shallow. I kept thinking, why is she even married to this oaf? He had no personality whatsoever, partly because he had very few lines in the movie. I blame this on whomever wrote the script. Did we even believe for a second that the husband cares for her? The husband was such a jerk, by the time the movie ended, I actually WANTED him to die.Also, after the accident with the sliding glass door, the husband says, "why didn't you put stickers up?". He was accusing his wife of being guilty for his own daughter's stupidity. How dumb was that? Having grown up with sliding glass doors my whole life, we never put stickers on ours and little kids didn't try to run through the glass. That scene was very unrealistic.The ending was just plain stupid. The husband turns his car around on the WRONG side of a hill -- if he got killed, he deserved to for being such an idiot. If Sandra's character really wanted to save him, she should have told him to get out of the car and run up the hill. You wouldn't tell him to turn around and block traffic. Once again, stupid and unrealistic!! Finally, my main complaint is that the movie itself has lots of "dramatic" moments that you make a mental note of and then they are never explained. You find out at the end that none of them mean anything. I don't like being "highjacked" at the end by being told that the whole film had been meaningless.I give this movie a grade of "D minus".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea, performed horribly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I thought this movie was going to be good, simply because I like these kinds of movies. I enjoyed Final Destination as well as The Lake House, both being part and parcel of the "see things before they happen" and "timeslip" genres (if they can be called genres).Now, this movie (and here's a spoiler) makes some ENORMOUS mistakes in how it was put together. We learn that Jim dies on Wednesday, having left a message on the phone about how he meant what he said the day before (Tuesday) - but he is referring to what he said on Sunday (we learn in the movie) and his actions on Wednesday morning (tripling his life insurance) also stem from Sundays events. The catch here is that we as viewers view the days in the "wrong order" together with the main character. She comes to realize she loves Jim on the second to last day we watch (Sunday), but the movie continues on the next day we watch (Wednesday) as if it was Monday.I know this might be confusing, but the way the movie is laid out it becomes important to keep track of what happens on what day. For example, the oldest girl runs through the glass door on Tuesday and gets cut up real bad, but on Thursday (the first day we view) the girl is unharmed and the glass door is untouched.I'm very sorry to say that this movie badly bungled the entire concept they were trying to catch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man this movie is so bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start out that the premise of the story is interesting but the script and the execution of it was off and in some scenes, waaaay off. This is about a woman, played by Sandra Bullock, who gets a strange phone call and then she gets a knock on the door and a policeman informs her that her husband was killed in an auto accident.That night, she sleeps and wakes up to find that her husband is alive and nothing bad has happened. She keeps going forward and then backward in time. This is all causing her to question her sanity. On top of that, she suspects that her husband is cheating which is causing her conflicted emotions.Now this seems interesting and it was to a degree but the execution and certain scenes just made this movie suck big time. For instance, there was a scene where she could not believe that her husband's body was in the coffin that was inside a hearse. As the pallbearers were taking the coffin out, she grabs at the coffin to see who is in the coffin. Well, this causes the coffin to be dropped and the top half of the coffin to be ripped out of the coffin where a head pops out and rolls around the ground. I can tell you that I busted out laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face. I mean what kind of coffin is it that the top half just falls apart and then like a scene from Jackass, the head starts rolling around on the ground? I mention Jackass because there was a scene where Johnny Knoxville was driving a hearse up a hill and the coffin slid out and a body burst out causing people to gasp in horror. The creators of the movie must of thought of that when they made this scene.Another laughable scene was where the daughter runs around the house and manages to burst through the glass door to the patio and her face is all cut from the broken glass. Can such a thing happen? Possibly but this kid was not going full tilt straight to the glass door but rather was lazily running to the glass door. Now, I don't know about you guys but I have a glass door myself that leads to back of the house and I have had kids hit the glass door and nothing like that has happened.There were some CGI's in this movie that seem poorly done such as the bird and the bees scene.Overall, a dumb movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to see this movie and waited since the first time I saw the trailer. Unfortunately, I was let down. I left the theater feeling disappointed and annoyed with the ending. I still like the idea of the movie, but there is no point in knowing the future if you can't change it. I found the movie to be too much like a Greek tragedy where the victim causes the future by knowing it, and the predictability of that was not entertaining. This is a movie where you can see the end from the beginning, but you spend the entire movie hoping that there is some way to change what is to come only to have your hopes squashed. I don't even know how else to describe it except disappointing. As others have pointed out, there were some inconsistencies in the plot, but they could have been explained by Linda changing the future by knowing what is going to happen before it does, except that it only happens when it is convenient for the director (as in the daughter who is fine the first day - Thursday, when we later see that she ran through a glass door on Tuesday). But, despite that, I enjoyed the movie until the end, and I guess a lot of people feel that way. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless you have nothing better to do and it is free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did I enjoy this movie? - Yes. Would I see it again? - Yes. Was it a great film? - Who cares because I enjoyed it.I am a hopeless romantic and I am firmly of the opinion that if you spend good money to see a film, attend a theatre production or read a book, to a certain extent, you have to suspend belief to allow yourself to enjoy the event.A lot of people have criticised this film for factual or plot inconsistencies ? I'm glad they have the time to observe and report them.Many others criticised the ending ? I thought it was inevitable.What moved me about this film was the 'miracle' factors, if you like.None of us would be given the opportunity that Linda was granted.She had, what appeared to be, a normal happy marriage and family life and all was fine. One day, the door bell rang and she opened the door to face the nightmare that we all fear, the news that she had lost the love of her life, her partner, the father to her children in a tragic accident.Then the first 'miracle' began. She was suddenly allowed to experience a confused 'replay' of the days leading up to this tragedy. It seemed to be played out in two phases. Firstly, she was an observer, trying to may sense of the alternating premonition days and facts. Secondly, she began to make sense of these facts taking control and changing events.She began to understand that her marriage was not as perfect as it seemed. She also found out that her husband was starting another relationship.She was granted the opportunity and time to come to the conclusion that she did truly love her husband, to let him know this and to take action to change events.Ultimately her actions probably sealed his fate but then, maybe his fate was never able to be changed. What she was able to do, in those brief few days, was to revisit her marriage and family, to reconfirm the love for her husband and to be granted the second 'miracle', the opportunity of a new life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about several very stupid people, with a main character who knows the future but is too dumb to do anything WITH her foreknowledge. Not surprising, as her mother as a callous ratbag who has her daughter hauled off to an asylum in front of her grandchildren. What chance did she have? But seriously, you've lived through Tuesday, the day on which your daughter ran through a glass slider. Then it's Sunday, and you still know what's coming. So wouldn't you put stickers on the door? Or break out all the glass THEN, so it's not there Tuesday? You KNOW your husband is going to DIE at mile marker 220 on the highway, so, on the date of his death, when you see him parked at mile marker 220 and you're ON THE PHONE WITH HIM, you tell him to TURN THE CAR AROUND ON A BLIND HILL ON THE INTERSTATE? And, of course, his car stalls, and, rather than get OUT when there's a semi coming, the idiot KEEPS TRYING TO START HIS CAR. DUMB. DUMB. DUMB. I've no doubt the writer thought he/she was making some deep point about accepting fate, but all he/she really said was "my characters are too stupid to live." Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated the whole movie. I hated the lame swearing attempts by Sandra Bullock. I've loved here in everything shes ever done but even when shes swears in the the movie "The Web". its lame. I think Sandra and everyone else was wasted in this movie. I think they are all talented and they deserved a better script. The headless scene was lame, the dead crow in the yard lame.The running after your kid, telling her to get the laundry that is already wet and out of her reach and then yelling at her to stop, causing her to turn and run through a door. He says I thought you were going to put up stickers, I mean how long had they lived there anyway? Plus it made me mad that he still bought the farm because she was too stupid to say pull over right now, instead of talking and driving. she should have said pull over get out and walk back to my car. or top the hill. him turning around in the road without looking was lame. him not getting out of his non starting car when he sees a jacknife truck coming at him, lame. shes yelling for him to get out the car when the roof is crushing in and then it blows up. she didn't know what was important? but in the end shes having another child, alone. I hated that I wasted my money on it. it should have been called destiny because everything came out the same unless the child wouldn't have been born or the fact that he decided not to have the affair was done. but was he really going to the interview or was that just an excuse to meet that other woman? it was like if shed left things along , he would have lived, but she didn't know that. because he had already died. i keep expecting her to wake up in a mental ward and the doc to be telling her that she had been in shock for 5 years after finding out that her husband and his mistress were in a car accident and that she caused the accident and that was why her daughters face was scarred and that she had found out that she was pregnant the day of the accident and had gone to see him and that she caused him to be hit by a truck by ramming him from behind because she caught up to him on the road and saw him kissing his mistress. but no it was a lame story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My comment doesn't have spoilers because there is nothing to spoil. It's disappointing that a really good actress like Sandra Bullock who was in the amazing &amp; ultra cool Speed would appear in a really slow, boring &amp; poor thriller. I rented the film and I did not like one single second at all not because it didn't have any blood or gore but because it was dull, soooooo boring, far from entertaining and had more plot holes than a sieve e.g. how can you be aware that you are having a premonition? It was like time travelling.The scenes of the film were not put in the right order, maybe because the pages of the storyboard got mixed up and it's like someone is constantly pressing the rewind &amp; fast forward buttons on the remote control. Overall it is definitely overrated on IMDb and I completely forgot about it after 5 minutes when I seen it and makes no difference whether you watch it or not. Anyone who has rated the movie a 5 out of 10 or more must be fallen asleep and had a sweet dream and their rating is based on that dream so don't fall for it.</fullReview>

They're hopelessly in love one moment and practically separated the next.The homage to the pill bottle sequence in Sixth Sense just serves as a laughable backdrop to how bad this movie really is.I know the actors read these things knowing they're probably gonna suck and that everyone needs a paycheck but jeepers Batman--is there any remaining hope for Bullock's career?

With gas costing $2.45 a gallon for regular gas, that was money I could have saved. Sandra Bullock plays a woman who has a husband who dies in a car accident. He was having an affair with another woman who ironically shows up at his funeral. She has two daughters. One daughter gets cut in the face badly after running through a glass door. What makes this movie different from any other movie is the fact that they showed what happened afterward before they showed what happened before. Confusing! Isn't it?

		<shortDescription>Disjointed time used as a cover-up for a weak script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like movies that have a redeeming factor in them. It doesn't matter if it ends on a down note, I just want a reason for having watched it in the first place. Why the events take place the way they do in this film is not clear: Time travel? Psychic visions? And to what avail? So she can get an opportunity to have her husband change his mind about cheating on her and have it end with her getting pregnant to a bastard child...yaaay for that kid. Maybe the concept isn't bad (for a good one check out "The Jacket") but how it's handled is pretty lacking. It throws a number of disjointed events at you as if there was some profound mystery to solve. Unfortunately, when you do put it together, it turns out that the screenwriter basically took a weak story of a happy couple going down the drain and simply rearranged the scenes and figured "hey, if Chris Nolan can do this with "Memento" maybe I can get away with it too" and disguised it as a paranormal thriller. There's nothing paranormal or supernatural about it.Oh yeah, and all the characters in the film suck. Her own mother wants to give her up to the authorities without a second thought because her grandkids face is all scratched up even though we later find out why and it's blatantly obvious that the other characters know very well how it happened! Speaking of that...her kids are retards! What's with the oldest one running into the glass door? What's worse, she smashes right through it even though she was barely running fast enough to break the damn thing! And why does the husband want to cheat on her? Have things gotten that bad? If so show me! Instead what we get is a lot of dirty looks as if we missed something but what? I know what I missed, the events that took place involving me renting this, taking it out of it's protective sleeve and placing it into my DVD player and then watching it. How did I allow it to happen will remain a mystery more profound than this piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reason every film needs a good editor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premonition is a film that is riding on the curtails of such films as the 6th Sense and Memento, where Sandra Bullock finds out her husband has died but wakes up the next morning to find out it's a few days earlier, so she tries to prevent his death. While 6th Sense and the like may have provided the fuel for this movie, the makers of this film probably should have watched Back to the Future to learn a little bit about time travel in movies - and making it work.The film begins with Bullock beginning her daily routine. Her husband is out on a business trip while Bullock is going about her daily routine, taking the kids to school, etc. She checks her answering machine, sees her husband has called and soon thereafter a police officer comes to her door to say her husband has died the prior day and they were unable to get a hold of her the day he died for some reason (do the math). The next day turns out to be a few days earlier and she jumps back in forth between the days before and after his death finally getting sense enough to try and do something about it, track when things happen, try to prevent things, and end up making things worse.If this sounds like a bad twilight zone episode, you're not far off. Any time travel is introduced as a premise though, watch out - you set yourself up for plot holes - and this movie is full of them. Watch for several paradoxes. I won't say much other than pay attention to when her daughter gets injured. The film also leans on an unresolved subplot involving a psychiatrist in the beginning. You can ignore the scene, because it makes little sense and does little to move the story along. Finally, the film tries to have a "message" towards the end, introduced with the character of a priest. Apparently it's also supposed to be a clue. It functions as neither. This film also makes obvious attempts at laying down "clues," which are laid out obviously and annoyingly in this film. If you haven't figured the film out by the end of the first reel, you haven't watched your fill of time travel movies.This film ends up being a huge monster of a mess and will do little to help Sandra Bullock's career. To go from Crash to this is very bad. This also shows the invaluable need for a good editor - not one that just cuts for time and pacing, but one that also catches obvious plot holes and inconsistencies. That kind of editor would've told the director to re-shoot the blasted thing - or throw it out altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These premonitions have lots of plot holes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, there you go... another new thriller about a desperate housewife going mad as the days go by. 'Premonition' is one of those films that desperately try to fill 110 minutes by bombing the audience with an extensive variety of sequences and situations that leave nothing but confusion, lack of consistency and plot holes all over the place. I watched this movie for the first time without realizing if I was the one who couldn't really keep track of the time or if it wasn't necessarily my fault. Fortunately, I got an ego boost when I watched for the second time and found out that 'Premonition' is one of those films that deliberately underestimates the audience and confuses just for kicks.Honestly, there's little to say about this big mess, except maybe: Do NOT watch if you're not in the mood to be insulted. This film resembles 'Danika' in a way, which is also terrible, but the difference is that 'Premonition' doesn't even provide a lame message to the audience. That, my friends, is a pretty stupid thing to do, because usually, these god awful thrillers (that never really thrill anyone), offer some kind of message regarding: love, hope, faith, religion or many other craps. Ultimately, no matter how hateful these morals can be, at least there's a noble effort in those cases. Well, don't expect anything like that in this film, because even though I'm going to avoid the spoilers, the ending turns out proving that the so-called faith won't help you whatsoever no matter what you do.For Sandra Bullock fans only, I suppose. Her performance is good for the most part and it was fun to see her as a mentally unstable mother of two who can't even control her own life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie never explained why in one of the time-lines, the main character was accused of hurting her daughters face, and punished for it. It also never explained why it showed her putting up the stickers on the window, which weren't there for the rest of the story.I just don't think that the movie was put together well. They probably caught their mistakes and said, "nobody will notice". But if you are going to attempt to do a "back in time" project, which is dangerous to begin with, then you had better do it right.Whenever you see a back in time project, you think "It's going to suck!" And if it's pulled off well, like Momentum, then it can be really great.But, this one was a stinker. It could have been so much better.But, if your looking to kill a couple of hours, then it's OK.Thanks for reading my comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike what seems to be many of you, I hadn't even heard of the movie when I went to see him. I didn't come with any prior opinion now was I influenced by any reviews or critics.But man, I wish I was, because then there might have been a chance I would've gone in for a different movie instead.Let's start with the thing that bothered me the most in this movie: the direction. And while it might be 'original' and 'different', hence making certain people like it just for that reason, I swear I was actually nauseous during the entire film. Could you please zoom out a little and let me see an entire room for once? Or are you absolutely set on making me watch that damned Cheerios take over my screen? Never mind how beautiful Sandra Bullock is, you get sick of watching the camera stuck to her face and moving with it for 110 minutes.Next, I know it may sound stupid, but for the love of all that is holy and good, throw in *one* joke somewhere in the movie! You really can't spend two hours just waiting for that one little laugh, it becomes heavy and just bad. As soon as the break came, I felt obliged to fill in the air with a non-ending strike of jokes and laughs, just so that everybody wouldn't go crazy.Finally, I'm sure everyone already noticed and noted it, but the inconsistencies in this movie are indisputable. You can try and say that what she sees on Thursday affects what she'll eventually do on Tuesday, therefore changing Saturday and making her daughter all scratches, then it is inconsistent with her husband dying on Thursday before she's had the chance of being traumatized and so causing his death on Wednesday. Don't get smart with "there might be a layer you didn't get in the movie", it's just plain stupid.To sum up, I'm now going to watch the newest "Lost" episode so as to erase the painful memory from my mind.Do not watch this movie. Don't go to the movies for it, don't rent it, don't even download it. You're better off cutting your finger off - at least that might have some positive aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PREMONITION (2007) * Sandra Bullock, Julian McMahon, Kate Nelligan, Nia Long, Peter Stormare, Amber Valletta, Shyann McClure, Courtney Taylor Burness, Jude Cicolella. Horrendous suspense drama about a woman (Bullock, whose game acting is the only thing worth mentioning), who suddenly finds herself in a time altering nightmare involving a terrible accident involving her husband (McMahon coming off very wooden) and her attempt to stop the event from occurring. The ridiculously awful screenplay by Bill Kelly pulls out all the stops in the conventional 'horror' dept. (i.e. foreboding weather, a nefarious crow etc.) that is so convoluted that the obviously tacked on ending is arguably one of the worst endings in cinematic history. Newbie director Mennan Yappo deserves a better vehicle to showcase his visual eye and a better grasp of what truly makes a suspense film work: a plot. One of the year's worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The storyline to this film is actually quite clever - if you read what the plot is written down on paper. It sounded similar to 'The Sixth Sense', which is very good. So, I decided to watch 'Premonition' after watching the trailer on YouTube. This film definitely looked promising by all this feedback I'd had from it. So I went to the cinema with high hopes. When I came out of the cinema I was thinking very differently.'Premonition' was a very cheap, boring psychological thriller which had no real flow to the story. The acting was awful, and whoever directed this rubbish must have been on cannabis. Sandra Bullock is in every scene, which is really annoying. The film was also much too fast-moving and had too much suspense. The story had a twist, but it was a twist too far. Too dramatic, the characters didn't even have any character in them, the plot was just messed up and there was SO many other things wrong with it. The ending was the worst part, though. Linda's husband died, but wasn't he already dead in the first place??? Seriously, this movie could have been really good, but it was so messed up it really sucked. This movie should not be a PG-13 either. It is a scary film. If 10 year old or 13 year old saw this, they could easilly get frightened as it is extremely creepy and quite gory too. This should be rated R.So, don't see 'Premonition.' What a waste of money!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe people (21.3% of voters to date) actually gave this movie a 10?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only reserve votes of "1" for the absolute WORST movies I see - this did not fall into that category, so I nicely gave it a "2." From the opening scene, when they (Bullock and her horribly-acted, non-existent, almost-less-than-one-dimensional husband) arrive at their new home that be bought &amp; "surprised" her with (my wife leaned over &amp; said, "Don't ever do that to me" - come on, ladies, do you REALLY want your man to just surprise you one day and say, "Hey, here's where we're spending the next x years of our life, I hope you like it"? Anyway, back to the horrible movie - from that very opening scene, I did not believe a word that was coming out of the actors' mouths. I didn't believe they were a young-ish couple in love - you have to assume they were in love at the opening, since they didn't have their kids yet and become "disconnected" from each other (as happens later in the movie). There is not one scene wherein I don't think the people on the screen are acting. From the lead on down - even Peter Stormare, who I liked in 8MM, Dancer in the Dark &amp; The Big Lebowski - I never thought these were real people, it all seemed phony. The plot line is good enough, but there are these ominous moments - "Jim's already Dead" her Mom tells Bullock - that are seemingly put in for dramatic effect, but I'm not buying any of it. Bullock stares at her Mother after her Mom says that as if to say "I know better, I have the power to stop it and HIS LIFE IS IN MY HANDS!" The movies sucks, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the previews, I was enchanted by the idea of Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon. But, honestly...what a CRAPPY ending!!!!! REALLY!!!! That SUCKED!!!! I've never EVER been so mad at a title in my LIFE!!!! And I'm a movie fanatic!!! I THREW the case across the room!!!! I was HICUPPING I was so upset!!!! I hope you're happy Mr. Producer!!!! Your crappy ending depressed me more than when my dog died. But don't feel bad you'll do better next time...RIGHT?You slayed the idea of poetic justice....where was the pleasure in making a movie that the two are unhappy, you torture the audience and the character traumatically, still, there was a ray of hope for the ending...you know, "alls well that ends well"? Well...phooey on that!!! You destroyed a perfectly good possible ending with tripe!!! What is wrong with you people? You kill the (now contrite and perfectly willing to make it work {which by the way is ideal in life}) and left the MAIN character whom you made us suffer with alone with not two, but THREE children!!!! What the heck were ya thinking'!!!??? Granted, the one semi-good thing about the ending was you left her with a child conceived of their love. I still totally would have preferred the alternate ending to the movie. Even though it left you hanging, it gave you hope!!! Sorry, but that was a HUGE disappointment to me AND my friends and colleagues. And maybe I'm being unfair, but I JUST FINISHED IT. I didn't care for the way it ended. I know not all movies can end happily ever after, but that was TOO HORRIBLE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...you enjoy screaming at the characters on the screen.Yes we are all aware of the phenomenon of movie/TV characters doing absolutely stupid things - or - as is more the case with this movie - *not* doing the intelligent thing (ever!). Whether it is the bimbo running through the woods from a monster/bad guy while wearing stiletto heels ("Ouch! My ankle!") or somebody simply failing to call the authorities when any normal human would ("If Woody would have called the police, this would never have happened") one would think the day would come when Hollywood abandoned that nonsense.The choices the characters make in this movie are either flat-out terrible or ridiculously under-explained. Does she care that her daughter becomes permanently disfigured? When she first notices it, it never occurs to her to ask, "Um, how did your face get torn up?" Later, knowing the cause of the accident and having an opportunity to prevent it, why didn't she "put the stickers on the door" in advance or throw a brick through it or, at the very least, have a sit-down with the kids ("Running through glass doors is bad, um-kay?").This movie fails again and again in terms of satisfying the viewer's penchant of speculating "If I were that character, I would..." My list could be very long. Didn't Bullock's character ever watch "Back to the Future" or "Star Trek" or "Groundhog Day" or anything, at all? Put me in the character's shoes. By day three (at most) I'd be like, "Okay...I might be looney tunes, but this is how it is playing out." Dye the hair (or something) to see if what I already know about the future can be changed. In the meantime, don't call that doctor. Don't act like a raving nutjob around the family. Throw mom out of the house (her character bothered me a lot). Send the "best friend" packing - knowing how quickly she would place herself between my kids and me (when she was committed). Put stickers on the door. Play the lotto. Slash the spouse's tires. Confront the spouse about cheating. On and on and on.This character did not - even one time - actually take advantage of the prior knowledge of events - actually turn the "curse" into a blessing. Frustrating with a capital "F-this noise".If the message was that stuff is predetermined and that we are powerless to change our own future, well, then they delivered it in a unsatisfying way. If her character were to repeatedly take *sensible* and (sometimes) *drastic* measures to circumvent future events only to be thwarted by extraordinary developments, well, we'd have something. That would take clever script writing and has been done in the past with other movies ("12 Monkeys", for example). This movie though...she can't even manage to *not* tear a page out of the yellow pages and avoid seeing a particular shrink.Another opportunity was missed to actually make this a movie worth watching. In addition to patching up the various things described before, they could have made this movie nearly legendary. I suspect that many of the males out there who have watched this movie were coerced into doing so by a spouse/girlfriend. Imagine the phenomenon that would have occurred if the character, reacting to knowledge and events, actually did have a clear opportunity to save the husband. Change the cheating husband plot line a little bit - develop it as ongoing with no change of heart on the husband's part. At the 11th hour, she just lets the bugger get whacked. If implemented in such a way that it was a dramatic twist accentuated by the "evolution" (or de-evolution, if you will) of Bullock's character, it could have amounted to a genuine "Fatal Attraction" moment. This impact of this storyline would have been heightened by the fact that Bullock typically plays the "good/sweet/naive girl" types. Opportunity missed, in my estimation.Given all of the poor choices made by the characters in this flick, I am all the more upset that the now-retired MST3K guys will never get a crack at being subjected to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although there are certain elements of 'Premonition' that are fine, I am giving this a 1 out of 10 because of those stupid marketing people. They made the decision to show you the entire film in the previews and commercials. That's right, folks... everything you've seen in those omnipresent commercials is all there is! The husband dies, and Sandra Bullock gets creeped out. Nothing else, nada, zilch. It is my sincere hope that you stay away from all films that show the complete plot in the preview trailers. The studios are under pressure to put butts in seats the first weekend, so they show you all they can. In this case, nothing is left. I assumed they showed the entire film in the previews so I had no desire to see this. But my daughter wanted to see it (she is 14). It is far easier to impress a teenage girl with something as flimsy as this. Since you have seen this movie already thanks to that idiotic marketing department, go see something else instead. Hopefully they'll learn a lesson. I know, I know, who am I kidding?</fullReview>

Yeah, lets just write that in the script for effect, and then never come back to it. The ending was completely forced. Hey, I love you, turn around. Oh, look out for the truck!! Oh no, I cant get out of the car. Its magically locked, and my Taurus's motor is flooded. Must be that carburetor you installed on that beast.The original reel should be burned, so that this movie does not waste anyone's time.There is nothing else to said about this movie, but I need a few more lines in order for me to submit my review.

		<shortDescription>Depressing movie - You'll hate the star by the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandra Bullocks character has a dream with vivid details of her day and then "wakes up" and allows them to become fulfilled. Including her daughter running thru a glass window and her husband's death. She has multiple opportunities to right the wrongs but never does; instead she is focused only on herself. After watching the movie my wife and I felt we wasted our time and the movie offered nothing worthwhile. A better ending would have been to have Sandra Bullock hit by the truck. There are also inconsistencies in the scars on their daughter's face the first time she tells them their father is dead, the husband was still alive when she was injured, why didn't she have the scars then. The back of the movie box suggests she has a perfect life, but from the viewers point of view, she and her husband have not gotten along for some time now. If she allows her husband to die simply because he was "thinking" of cheating on her, she is a cold hearted beast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would give it a zero if it were possible.I feel movies like this are a waste of time and effort on both the part of the film makers and the audience. This movie tries too hard to be mysterious, like many other successful films with a story told out of order. Who is this movie supposed to appeal to? Why was it made? Who said "This would make a great film."? I guess if you have enough money that you don't know what to do with, you make movies like this one. A woman who has an extremely traumatic experience, can't remember the previous week in the sequence it originally happened. That's it.this movie has no redeeming qualities what so ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel foolish saying that I didn't understand a Sandra Bullock movie, but this confusing mess left me questioning my intelligence. Packed with symbolism that, in the end, represented nothing, the film has useless plot twists and nonsensical chronology. At first, it seems as if Bullock's character is being given a chance to change the course of events, thus changing the outcome. It seems to be the old "butterfly effect" wherein if one event is changed, the entire time-line is changed. However, as the film progresses, another philosophy emerges ? fate is written in stone and no matter how hard we try, we cannot change the ultimate outcome. I wish the screenwriter and/or director would have decided on one path or the other, instead of wasting 1hr, 36 minutes of my time-line. The two-star rating is because it's so hard to dislike Sandra Bullock!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment may contain information that would allow you to guess the ending, although if you can't predict the ending of this film an hour in advance anyway, it's probably because you fell asleep.The ending completely ruined this movie. The first problem is that it is, quite possibly, the most predictable ending I've ever seen in a movie. Virtually every detail about the ending is flat-out given away during the course of the film. One gets the impression that the director knew how predictable the ending was and then tried to make the rest of the film confusing to try to distract the viewer.A more fundamental problem with this ending is that it sends a message that is depressing and -- worst of all -- laughably unrealistic. The ending of this film basically says that our fates are sealed and unchangeable. In the real world, our choices most certainly do have an influence on how our lives turn out. I don't know what world the director is living in where our choices are irrelevant and don't affect our fates. It certainly is not the real world and it certainly is not a world I would want to live in.It is also absurd to imagine that she would be completely unable to prevent the disaster at the end. She is portrayed as an intelligent, determined woman and the film makes it clear that she REALIZES that her nightmare is coming true. By the end, she (AND WE!) know every single detail about the impending disaster, even down to the exact mile marker where the accident occurs. Why, then, is she so unable to think of any of the *INFINITE* things she could have done to prevent the ending? I mean, if I knew in advance the exact day that my wife was going to be killed in a car crash, I would ANYTHING NECESSARY to prevent her from getting into a car that day. Swipe the keys, drive the car to some hidden location where she can't find it, pretend to be violently ill so she would have to take me to the hospital -- ANYTHING. Bullock's character inexplicably tries none of these things to save her husband.Finally, the sad ending basically renders the rest of the movie pointless. Why, exactly, did anyone think I would want to watch a woman lose her husband like that? The real world is depressing enough -- I don't need my entertainment to be depressing too. This film is a poorly thought out, predictable mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The middle-class couple Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) and Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) lives a wasted and routine relationship with their two daughters in their comfortable house in the suburbs. On a Wednesday morning, the local sheriff visits Linda and tells her that her husband died in a car accident on the previous day. On the next morning, when Linda awakes, she finds Jim safe and sound at home. When she awakes on the next morning, she realizes that her days are out of order, but her family and friends believe she is insane."Premonition" is an enjoyable movie of romance, drama and mystery, with an original but flawed screenplay and good performances. The story gives at least two positive messages: live each day of your life at its utmost since it is not possible to control time and the future; and also a message of hope in the end. I only do not understand how the crew, director, editor, producers, anybody related to the production and edition of this film does not fix the plot holes, especially the one related to the unnecessary cuts on Bridgette's face. The Brazilian DVD distributed by Paris Filmes shamefully inserts an advertisement of a computer company over the credits, in a total disrespect with the viewer. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Premoniç?es" ("Premonitions")</fullReview>

I actually wish that I had had a premonition before I went to see this telling me not to bother and to go see 300 instead, but as I am a sucker for supernatural / horror type movies and I am an even bigger sucker for Sandra Bullock I opted to go and see this awful pile of tripe.The story is quite a good concept but it is just badly executed and the acting is lame, the direction is lame and there are so many plot holes it is like the swiss cheese of movies. I am not going to write anything to spoil this movie for anyone (I am not a fan of spoilers) but I will warn anyone wanting to see this movie to not waste their time or their money as you will come away thinking "what the hell was all that about?" And don't get me started on the end - I have never seen such a bad ending in all my life!

		<fullReview>There are good Sandra Bullock movies and then there are bad Sandra Bullock movies. Unfortunately, this one falls into the latter category, but not through any real fault of the star.I have no problem with non-linear movies or with movies that require the audience to think, but this movie tries too hard to create an usual situation just to be interesting but fails to add any reason for the situation's occurrence. The premise involves the apparently happy housewife (played by Ms. Bullock) receiving some tragic news at the outset. However, when she wakes the next day it is as if the tragedy never occurred. Next day, she awakes back in the world with the tragedy. Apparently, she is jumping ahead and back in time, which could be interesting, but the movie fails to offer any reason why this is occurring to this character. Is she suffering from a mental breakdown? Or if not, are we to assume that this time-travel happens to other people? If the situation is not one caused by a mental breakdown, why is Ms. Bullock's character singled out for this phenomena? No explanation is given or even alluded to. You will leave the movie scratching your head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I watched this movie despite the reviews here and also from friends, thinking out of order timeline could be an interesting scenario. However i was completely bored out of it by the end. The movie is about a woman waking up on random days of a week (it is only/exactly a week for some reason) and that's pretty much all there is. After a while it was like, "oh today the accident will happen", or "she will talk to the doctor". What was delivered was completely predictable, and also very mundane in their creation. The end shot was the now-widow housewife in the late months of pregnancy. So very original. In addition to all i successfully fast forwarded quite a few of the scenes, with the house chores, the husband or wife having a shower, then again. I think the movie could easily be around 60 mins.</fullReview>

I don't know which is worse...this or THE LAKE HOUSE(2006). Bullock plays Linda Hanson, who has the nice home, nice family and nice life...until bad news comes knocking on the door. She is informed her husband has died in a fiery car crash. She awakes the next morning to find that her husband Jim(Julian McMahon)is alive and well. The next day she finds she is a widow once more. As if her day planner is going to have the answer to repair her scrambled world; Linda is now racing against time to bring reality and destiny closer together.

		<fullReview>Time travel, eh? What a tricky old subject it is. Never seem to get it quite right, do they, these filmmakers? They always seem to drop a clanger that's caught not only by those film geeks who can spot obscure meaningless anachronisms that nobody else cares about, but even those who are paying only passing attention (eg. the older daughter doesn't have scars when she should). On top of this, the character caught up in this time-hopping conundrum resolutely fails to do the one thing every ordinary person would do in the same situation: try to break the chain of events. If the reasoning of this film is to be followed the outcome would be the same, but at least there would be a little logic involved.Sandra Bullock plays the depressed housewife who, for no apparent reason, finds herself batted back and forth in time like a ball of wool between a kitten's paws. Every time she wakes up she finds herself one side or the other of her husband's death and very slowly pieces together the pieces of the puzzle. For the most part her predicament is surprisingly uninvolving, possibly because the writers neglected to give her any sort of character whatsoever, just a set of predictable responses to fantastic situations. Only at one brief moment, when Bullock asks her screen mother, 'If I let Jim die, is that the same thing as killing him?' does the film even remotely look as if it is going to go off in some interesting direction. Unfortunately, that idea is dropped as quickly as it is suggested, and the film lumbers toward one of those predictable conclusions that used to be a twist when Rod Serling wrote it in the 50s.The film isn't boring, but it isn't particularly interesting either. Bullock does what she's paid to do, but she's a lightweight actress at the best of times so, really, you should know what to expect when you see that she's appearing in this type of film.</fullReview>

Could there be a sequel in the offing of the truck driver's life? (Please, no). This film was pure cheese (and not the good Welsh stuff) when it had promised to be Hitchcock. Who are those poor misdirected child actors? The youngest one with the squeaky voice hindered the film too, as did mawkish closeups of hugs - lazy, lazy shortcuts with no attempt at any depth.

		<fullReview>The main reason this film did not work AT ALL is that the lead character's behavior was not consistent with what was happening to her throughout the film. When she first saw her husband alive after she thought he was dead, I was saying "faint, faint, faint", which is what the normal person would probably do in that situation, but instead she just dismissed the whole previous day as a dream - a whole day. Wouldn't a person know the difference between a real day and a dream? This continued for pretty much the entire film - Bullock's character jockeyed between two realities, but she never freaked out properly. She only reacted to what was going on right in front of her. She still drove her kids to school, hung laundry, etc. She should have been completely stopping her life, telling everyone in her life what was happening to her, and she should have generally been having a complete nervous breakdown. Instead, her complete lack of a realistic reaction to the events in her life made this movie totally unbelievable and basically just stupid. The fact that she ends up killing her husband was just the culmination of her characters complete ineffectiveness. She never once took matters into her own hands, aside from ruffling through some drawers for the phone book. LAME! All the other stuff: inconsistencies in the plot, pointless symbolism, simple message about relationships, stupid religious red herring, etc. didn't work...I could never get to any of that stuff because I never believed for a second in Bullock's character. Oh, and the rolling head was totally laughable. The whole point of opening the casket was to see if it was the husband in the casket. When the head rolled, they didn't even reveal whether it was the husband, which was the whole point of opening the casket in the first place. It was just a gratuitous rolling head, as if we've never seen a rolling head before, which makes you wonder who this movie was made for - - people who don't go to the movies I guess. Not to mention that his head would have been burnt to a crisp in the explosion, etc., etc. This movie was LAME on so many levels. WEAK!!</fullReview>

The film shows ridiculous events following on from each other, pretending to cleverly follow each other whilst insulting your intelligence simultaneously. More importantly, it begs the question why she wanders like a sheep copying everything she has seen happen before, when the most sensible thing would be to change it. Pathetic.</fullReview>

What an easy way out that dumbed down the whole movie.But one line is poignantly true.... "We're running out of time!" Live by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the commercials for premonition, we thought it would be a suspenseful and interesting choice for a trip to the movies. We were so so so wrong. This movie is so weird, gross, scary, and just plain terrible for many reasons. However, if you like blood, needles, screaming and cut up kids, then go ahead, you will love it! Sandra Bullock could not have played a more strange character. She constantly looks constipated and drugged up. The entire movie had suspenseful music in all the wrong places and showed disturbing images when you least expected it. You may think of that as good filming, but it was poorly put together. If you don't like this kind of movie, don't waste $6.00 on a ticket. Because Premonition sucks. To wrap it up, Premonition should have been rated R, or better yet, it should never have hit the big screen! =]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain movies that they should pay you to go see. This is one of them. I think I died twelve times waiting for something interesting to happen. Do they really think that Sandy B is so pretty that you want to look at her with long long camera shots. She has this stupid habit of looking like an Irish Setter that tilts its head when it doesn't understand something. Over and over again tilt to the right and tilt to the left. Halfway though the move I was begging for someone to have some sort of sense of responsibility and kill her. Finally the writing of the script was horrible. How many times in the movie did they look at each other and say, "What?" If they took the word "What" out of the script they would have lost half of the dialog. IF you seriously want to waste two hours of your life do not miss this one. At the end I was begging the truck to please just go a little further and kill her. It would have been an act of mercy....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My eyes want to vomit -- Terrible pacing, swiss cheese plot holes, entirely unsatisfactory ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I registered on IMDb just to vent about this movie. I have an almost inhuman tolerance for bad movies, and in most cases you can at least say "that was entertaining". Not so for 'Premonition'. I actually came out of the movie feeling sick to my stomach because of the uncomfortable scenes forced upon the audience for absolutely no reason. There are needlessly horror movie-like gross-out images that serve zero purpose other than to make the audience feel sick.One of the worst parts about the movie are the inconsistencies that a careful viewer will pick up on, because these seem to be hints of a well-thought out plot twist that will explain everything. I was shocked when the movie ended abruptly, leaving loose ends flapping in the wind showing that what seemed to be the start of a clever plot twist was simply an unforgivable consistency mistake.The pacing is appalling as well, for any one who has seen a preview knows the general idea of the movie is going to be tortured by the multiple scenes where we wait for the absolutely obvious moment when certain characters will appear.This is the first movie I feel safe saying there are no redeeming qualities. Hopefully the end product is the result of butchering in the editing room, because if this is what the original filmmakers intended I am shocked and appalled anyone would finance this.I am not going to discuss the ending because honestly, if you didn't think this movie was egregiously terrible before then, I envy you as you should be able to enjoy absolutely anything. I thought that was the case for myself until this film. I only wish I could rate lower than 1, to lower the average score further and hopefully save future viewers' time and money.</fullReview>

There is nothing I hate more than a movie that throws it all away at the end in order to what? Be more realistic? Show that things don't always have a nice tidy ending where everyone is happy?? If I wanted to see a story where people end up unhappy, disappointed, frustrated, or killed in a tragic accident (that is completely avoidable in this case) I would go watch the news. Honestly. And trying to make it all okay by showing Linda pregnant at the end? What's with that!? Like her having a baby is supposed to make up for the fact that she watched her husband die and her cute little girls are going to grow up without the daddy they adored? Yeah right, it just makes it worse. Truly terrible ending. Would it have killed the writers to cut Linda and the audience a break by letting the husband live? I can't believe I spent my Friday night on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappears up its own wormhole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock tries hard but ultimately fails to redeem this incoherent timeslip movie about a woman whose days of the week are thrown into disorder upon the news that her husband has been killed in a car crash. By re-living her days, she figures out that her husband was having an affair. More threateningly, her sanity is called into doubt by those she loves.Time-travel conundrums make for interesting discourse on occasion. The Time Machine re-make considered the possibility that some events, namely deaths, are fixed in time and no amount of re-jigging the past can change that. Premonition tries to wrestle with that, but unfortunately loses the bout. Strangely, the wife seems not to be re-living events, but choosing to create them. Pages ripped from the Yellow Pages cause her a problem - and yet when she wakes up in the past, forearmed with that knowledge, she makes the conscious decision to rip out the pages. There does not seem to be any justification for this decision. The ending, contrived in the extreme, plays out the 'inevitability of death' scenario. The twist is we are asked to believe our heroine did what she did in order to manufacture a pregnancy. Even reflected on in that light, her actions do not make sense.Often, the supernatural element is thrown into these films in order to paper over a failure in the writing to represent accurately genuine emotional responses to difficult, everyday problems. So it seems here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premonition is a stupid, schmaltzy Groundhog Day. Linda (Sandra Bullock) receives terrible news: her husband (Julian MacMahon) died in a car accident. However, as she wakes up the next morning, he is still alive. She dismisses the previous experience as a dream, but the next day her husband is dead, again. And so on. For the whole movie, every time Linda wakes up, she has traveled either forward or backward in time, before or after the accident. After some slow-paced boredom, the moronic twist: Linda discovers her husband cheated on her, so now she is uncertain, when she'll wake up the crucial day, whether to save him or not. The whole thing reminds me of Homer Simpson's screenplay: "A robot driving instructor travels back in time for some reason, and has to choose whether his best friend lives, or dies. His best friend is a talking pie. " Unfortunately, in Premonition we get Julian MacMahon instead of the talking pie; poor Sandra Bullock bravely struggles with her character's preposterous idiocy - which, during the climax, reaches astounding levels of stupidity.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog day the scary way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The IMDb summary said it already: this is a confusing story of reawakenings. You wonder for most of the movie what is going on: is Linda Hanson (Bullock) dreaming or not? While it may have been the intention of the director to confuse its audience, it's an unpleasant experience. This is exacerbated by the fact that the story is pretty depressing. For most of the movie you don't see much light at the end of the tunnel. Again, if this was the intention of the director, he was fully successful - you just get depressed and desperate and wait for redemption.The good thing about this movie is Bullock's excellent acting. Even McMahon is good if you buy that Jim Hanson, his character, is supposed to be an uncommunicative and unhappy husband.However, to me it seems most unreal that husbands and wives (or their friends and relatives, for that matter) don't talk to solve an obvious problem. This is probably the most frustrating part of the movie - the fact that its characters don't do the most obvious thing, i.e. just talk. For example, there is hardly any attempt by Linda to sort out her experiences with Annie (Nia Long), her best friend. Even if communication is not a strength of many of our fellow human beings, it's frustrating to see characters in a movie acting in unreasonable ways if you do not get any idea why they act unreasonably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Then, there's the handprint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Premonition" is a paranoid thriller, with visions. They turn out not to have been visions, after all; but that's the category into which the movie falls, or proceeds as if it did. Now, anyone who has ever tried to write in this genre, where everything is mazy-crazy-hazy, knows how difficult it is to make such a story work; pay off satisfyingly; and make sense. Or, maybe not everyone knows: the people who wrote this movie seemingly didn't. Its appeal lies entirely in Sandra Bullock, the best word for whose acting is "simple": she uninsistently puts across simple feelings and thoughts. This talent is obviously useful to a thriller, and in an earlier one she made, "The Net," the script went part of the way to meet her; in "Premonition" it doesn't. Where the waters should be clear, they're murky; and here are some causes of the murkiness: The title leads the viewer to expect a story about premonitions; the movie isn't one. It's about what seems like a premonition but is really something else--something less interesting and less usable dramatically.Nothing in the movie--no event, no change of character--precipitates what the heroine undergoes. It has never happened before, and presumably never will again. So why now? The first half of the movie is presented as an Ira Levin type of conspiracy story, which would require that everyone in it be complicit against the heroine. Here this would include her two small daughters, all the authorities, etc., and one soon realizes that this would be impossible, so that what she's experiencing must be either a dream, like Bobby Ewing in the shower, or a Twilight Zone situation of some kind. After the viewer has been led to expect a puzzle with an ingenious, or at least unpredictable, solution, either alternative is disappointing. Not until the climax does the plot reveal itself for what it is, which the movie is at pains to disguise; and this is more disappointing still: an old chestnut--or whatever the ancients ate instead of chestnuts--which would indeed have done for The Twilight Zone, at twenty minutes, but doesn't merit the expense of two hours.The movie has one unique dramatic gimmick: a calendar on which the heroine, who has trouble keeping straight which event occurred on which day, jots them all down. Unique, but not good: jotting down memoranda isn't very dramatic or cinematic, and that's probably why the device has lain dormant until now. Before its introduction, the heroine is in a muddle, unable to tell one day from another, and the story is told so as to keep the viewer as confused as she is. The effect is only to make the movie look inchoate: even before the heroine enters the Zone, events aren't entirely clear; and afterward they become unfocused entirely. What should have been done was to keep the viewer confident at every moment of where the character was chronologically: what the day was, how it differed from the day expected, how it related to the last day shown, etc.; and this would have required that the identity of each day be established definitely and recapitulated as necessary, and the events of that day associated with it indelibly.The premise is that a woman is living the days of her life in random order, but doesn't understand it until too late. I didn't understand it, either (until I heard it stated in the making-of feature on the DVD); and the idea is one it would be difficult to put across without resorting to a One Step Beyond preface ("Can a person live his days in reverse order? Sandra swore that it happened to her...."), which the movie disdains to do. Without it, the viewer gathers that the heroine is leading a double life, one half real and the other half either (a) real and running along a different track, three days ahead of the other, or (b) not real but real-seeming, a series of dreams or visions of three days ahead. Either way, the future proves not to be inevitable, and the heroine, by altering her actions in her primary life, is able to keep the worst from happening--up to a point. One expects the alterations to continue, and the eventualities to multiply (a la "The Butterfly Effect") until the heroine undoes them all, or is undone by them. And this is more or less what does happen, but to less dramatic effect because, the sequence of days being random, the character can't anticipate what will come up next and so the suspense can't accumulate, there can't be a big build-up or pay-off--and all the more so that the movie never explains what's actually going on. What seems to be happening is that the character skips a day; then skips another one; and if the viewer is by that point still trying to follow along, he/she becomes lost. To preclude this possibility, the sequence of days should have been arranged so as to make it clear early on that the character was ricocheting between past and future; from the first bounceback, she should have begun suspecting it, so that each time she woke up in the morning, her first order of business would have been to determine what day she was in--thereby giving the viewer the chance to keep up.Then, there's the handprint: a detail that for me sums up the failure of the whole movie. Bullock is working in the yard when she cuts her hand on a bird carcass or something and runs inside. As she passes the glass sliding door, she leaves on it a big bloody handprint, which the camera accentuates in close-up. Okay, I thought; and this will lead to...her being suspected of doing in her husband? Maybe in some earlier treatment it did; but as things stand, the handprint is introduced never to be brought up again. So why is it there? Tell us, Sandra.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premonition starts out as a confusing thriller that escalates well into a disappointing climax that wasn't fully thought out. In the commentary they mention they wanted to leave things to the viewer's discretion, but this was just a cop out. They couldn't think of a Deus Ex Machina to pull themselves out of the situation they created.Let's be clear, while confusing, the movie partially pulls itself together by the end and does take the movie watcher on a slow, but entertaining ride most of the way. Yet, even when using the special features to watch the movie in a proper and succinct order, it still won't quite make sense, but it doesn't need to.... it's a Hollywood blockbuster.This movie tried to take the concept of Memento to the A budget and fails miserably. The writing, directing, and editing needed some help. What didn't need any help was the acting. Everyone was pretty good, and I must say I think Sandra Bullock defined herself as an actress in this movie. While the movie as a whole falls apart, she was simply amazing in every scene. She absolutely wows you with her ability to throw herself into this role. She most certainly should win an award.Certainly others in the movie were good, Sandra was so outstanding she outshone everyone else and the movie itself. It's worth it to see her range as an actress if nothing else.Don't spend too much money on this one though.10 out of 10 for Sandra Bullock, 1 out of 10 for whoever wrote themselves into a corner and couldn't get out, 4 out of 10 overall.</fullReview>

What ever happened to the old-style horror/thriller films? They didn't have either of these characteristics, and they were much better and scarier. I wasn't too impressed with Sandra Bullock either, she did a mediocre job at best. Each scene was as predictable as the last.

		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock is a woman with a "Premonition" in this 2007 film also starring Julian McMahon and Kate Nelligan. Though this film was resoundingly trashed when it was released, it's not the disaster one would expect after the bad reviews. A wife and mother (Bullock) learns that her husband is dead, only to wake up the next day and find him alive. A pattern begins to emerge to the point where she doesn't know what's the present, the past, or the future. She tries desperately to work it out - is her husband going to die? If so, can she prevent it? The premise in "Premonition" is a good one that could have used some script tightening and been handled with a little more skill. Parts of it are on the slow side, and I agree with another poster, some elements could have been eliminated. However, it retained my interest in a Sixth Sense sort of way, though it's by no means as good.Sandra Bullock is good as a woman living a nightmare, but Julian McMahon of "Nip/Tuck" gives a very bland performance. He perhaps was directed that way as to seem ambiguous - he's certainly capable of being a strong actor. The casting of Kate Nelligan as Bullock's mother is an odd one - she is 14 years older than Bullock.Worth seeing as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>should it be this much work?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers on this board have chided others of us for "just not using our logic to get this movie" But should a movie have to be this much work to sort out? We watched this on d.v.d last night and it was a real downer. It maybe could have been helped by showing more happy scenes of the couples life before everything heads downhill. All we saw was the purchase of the house (maybe they disconnected because the husband did things like making the major purchase of a house without consulting the wife!) and a shot of them leaving the church after the wedding. Nothing else of the 12 or so years that must have transpired up till the film time. I have concluded that all of the days of the week are dream days, except for the first day (out of sequence) which is Sunday, so she had the dream Saturday night/Sunday morning. Well no that is not right either because the oldest child did have the cuts, the bird was in the trash, so the cuts the bird and the husbands concern happened Monday. The doctor was visited on Tues. or was he? The visit to the office and the visit to the girlfriends home must also have happened on Tues, so Tues was a "real" day as was the Wed. Did she have lithium? The home visit by the doctor and subsequent events could not have happened including the sheriff's visit. The only things we know for sure happened are the impregnation, the accidental death, the child's cuts and I guess the crow. The funeral events both at home and at the cemetery must have been part of the dream sequences. It is understandable that the main character, Linda should be depressed and preoccupied but that does not make for entertaining movie. The kids also seemed subdued I'll have to think about this more, but because a movie gives you some mental exercise does not make it a good movie or an enjoyable one. Kids acting was good and it was good to see Kate Nelligan again. Others were fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could Sandra Bullock have been thinking? She has played many parts in her career, but seldom made a film in which virtually every character was so thoroughly unlikeable that the audience didn't care about them, other than to wish they would stop wasting our time. Even her mother and her friends are unpleasant.Her character is a woman with recurring premonitions of doom--hence the title--and who is unable to determine whether they are true or false, whether they have come to pass or are just dreams. She pursues the truth in ways that guarantee her self-fulfilling prophecies become realities.The scope of her tragedies are such that she is stunned, paralyzed into inaction. Poor Ms. Bullock wanders through this film in a fog, a frozen expression on her face as if she had just bitten into a bad-tasting lemon. Her children either run around blissfully ignoring her, or tiptoeing around their moody mom. Her husband spends what little time he's at home obviously wishing he were somewhere else. Don't we all.In some ways reminiscent of "Jacob's Ladder", the schizophrenic nature of the character's waking dreams are painted in shades of grey, pale blue, and black. It is not the acid trip that "Ladder" was, but it is seriously in need of some anti-depressants. It is a bleak, over-long, ultimately miserable film that the previews made look interesting by picking out the only vaguely intriguing parts. I'm glad I borrowed the DVD and didn't pay to see this one, but I still wish I had my 96-minutes back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a premonition this movie would suck, but it wasn't even that bad. The movie is another mystery thriller that toys with the concept of time. Actually it borrows heavily from Kurt Vonnegut's "Slaughterhouse 5" with the main character jumping back and forth in time. The problem is that the viewer is always two steps ahead of Sandra Bullock. We watch her slowly finding out what we have known all along and that takes away a lot from the tension.What's worse are the many mistakes that director Mennan Yapo makes along the way (like a huge continuity error that involves one character getting her face cut and "losing" the wounds for one day). Also, the title is a bit inapt since Sandra Bullock doesn't actually have a "Premonition" but rather lives the days of one week in the wrong order.So, yeah, this movie is definitely no masterpiece, but it's good enough for one more or less enjoyable viewing. Think an overly long episode of "Twilight Zone" and you'll have an idea of what you're getting from "Premonition".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rich housewife gets the terrible news that her hubby is dead. A few valiums later, she wakes up to find him alive next to her (poorly covered-up Aussie accent still in-tact!) And then dead again the next day. Take "Groundhog Day" and switch Bill Murray with America's Sleep-Inducing Sweetheart (aka Sandra Bullock), put a darker spin on it and voila! You have "Premonition," a dull and derivative thriller. If movies like "Captivity" are supposedly misogynist for physically torturing their female characters, then I'm not sure why this one isn't considered part of that trend and equally maligned by the public. It's just as mean-spirited as any horror with graphic violence, except all the torture is emotional and mental. I can't remember the last time a movie was so relentlessly vicious to its heroine just for the sake of it, yet the same people who pitch a fit about so-called "torture porn" didn't do the same with this mainstream Sandy B-schlock. Anyways, if you like movies that have time frames that make no sense, you might like this one. Otherwise, not recommended.</fullReview>

Because the crucial things in the movie take place too fast and after that, well, there's nothing?But it's not that "Premonition" has a nice rhythm and loses it; the movie doesn't have any rhythm at all.And it's so sad, because director Mennan Yapo makes a big effort to generate a chilling atmosphere that actually works (the score by Klaus Badelt helps a lot) and makes us think something bad is going to happen, but the moment never comes. Why? Bill Kelly's screenplay, so arbitrary and predictable, makes it impossible.It's the first time this year that I see a script so ridiculously transferred to the screen. I had heard that "Premonition" was difficult to follow, that you had to pay a lot of attention?A lie! It puts things for you right on the table and it starts repeating them so embarrassingly that if you're intelligent, you'll feel like a five year old kid that discovers the secret of a trick and gets tired of it.Besides, you never get to feel identified with some of the characters because their actions are completely dictated by the script and they lose credibility. But this is worse than "Hide and Seek". There, nothing made sense and you were supposed to forgive it; here everything fits, but it fits excessively and that's the worst thing in a film of this genre, if you really understand what I mean.If "Premonition" works, merely, or if it deserves some credit, it's because Sandra Bullock is a great actress; because she can do anything and she can do it right. Not Julian McMahon, though; he's doing the same thing every time and he doesn't get it right?He's basically just a no-one for me, until he proves it differently.And about "Premonition", I recently bought a movie with the same title; a Japanese film. I'm guessing it's not about the same thing, because apparently this movie is original?I'll watch it soon and I'll write what I think. Hopefully, I won't have to make awful comparisons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a good thriller, this wasn't one. All you have to do is watch the trailer, those are the only good parts. I had no problem understanding the time-line, what sucked was First, how could you possibly have these "premonitions" and NOT say something to your husband OR your daughter so her face doesn't get all messed up. In real life WHO wouldn't tell their husband this information?! When the doctor and the cop are talking and the doc says she came in a day before he died saying he was going to die, in real life the cops would have questioned her &amp; so would the doc. The husband had NO personality what so ever. He never talked, I don't know why she even cared about him. I felt so cheated by thinking I was watching a thriller just to have it turn into a love story. I was so excited about this movie but I've never been more disappointed. It was like they ran out of money at the end and took the cheapest easiest way out. I'm mad I paid $3.95 to watch it on pay per view. Shame on you Sandra. I expected more out of you, WHY DID YOU DO THIS MOVIE? First the Lake House sucked then this sucked! Take some time off and then bring back that old Sandra we all loved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock has to try to figure out if her husband is a live or dead as she shifts through time and dream to sort out her life and his possible death.New Age-y story is too confusing and less than engaging in a Lifetime style supernatural tale for the big screen. TV movie feel aside the film suffers from doubling and tripling back on itself about nine times too many so that when you get to the end, the "THIS IS REAL" moment you really won't care since you'll have ad the wool pulled over your eyes once too often. I saw this in the theater and began to play a video game on my cellphone to pass the time to the end because I didn't care what was happening I just wanted to know what the end really was(and lest you think I disturbed anyone by doing so, I was all alone). Whats worse my reaction at the end was a loud "Thats it?" said in disbelief.Its movies like this that make you wonder why we go to the movies when they throw such crap at us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But I don't know what to fight for (and a new Ending proposed!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem about this movie is the wife, played by Sandra Bullock hardly lifts her finger in preventing the premonition from coming true. It's as if collecting the insurance money made more sense and just leave her husband dead. The best comment of this movie is made with the statement: "I don't know what to fight for". And as a results, she fights for nothing. An empty vessels and she continue to do that with great consistency until the end of the movie. The premonition gifts were trashed. It could have been put to better use like "Ground Hog Day", or at least some spectacular failure effort, yet heroic as in "Final Destination", or even "The Butterly Effect". Oh sure the preacher gave her some good advice on the lack of spirit and she do so and learned nothing. It is great for I.Q. zero, but it is a total insult to my moronic brain, if it doesn't get more stupid then this. Now let me give YOU another ending: Ted's alternative ending (namely mine). To make the movie better, the ending of the movie is kept as is. But the following is added after THIS supposed ending.She wakes up on again Monday and warns her husband on Wednesday, to stay away from the 220 highway, love her husband, go out with the kids, close up the glass patio windows and ends up with a big surprise when she woke up on Saturday Again: "The Interview" her Husband went on Wednesday (after canceling his mistress) turns out to be a CEO job for a major 500 fortune company and she moves out the house in the end of the movie. One of her princess daughter got a chance to stay with the real princess after her school voted her School Queen. The best word for that ending is when she says to her husband "Yes you do love me if there is something worth fighting for." I am sure this slight improvement, not the best, will at least improve some major weaknesses to the movie. Without this I believe the movie to be totally pathetic. A good movie needs to make a point at least in this movie otherwise I just wasted a good 1 1/2 hour of empty watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. And this is coming from someone who watches a lot of movies, both good and bad. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that it was completed in an afternoon with a budget of $10. Anyone who actually thought this movie was decent must have been too ignorant to notice all of the flaws. The premise could have had promise if they hadn't completely butchered it by making the non-SiFi parts of the film completely unrealistic. Sandra Bullock did a good job though... poor thing. Somehow she always gets stuck with the bad movies, but this one really takes the prize. Whoever wrote the movie should be banned from writing ever again and that is being generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but highly irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb. I was tempted to write the review because the movie plot is so good, but the director/writer has screwed it up, by filming some non-sense scenes. If Sandra was seeing some future, she would have discussed it with her husband, but NO. Many places, the director made her acting silly. For example, when doctor came, she never tried to handle the situation by saying "...Ok, tell me, whats up?.." She is not mentally retarded or disturbed, but still she was standing in the middle of the road (probably the high way)..why? And the end was REALLY REALLY bad. It does not make sense at all. I was so irritated that finally I opened an account in IMDb and wrote it. If you are not bother about all aspects of a movie, you may enjoy it, as I said...plot is really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The starting promises a lot, but as the movie rolls, it fails to produce the desired effort. Mind you, this is not a bad movie. But the concept is not something new. It's already tried and tested. Also, the movie looks like they wanted to tell the story in a rush within 90 minutes. Movies like these needs to have three parts:- A starting - which should produce an eerie effect. Then the audience will be interested. A middle part ? the actual story which should focus on the main character alone. This will help the audience to expect a climax in favor of the main character. Then comes the climax ? the twist ? the final taste ? which will last long in the minds of the audiences. Then they will talk about the climax and the movie and then you have a hit movie. Sadly, this movie has a good start and a decent ending. But an ordinary middle part, which makes it a usual movie.The acting is OK in this. No biggie from Sandra bullock or Julian McMahon. The music does not have a great impact on the movie. This is also a failure. The kids are really cute and have acted well. Watchable, if you are not expecting a great thriller. (4.5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy movies that lay out confusing narratives by messing with time and memory, which then lead us to question the authority protagonists have over their own lives, and then make us viewers wonder what we can really believe. I think of Memento, for example.The Premonition does something similar. There's some clever story-telling and the acting's fine (though Kate Nelligan's wasted in her mom role), but my big beef is with the implications of the story (spoilers coming!).At one point, Linda (Bullock) visits a psychologist, Dr. Roth (Peter Stormare--who immediately invoked in my head his role as Satan in Contantine), to tell him about her "premonitions" about her husband's death. Roth says it's a common fantasy--unhappy spouses daydream about becoming widowed. She (and the movie would have us agree) is not daydreaming--her husband's past and impending death is real.But what does the movie deliver? She is widowed! But only after the emotional satisfaction of winning back his love, getting even more money from his death, and ending the empty nest syndrome by getting pregnant from her last rendezvous with her husband. She even visits a lovely lakeside development where presumably she'll move the family after the funeral and the insurance money kicks in. What a daydream.On top of that, we get a sort of priestly sanction of all this. Linda confides in her priest--she evidently hasn't been to church in quite a while--who tells her she just needs faith--hope mixed with love. He gives her the platitude that everyday is a miracle (or was it that miracles happen everyday?). And she gets the miracle.I don't mind stories about wish fulfillment. But I don't like movies that pretend otherwise.</fullReview>

Why would anyone have her go through that much trouble to save his life and he dies anyway, primarily because of her own actions. Then, as the movie ends she's pregnant with his 3rd child, and he's not there to help her raise it. Unless I missed the significance of the whole movie- yes, I guess it was a little moving, I have been very bummed for 2 days after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out Good but then Gets Completely confusing and DISAPPOINTING!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some friends and mine and my husband brought over the DVD of Premonition last night and we stayed up late to watch it with high hopes. The movie started out really good and caught my attention from the beginning. Eventually we all spent the entire movie waiting for the big reveal or the big twist in the plot. I could have predicted what was going to happen from the get go if someone had asked. Instead I hoped that something out of the ordinary would occur like something involving the mystery blonde woman who we could all guess was the "other woman". On another note this film had considerable plot holes. For example it is never addressed whether Linda's premonitions change the future or simply are the future. It is totally unnecessary for her to keep going back and forth in time as well. Why when she goes back in time her daughter gets her face cut by running through the glass but on the day earlier which was Saturday her mother has her committed because she thinks Linda did it??? Doesn't make sense. Also why on the very first day which is Thursday is her daughter's face not cut if it happened on Tues? And WHY is it on the answering machine the message that her husband left in which Linda beeps in on the other line trying to save his life when on the first day it's before any of it happened????...and she's at home, NOT at mile marker 220....Anyone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: This reviewer did not understand the film in question. Therefore, if you don't understand the review or find it incomplete, please excuse us. Well, you better play it safe when you are dealing with a film like this, and you should try to avoid, as much as you can, talking about the movie. The premonition this review has is that this review is utterly meaningless, just like the film. Time travel films have their own set of rules, that's quite okay, if you stick to the rules, like The Forgotten, or like Groundhog Day where Bill Murray finds himself living the same day over and over again. Whatever the rules may be, one thing is constant, that is, the protagonist must stand up to face the situation and try to find out what was happening. To start with both these things are missing in Premonition. One wonders what's wrong with Sandra Bullock, a fine actress with terrific potential. Why should she act in one supernatural dud after another (The Lake House, a time traveling hotchpotch of a romance!)? She should stick to simple romantic comedies like Two Weeks Notice or outrageous Miss Congeniality. Anyway, we can't avoid talking about Premonition. So, let's try. Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock), a housewife is informed that her husband had died in a car crash. Linda, a mother of two, is understandably shocked. As her mother comes to share the grief, Linda finally goes to sleep. The next morning she wakes up to find her husband very much alive and kicking. But that's not all. She also finds that she had woken up on a wrong day. It was a Thursday, or a Friday, no, no, it should be a Sunday today! Never mind! But Linda does mind, and she is pretty confused. It's because her husband keeps dying and keeps coming back alive. Linda goes to sleep and wakes up in different situations, sleeps again, wakes up again and it goes on and on, until you desperately expect her to get a life. What's wrong her? Is her husband really dead or not? Is someone plotting against her? The bigger question, however, is what's wrong with the movie? A simple answer would be, everything. The film begins well, with right amount of thrills and right amount of problems, the marital life of Linda and her husband, throwing a few clues along the way. Then the film begins to slip away, as it finds itself into the mire of past and present, this date and that date. And when the film ends, you feel cheated, as if you were promised a stupendous lunch and was offered only a cold cup of tea, that too without sugar. Sandra Bullock is good to look at. But she fails to command your sympathy. That's the first barrier and one of the many reasons why the film fails. You do not even want to know who wrote the film or who directed it. If you thought M Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water was supernaturally pretentious, chances are that you will reconsider your opinion after watching Premonition.</fullReview>

The movie was just pointless and the whole "reality change" thing (don't worry, wont spoil!) was totally irrelevant to the plot. Guess you have to do something if you can't get a good script writer.. I'm not gonna bother writing more 'cause there's not really anything meaningful to say about it.The only reason I'm giving it a 2 is because it managed to hold the (unnecessary) suspense for about half of the film.

		<shortDescription>Good movie, Sandra Bullock scores again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers in this review....First I was struck by the picture on the DVD box - it reminded me of the wonderful Lake House movie - the scenery in the background.The music had exactly the same effect. Like the Lake House music, melancholy.Even the writeup on the box reminded me somewhat of the Lake House - slippages in time, etc. Bullock surely wouldn't make the same story twice, so what variation would this be? Quickly got me interested.The start was a bit of a surprise - a death and clearly is to be all about this death. Not too sure after all that I was going to enjoy this, that it was going to be an absolute tragedy, and all too often I don't like tragedies. However, the time slippage in this story, which confuses Bullock's character and at times is harrowing, certainly kept me watching. Spoiler........... this tells the endingUltimately I decided the finale was for the best. Sad though a death is, the husband was about to leave his wife so you could perhaps say it was poetic justice if you're on the wife's side as I certainly was. In the time-slip this appears to change. The wife wanted to believe it could change, that her husband really preferred her to his other woman. I wasn't so sure - I didn't think he was worth having and she'd be well rid of him. He was a jerk, and "Let's hope in the context of this fiction she would soon find someone far better" or at least soon realise what had happened was for the best.This is a strange movie and I'm not surprised the reviews are variable. I don't think I could watch it again but I think it well worth seeing once. The time slip stuff is decidedly confusing - you have to suspend belief, or you'll find it just too unlikely unless Bullock's character is meant to have more or less lost her mind and I don't think that's what's intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the direction was very nicely done. Direction is harder than you might think. The acting was of a very good class. It didn't appear wooden or anything. The line by line script worked fine. But the let down was the story.(If you want to get specifics read the posts which will contain spoilers) The story, even to those who only understand it to a small degree, has major discrepancies running throughout. The story appears confusing to the point that the storytellers must have been in a muddle. Furthermore the film finishes with holes in the plot. You find yourself questioning "at that point what did she do next?" Loose ends that aren't tied up.In effect the film seemed to have a good start, a reasonable ending, but the middle being a tangled ball of string. I could untangle it in my mind but that only showed me that it was made of several bits of string all different colours.In conclusion it's a film that keeps you interested but even if you can work it out it still doesn't actually make sense.Nice try though.ADDENDUM- Contains spoilers.I've seen some people need the faults made clear.To start with the obvious on Thursday her eldest Daughter has no cuts on her face, yet on the Tuesday previous we discover she gains the cuts in an accident which Sandra Bullocks character first discovers on the Saturday. The cuts arrive Tuesday, stay Wednesday, disappear Thursday, and are back for Friday and Saturday.The Lithium Bottle gets thrown in the sink on Tuesday and yet is not removed until the Saturday. However it is not seen in any of the inbetween days.And plot holes.She was at the crash on Wednesday morning. Did the police question her? Did she not tell anyone? What happened for the rest of the day after witnessing her husbands death?How did she get free after being institutionalised? Last we knew she was under observation being suspected of harming her daughter (she told her husband she thought something would happen to her-that's why he called her mother) and thought to have something to do with his death. After all she was at the scene of the accident. Suddenly a few months goes by and all is fine.On the first day she wakes how does she know it's Thursday or that he husband left the day before on a business trip? If the premise of the story stands then the day before would have been the previous Saturday.Nothing in the story explains these discrepancies. I liked it, I even laughed and the boucing head bit, but the story is bad. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie first of all was all that i expected and predictable..It may sound sad but not really because sometimes the familiar movie is always good to see. I liked the plot. I liked how they confused us making the movie seem that its all about the premonition. But it was simple and sweet. It happened to her so that she could appreciate life after her husband's death and take care of her kids. The way the days went around was perfect. The bad ones first then the better ones so that she could know what to prevent after his death (sometimes i wish he didn't die but the movie will lose its premise). I am actually loving the movie more the more i talk and think about it. sometimes simple ideas like that make you think and this movie is definitely not a scary movie! It's just an interesting love story and a wonderful way to turn back to faith and believing. If you don't know why she lost faith..then you should look harder. The Director doesn't have to tell you everything or the script or the actors. This movie was very good, go watch it. But remember, its not about the premonition is about why it occurred.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really confused me a lot. None of it was explained at the end, as it should have been. At the end it seemed like Linda CAUSED her husband's death, but how could she have if she didn't know that he was going to die? Or something like that?! If, at the end, everything was explained in some way, then I would have liked this film a bit more, but I think that finally it just gets so confusing that not even the director can figure it out. I'm sure no one explained it just because they weren't sure of what really happened, just like none of the audience is.On the bright side, Sandra Bullock is very good in this part, it really suits her, and I think she did great in the film. It's actually Julian McMahon that I found a bit cold. It didn't seem like they had a good relationship in the film. But I think it was supposed to be that way, so it doesn't really matter that much. What really matters is all the plot holes in the film and every element that's left unexplained, that stopped me from rating this film any higher than a 6.Overall, I recommend this film if you're interested in this type of thriller - the kind that has something to do with time, and living your life out of order, that kind of thing. Because I am, and that's why I watched it. Oh, and another good note about the film, I think at the end it really makes you think about what's important in your life, and not taking it for granted.6/10 - pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I cannot stand Sandra Bullock but the trailer for this film was so exciting that I decided to give it a go. The basic plot is a housewife who keeps having dreams where she wakes up and her husband is dead. The next day she wakes up and hes alive, yet the next day he is dead etc.It was a good idea for a film and it could have been brilliant, unfortunately it was far from it. I was right about Sandra Bulloks she was very irritating and her performance was bland. Actually almost every character in the film got on my nerves from her mum to her two daughters. The plot was predictable and slightly stupid in some places. There were countless plot holes and the ending was very disappointing. I would not recommend you see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premonition is one of those movies that make your heart and mind wonder if you have lived life as we were meant to live it. Not in a daze but truly awake to each others needs and personalities. This is by far the best show I have ever seen yes Jim dies in the end. But the connection between husband and wife that are truly in love is shown in the most amazing way. Through premonition flashbacks and the will to live a better life as the film unfolds out of sequence pay close attention to her writing on the paper the days of the week and sequence of events. This helped me keep track of what was happening. And how she had to decipher the premonition. Remember all premonitions do not give specific details or come in sequence ever! I must say that Julian McMahon played his part wonderfully low keyed to help Sandra Bullock shine in her part. He is a true master of the theater. I don't think another actor could have pulled it off as gracefully and with such subtlety as he did. This movie is a must see for those who want to think rather than dream their lives away. It teaches as well as entertains. Sandra Bullock out did herself again and brought a wonderful actor like Julian McMahon into the limelight. I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out. It is going to become a classic. A must see!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good On Paper Poor on Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly the execution for "Premonition" failed to live up to what could've been an enthralling roller-coaster ride filled with mind- boggling scenes where our conclusions to be drawn are more than likely to be welcomed. Have you ever felt like being stuck in time? Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) has the unfortunate experience of being in such surroundings. She seems to weave back and forth from the past and future with little purpose and so much confusion. In many ways her story can resemble the likes of Kurt Vonnegut's "Billy Pilgrim" where one scene of her life swiftly changes back and forth to the point where she's at her wits end. Her roller-coaster ride begins on that tragic Thursday where Sheriff Reilly (Marc Macaulay) shows up at her door to tell her the news that her husband, Jim (Julian McMahon) was killed in car accident the day before he was scheduled for a business meeting.By the next morning, Linda wakes up discover Jim lying on the couch. And the day has transformed to a Monday as Linda dismisses her events as only just a vivid dream and goes back to sleep. By the next morning, Jim is deceased once again. It's Saturday and all her dearest close ones are preparing for her funeral while she's clearly not dressed for the occasion. Linda knows there's something fishy going on here and hopefully she could save her husband from his fate if she could find a way to manipulate the future through her premonitions. I'm usually fond of movies with with non-linear timelines like movie "Memento" among many other. Heck I even gave a similar film that Bullock starred in "The Lake House" a bit of praise that very few people did during its release in 2006. I bear no prejudices when it comes to suspending disbelief. In the duration of this 96 minute long roller-coaster of a film, Linda was able to change a few of the outcomes while unsuccessfully wasn't able to rectify all of them. All the while it seems to lack in any constituent pattern. Her week just goes around back and forth with no rhythm other just to weave through the plot structure. When it comes to performances, Sandra Bullock was really on her A- game. She's able to capture the painful ordeal of reliving her husband's demise while all performing it on daily basis in an enigmatic non-linear perspective. Therefore, she can't fully embody grief like most of us do when a loved one dies. She may look unhinged, but we can forgive her for her confusion she's facing. Peter Stormare is evenly impressive as her psychologist Dr. Norman Roth who's equally baffled as Linda is. Julian McMahon turns in a great performance as a husband who's relationship with Linda is on the rocks, but still has the time to be a devoted husband a caring father. A far cry from his Dr. Doom character. Sadly the acting can't get approved mainly because the script by Bill Kelly was never fully completed unlike his well polished script "Blast from the Past". Meanwhile German director Mennan Yapo takes it to an even greater low as his camera movements tend to move around in a way that becomes quite appalling which makes every scene uninspiring or uplifting. There are many methods to represent a character's confusion and disorientation without giving its audience migraines. Time travel has been a symbolical manifestation in the romantic fantasies, but writing about them is as complex as it comes. For us to get into these situations you have to make sense of it all, "Premonition" fails to accomplish that. Which is too bad because I really thought this movie had the potential to be really good. Sandra Bullock and company turned in terrific performances but the details to get the story seemed to fail in delivery which goes to show that a good movie isn't about just the acting. You need a coherent story so we can get more involved with the storytelling by the performers for a movie to sell. So while this movie survives on strong performances by the cast and the ideas have the audience in wonderment, it still fails to make any logical connections to keep us involved with the characters. In addition to that Yapo's camera work could use some greatly need improvement in the future. Plus there are some very disturbing footage with violent scenes and lots of foul language to keep advised. For some trivia this movie was originally supposed to be filmed in New Orleans, but because of Hurricane Katrina it was located elsewhere. I'm sorry I can't recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of the problems here stem from what this film is trying to be rather than what it actually is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Husband and wife Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) and Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) are a seemingly happy couple who have bought a new house and are ready to move into their new house. Whilst on his way to a business trip, Jim is killed in a car accident which wife Linda only learns of 24 hours later. Linda is clearly devastated about Jim's death and is surprised when she wakes up the next day to find that Jim is alive and well. Over the next few days, Linda struggles to understand the parallel universe that she has slipped into and gradually starts to lose control of her sanity.Premonition essentially tries to be a combination of Groundhog Day &amp; Memento (arguably two of the finest time-twisting films around) and you can't help but feel that this was not only a brave move, but also a misguided move (if you're going to meld two really good time-twisting films then you really need to make sure that what you're offering is top drawer in order to really impress audiences). In all honesty, what you get here is a serviceable story which passes 90 minutes by fairly painlessly, but one that is a little too predictable and one that only sporadically pushes the right buttons....For the most part the narrative here is rather simple (it's essentially told back to front for the most part a la Memento) which for those who have seen Memento will clearly be the weakest part of the film. Where this film is a little bit stronger is in many of the scenes in between where essentially it becomes difficult to establish between things that happen in Linda's head and things that happen on the chronological timeline (logic would suggest that the scenes involving Linda and one other person are in her imagination and scenes with a group of people are reality or are based on her perceived view of reality).What hurts this film slightly is that it is quite easy to predict what is happening or what is going to happen; a large bottle of red wine shoved right in front of the camera, several shots of Lithium pills being shoved under the camera - it's ham-fisted script writing and direction like this that ultimately does the film more harm than good. At one stage, it's suggested that the doctor didn't prescribe Lithium pills to Linda and that if he did that Lithium would actually be good for her - this made me wonder if the pills he prescribed were actually a Placebo which wouldn't do anything at all or again maybe all this was in her imagination. The end of the film sees Jim get killed in a car accident with Linda bearing witness to his death - this perhaps explains her psychological mind-set (seeing one's spouse getting killed in such an horrific manner would undoubtedly cause untold amounts of pain and upset). Whilst this doesn't necessarily excuse Linda's behaviour following the event it does at least make it more understandable. As mentioned, a strong aspect of this film is in its ability to try to differentiate between reality and fantasy - I half-wondered if a lot of the tender moments between Linda and Jim were down to Linda wanting to try to change the past and in believing that he was alive she may have felt that she can right some of the wrongs. The performances in this film are OK but it's Sandra Bullock who is really deserving of praise; she kind of holds this semi-predictable and rather dull story together and gives a performance that is never less than compelling (it does help that she's easy on the eye and despite being in her early 40's at this point she could still have passed for being in her late 20's or early 30's).Premonition is not the best film ever made, it's not original and certainly doesn't have the most interesting of stories. However, it is one of those films that does just about enough to make it worth watching and to its credit it never feels boring. For me though it probably would have worked better by being its own beast rather than trying, and ultimately failing, in trying to emulate earlier and frankly much better films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Find Movies Like This Frustrating to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, Sandra Bullock is a top notch actress in movies like this one. She doesn't disappoint.The other actors are good too. Julian McMahon did alright . . . I have to say, every time I see him in anything I am reminded of two things he was in, and I didn't like him in either one: Charmed and playing Dr. Doom the first time Fox screwed that superhero team up. So I think he did okay in this movie, nothing special though.Premonition is sort of a Groundhog Day meets thriller movie. So not that fresh, but what really took it down was the utter incompetence of everyone involved. Everyone from the shrink to the mother in law. Pure incompetence. That made me totally frustrated in the movie, I was uncomfortable watching it.By the time the movie ended, and some people didn't like the way it ended, but I was not really caring by that time. I just wanted it to end. I rated this movie a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Linda (Sandra Bullock) and Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) are married in a suburban family home with two daughters. Sheriff Reilly tells her that her husband died in a car accident. She is heartbroken but she wakes up next morning to find Jim perfectly fine. Then the next morning after that is the funeral with her mother Joanne (Kate Nelligan) and best friend Annie (Nia Long). Her daughter Bridgette has terrible facial lacerations.This tries to be a loopy time jumping movie. Sandra Bullock does a good job portraying the confusion. The movie does confusion too well and intensity not well enough. It's a pretty boring confusing mess. I still give points for Bullock's acting but this is a hopeless exercise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Premonition" had all the elements for being a great thriller, but it ended up as a somewhat mediocre mess. The jumping around days part was interesting, but it was ultimately the director who killed the potential of "Premonition".Normally I do like the performances in movies by Sandra Bullock, but she was way off in "Premonition". I didn't buy into her performance as a woman who had just lost her husband and the father of their daughters. It was like she wasn't fully there mentally, and that absent performance weighed down on the movie in overall. Julian McMahon did a good enough job as the husband and father.I was disappointed with the mediocrity of the movie, because I must admit that I had expected much more from a movie with Bullock and McMahon in the lead roles.The movie was also a bit shallow. The part with the affair in the making was just brought up briefly and then brushed well clear off the table. The characters could have used a bit more depth and background.All in all, not an overly impressive or memorable thriller. This is not a movie at the top of the recommendation list if you want to watch a good thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Premonition for this Film is Bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premonition (2007): Dir: Mennan Yapo / Cast: Sandra Bullock, Julian McMahan, Nia Long, Kate Nelligan, Courtney Taylor Burness: The title apparently means "previous warning" and that's what viewers need before seeing this ridiculous film. Sandra Bullock is given the news that her husband died in an auto accident. Starts out well before repetitious circumstances where every time she awakens her husband is either alive or dead. Director Mennan Yapo is backed with eerie production and a decent performance from his leading lady. Bullock pulls all the stops as a confused woman struggling to make sense of the dilemma. She goes from regular house wife to trying to figure out the events that have recently transpired. Either way she will wake up to a depression and dealing with her two daughters with regards to the loss of their father, or she will enter the shower where he cleanses himself much to her shock. She goes to a doctor in hopes that he will tell her that she isn't nuts. Julian McMahan is total cardboard as her cheating husband. He is more or less observed through any conduct with Bullock, and how his fate came to be is more a kick in the ass than a surprise. Nia Long is wasted as her best friend. Kate Nelligan is lifeless as her mother who shows up when the plot conveniently needs a supportive word. The result is a laughable thriller at best. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't waste your time! In fact I think I may be overly generous with half a star. If, however, you are a film maker and are interested in how terrible a film can be with lousy cutting, flat performance, continuity errors, sloppy camera work and poor storyline - look no further this surely is the one! This story had great promise - at least I thought it did from the trailer, decent cast, a good hook to bring in audiences, yet it failed story wise. Not a lot can be done with it when the story just fell apart. The mystery and suspense of this movie was not generated in any shape or form from the story, but rather the from the confusion of what is going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bollock is a stand out in this psychological thriller that focuses on her characters life. One day she is told her husband has passed away......the next day she awakes to find he's alive. Then he's gone again. She is confused and depressed and her friends and family are convinced she's insane. She starts to wonder about her own state of mind and just does such a true and strong depiction acting out this character. Her confusion and fear, the scene when she is swirling it all through her mind in the middle of a street.....brought back to reality by the cars horn. Good stuff. Although this is an older film It is one worth seeing. It will hold your interest and you'll want to see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a semi-suspenseful movie starring Sandra Bullock as homemaker Linda Hanson who discovers that her husband Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) was killed in a car accident the day before. She awakens the next morning to find Jim alive and well, and then, the following day, he is still dead.The plot to the movie is clever, telling of days mixed up in Linda's house, with dream sequences and premonition thoughts. However, this movie was filmed in a way that it is very confusing to the viewers to decipher which days are "real" in the story's universe and which days are just "dreams." Horror/thriller movies made in America are notorious, I think, for these confusing depictions.The parts where Linda tries frantically to put the days together in order to find out which day her husband actually dies to save him kept the movie going, but the mediocre acting and the depressing ending didn't serve the film well.Grade D+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have often heard that there is a fine line between sanity and insanity and this 2007 film provides a perfect example of that.It can become quite confusing. I felt an eerie sensation throughout this miserable fanfare where a woman is told that her husband was killed in a car accident, only to wake up the following morning and see that he is alive and well.Yes, she has a premonition that something awful shall occur. Those who made this mess should have had such a similar premonition.The film details what she goes through. Kate Nelligan plays her well meaningful mother, who even goes so far as to have her institutionalized. A priest explains to her why she is undergoing this traumatic experience.The film shows that you can't hold up or prevent the fates from occurring. Just too bad they made such a film.

Sorry if I've given away the ending - or the beginningI had a feeling this would be terrible, actually more than a feeling. I felt that I'd seen Sandra Bullock in a similar car crash of a movie before. I saw it on Wednesday - no Tuesday - no Wednesday. That's unfair. She was actually quite good. In a crappy insomniac amnesiac psycho-killer kind of way. The point is that I stayed with it as long a I could - far longer than it deserved and well beyond the point where the double, triple and even quadruple layers might be resolved believably. It was Groundhog day without the beaver. A Christmas Carol without jimminy cricket and It's a wonderful life without any bells ringing. Amber Valetta was good though. She was my favourite of the early 90s "Supermodels" that I photographed. Always had a glint of something almost like intelligence in her eye.</fullReview>

But the undertakers drop the coffin and we SEE the head roll down the street. Then later on we actually witness the car crash with the big gasoline truck ? and it explodes with the husband's car stuck underneath and everything goes up in flames which means that the husband is not only being decapitated ? he is being barbecued until he IS coke!!!

		<shortDescription>Often Confusing But It Holds Your Attention Throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You never know what you're going to get from Sandra Bullock. Sometimes you'll go for one of her titles and get an absolute, unmitigated disaster like "All About Steve." But then you'll pick one up and get "Premonition." Bullock was very good in this suspense/thriller as Linda Hanson, a young wife and mother of two children who is given the news that her husband has died in a car crash only to wake up the next day and discover that he's still alive. Was it a dream? Was it a premonition? Is she going insane? As the movie progresses, every morning that she wakes up she wakes up in what seems to be a rotating reality - some mornings her husband is dead, some mornings he's alive.You never lose interest in this. It's helped by being fairly short, at a bit over an hour and a half, and Bullock's performance draws you into Linda's confusion - you want to know what's happening to Linda; you want to know what's really real. Aside from Linda herself, most of the rest of the characters (including Jim, her husband) are sidebars at best; they exist simply to move her story forward, so none of the rest of the cast really stand out in this. The movie is confusing. Given that confusion, I was completely uncertain how Linda was able to put together the calendrical chart of what was happening in the two competing realities - especially because not everything seemed consistent from one day to the next. I'm not sure if those were accidental plot oversights, or if the whole movie was making the point that while the details may change, the end result can't be changed - a point that was powerfully made at the end, when Linda is unable to prevent Jim from dying and actually seems to have been the cause of his death, whereas when the movie opened, she was clearly not the cause of his death - the point being that he would die regardless of what she did or didn't do. So I can live with some of the plot oversights that bother so many - except for the fact that she could piece it all together well enough to make her chart! The only real offputting moment in this to me was the very last scene, which seemed to be to be an unnecessary attempt to leave the viewer with a "feel good" moment that wasn't really necessary and that actually seemed to detract from the overall feel of the movie as a whole. Aside from that though I thought this was a very good movie - one of Bullock's better pieces of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very difficult for me to find a movie from recent years that I consider decent and much less one that I find really good. This one is okay, even though the plot is rather confusing. Not as confusing as films like 'Vanilla Sky', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'The Lake House', but it still requires a good amount of attention to properly understand it.This film is reasonably intriguing if slow-paced, dramatic, intense, a bit dark and suspenseful but nothing beyond that, and at the same time odd for being confusing. Plus, the beauty of some of the scenario is a plus and the house where it takes place is very pretty.Sure, there are many inconsistencies (as well as certain things that don't make much sense) comparable to 'The Lake House', however I consider this one more interesting. And yet it is awfully underrated.Sandra Bullock's performance in this film is one of her finest. She's very convincing and natural as the depressed character Linda Hanson. Besides, I have always liked the lovely Sandra Bullock and I always thought she is beautiful. As a guy, it's a delight for me to see her and she is gorgeous in this movie. There is something about that woman. And it makes me even more delighted that she appears in practically every scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Premonition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ordinary woman named Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) is happily married with two daughters to a man named Jim (Julian McMahon). One day she is shocked to hear that Jim has perished in a car crash, but that is only the beginning of the strangest week of her life: the next morning she wakes up to find Jim happily alive again and everything back to normal as if nothing ever happened. She assumes the previous day was just a nightmare despite finding eerie similarities between reality and the dream, but when the next day arrives and Jim seems to be dead again, Linda knows that something is definitely out of joint in her life. Is she losing her mind or have the days really lost their chronological order?While technically the movie is clearly work of professionals, in the end it is a fairly run-of-the-mill thriller. The problem is that it puts too much trust on the charm of the unusual timeline and passes the more interesting plot lines with barely a shrug. Questions about the cause of the premonition are answered with a lame religious passage and the more obvious sources of anxiety like the sneaking sense of dissatisfaction in Linda and Jim's marriage and his relationship with an attractive co-worker are not given enough attention. The consequences of the final revelation are left very vague too, and while ambiguity is not a bad thing per se (often vice versa, actually), here it only comes across as an anticlimactic cop-out.The constant aww-inducing exploitation of the little girls' cuteness and the overwrought message about the importance of family also get annoying soon, but at least a few of the performances are good. Peter Stormare conveys a cool sense of menace as a skeptical doctor, and Sandra Bullock can always handle a role like this without troubles. Nevertheless, when all is said and done, Premonition doesn't really achieve the haunting atmosphere it was clearly going for and begins fading from the memory as soon as the end credits start rolling. It's not terrible, but not very good either ? that's just not enough these days when there are so many great movies available everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The underlying message the movie attempts to convey is noble. Destiny is absolute. Owing to the aberrations to the laws of nature there might exist a possibility to get a sneak-peak into the future. However any attempts to cheat fate is futile. So the freewill, every mortal is blessed with - how much of a choice it really is? Using Love, hope and faith, one can only make best of any adversity."Premonition" could have been translated into a good edge-of-seat thriller/ horror and suspense. Sadly, moving back and forth between the present and future gives away practically all the ropes and you feel watching a puppet show. It is one of those cases where using a book as a medium it is fantastic toying with the readers imagination. However the very same product fails to excite when translated on screen (the reader's imagination doesn't match to the expectations). Sandra Bullock gives her best shot, but thats about it. Julian McMahon was plain wooden. The only good part was near honest depiction of mid- life marriage crisis. But then everything good about the "Premnotion" ends there. And did I mention the ending is the worst possible ever?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the reviews on IMDb are any indication, this is one of the more controversial films of the year. I didn't find it to be confusing, partly because I kept track of time by tracking which pajamas Linda was wearing at the moment! The most compelling aspect of the picture is any time a "Memento"-like piece falls into or out of the puzzle. We're carried along on a mystery ride and are only brought back to a traditional Hollywood film at the end.The final quarter of the film is slower and weaker, perhaps because more pieces have fallen into place, but this is definitely a picture to see once. After that first time, it may not be as compelling because you already know how the pieces fit together.</fullReview>

Granted this is not an Oscar winning movie, the level of acting by the Sandra Bullock will eventually gain her favor with Oscar someday. This movie was disorienting, but I believe it was by design to draw the audience into having empathy for the Sandra Bullock's character. This allows us to feel just as confused and uncomfortable as her character would have to feel in the circumstances she has been placed in. The movie has a sad, almost depressing feel to it, its not the type of movie where you feel all warm and fuzzy after watching it. But I will say, it made me want to go over and hug my wife and be grateful that she is with me after watching it. This is definitely a movie that will make you want to get closer to those that you care for and thats for sure. My wife and I appreciated this movie, even if it was not an enjoyable experience which I believe was the intent of the writer and director.</fullReview>

It started out very interesting and promising, but as soon as the second, third, fourth, ??? premonition scenarios begin happening, I became simply confused. When were things ever real? How could a person sleep so long to have 3 or 4 days worth of scenarios/premonitions? Was she envisioning things a week before they happened? I paid attention as closely as I could, but the storyline just became too complex. What was with the lithium and the psychiatric ward? Is she bipolar? The marital problems between the main character and her husband are not explained very deeply, so you have no idea what to make of the constant changes she has about racing against fate or letting fate have its way with the husband.Yes, too many plot holes and too much confusion. To her credit Bullock does yet another fine dramatic performance.</fullReview>

In probably the most traumatic week of her life, she is living the days out of order. Everyone else, however is living them IN order. So, she acts pretty strangely, since she has no knowledge of what has transpired on those days she hasn't experienced yet, even (especially) her own actions. She eventually figures out what is happening and tries to avert the tragedy. There is absolutely no exposition of why this happening to her. It's a little reminiscent of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five.Although done fairly well, the plot eventually falls into a few of the inevitable time-travel paradoxes, even though this isn't explicitly time travel.Bullock, while still very attractive, dials down the cute, and plays this as straight drama.Overall, a decent film, and avoids the pat Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

From the moment you communicate Linda her husband's death intrigue is assured through all sorts of situations and scenes really exciting and I daresay that is really frightening moments and a succession of scenes that go backwards and forward in time while not a masterpiece of suspense if they are intriguing enough to keep viewer attention.The problem of the movie begins its final half hour, when it becomes an unexpected melodrama, from the moment the film begins to lose bellows and become slow at times and sweet dialogs unfit for a thriller, surprising to the viewer. As at the end I must say that it is not as grim as they said, it's just a different ending, which was intended to be more original in what it actually is, but thanked the attempt to keep surprising the audience.Sandra Bullock is fabulous and left again in his comedies, proving to be a good actress, on the contrary Julian McMahon makes a performance really shoots flat and marriage information is sometimes repellent, but bearable.In short, a dramatic thriller that sought to be innovative and different, but that has only been in one more attempt, it is still very enjoyable and despite that the final half hour is better able to intrigue of what could be a suspect in principle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Sandra Bullock act? This movie answers it for you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Premonition" looked like just another suspense about precognition and all this things we're all tired of. But it's not. Why? Because it has Sandra Bullock. What a performance here! Creepy when the script asks for it, touching all all the way long and absolutely fascinating. Okay, maybe it's not just Sandra. The script is smart to run out of clichés and bring us a new look to this kind of supernatural happening. It's deep, somewhat easy to follow, but never conventional. For a suspense, "Premonition" has less scary moments then the average, smartly choosing to put the confidence in the cast and putting together a nice piece of movie about family, sadness, protection and misunderstanding. Mennan Yapo is not a great director, but can carry on the movie with no problems, giving space to Sandra shine more than the usual. It's the ultimate proof of her talent, a solid interpretation to a fascinating character. Now, let's wait for the next, this one is worthy to watch.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulation of audiences arises from prevalent mass media deception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie medium is so powerful that even charlatans can produce an emotional effect. We were riveted as the director and screenwriter careered down the amnesia/psychosis route into a puzzle that became excruciating. Did housewife Sandra, who could not even stay standing to hang out the washing, somehow bump off her straying hubbie? Did hubbie fake his own death to make out with his sexy-beauty office colleague? Was he struck down by dark forces, who then started working on the little girls as well, ultimately aiming for our worried heroine? Well, the answer was: none of the above. You see, the trigger scene, shortly after the titles, when Sandra's character learns of hubbie's death from the local sheriff, who appears at the door a day late, unaccompanied by a woman police officer, unadmitted to the house, and not using any of the normal practices involved in announcing an unexpected death, this scene never happened, because the end of the movie shows that Sandra's character ALREADY KNEW her hubbie was dead. So much for the shattering news that launches the incredible puzzle. This is not movie-making, it is audience manipulation, an abuse of the movie and distribution apparatus that can only proliferate as the mass media moves steadily into a morass of lies and deception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, agree about holes in story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this movie, and just saw it again for the second time.The first time I saw it, I kept wondering about the scars in the daughter's face not being there on Thursday (the first day of the movie). But the first time I saw it, I didn't have the ability to go back and re-watch specific scenes. This time I did. I disagree with the person that says it all makes sense if you pay attention, because her actions change the future. This would be okay logic EXCEPT in the final day, when she is pregnant, the daughter comes in and she says to her "Your face is healing nicely." And the daughter has faint scars. This would definitely indicate that she had still run into the door on Tuesday, even though she lived Thursday before Tuesday. We can't tell if scars are there on Wednesday, as we only catch a glimpse of the younger daughter as the husband drops them off at school. The other thing is that the grandmother has no idea what happened to the girl's face, even though, if she had been to the emergency room on Tuesday, and the grandmother arrived on Thursday, she would have seen the scars, and most likely heard about it. (Also, the husband says at the end of the day Tuesday that he is calling her mother to stay with them while he is gone. Now maybe we are supposed to assume he doesn't actually call, but grandma isn't there Wed or Thurs morning.)Now I supposed you could argue that it is supposed to be that all of time progresses this way, and she is the only one that notices, but I assumed in watching, that is just that she is living her days out of sequence and everyone else is living them in sequence, and that would be why everyone else knows about the psychiatrist, etc. I guess maybe the discussion is-- is fate controlling her, or is she controlling fate? Would he still have died if she wasn't there to make him turn around? If we assume the first Thursday happened before any of the other days, it would mean he still died, even if she wasn't there. The other interesting thing would be to know what she thought happened on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday BEFORE she lived that first Thursday. (when the movie began)Anyway, I think that the movie leaves you thinking, which is good, but I would love it if there was just a few more clues to help understand the logic of the movie. I also hate the ending. I thought after she watched his death, that there was going to be another day that somehow she changed everything. (the previous Saturday?) The second time I watched it, the ending sat with me better, but I think that comes from knowing what happens at the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>though the plot was not original, the screenplay definitely was creative and impressive. but the title gives away too much and therefore the movie which had immense potential fails to generate any suspense which should have been the aim for the makers. "Premonition".....instantly i knew what the movie was all about and every scene made sense to my belief. The concept of "1 day alive and the other day dead" was really interesting. and had it not been for the title, the movie would have succeeded in keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. but as it turned out, I was really disappointed. This does not mean the movie is bad, its not bad at all, nor by any standard of imagination, its rather good. but all i am trying to convey is that the title played the spoilsport. a good movie nonetheless.... watch it if u are a thriller/mystery fan. i'll give it 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, you do have premonitions. They are instinctive to the way humans can feel. And my premonitions told me this movie wasn't going to be great. And boy were those premonitions right. This movie did not turn out so well.The story was clumsy. It kept flipping back and forth between days all throughout. While that is fine, it made the movie strange to watch. She appears to go insane at times, including at the funeral. But yet it never drew me into the thought of foreseeing the future in the past by living it. I just couldn't draw any entertainment value in it.And what is with the ending. It flips ahead months later to give some glimmer of hope after the whole tragedy. But by that time I was beginning to lose interest in the movie and could not enjoy some of the weaker acting by some of the cast, but not all.It has some merits and could have been good (like the original Final Destination), but nothing got going. So it turned out below average. "C-"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really enjoying Premonition. It was a completely unique and suspenseful little drama/ thriller. The acting was reasonable. It was a good and shocking script. And I am so shocked that what could've been one of the coolest films of 2007 was all killed by the 60 seconds at the end.Indeed I had heard negative reviews of Premonition. A lot of negative reviews actually. But I thought everyone was crazy while watching the film, it was the most fun I've had watching a film in a long time. I admired it's originalness, it's shock factor and it's stellar cast. Although the first 15 minutes were dull, there wasn't a boring spot in it after that intro........ then the end came. An incredibly suspenseful film ended in a montage of moments in to movie for a pointless final message followed by one last new image, one that was in no way necessary and didn't give us a big ending, shock twist, satisfaction or anything. If you've seen it you'll know what I mean.If you haven't I strongly recommend the film I just warn you about the strong disappoint you may hold in the final scene. Turn it off as soon as she wakes up for the last time after the crash if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to see this movie because I have had many premonitions (two of them deaths). Having dreams like that that come true in real life can really make you feel kind of crazy. Although because they are dreams you tend to discount them or people don't believe you if you tell them. I thought it was an accurate portrayal. I bought this movie on DVD. When I watched it the first time I found the plot very confusing. I then watched all the DVD extras and figured out that in the movie when all the bizarre things happened (mental hospital, cuts on face etc..) it was her dreaming!! I then watched the movie a second time and it all made perfect sense. The entire movie alternates between her dreams and her reality, separated by her going to sleep and waking up. I loved the ending. It shows how the outcome in these dream premonitions cannot be altered in waking life. You cannot change fate and destiny. I recommend watching it twice!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea, poor implementation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the idea of the movie where main actor somehow lives through a week of her life in non-sequential order desperately trying to stop the death of her husband. Well, but the scriptwriter and the director should make it at least reasonably plausible and consistent to let people who get used to a somewhat consistent plots to enjoy the movie. The implementation has several inconsistencies - most well commented are the scars that appear while the husband still alive, yet not there in the first day after his death. For a movie, which pretends to be something by getting popular actors, it is hard to excuse. The end contradicts the rest of the movie too. Pity. Such an interesting idea - with good actors. What a waste of time. Well, I was in the plane. US Airways choose to run this movie for half a month. I wish US Airways too to be more attentive to UMDB movie ratings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsitant and Frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm notorious for being a very critical person, especially when it comes to movies. In order for me to enjoy a movie, one of the key elements that has to be present is realism. But me being a big fan of fantasy movies like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, maybe a better word to use would be logic. The movie has to make sense, the characters have to act like a reasonable human being, otherwise the relation between me and the character diminishes and is replaced with frustration. That's why this movie was one of the most poorly made "mainstream" movies that I ever remember seeing.The acting is great, but way too suspenseful. From the start, the music is tense (even though there's no apparent reason for it to be that way) and it just really wares you out. There was no emotional contrast in the movie. No roller-coaster feeling of suspense and relief. Just the same level of suspense with no climax. Boring. Music was good in itself, but as mentioned above, it was VERY poorly placed in my opinion. Camera work was nice in some places, and way too forced and corny in others. It seemed to me like an amateur trying to copy the modern style of camera work, but way overdoing it. You'll see what I mean if you bring yourself to see this movie.And lastly, there is one major inconsistency in the movie that others have mentioned in their comments. I won't say it again, but it really takes that whole feeling of realism out of the movie and leaves you with nothing. A very empty and pointless film.</fullReview>

There were a few scenes that I'd have cut, but by and large the movie was well done. The movie wasn't very confusing, contrary to what some have written. You pay attention, and put the clues together with Linda (S.B.). It's fun. The story was interesting, well paced, and generally satisfying.

		<shortDescription>So close, could have been a perfect film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but as many people here commented, there are plot holes that really ruin it. There are three parts of this movie that make absolutely no since to me, and all three of them could have been easily fixed with just a little thought. That's why it really bothers me, it's like they didn't re-read the script once they finished writing it to make sure that there weren't any inconsistencies (maybe the writer needed to be on Lithium), and it's not like it would have been too difficult to fix them.Warning: the following contains spoilers that give more detail than you will want if you haven't seen the movie yet!1) We meet the character on Thursday but the daughter's face gets cut up on Monday or Tuesday (I don't remember which). But her face is fine on Thursday; we discover the cut up face on Saturday. Were they just thinking "hey, the audience won't notice this." Maybe they thought "the audience won't want to see this movie a second time so they'll never remember that we left out that one detail." Come on, it's so obvious and yet nothing is done to make it work.2) How did she get out of the funny farm at the end????3) What happened the rest of Wednesday where she was able to go get the kids from school and go home and go to bed? And how did she know when she woke up Thursday that Jim had gone on an overnight trip?That said, really, the only day that didn't work was the very first day we see. I could probably forgive #2 because I suppose after she wakes up after the week she would have been acting normal and they would have let her go. But it should have been SOOO easy to make #1 and #3 work, just a little thought! Since they didn't deal with that one day, it comes off as being amateurish. If they had done something clever to deal with it, the I would rate the movie much, much higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A More Sinister "Lake House"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second movie of Sandra Bullock that I have seen dealing with time. Both times, it was love story, since Sandy is a master of the romance genre. There was "Lake House" last year. And this time, it's "Premonition." **** Spoiler WARNING***** Linda Hanson was having a humdrum regular day, when her daily routine was shattered by a policeman at her door, telling her about her husband's death in car accident. The next day, she wakes up to see him alive and well in the kitchen having breakfast. The next day, she wakes up to see Lithium on her sink, people dressed for a funeral and her daughter with a face full of stitches. Then, the next day, she wakes up to see him taking a shower! Linda begins to realize that she is living two timelines, one before, and the other, after her husband's death. So then she begins to intervene to try to prevent the death from happening. However, there were tragic consequences to her interventions.I have learned from watching these timeline movies in the past not to think to much about them afterwards, or else you would end up puzzled and confused, and riddled with your thought-up plot holes.If you treat her first day as the premonition referred to in the title, the way the events unfolded seem to be logical, as Linda's interventions have varying effects on what actually happens. But again, I don't want to look to hard.It is not difficult to like a Sandra Bullock movie. I felt that liked "Lake House" more than this one. Maybe because of the lighter fantasy treatment of "Lake House", compared to the heavier, more sinister feel of this one. I would like to think that the story of "Premonition" was actually more cleverly thought out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all can somebody please explain to me why Bullock's character is experiencing the week in a random order of days? Please answer that. One other gaping big hole that never gets explained is how her daughter gets cuts all over her face in one day, then when experiencing another earlier she is perfectly fine. Then at the funeral she has cuts all over her face again. Am I the only one that didn't notice this.Imagine going through your week in a completely random order of days. That is what the premise is of this movie, aside from that it was the week Bullock's husband dies. She tries all she can to prevent it, as well as making sense of the things going on in the process.This movie does have a very thin plot. So much so that it seems to introduce twists and turns in the plot without any call or explanation for them. For Example (I have said this already but I'll do it again), At Bullock's husband's funeral her daughter is cut, in the first day experienced she finds out her husband's dead and she is perfectly fine, in one of the days when the husband is alive she runs through a glass door and gets the cuts that way... Why did she have the cuts in the funeral and not on the day she finds out he's dead? Please explain.So this movie is in short not a good one. It just doesn't make any sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful but not frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock is Linda, an average housewife going about her normal duties. But today is anything but ordinary. When her day takes a devastating turn for the worse, Linda's average existence becomes anything but. Each day becomes a race against time to figure out what has happened and what she can do to change tomorrow.The film has a large focus on plot. From the beginning of the film it is clear that the audience is not going to be certain of exactly what is happening to Linda and her family. As the film progresses however, events begin to fall into place and Linda herself begins to understand her role in those events. This shows a focus on plot because what happens or doesn't happen is most important to telling this story.This film, while suspenseful, was not what I expected. I expected it to be more frightening for some reason. I did enjoy much of the story because the actors made it believable. Even though the story itself is impossible, the daily events were portrayed in a way that made me feel what the filmmaker wanted me to feel. Film elements also contributed to the ominous nature of the film. Many of the scenes are shot in a way that limits sunlight. Overcast skies and darkened rooms placed me in a state of mind that wanted to believe Linda could change their fates.This film ended up being among my favorites because it actually kept me guessing. This cannot be said for every film I have ever seen. In addition, the suspenseful nature of the film did not translate to fear of what was to come. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I might be a decent couple mystery suspense movie that both can watch. Some viewers that hasn't seen any good suspense thriller might really dig this one. There are almost no blood or gore scenes that might really disturb your girlfriend/wife or anything like that. For those that have a difficult time watching that kinda stuff anyways. The psychedelic feel to this was alright but that feeling stops after a couple of minutes into this flick. This movie is just incoherent in a lot of parts and things just don't make any sense in a negative way. Yeah the direction purposefully heads in a inconsistent direction. Because of what the female lead is going through but sometimes it gets inconsistent in a way that just hurts this movie. There are some unintentional funny moments although some might feel guilty for finding it funny. Which kinda takes away from this movie, because it tries to be way serious and all. I give it some props though, it could have gone in a very generic and cliché direction just by the beginning few minutes of this movie. This flick had some nice ideas but it was just executed poorly with some poor directing. It just start to drag really quickly and become tedious. You can also easily figure out what is going on over half way through this. I guess in some way it's for the lead character to find out what is going on. But the mystery just dies for the audience and the movie becomes even more boring. Even Sandra Bullock's character is so very generic when it comes down to it's all, it's just a character most movie buffs have seen in countless movies like these. Acting wise as well, she just doesn't stand out and you just don't care about her character. The ending is also meaningless cause the audience is almost left with nothing. I guess this flick was trying to be a bit different but it just all seem pointless. These types of endings are good when it leaves and impact or makes it last but that just isn't the case with this movie. The alternate ending to this is better and should have been left with it.***Spoiler*** If this movie is trying to show that no matter what you can't fight fate than maybe that was the message. But it's still pointless the way it ended.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always liked plays or films that play with the circular notion of time going back to "An Inspector Calls" and so was prepared to give this Sandra Bullock vehicle a chance. Unfortunately I found the film lacking in suspense, dramatic tension and coherency and found myself misunderstanding, discounting or disbelieving some of what I saw. Perhaps to fully get it, I'd need to watch it again but that's something I don't think I'm prepared to do.Of course the plot isn't exactly original and inevitably suffers in comparison to other films touching on a similar theme. I get that Bullock's character is mightily confused as she wakens up to different time-lines at different stages in the demise of her husband Jim but didn't follow some of the plot devices utilised, I mean just why did Jim raise his life insurance the day before he died and what was the significance, if any of the couple's older child running into a glass door, cutting her face horribly in the process.Plus there were the more blatant clichéd plot devices and character-situations like the husband having an affair at work, Bullock's character turning to the church to rediscover her faith and of course two young children on the outskirts of the action.There was similarly no great twist, or cliff-hanging moment to shock or surprise me with so far as I could see Ms Bullock coming out of the whole thing free of a philandering husband and up by several thousand dollars. The direction was pretty routine, the acting nondescript, in summary, this was a thriller that failed to thrill, a mystery that failed to intrigue and a plot which, frankly lost itself, i.e. the plot.</fullReview>

Throughout it, there were various hints of key elements which you fully expected to be expanded upon later but never were. In addition to this, there were major plot themes and action results which were completely omitted/neglected in subsequent days of the week. This movie had a lot of potential but will leave an attentive viewer disappointed. I'd love to see what this movie could have been.

		<fullReview>This is a fairly interesting vehicle for Bullock, using a Groundhog Day-style time loop format to tell a Memento-style story of piecing together a mystery (concerning Bullock's husband's death) from temporally dislocated fragments.Not all the pieces add up, some of the motivations and actions don't make sense, and the movie takes its time to get started. But after the first 20 minutes or so it picks up pace and keeps you interested - and guessing - right to the end.I say right to the end - I could see what was coming some little while before it arrived.Bullock is excellent.

The biggest and more obvious inconsistency is about the cuts in older daughter. Those cuts are really relevant in the script and they are are supposed to be a hint for the time-line of the events happening. The surprise is that girl cuts on Tuesday, but cuts are not there on Thursday...they appear again in Saturday. Unfortunately there were no explanation at all but the lack of any kind of professionalism in the script. I cannot figure out how this script has become a real movie... I really felt insulted when I saw this movie, is anyone thinking that we are not going to see all the script holes? is anyone thinking that we cannot follow a basic time-line of events happening in a week?... There are a lot of questions I wonder about what do writers, producers, etc think about people that goes to theaters to see their movies, but I really prefer not to think to much about that...</fullReview>

Actually all acting and dialogue were great including the children Everyone is making a fuss, because of the ending. The ending was not what I was expecting, so the big Q is why. What good was that. With some thought, I realize what was great about it. Here is a women stuck in a marriage going the way so many do. Their love is just being wrung out of them by the day to day routine grind. Then, she is given this premonition that her husband is going to die. Many women in her situation would just be relieved and couldn't wait for it to happen, especially after they find out he is planning on cheating. She does consider this in a chat with her priest. Her decision is to get enough information from the future to save her husband. This is what makes it a great loves story, that she decides not to let her husband/marriage die. She decides to love again, quite possibly because you value the important things once gone. Unfortunately, she only accomplishes to save her marriage since he dies. This is what I think is important...he died not in a loveless marriage, but in a loving marriage..kind of falls into that Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People, this is not a bad film, give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I read the review and look at the rate on IMDb, I didn't want to watch this movie. I thought that it must be confusing and pointless with stupid ending. But I decided to watch it anyway, and to my surprise, it was far better than I expected. So I want to write a review to tell others that "Premonition" is a film worth watching and actually delivers a beautiful message.This is a story of Linda, who one day found out that her husband was killed in an accident. Then the next day she was back to the time when her husband was still alive, and the day after she came back to the time after his death again. Things keep bouncing backward and forward like this, until Linda realize what truly does matter to her life and she would try to fight to get it back. I'm not revealing anymore.The acting (Sandra Bullock did especially good job), the cinematography, the story, and other elements of the film are in good quality and make the story run smoothly and pleasant to watch. Despite some bad comments,I personally think that the plot and the script is not stupid. If you wonder why this kind of thing happen to Linda or want some explanation, watch carefully the scene in the church when the priest is talking to Linda. Sometimes God make things happen without reason, but if you believe, then you'll find out.Some people dislike the ending, but I don't. I like it that way.Well, If you haven't watched it, then go watch it and judge this film by yourself. Don't ignore it just because of the low rates it receives here.PS. I watched this film with my mom. Though she didn't say it, I think the film made her love dad a little bit more and find it easier in her heart to forgive his mistake. Hmm..this film sure does good thing to its viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who enjoyed movies like "Total Recall", "Memento" and "The Butterfly Effect" will want to have a look at Premonition. It's essentially the same concept but certainly nothing new except for the story. This film is pieced together as a tapestry of events happening at different times, yet the viewer is forced to put them together in real time along with Sandra Bullock's character Linda Hanson. The acting, direction and editing is very good, especially Bullock who plays a fairly average suburban mom we can all relate to. The story builds slowly and consistently. If you don't have the patience for this type of film making and are looking for an in-your-face psychological thriller you'll most likely get bored within the first 45 minutes.It's a shame that what started as a decent movie would have such a disappointing ending in my opinion. Using typical Hollywood clichés like car engines that won't start, dropping cell phones, fumbling with keys, all at the most inopportune times. The movie makes you feel that the conclusion will be something really bizarre or mind bending, unfortunately it isn't. In turn we're handed an average wishy-washy ending that's supposed to be thought provoking AND warm &amp; fuzzy at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bullock plays 'ordinary' to perfection...but film is an empty vessel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jittery, solemn melodrama, a would-be thriller, casts Sandra Bullock as a businessman's wife and the mother of two who seems to be living a tumultuous week out of sequence: one day she's being told her husband has perished in a car accident, the next morning she wakes to find him in the kitchen. It's nearly impossible (and useless) to pick apart screenwriter Bill Kelly's shuffled format when that format is the film's entire agenda, however certain sections of the movie simply do not gel (Bullock being accused of hurting her daughter and dragged out of her home by an imposing psychiatrist--she doesn't know what happened, but that doesn't mean everyone else should be in the dark). There's a bracing quality to the theme of the picture--do we attempt to stop fatal events from happening if we have an inkling of their outcome?--but that nearly gets lost here, mostly due to the writing; Kelly has created a group of stony characters who enter and exit rooms in a flash without proper communication. Good acting and technical values, but frustration builds instead of suspense. "Premonition" feels blunted, and one can sense director Mennan Yapo's indecision, particularly at the final gate which is just a passel of former scenes. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had me engrossed more or less from start to finish, so for that I give it high marks. A housewife with 2 kids becomes a widow when her husband dies in a car accident.But has he died or is that just a dream and has she seen the future? She awakes and sleeps to events before, after and during the accident and that scenario of past, present, future is done with intrigue and skill throughout the whole picture. The puzzle of the story is personified by the jigsaw played by the family in the film. For this movie to be successful the lead actress needs to be convincing and on that she certainly succeeds. I thought the ending was excellent and appropriate and I never saw it coming. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Linda wakes up one morning and her husband is dead. The next morning she wakes up and he is alive. The next morning she wakes up and he is once again dead. It may sound pretty confusing but the whole mystery unravels as the movie goes along. The time line of the movie goes back and forth as she wakes up every morning. Some days it is Wednesday and some days when she wakes up, it is Friday. It's always the same week. The movie reminded me of "The Butterfly Effect" in the sense that they both go in and out of time and try to change things. The movie was a pretty good mystery but I would have changed the ending. It definitely reminded me to cherish the ones I love the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow movie, needed more tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was half descent, but really just dragged on a bit too much and didn't have enough excitement. This is in the realm of sci-fi since it concerns time travel. Of course, when you are dealing with a movie about time travel, there are always gaping plot holes. House wife, Linda for some unknown reason never explained starts time traveling throughout a week of her life. It happens to be the week her husband dies in a car crash. One day it is Thursday, the day after he died, and when she wakes up in the morning, it's the first part of the week when he's still alive. So, she thinks she's losing it, but puts it together after jumping back and forth in time a few times. Can Linda change what happens in time? Sandra Bullock doesn't have a whole lot to work with here. She's not required to do a whole lot so there is little energy. This story just needed some more excitement and to have the characters do more.FINAL VERDICT: Very slow moving, but at least the plot is written well enough you can follow it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have pondered as to whether this film deserves any credit... After some thought the only credence that I can bestow is that it initially has a intriguing premise which for nearly half the film is handled well enough to keep you occupied... But then it becomes a scrambled mess.Firstly, although this is a supernatural thriller and one should be willing to forgo a logical premise or explanation it must have some substance. This is where 'Premonition' severely falters.The plot is patchy and gets irritatingly confusing. I was left with a numbness about halfway where I did not know what happened, when or which day of the week we were in... And I just gave up as I didn't care.'Premonition' ends miserably, which in a film of such a nature just makes the film that much worse... I wish I had seen this one coming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***** This comment may include spoilers ***** Sandra Bullock is living a week of her life out of sequence. It gives the movie a neat feel of relativity, because to everybody else it seems she has the ability to predict the future and she also can't reliably remember the recent past. You have to pay close attention to what's going on, even in the beginning, and commit to memory some clues that won't become meaningful until later. It's a puzzle.I have to give it a 6 because even though it's a neat idea and wonderfully implemented in parts, it's flawed. You're trying to figure out what came before what, and the biggest clue of course is the husband's death. There's also a child whose face was cut up in an accident. Well, the face thing wasn't carried out consistently, so if you're paying close attention and picking up all the clues, you get into this moebius strip problem and the puzzle becomes unsolvable.That would be alright if the characters were developed to the point where you actually cared about them. But it isn't that kind of a movie. The puzzle is the point. And the puzzle is busted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For starters where is a worse rating than 1 star out of ten because this would get it. I do not rate movies as bad easily because ill pretty much watch anything, but this movie sucks enormously. This was the first movie ever that i wanted to leave the cinema half way through, and ended up sleeping, i don't know about you but if id wanted to sleep id have stayed at home. So here comes the spoiler, this movie goes on about changing destiny, but all it changes is my opinion on how much a movie can suck. It is supposed to be about seeing into the future to show how she could change or prepare for her husbands death, but all that happens as nothing changes, is that you get to watch a week in her life where the only interesting thing is that her husband dies . . . . IN THE WRONG ORDER!!!!! This is infinitely frustrating, and i would not subject my worse enemy to the torture of Sandra bullock trying to figure something out. Hope this helps warn you away and if you still watch it then don't complain when your life is dramatically shortened, and you are like that person that reads the "one way" sign and still drives smack into the front of an articulated lorry and dies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad to see a great idea slaughtered like this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked up this movie just to see if anyone could explain all the logic gaps, thinking maybe I'd missed something. In fact, they were all so illogical that I was expecting them to be deliberate. They'd be part of the resolution, details that some unseen conspirator had overlooked in his plot to drive Sandra crazy. But nope, they were just incredibly stupid sequencing mistakes to make when directing a movie about sequence.And about that ending ... after the accident, I guess Sandra goes home and forgets she's just seen her husband not only blowed up good but also decapitated, in order to be surprised by the cop the next day? About her getting committed ... what a missed opportunity. If her mother had found that calendar she wrote... whenever the hell she wrote it... with all the FUTURE details written in a hurried, compulsive kind of way and circled in red (Wednesday, Jim dies! Tuesday, Kid's face cut!), and then all those things happened, that would have been a good reason for her to get committed. I expected the mom to find the calendar (concealed under the tablecloth, cunningly except for the fact that the mother watched her conceal it) and get suspicious.As it was, she got committed because... why, exactly? Because nobody but Sandra thought to ask the kid how she cut her face? Although if they had, I admit that window being strangely in one piece again right after the accident would make me wonder if she's hiding something.I found it particularly galling that in one scene, Sandra draws a calendar, and starts putting things into order. That (plus doing any damn thing at all to avert the premonitions) is something I'd have tried from the very start in her shoes. In fact, about 15 minutes before Sandra did, I actually considered pausing the film and doing that myself. But one person who obviously never did any such thing was the screenwriter, and it could have made this into a great movie. As it is the only good thing about it is Sandra Bullock. Damn, she can even make MARRIAGE look appealing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schrödinger's Groundhog Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock gives one of her best ever performances in this promising, but ultimately dissatisfying film. It may be her best chance so far for an Oscar, though I expect that the rather clumsily telegraphed themes of faith and fate will push this missile off its target. While running through similar ground covered in films like Groundhog Day, What Dreams May Come, and if it comes to it, It's a Wonderful Life, Premonition presents us with a complex web of events to be assembled like a 3-D jigsaw puzzle with a time limit. The concept is intriguing, but I wondered if this could ever be anything but a literary device that is a challenge to commit to film. I commend the scriptwriter, director, and cast for creating a film that, while not perfect, certainly covers and gives credibility to the initial conceit.Initially, I thought we were being treated to a probabilistic multiverse, where Bullock's character was living out many of the possibilities of the life she knew. It took quite some time before I was forced to discard this notion and see it for only two possible time lines.The sleuth-work required by Bullock's character pushed my credibility at times, but I was willing to maintain the illusion until the faith investigation came into play. This part, where the best possible voice actor the production team could hire, intones "It's been some time" made me groan loudly. This line, while reaching for the spiritual, came across to me as a late-night Saturday advertisement for the local evangelical church, a call to return to the ol' time religion, as she's going' straight to hell otherwise. Propaganda for organized religion!The tack, distasteful as it was to this reviewer, nevertheless provided much needed inspiration for our protagonist to work out the terms of her karmic debt. Unfortunately, the mix of mystical metaphors crashes unsubtly into the trough of Calvinist predestination in some of the broadest foreshadowing I have ever witnessed in a movie of this budget. And the ending! Well, talk about your Jerry Bruckheimer special! Was there excess money left over in the production budget? It felt like someone said, "We need a tanker truck explosion. That'll round out the demographics." Honestly!Real spoiler here: for those who see this on DVD, the final deleted scene I suspect shows us what the creative team really thinks of the film, where the most personal of props is chased through the climax location. This could have been a really good film, if not great. It raises some very interesting questions, and looks at some concepts that other reviewers on this page have tackled well. It's a pity that this mix of thriller red herrings, thought experiment, and nod to teen horror couldn't have trusted itself more.</fullReview>

I completely disagree. This movie surprised me in a good way. It was much better than I expected it would be. I guess it's a movie where critics hated it and audiences liked it.It was surprisingly quite emotional and non-confusing! Usually, in these types of films that makes you think, I usually get lost. But this time, I followed it quite well, because, well, I thought it would've been much more confusing.There are some minor problems though, including some plot holes and the fact that Bullock goes back in time in certain days, she makes some dopey mistakes. There are some great visuals, though. Sandra Bullock's performance in here is done quite well. Julian McMahon, I guess, is decent and the score is great.In the end, I thought that this was a great film. It's better than most thrillers, in my opinion. Should you watch it? I don't know. You can but you don't have too. For me, I just liked it a lot.</fullReview>

Sandra has done better movies by far than this one. She probably only did this one because she needed the money. I did understand the line about the roommate thing. But I agree I to thought the hubby would live at the end. But like another commenter said it was his time. Final Destination was better than this.

She was trying to save him but if he would have just stayed on the side of the road, he would still be alive. The ending of her being pregnant was priceless. She DID have something to fight for and she didn't know what because she didn't know she was pregnant at the time. I thought the movie had a lot of meaning in it.

		<shortDescription>Making sense of Premonition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning of the movie we see Sandra Bullock's character receiving news of the death of her husband, which comes as a complete surprise to her. The day is Thursday. Her husband died the day before, Wednesday, in a terrible car accident on Route 220. On this day, Thursday, her daughter's face is not scarred and the glass door has stickers on it to prevent someone from accidentally walking through it. Thursday night she goes to sleep on the couch with the knowledge her husband is dead. She wakes up the next morning in her bed and she finds out her husband is still alive. It is now the Monday prior to the accident. And so the movie goes. Each morning she finds herself in a different day of the week, one day he is alive, she wakes up, and he is dead, and so on. Later we learn the daughter runs through the glass door that has no stickers on it and badly scars her face. This happens prior to the husband's accident which contradicts the opening sequence of the movie. How can this be explained? As it turns out Sandra Bullock's character actually causes the events that lead to her husband's death. This can only happen as a result of her acting upon the premonitions. If we view each awakening as her actually traveling through time then it makes no sense. But if the movie is actually about Wednesday then everything else is either a "Premonition" or a recollection. For example, when she goes back to Monday, if she was hopping through time shouldn't she be reliving the day? Why was she surprised when she fell on the dead bird? Yet she approaches the previous Monday fresh as if it is just happening to her. If all of these premonitions and recollections are happening in her sleep prior to her waking on Wednesday morning this would explain many things. It would explain why she seems to do nothing to alter events that could protect her and her children. She tears a page out of a phone book and tosses it in the trash where she had already found it in the future. She is surprised to find a bottle of Lithium prescribed to her and yet afterward, while visiting a previous day, accepts a prescription for Lithium and then discards the pills and bottle in the very place she was surprised to find them. The list goes on and on. In her sleep she combines her recollections and premonitions. The visit to the priest may be an example of an event conjured in an attempt at some reconciliation. I think the police officer is a telling character. We know he never actually brings her the news of her husband's death because she was an eyewitness. In the premonition she borrows the police officer from an actual traffic stop to be the one who gives her the news of his death (the opening sequence). He also appears in another premonition we do now know actually occurs.This view also explains one of the great so-called inconsistencies of the film - the daughter's disappearing scars. It is impossible to think the director, producers, the cast, and especially the editor, could not see this glaring incongruity. Understanding the opening sequence as a premonition makes sense. In the premonition she foresees receiving the news about the death of her husband in a way she wants to see it. She admitted to her husband, on a prior day, she may have forgotten to put the stickers on the glass door which makes her feel guilty about what happens to her daughter. In her premonition she is guilt-free. The daughter is unscarred and the glass door has the obvious stickers. The focus is on the news of her husband's death. Since this premonition is actually happening in her head prior to her waking up Wednesday morning she is genuinely surprised at the news of his death and has no idea how he died. So the "real" day actually begins when she wakes up Wednesday morning. From that point on she begins to act to mitigate the events that lead to the accident.I think this is a good movie although the scene with the priest came off contrived - a silly attempt at trying to create a moral to the story. The movie ends with Sandra Bullock's character pregnant. Why? It is like Juliet living and finding another boyfriend. This movie is a tragedy. The audience should leave unsettled but not nauseous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good up until the last 20 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, this movie moves really slowly. I was watching it with a friend's family, and a few people just left because they were bored. At this point, though, I was rather enjoying Premonition. Sandra Bullock's acting is pretty good, and the mood and cinematography were well done.However, at about the one hour mark, it all went down hill. Continuity problems starting springing up, and I found myself just glancing at my watch and hoping the ending would come some. But when the ending did come, it was a HUGE disappointment. I won't give it away, but I can't believe I sat through that whole movie for that to happen.I have seen a lot of people saying that this movie is poorly rated because "typical Americans" don't have the brain and/or patience for it. There is not really anything here to misunderstand, though. The plot is straight forward, but is just told out of order. And I was very patient with it, but the ending was just plain disappointing. If you want to see a good movie in this style, I'd recommend "21 Grams" or "Deja Vu."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of my favorite movies are The Butterfly Effect, Vanilla Sky, and Minority Report - because they take the viewer on a dreamy ride and test our perception and our desire to control the future. Premonition takes you into a confusing restless ride and let's you keep wondering when you will awake. Maybe you don't.. not everyone does. I'm very surprised by the reviewers who must have just sat there and analyzed this movie instead of letting it take them away. I loved the movie. Good moviegoers are good dreamers. Who says you are entitled to wake up from a bad dream and everything makes perfect sense when the sun shines in the morning? What if it doesn't? Those who say they guessed the plot are not being truthful - at all - with themselves. There's nothing to guess. Like any dream - there is no plot through which you can drive a nail. When you're dreaming - just when you think there's a plot - something flat-out plot-less occurs. This movie successfully touches on many slippery and difficult to corral feelings experienced through many peoples lives... like dreaming... like going insane.. like mixed degrees of reality... like uncontrollable paranoia... and like thinking you know the plot of something, where it's headed, and where it should wind up - when you can't possibly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problematic But Interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a little bit difficult to give a clear-cut synopsis for this film, but I'll give it a whirl - "Premonition" is about a woman named Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock), a housewife with two children and a husband, Jim (Julian McMahon). She lives in a great home and seems to have a good life. But her entire life spirals out of control when she receives a knock on the door telling her that her husband perished in a horrible car crash... at least that is what she believes, until she awakens the next day to find Jim perfectly alive and well. Then the following day, he is dead again. This vicious cycle continues as Linda tries to solve the puzzle behind her husband's death, whether it be after it happens, or before... but is there a way to stop what was meant to be?This film didn't appeal much to me when I saw advertisements during its theatrical release, so I put off watching it until it came to home video, and decided to give it a rent. I'm still trying to decipher what I thought about this film, because it's hard for me to make up my mind about how I exactly feel about it. The story is really hard to follow at times, and I had a problem with that. Clues are dropped often, and things would come together eventually, but it seemed like it took too long for them to piece together, so by the time it did, the viewer wasn't able to catch on because they were trying to focus on another piece of the puzzle that was waiting to be solved. The film is told through a series of disordered scenes, and the piecing-together of them was done a little bit sloppily at times.On the other hand, I thought that the premise was pretty interesting. The premonition subject has been done before in films like "Final Destination", but this one was a little more adult-oriented and a bit on the more believable side (not that "Final Destination" is bad at all, in fact I really enjoy that movie). The topic of premonitions is interesting, and I think this movie could have been better with a little improvement in the script. As the movie progresses there seems to be more and more plot holes, and while some of them may have been answered, I never did catch onto some of them. The cinematography really soars though, and the direction is stylish and everything looks very nice. It's not necessarily a scary film, but there are a couple of eerie scenes scattered around, and the mystery aspect is a strong element, although the puzzle pieces aren't put together very well at times. My biggest gripe about this movie was that, as a whole, it didn't really feel like it had a story. It almost felt like a bunch of scenes strung together to try and tell a story, but it seemed unorganized at times.Sandra Bullock leads the cast in our main role as Linda, a woman who is lost in between her premonitions of her husband's demise and the real life things she is dealing with. Bullock conveys emotion well, and she plays her character in a very respectable manner. I'd say overall she was strong here. Julian McMahon (of TV's "Nip/Tuck") plays Jim, and while his performance is good, his character seemed a little underdeveloped to me. We can get the general sense of him, but I would've liked to get to know the character a little more, but the prime focus of the movie is on Bullock's character. The child actors are good too, no problem with performances here. The final ten minutes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, and I've rarely felt suspense as intense as that in quite a long time. I think it was due to the fact that the whole film built itself up to that event, and it was inevitable in the end. It ends on a warm-hearted note, but is a bit of a downer as well.Overall, "Premonition" is a mixed bag. The script needed some work - the general premise was excellent, but the stringing together of the story was a little messy. I understood it for the most part though and it made sense, but I do think that this is a movie that may require repeat viewings. Good cinematography though, plus some good acting and an extremely intense conclusion make this worth a watch if you're a fan of dramatic thrillers. It's got some script problems, but I think it's worth watching once, probably two or three times if you want to fully understand it all. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- spoilers - Linda lives through he days out of sequence, but the order of events is predetermined. Alas, the producers play fast and loose with the consequences of the events and other characters' perceptions. How can the cuts on the daughters face be a mystery to anybody other than Linda? The daughters know how it happened. The mother was called by the husband after the accident, so the mother would know. Despite the pretty shots and interesting plot line, when the plot does not hold together it ruins the experience. Ah, the pregnancy at the end is pure bogosity. Is that supposed to fix everything? It has nothing to do with the movie, but maybe it was added to appease the Christian right...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Review of "Premonition"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premonition The mystery thriller Premonition is focused around the life of Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) and how she gets the news that her husband Jim (Julian McMahon) has died. As she deals with it, she wakes up the next morning to see Jim alive and dead the next and so on and so forth. Linda starts to wonder what's going on and wants an explanation. Now Linda tries to remember what happens which day and tries to piece together the puzzle so she can save her husband.Now this movie slow to start with, but suddenly picked up in the middle of it. Sandra Bullock was fantastic in this movie. She does well in these mysterious thrilling movies like The Net and The Vanishing. Julian McMahon did well playing the role of her husband, a character that is static and dynamic. As for the supporting cast, they did a good job.I recommend this movie to fans of Sandra Bullock fans or anyone who is interested in mystery thrillers. So give it a chance, it is really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premonition was sub-par. I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't like it either. The whole jumping around in time is discombobulating and unnerving. It just made the already delicate and mysterious plot more difficult to follow. Sandra's acting wasn't bad, but all of the other characters you meet for a few minutes, and thats it. And the ending was was pleasing, but wouldn't have been my choice. I'd like to know why she has this "ability" to transverse time, and why does SHE have it. Why is it important? Is it a blessing or a curse? So many questions. The movie trailer I actually thought was better than the movie. It had good footage, but I don't think the editing served it justice.

This movie far exceeded my expectations and was every bit as good as I had hoped it might be. Very suspenseful! Kept me glued to the TV (rented the DVD, wish I had made it to the theater for this one!) Sandra Bullock is superb; this is her kind of role. The film also includes many other talented stars. There are moments where the film seems slightly confusing (one day turns out to not necessarily be followed by the next), but the story really pulls it all together by the end. My only real complaint would be that I wish they had used the alternate ending, that is included on the DVD as a special feature, instead of the films actual ending. Oh well! Definitely worth seeing.

The girl running through the glass door was so unbelievable. What was the point of that. Maybe the husband wanted to do so plastic surgery on the little girl.Sandra Bullock and The Nip/Tuck guy had no chemistry whatsoever. No wonder he had an affair.

		<fullReview>This movie is watchable primarily because of Sandra Bullock; she has a great screen presence, and even watching the minutiae of suburban life is bearable (although her house is way too clean for having two kids and way too Pottery Barn for someone without great means...). I had some trouble with the "climax" if you will; this has been addressed elsewhere: http://www.drivl.com/posts/view/819 so I won't dwell here, but needless to say, it is the kind of weird plot device that modern movies serve up regularly. Makes you wonder if the writers had any say in how to wrap this one up or not? The actors, including the kids and Kate Nelligan as a true "Nervous Nellie" of a mother, were all pretty decent and giving it the old college try. Why must the blonde Amber Valetta always play the mistress? See "What Lies Beneath"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't escape from destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see this movie, I had read about the controversial ending, but I wanted to see by myself. Well... people were right, very confused, after thinking about it, you just can say: You can't escape from destiny, of course, a original idea, there weren't films with this focus, doesn't true?, I think we are seeing the fourth part of final destination, whatever thing you'll do to avoid death, doesn't care, because it will find you. I don't understand why did she have a premonition if she couldn't do nothing for changing it?, she tried, but that attempt bore to the tragedy. It's true through the film the plot was amazing, I was eager all the time waiting the end, but, Is that it?, I was another one that said the same when the screen faded. I don't pan Sandra performance, I think she was wonderful, the flaw, the big mistake, was the main idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant start with a disastrous ugly finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't only just that 'the ending was bad', I mean a bad ending can usually only take a point or two off an other wise decent film. Premonition has such an interesting concept and seemed like it was so well put together and like everything was carefully covered and by the end you realize that it was an absolute shamble and delivered awful!! It wasn't even that they rushed it or threw things together...I really think they meant for everything to be this way and might have even been proud of themselves and that's the worst part!! They destroyed what could have been a truly unique and incredible thriller by not following through on necessary plot holes that are inevitable with time travel, and the ending...oy...the ending!! I really wanted to like this film because it looked cool, critics hated it, and I like Sandra Bullock and want to see her get out of her semi-slump she's been in.Sandra Bullock plays wife and mother Linda Hanson, whose idyllic marriage has, over the years, turned to one of comfortability, and near silence with her husband. Bullock has the proper intensity and concern and emotion to carry the role, there is absolutely nothing wrong with her performance except that in recent roles including this one she has this aura of being almost bored with acting which is so unfortunate as she used to have such a strong screen personality from Demolition Man, to Speed, to her early romance films and even Miss Congeniality. Other than that she appropriately carries the film. Julian McMahon plays her well meaning but distracted husband Jim. I always thought of McMahon as having a better look for playing a villain but he was a decent guy and a decent choice for this role. Bullock and McMahon had good chemistry even when they were at odds in the film you could still feel the love and tension between them which was good for the film. Nia Long, Irene Ziegler, and Peter Stormare all do very well in the respective supporting roles however brief they may have been. And the young actors that portrayed the Hanson daughters, Shyann McClure (in her debut big screen role is adorable!!) and Courtney Taylor Burness are terrific and hold their own together with Bullock.No one from the cast of this film drags the film down...the story and awful plot development does that all by itself. The first hour of the film you watch in true awe...thinking and knowing that everything will come together in some spectacular way because there is no doubt that the time line of the film is a little confusing but as it goes on you think you start to figure things out a little bit but it's like the director Mennan Yapo and writer Bill Kelly realized you would think this and so tried to curve ball but in essence destroyed any hope of a good ending or wrap up. They left behind any attention to detail or plot, any reasonable filling of holes or explanations that made sense and the god awful ending!! So much potential for the first hour...that if you left after that first hour you'd probably give this film a nine out of ten but it's so horribly handled that all hope is lost. Very unfortunate because the cast is strong, the mood and setting and tone is dark and disturbing and depressing but all is lost for this one...it's a stinker!! Rent it and see for yourself...but don't waste 10 bucks. 5/10</fullReview>

The ending I have a problem with, I'm not always the biggest fan of happy endings but for this movie it made the most sense. I see her character as a very manipulative and disturbed woman, who convinces her husband to increase his life insurance so when she orchetrates his death she can live the good life. And on top of it since he was going to leave her so much money she decided that before he died she wanted to have another of his kids. I know this is not the intention but she literally is the person who causes his death. The whole movie revolves around the premonition of her husband dying and she is given the power to change his fate and she fails miserably. So let me say the writers of this film would be better off not writing anything ever again because they can't do a story right...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Premonition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock has the keen sensitivity to pick up some roles that she thinks she can create a niche and leave a mark of her acting skills. That is what interests me to go and see her movies.Sandra Bullock plays a housewife Linda in the movie, who is happily married with Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon); they have two daughters. Linda has a special sense to live through future events (premonition) and again wake up in real time ? each night when she sleeps.The movie spans a week of time - 7 days and nights, jumbled up and presented to us one after another ? like Tuesday, Thursday, Monday, Saturday, Sunday, Friday and Wednesday. So Linda sees after Tuesday events of Thursday, then goes to sleep and sees events of Monday; so on and so forth.In one of the premonition Linda realizes that her husband has died in car accident, and when she comes back to the days when husband is alive; Linda tries to save her husband from dying on the fateful Wednesday. Will she succeed or not ? makes up for the last scene.The movie actually captures your interest in the way it is presented and events are unfolded. Technically and screenplay wise the movie is okay. Where the movie fails are two clear scripting failures: First, the Director Mennan Yapo's attempt to make the movie intelligent with lots of jig-saw puzzle presented in front of the audience, and in doing so totally forgetting that the wife who has this premonitions ? goes and discusses her problem with a Psychiatrist and a Priest, but never tells the same to her husband, with whom she stays, eats, sleeps and talks. Which societies this couple is living in where they do not share their fears and desires ? especially when they are having fantastic relationship? Second, the ending ? it is so lame and unacceptable. A tight presentation is laid down to rest with our spirits down in a false note.Sandra Bullock brings life to her performance in each and every scene, but unfortunately, Sandra is not picked up by top brass Directors and good scripts.Overall not so good time-sharing experience!

The very trendy 'time manipulation' in juxtaposing present and past is (pardon the pun) present in this film. Since the crux of the script is based around this whole concept (nevermind the plot) it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Contrivance runs rampant in too many scenes to mention.

		<shortDescription>New Life Conquers Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this high paced intense film Sandra Bullock plays Linda, a middle-American housewife whose life has become mundane until the day a police officer shows up at her door announcing that her husband has been killed in a car wreck. After an extremely long and hard day she drifts off to sleep only to wake up and find that her husband, played by Julian McMahon, is very much alive. As she goes about her day thinking it's a horrific dream she start questioning if it was in fact just a dream. Linda's world is capsized as the days of the week begin to fade in and out and go back and forth; though confused at first, she is able to pull herself together and gather all the clues that have been placed around her and unravel this mysterious premonition.Okay, I know it's kind of cheesy, but it is the movie plot. However, there is so much more to it! If you look at it properly and studying, not just watch it, you'll be immensely satisfied. The story is about destiny, control, hope, love, redemption, new life; I could go on and on because it has so many levels to it. The story was beautifully scripted and exceptionally executed. I saw the ending coming for one reason, I followed the clues. I didn't just rely on what I was hearing but what I was (really) seeing and what I was feeling. This film is strong for Mise-en-scene because everything in the picture- colour, framing, music, sound, and especially lighting were extremely important to the story and each fulfilled their duty.Sandra Bullock delivers a strong performance, but then again, I would never expect less. Not just as a mother trying to be strong for her children or a wife trying to reconnect with her husband, but as a woman striving to make things right and realizing the truth about herself. The supporting cast was superb, especially Kate Nelligan, as Linda's mother gives an outstanding performance of a mother and grandmother who is trying to keep it together for her family.Though many don't, I love the ending of this picture? maybe because I get it. It doesn't mean that others don't get it or that they have to like it because they do; but for me, understanding it, getting it is what made me love it. This picture runs along side of the Final Destination films because 1) Destiny has a design that you can't escape it forever and 2) new life does conquer death. Not that the other person lives, but that they live through the people they've left behind. If you love it, you'll probably always love it; if you hate it I strongly suggest giving it one more try before giving up on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILERS: Good movie, but the ending sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock is almost always great. She doesn't disappoint in this movie either.The writing, however, does. Too many plot holes. Too little character motivation. Too much unintentional inconsistency. Like Linda (Bullock) does things even when she knows they are contributing to future unpleasant events. Why? And the ending seemed rather staid and pointless when compared to the rest of the movie. The progression of events did not improve her circumstances. Everything that the main character did or learned because of the 'premonitions' were essentially without meaning, and perhaps detrimental. What was the point? I suppose since she saved the guy in her last film, she couldn't do that again, but why did she need to end up pregnant? Come on! The movie definitely could have ended better -- maybe with her getting a job or becoming more empowered as a woman, not just knocked up and living off her dead husband's insurance money. Ugh...disappointing that women must still be portrayed that way in modern cinema.Julian McMahon needs to give more in his performances emotionally.Overall, it wasn't bad, but I don't think I would see it again. Entertaining, but nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Big Plot Hole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Premonition" despite the poor reviews because it had an intriguing premise. It turns out the 60 second commercial shows you everything you need to know about the movie and the ending does not explain anything.***SPOILER*** I suspect half the budget of the film went to Sandra Bullock. Without her, there would be no movie at all. The writer came up with this great premise, but could not figure out how to end it, so they just pretend that everything that happens in the movie didn't really happen. There is no explanation for most of the events in the film and some of the things that we saw happen evidently didn't really happen. It is the most frustrating ending they could have used. It would have been better to have a really stupid ending like in "The Number 23" than to just ignore everything in the movie. ***END SPOILER***"Premonition" had a lot going for it and Sandra Bullock makes the film watchable, but the lame ending and a lot of plot holes are going to frustrate anyone who actually thinks about the movie. Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Premonition is...You will go and see this film with rather high hopes; after seeing it however, you will be confused by the plot holes, frustrated by the directors ending, rather satisfied with Sandra Bullock, Nia Long and Kate Nelligan's performances in the film and wanting to post a review similar to this and the below negative posts. I wouldn't recommend this film, its plot holes left a lot to be explained, and the skipping from day to day was very confusing, which i guess if you want to see something that will make you try and work things out in your head, this might be OK; but if you just want to go and see it for Sandra, i suggest you go and rent The Lake House...--Spoilers below!-- The scars on Bridgette Hanson's face were almost Chucky-like, the whole dead bird scene was rather gross (and didn't seem to have much relation to the film), Linda Hanson nearly crashing towards the beginning scared the sh*t out of me... and the film generally lacked any real "Umpth" (also known as pace) and if you get bored easily... bring a pillow!~AL~ XxX</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film because I really like Sandra Bullock but ultimately came away feeling disappointed with almost every other part of the film. The script and story had potential but it was soooo slow I felt like shouting out at the screen. * SPOILER ALERT * The story got off to a very bad start with her totally unbelievable reaction to being told her husband was dead. Instead of asking for verification, or maybe how or when it happened, she closes the door, only to be left on her own, I'm sorry but that didn't seem real at all. I could get over the inconsistencies of her daughters accident,doctors committing her for little reason,her seemingly not trying hard enough to prevent it happening at all.. etc but the ending ...oh dear the ending was bad, very bad. We felt the theatre with comments of 'is that it?' ringing in our ears. I felt cheated after enduring a very poor seemingly very long film I felt at least I deserve a decent ending but no... disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The trouble with causality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people start traveling backward and forward in time in movies, I get annoyed when the plot gets tangled up in that old time-travel gremlin, causality. When that happens, the entire film becomes unbelievable and confusing. So it is with Premonition.SPOILERS BELOW!The movie starts on a Thursday when Sandra Bullock's character is informed that her husband died the day before in an auto accident. Just before the officer informed her, she was listening to a message from her husband on the answering machine. At the end of the message, he was interrupted by another call. That call turned out to be her, in the past, trying to warn him of his impending collision but failing.In fact, she is the one who killed her husband. If she had not tried to warn him, he would not have been killed.Ultimately, it turned out to be one of those movies where the wife kills the husband to get the insurance. But instead of being written in the style of Law and Order, it is written as a suspense thriller time shifting movie.It was a little slow paced throughout for me. And I really hated the ending. There are some unanswered questions and some plot devices, such as the dead bird, that were placed in the movie solely to let the audience know what day it was. It wasn't awful, but it certainly didn't live up to its hype. And of course that whole causality glitch: He wouldn't have died if she hadn't tried to warn him, but she wouldn't have tried to warn him if she hadn't found out he had gotten killed. I gave it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not "Memento", but still...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really know anything about "Premonition" when I turned it on. After about half an hour, I figured out what was going on before they officially revealed it. The movie's strength is how they lay everything out, although you might be able to predict what eventually happens. I wouldn't call the movie particularly suspenseful, but it's still worth seeing. I couldn't tell whether there was supposed to be a religious theme.Sandra Bullock plays a little bit against type as a housewife (I usually expect her characters to be bitchier than this). I got the feeling that the movie may have been channeling Robert Zemeckis's "What Lies Beneath", as both movies portray the wife getting suspicious about what's been going on in her household (not to mention that both movies co-star Amber Valletta, and both have characters named Claire and Norman). But maybe that's just me.So, it's an OK movie. While far from any masterpiece, I still like how they set it up. Also starring Julian McMahon, Nia Long, Kate Nelligan and Peter Stormare.</fullReview>

It's like the Christian Broadcasting Network wrote the script and paid big bucks to have it made. Remember women: it is your role to fight for your marriage, home, and make lots of babies. That's all that is important in your life. Now get your ass in the kitchen and make some cupcakes.

The acting was great, but I am disgusted at the writing and execution of an attempt to be avant-garde. The writer and/or director must think I and the rest of the world have no intelligence. The plot holes were so numerous, I, much less than a movie critic, could not buy into the story. The suspense music was played at totally inappropriate times and annoying to even the less than critical movie viewers. I was so appalled at the movie that I wanted to leave halfway through it, but held out in the hopes that the ending would justify the horrible beginning. I was wrong.

		<fullReview>Is he alive; is he dead, do we care? OK, it's not the tag-line for the film, though it may heave been more accurate. Premonition begins as it means to go on, one big predictable cliché of a supernatural thriller. Jim (Julian McMahon) and Linda (Sandra Bullock) Hanson have just bought their dream house and appear very much in love. Fast forward a few years, they have two daughters and their marriage appears to be in trouble, however before this can be resolved Jim dies horribly in a car crash. Or did he? Linda wakes up the next morning to find her husband alive, and then he's dead, then alive?get the picture? There is absolutely no suspense in the first half with director Mennan Yapo adding none. He's not entirely to blame though, a film can be predictable but atmospheric with the right score, however this one is just as clichéd almost as if it's actually telling you what's about to happen next. The only thing that's surprising in this film how the hell they though they could get away with such a poor ending? It's not all bad though; Bullock plays the part well enough however her character appears to be dealing with the strange time phenomena pretty easily. McMahon isn't given much screen time for us to really care if he lives or die and the rest of cast behave like they've been brainwashed by a cult. All except of Peter Stormare as psychiatrist Dr Norman Roth. His performance is solid, though limited. The interesting thing is that the whole film appears to improve when he's on screen, from fellow performances to the directing. By the end, which you don't need to see into the future to see, you feel cheated. Like the whole film was a waste of time. Not that's a particularly bad film, it's just so by the numbers in most departments that it's not worth caring about.</fullReview>

Yes, Bullock's acting was good, but wow, the script was horrible. People have already commented on the inconsistencies in the script; the daughter walking through the door on Tuesday and not being cut up on the Thursday, the stickers on the door....and so on. Bullock's actions in the movie is what causes her husband to die! If she lived her life normally (Sunday to Saturday) then her husband would have been fine. There's no explanation why her days were jumping around, none, nada, zip. I had to come home and watch another movie to "cleanse" myself from this horrible waste of time and money. I was hoping the ending would justify the time wasted in the theater, but it didn't, it just added more holes to the plot. Ridiculous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgracefully unoriginal + Sandra Bullock's worst performance seen on camera = Premonition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premonition is a terrible movie. Absolutely, disgracefully, terrible. Terrible to a point it makes grown men cry. The plot is a mess, the acting is as flat as a wall, the characters are lifeless and common, and the "plot twists" can be seen coming a mile away. I actually thought as I walked into the theater that I knew how the movie was going to end. I had an idea, a twinge. A hunch. But, surely, the movie would prove me wrong. Nope. I walked out, an hour and a half later, the girls I were accompanying crying like saps and the guys moaning about how terrible the film truly was. And it had ended. Exactly. As. I. Expected. Exactly. And that's so very, very, truly sad. Throughout the length of this film, you really have to wonder, what are we coming to? What is America coming to when people watch the same formula, over and over and over? And I know Premonition isn't the only one to blame. I can't help but predict endings just by glancing at the back of novels and DVD cases these days. And usually, I wind up being right. The true crime with Premonition is that I could predict it in it's entirety. I'll admit, I could possibly predict the details, but I had an idea of what the whole plot would probably wind up being before I saw this movie. I was wrong on a few notes. But, folks, seriously, when you have an air-headed sixteen year old like me complaining about a movie that has scenes of sex, explosions, and the f word, you know something is desperately wrong here. Usually these things, even in the smallest doses possible (as Premonition tries to disperse discreetly), are usually able to entertain one such as myself. But it didn't! After twenty minutes in, I and my friends (well, male friends, the girls seemed to find the whole thing very emotional) were able to point out what was going to happen : oh, he's doing her. Oh, they're going to get in a fight and have sex. Oh, there is going to be a massive global tragedy which causes the world to fall on it's hinges of apocalypse (just kidding folks, that doesn't happen in the movie, that happens because of the movie) (and it's not fictional). Please, please. I'm begging you not to see this. I'm begging you not to rent it. I'm begging you not to see, rent, purchase, borrow, or encourage Premonition or any other predictable blockbuster film of it's kind in any way, which, sort, or whatever the hell expression you won't me to use. This is the United States of America, the land of the free, the land of the brave. Please, don't make it the land of the dumbasses too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, confusing ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Premonition was hopefully taken in by everyone the same way I took it in. While sitting watching, confusion filled viewers faces and the first thing that came to mind was, what was going to happen next. It's definitely a film that puts you in the place of the characters and pulls you in, until you yourself figure everything out before the character. Sandra Bullock was one of a kind throughout the film. Her Miss Congeniality character was not a favorite for some and this film more than likely gave most people a different opinion. She did very well performing in various scenes and really made viewers feel for her. When her husband dies, she reacts in a way most do, however she holds herself together and trusts her instincts that he can't be dead. Powerful scenes took over the theater as Sandra sees her husband alive in the shower after hearing he was dead. She gets in with him, clothes and all, and just hugs him for awhile. He doesn't comprehend why she is acting the way she is and tells her OK enough enough, but she refuses to let go with a " Just one more minute." We tend to notice the irony behind the scene and know exactly why Sandra acts the way she does.Throughout the film, I do have to admit that I almost had to get up and walk out for a minute, for I was going crazy myself. The order in which things happen in the movie, is just flustering. It is way too much to take in at once and I, for one, can say I couldn't concentrate on what was happening at that time while trying to figure out what had just happened before that. I would have to say that was one of the worst things about the movie. The only other problem some seem to encounter, including myself, would have to be the ending. The whole time you are assuming Sandra will save her husband from his death and after filling in all the wholes, you were for sure convinced she would. This is not the case after watching the film. One thing I would have to ask the writer would have to be if she followed her husband to the scene of the accident, talked to him on the phone, saw him die, where in there does it show why she would need an officer to come tell her he was dead. She was there, she lived it, and a day later she is basically told she was not there at all. It might be because I am a little confused, and she changed things so that good happened instead of bad, but if she was only living the days out of order and going back in time, wouldn't that mean the officer still would show up Thursday? I don't know. I am now confusing myself! Overall, it was a very well written and performed movie and I will be buying the DVD as soon as possible. I recommend it COMPLETELY and hopefully you do too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was , in a nutshell, terrible. As others have said, too many plot holes along the way....actions being taken that no one would take, etc. etc. etc..... It is actually funny when you realize that Sandra's character is the sole reason for her husband's untimely death! Let me ask you this....you find yourself waking up from a nightmare/dream/premonition, whatever, in which someone you love died in a horrible accident. Upon waking, would you repeat every action that you had carried out in that nightmare/dream/premonition?? Or, would you, like most sane people, try to do something different that totally goes against what you experienced in the nightmare/dream/ premonition to possibly break the bad kharma? I mean if you are going to believe that the awful thing can happen, wouldn't you also believe that you should not blindly do everything again that happened, just in case. I don't know...maybe I just don't get it. I do know that everyone we walked out with in the packed theater was disgusted and complaining. One lady even said "I wish Sandra Bullock's character would have been the one to die...now that would have been a good ending!" Pretty bad when folks are wishing death on the lead character.My advice is to wait for the DVD...and then still take a pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think that movies should entertain you, like I do, this movie will be a big letdown. First of all, it's supposed to be a thriller, something I was not aware of going into the theater, and as such not my cup of tea at all. But thriller or not, I found it plain boring. I went to see this movie as part of a group, this movie was not my choice and I didn't know what to expect, and the result was, of course, two hours of my life wasted. Because I was part of a group, I did not have the option to leave before the movie ended, which would have been my preference. So what was wrong with the movie? Sandra Bullock is permanently disheveled, although perhaps it is appropriate for her character. She plays her part well, the problem for me was the excruciatingly boring storyline, very slow moving plot, very little action. About half an hour into the movie I started checking my watch and mentally calculating how much longer before the movie ends. The only good thing I can say about Premonition is that it was not overly long - the standard two hours. My recommendation is to skip it altogether, spend your money to see something more worthwhile. Or if you are into thrillers and really curious about this movie, rent it once it comes out on DVD. That way you can always turn it off if it proves too boring to watch and won't have to sit through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cuts on the face? What about the mental hospital?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was decently entertaining, but at the end, I felt that there were elements that weren't explained. First of all, the older daughter had cuts in her face from Tuesday when she ran through the glass door and the husband was still alive. However, when the movie started on Thursday, she had no cuts whatsoever, Sandra Bullock's character was putting stickers on the door (the door was not broken), and she was informed that her husband had died. This is never explained, and in the very end, the girl still has the cuts, but they are healing.The second bit that bugged me was Linda's mom committing her. They commit her because she won't say what happened to the girl's face, but she when it happens, she explains it to her husband. So does she get committed later on or does that not happen? This is never explained, and if she got committed, how does she get out? I felt that there were major plot holes, but all in all it was an entertaining movie. Go watch it if you want to be entertained, not if you want to discuss it afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Ridiculous non-thriller with no suspense from hack director Mennan Yapo. So many plot holes and stupid moments that I was tempted to walk out.Here is the best I can offer for positive feedback: Sandra Bullock is not as awful as she usually is. OK, here is one more ... the film only lasts about 90 minutes. Those are the only two things I can come up with.Kate Nelligan, who is usually solid appears to be embarrassed to appear in the film. Peter Stormare, who has many classic supporting roles on his resume is just plain awful in the inexcusably miscast role of a psychiatrist. Julian McMahon is so tight-lipped that we not only wonder why Bullock's character was ever attracted to him, we certainly can't figure out why the hot new "assistant manager" wants him. Nia Long is wasted as the best friend. Her big contribution is not being able to get the kids upstairs before the white coats barge in to drag Bullock out ... or maybe that was the acting police. Either way, she deserved to go.If you enjoy stupid, unbelievable, BORING, lackluster films with no suspense, then "Premonition" is certainly the one for you.</fullReview>

When the husband died, the gas truck went on fire so his body would be cremated but the wife saw the body in pieces at the funeral. Also the wife witnessed the husband's death on Wednesday but on Friday the sheriff told the wife the husband died.I suggest if you watch Premonition, do not leave to get food or go to the bathroom because if you do you will not understand the rest of the movie.

		<shortDescription>Broken - Do NOT See This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director for this movie should be fined and should apologize to everyone who spent two hours watching it. As I'm sure others have said, the premise behind this movie is completely broken. First of all, there is an inexcusable lack of continuity from the very beginning. I won't spoil it, (though I hope nobody reading this watches the movie) but let's just say that something hasn't happened that the story demands. The day before, something was true, and after, but not the day in the middle. Confusing maybe, but not as confusing as trying to figure it out logically. This isn't some neat trick of the direction. It is a mistake. That aside (if you have the ability to dismiss something that huge), there are SO MANY WAYS the wife could have ATTEMPTED to change her reality. Cut her hair on Sunday - this would have modified the time-line - break all the windows in the house - confront the husband about his little indiscretion - any of these things would have changed the outcome, but the writer/director didn't even come close to addressing these facts. I felt like I was watching the stupidest woman who ever breathed being dragged through hell without resisting at all. In short (if possible at this point), horrible movie. Completely flawed story line. Total waste of time unless you really like being infuriated, OR you are just as dumb as this character or some of my relatives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really rare that a film has a good ending when the set-up and exposition have been completely botched thanks to terribly clumsy writing, but this is the case with Premonition, a film which, about three-fourths of the way through, becomes a totally different movie.-=- MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (from here to the end of the review) -=- In the scene where Bullock's character Linda (a soulful performance from Bullock, who's utterly compelling throughout) goes to see a priest about the major confusion she's been experiencing regarding her husband's death and events surrounding it, it becomes clear - or it did to me, anyway - that Linda has indeed been having sight into future events. The film then shifts gears, where she begins dealing with the moral issue of "if you know someone's going to die and you don't stop it from happening, is it the same as killing them?" She then finds herself doing some serious soul searching regarding her relationship with her husband (who is on the verge of having an affair - if it hasn't already started - with a fellow office worker), and the scenes where she realizes she loves him regardless of whether he's been (or is going to be) unfaithful are deeply poignant.Her loving actions towards him change the husband's mind about meeting said co-worker in a hotel, in fact; he realizes he does love Linda after all. But it is not enough to stop the accident from happening because it was meant to happen that day. The message here is profound and true: you cannot change what is meant to happen. Linda does at least, at the end, understand this, which gives her the peace of knowing she tried to make things right, which allows her to move on with her 2 daughters to the next phase of her life.This ending is being missed by a lot of people, and I attribute this to the astoundingly convoluted set-up and exposition. How, though, does one successfully convey that a character is having a genuine premonition? In other films, it's been accomplished by the character dreaming it, or flashing on the vision of it during waking hours, but this wouldn't have worked in the film because the set-up and exposition would have been 10 minutes long and the film in its entirety would have run 45 minutes. The writer, I think, was trying to show Linda's state of confusion - and if you've ever had any kind of premonition, you know how confused it makes you because you're not sure at any point that it's a bonafide vision of future events or if you're just projecting fear into something you do not want to happen - but I feel, still, that her mental state during this occurrence could have been conveyed in a more coherent way, so the ending wasn't lost on so many viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Premonition is....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't waste your money on this money. I looked forward to this movie due to the trailers, but I was extremely disappointed. I love Sandra Bullock, but she is going to HAVE to do better in choosing scripts. She is much better than this. Julian McMahon's character was good. It was just the script as a whole. It took a long time for everything to be explained. When it finally WAS explained, I was very let down. She is going to have to really pick a good script next time before I waste any more money. It's not her fault.....it was the script itself. I love the fact that she has stretched out into more dramatic films, because she CAN ACT. I recently watched The Lake House and found it to be a very boring movie. So, please, Sandra, keep up the good work, just be a little more picky about your scripts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock is unique in her passion in roles that involve a husband and children. She inhabits her character in this film especially well. Bullock not only acts the role of the adoring wife but actually identifies with that role. It must be close to her own heart and life experience.The film is touching in the sense that Bullock as the wife has a premonition so real that she has difficulty sorting out the dreamlike premonition with the reality of her continuing life. Women are famous for their intuition and their premonitions. Perhaps, this is an evolutionary protective device for our human species, that makes the female more sensitive to certain clues given by the environment. Whatever the case, the premonition in this film is so vivid and overwhelming that schizophrenia is suspected by Bullock and a psychiatrist she visits. But, gradually Bullock gets a grip on reality and defends not only her own sanity but the physical health of her family. She becomes "superwife" and "supermother" as she uncovers an affair that her husband is concealing and yet forgives him and tries to save him from a tragic death.Several scenes are especially compelling. One is a scene in which Bullock hysterically demands that a closed coffin be opened, which contains her husband's broken body. Another scene is when Bullock finds her husband unexpectedly in the shower and holds him like a long lost baby that she desperately wants to protect. Bullock knows how to show affection for the adult male of the species like no other actress alive or dead, in my opinion. God bless you, Sandra Bullock, for being the beautiful woman you are, inside and out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow, tedious, boring. That pretty much sums it up. I saw a lot of people leaving early and I stayed because I just wanted to see how it ended. Now I wish I had my $9.00 back. It jumped around days in a particular order then dropped it towards the end, I guess to make it longer. BTW, Sandra Bullock is a horrible screamer. There's one point, seemingly very dramatic but then she's surprised and screaming and screaming but it sounds really bad and fake and instead of being moved by her trauma, everyone in the theater started laughing. Then, the token love scene because she and Julian McMahon were both outside in a storm and they got wet. So, cue the love scene. Except she took one of his shoes off, set his stinky sock foot in her lap and all I could think was, "I bet he needs some Odor Eaters." It seemed like it was trying to do a 6th Sense twist but it failed miserably. Even thinking about it later, it just didn't work. I'm not sure why anyone would give it a rating higher than a 2 but they must have really liked their nap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie in a Sneak Preview. The reaction to the name Sandra Bullock at the (beginning) titles was bad! She wasn't well received at first. If you also have a problem with her, than you might want to stay away from this movie. Although the people who stayed and watched the film were pleasantly surprised ... I'd say judging by their reactions after the movie was over.The movie itself begins slowly, but after the introduction and "the" incident that kicks off the story, it all goes fast, so you have to stay with it! From then on, it's trying to figure out what's happening! And the viewer should realize something earlier than Sandra Bullocks character ... It's well acted and overall well written (there are holes in the script, but I think forgivable ones), but it's the ending that will split people: Some will like it and some won't!</fullReview>

Why was Sandra Bullock experiencing all this! I could have overlooked these flaws if the movie had been entertaining! With the exception of some scenes the story is quite uninteresting and boring! This movie also could have used more drama and likable characters! We don't see enough of the husband! When he is in the picture he is not showing a lot of affection for his wife! From this you can deduct that Sandra and he are having some marital problems! But why didn't they show this to us earlier and more frequent! If they did we would have cared more about them and the story would have made more of an impact!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Great - Consistent Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of 'Premonition' is pretty much in the title, Sandra Bullock starts to wake up to what seems to be any random day in the near future and then is flung back into the present the very next day she wakes up, presumably to prevent any events from happening, to fix something and so on and so forth.Unfortunately it's execution is quite poor. It's very clumsy in its approach and there's a frightening amount of plot holes. Very few elements of the movie are satisfyingly resolved at the end and it's attempts at tension are clichéd at best, to which they play unsettling violin music until it's so loud that you predict a shocking event to occur, but it's just not very thrilling in its delivery.I for one, was never sure where the movie was going, it was messy in it's approach and it had that hint of confusement that you know after few watches would just make you more disinterested. Also, what was with those over-sentimental scenes that dragged on for no apparent reason? They certainly didn't give the characters any real depth or likability, which made those scenes even more pointless.Not great. I'd say the only positivities I could draw from the film was that it had an interesting concept, and through the consistent mediocrity you were 'somewhat' intrigued as to how it concluded, only for the simple reason that you couldn't really fathom how they could string all the dodgy events that occurred together.I suppose it's not terrible though, pretty harmless hour and a half. I just wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bullock is strong in this time line puzzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Premonition", a woman finds herself in a real-life nightmare--her life becomes a non-linear experience, a puzzle that she must sort out. And she must do it by herself, because if you start talking about premonitions, you sound like a crazy person.As viewers, we get to work on the same temporal puzzle that Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) is trying to unravel. At first, it seems that the time line will be difficult to follow, but the script does a good job of helping the viewer keep things straight.The film has its twists and turns, eventually morphing into an ethical puzzle, which deserved more attention. But that is a minor issue.Early in the story, Linda is told that her husband died in an accident. Bullock's portrayal of grief is one of the best I have seen. And it takes the viewer into her world immediately.There is a lot of moralizing built into the story, but it does not detract much. However, the film contains a lot of religious symbolism--to the point that I found it distracting. By the time we get to the end of the film, the story has the feeling of a roller-coaster--in a good way. Some reviewers hate the ending. There is no satisfying everyone on this issue. I can't say it ended strongly, but it was not a cop-out. The acting is good, including that of the children. The story is engaging. I have to deduct a little for the weak ending and the religious undertones that unnecessarily detract from the stronger story lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie some years ago on TV and it must have had an effect on me. Because when I saw it advertised again yesterday (2014) it rang bells with me and I re-watched it. If you are looking for a feel-good fairy tale ending then this is not for you. If you are wanting a life-affirming message then - again - this is not for you. But if you appreciate a good, thought provoking, well-crafted story with much to think about then you will not be disappointed. A second viewing reinforced my initial feelings of quality and helped me understand some of the subtleties of the direction and screenplay. It is one of those films that reveals itself more as it progresses. Throughout the movie small things - the empty wine bottle, the page torn out of the directory, the 'other woman' etc - slowly return to make sense of the confusion. Things begin to slot into place as the flash-backs and memories depicted start to make sense of the plot. The tragic finale is (by the time you get there) predictable but no less powerful for that. There are holes in the plot but these are insignificant compared with the effect and the drama of the unfolding story. Watch it with an open mind. You will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Goosebumps . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>or were they just Sandra Bullock's nipples, popping up again (as in Practical Magic) under some flimsy material, designed to get the audience to pay attention to this dull, incoherent mess of a supernatural mystery. By the time we see Bullock's high beams, the movie has devolved from a vaguely interesting dead-husband/live-husband/wife-sane/wife-bonkers narrative to a desperate attempt to tell us that fate is a mean-spirited SOB who will snatch away your dearly beloved despite making nice by forgiving infidelity.Bullock has absolutely no chemistry with her co-star, Julian McMahon, so her frantic attempts to make sense out of her losing and gaining days, mourning her dead husband and trying to make peace with him, and unraveling a story that has already unraveled is based on a false premise. McMahon is so stolid and Bullock is so fussy and dyspeptic that the viewer (me) must inflict bodily harm on himself to stay awake.It was nice seeing this thing free, but think of the time wasted! There's an old saying, "You don't kill time, you murder it."I just murdered 96 innocent minutes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandra Bullock encounters the supernatural in her life and attempts to alter the fate of her husband</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Premonition" is quite an entertaining film. I classify it as a horror film in which there is a supernatural element. As the film proceeds and especially as it moves to its conclusion and at the very end, it introduces dramatic elements in the form of a theme about love and marriage. It remains basically a horror film, in my opinion.Sandra Bullock does a very good job playing the central victim of the piece. She engages our sympathies throughout the film. We would not want to be in her shoes and we hope she can win through her difficulties. Her husband has a smaller role, but he handles it very effectively, showing a man who feels his love for his wife has waned and his marriage has gone stale and who is tempted by a blonde at work. Their two children also are easy to take. They are not obnoxious or overly precocious as Hollywood children often are.I decided early on that it would not pay to try to figure out the logic of Bullock's experiences. She is not simply having premonitions, as the title suggests. Far from it! She is actually living different days in a particular week out of sequence, so that she knows in advance certain things that will occur, to the extent that she can remember them from one day to the next. However, her memory is impaired by the shock of learning of her husband's sudden death in an auto accident. It is this event that she seeks to prevent. How well the script handles the complexity of these non-sequential days is something that will take repeated viewings to sort out. I didn't try. I decided to sit back and let the movie happen. As such, it was engaging and suspenseful.The very ending was an epilogue that got overly preachy, hammering home a theme that had already been shown dramatically and in dialog. This detracted from the film. It was designed to soften the ending and Hollywoodize the film, which ended without Bullock's being able to alter fate and, indeed, participating in that fate and helping to make it happen. Of course, had she done nothing, her husband could still have met a similar fate in any number of related ways."Premonition" is a decent horror movie. The script attempts to introduce some thematic material, and that's its weak spot. The message is garbled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been such a good movie. The imagery, the atmosphere, the acting, the idea are all superb and interesting. But it just lacked credible actions from the main characters: the people involved in making this movie were just too chuffed by their 'clever' and 'mysterious' film that they couldn't be bothered making Linda (Bullock's character) more resourceful or the events of Wednesday a little less frustratingly clichéd.I think this movie is NOT about time-travel as many believe, it really IS about premonitions. I caught this movie on free-to-air TV about one minute after it started, so I didn't know the title, I just saw it had Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon in it and I don't mind either of them, so I kept watching. I thought it was about time-travel while watching the movie (making me hate all the inconsistencies more) but then in the end credits, the title of the movie came up: Premonition - it then clicked: Linda is dreaming about the first Thursday on Monday morning. Hence her daughter's face is fine - because it is just a dream where she finds out about her husband's death, but not the details of her daughter's injury. Linda then dreams about Saturday on Tuesday morning. This is where she finds out about her daughter's injury, a possible mistress and a doctor who is trigger-happy with prescriptions/injections. She then dreams (or remembers) the previous Sunday where she seeks spiritual guidance, feels weird at Mile Marker 220 and has a bit of a confrontation with her husband. EVEN IF the movie is meant to be understood in this way, it STILL makes the viewer just want to shake Linda. If you woke up from a death dream and found your husband alive, wouldn't you even JOKINGLY say "I dreamt you died in a car accident on so-and-so Highway at Marker 220 on Wednesday, so be careful, eh.." So then the next morning, if you've just had a dream that the accident is for real, but you've also found out something happened to your daughter's face (but you still don't know how nor does anyone else because its YOUR dream) and some doctor who knows you is going to commit you to a mental ward... when you wake up and it has NOT happened yet, wouldn't you immediately put stickers up on any glass doors and avoid going to that doctor? And if it is all destiny anyway, couldn't the film-makers have had the daughter run through the house, but IS able to avoid the sliding door at the last minute because she swerves when her mother calls her, but due to inertia trips over the carpet or something instead and crashes through the glass coffee table OR SOMETHING (I've lived with glass doors and yes, my whole family AND the dog were stupid enough to walk into them many times but they NEVER shattered like that - and even if these glass doors DO shatter like that its inconsistent with a loving mother's behaviour not to have tried to prevent this with curtains/stickers/something). Rather than asking your lying, cheating husband to wake you up before he goes away on Wednesday, might you at the very LEAST hide the car keys? And if it is all inevitable, then DON'T do the clichéd dropped phone/car stall. I think it would have been more of a shock and bit less clichéd if at the EXACT moment where he sees her number on his phone coming in and he switches over to speak to her, THAT'S when he could have passed Marker 220, taken his eye off the road and NOT seen the deer or truck or whatever come out of nowhere and smash into his car. THAT would have also served as a warning not to talk on your phone while driving. I didn't mind the last-last ending either, nice to know she rekindled her love for her husband before his death and that she has yet one more spawn of his loins to raise in another house.So pretty much this is a great movie to watch if you like romances and believe that people are really passive (like those horror movies where the teenagers don't call the police or their parents when they find a dead body; or decide to investigate that noise in the cellar rather than slam the door shut, bar it and arm themselves with a sharp weapon - just in case). Finally, I am just glad I saw this for free on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very strange Premonition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is quite watchable i.e it is quite intriguing in as much as I found myself quite interested in the story and where or what it was leading up to. The cinematography is pretty standard fair for this sort of movie and the scenery and setting is OK too. I enjoyed Sandra Bullocks performance as the desperate housewife trying to resolve the puzzling p'premonition' she has to live out concerning her husbands death and I thought some of the themes of the movie were good too: faith, hope, love. The main problem, however, is that none of these themes really resonate or come to light until the very last few scenes of the film = her trip to a priest being the point when these such themes first make themselves apparent within Sandra Bullocks character, as she finally seems to come to terms with the inevitable death of her husband and begins to look for answers in relation to how she will carry on once he has passed. The bigger problem I had with this movie, however, is that once the final scene is shot and the credits begin to roll, I was left thinking 'what the h*ll was that all about', as the film is quite confusing in the end and leaves you with a lot of questions in terms of how she manages to break the 'premonition' and move forward and how each day of the 'premonition' had an effect, if any, on the previous/subsequent day. In fact, after the final conclusion of the movie is reached I was thinking what exactly was the point of it all and more precisely what was the point of her experiencing her 'premonition' in the first place. Anyway, I'd watch this film again when in no doubt it appears again on Television in a few years, otherwise I'll be staying far far away from this one - and to be honest - my advice is you do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been said to be a "horror". I disagree with that. If you're looking for a good horror movie to scare the pants off you, then this is certainly not a good pick.However, it is a good psychological thriller. The ending is more than unexpected. You can try and guess it out as much as you like, but I can guarantee you that you won't be able have it all figured out. It is as good as it is shocking. After you've seen the entire movie and replay the happenings in the correct order in your head, you will see that it's not really that outstanding. Sure, it's not common, but certainly not out of the ordinary. On the other hand, the way it's made, the way Sandra Bullock manages to pull herself together throughout the entire story, the way she deals with her children, with the situation itself, now that is way out of the ordinary. She makes this whole movie worthwhile. And by "she" I mean both the actress and the way she plays her part and the character and the way she remains stable when others would have gone crazy.To sum up, this movie is way better than it's rating. Or so I believed. I would definitely watch it over and over again and I believe it's worth a try. I really loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premonition tires a bit as you watch. It tries hard to break into something interesting, but doest quite make it. It shows some promise at times but is much too back and forth ultimately identity-less and with some bad turns - mostly with the Sandra Bullock character in her own reactions and thinking - (spoiler) if events/places/time changes when she falls asleep, why doesn't she try to keep awake after she's aware of it. Is the movie a horror, mystery, drama? Well maybe all 3 but feels spread thin too. The acting is barely passable for most of the cast members including the leads. Supporting cast members are truly unremarkable save for the lady in the affair and the doctor. Movies that deal with time more interestingly have been better done - namely 12 Monkeys and Jacobs Ladder in this case - both more defined in genre and story. There is a paltry explanation about 3/4 through dealing with faith that helps deflate the watching experience as if the default explanation of religion could be the only plausibility - bad cop-out. So while Premonition at least makes an attempt with the topic of time, it's walking over trodden ground made by better trailblazing movies before it. Better directing needed here especially I think</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i saw this movie i thought"wow why hadn't i seen it before?" i then later on bought it because of how good it was. i loved how it was filmed , the acting was brilliant and it had me guessing from start to finish. Premonition is one of those films which you've never heard of till you come across it in the video shop or a friend has it at the back of their DVD collection. But i must say,its at the top of mine!its a film you need to follow till the very end and don't let anyone stop you, as every moment of it is important.everyone i've shown this to says it's great and that they throughly enjoyed it. the plot was great and it puts you in the position of what it would feel like to be her. a great film. i loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be anything out of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Difficult to give this film any sort of rating really until I can sit down with the scriptwriter &amp; director and have a chat to descipher if it was actually a work of genius or plot holed/flawed crap.There's so many perspectives &amp; issues to go into but the huge flaw (or maybe not) for me which prevented me from enjoying the film was this: What happened in the days before the film? The film began on the Thursday, then (off the top of my head came) the previous Monday, following Saturday, then back to Tuesday, forward to Friday then the previous Sunday and finally the Wednesay (the day before the initial day).The nagging problem there - on the assumption that the most recent day not to have been part of the script was the Saturday.a) Was that the day immediately before she woke in the 1st scene on the Thursday? b) or was there supposed to have been a Sunday to Wednesday prior to the opening day? Either way it is open to too much inconsistency. If a was true then surely she'd have woken on the Thursday expecting it to be Sunday &amp; a lie in - yet she immediately knew Daddy was on a business trip.So we assume it was b)? But surely then certain parts of those Sunday-Wednesday days would've repeated themselves. That was a problem with this film - it never had a reality to it. Linda really had nothing in her life. Did she not watch TV, the news, have anything in her life that she had to do on a particular day - work, a club for the children etc? Either way those events would have either been completely missed one week or repeated. I'd have been straight down the bookies to have a bet on the football.The other nagging problem here was the appalling casting of the Husband/Father - he had absolutely no redeeming qualities or personality at all. They never convinced as a couple &amp; not too much as a family. Dr Roth would've been more suited to somebody on the receiving end of psychiatric assistance rather than dishing it out.In defence of the film though, it is potentially a mind boggling &amp; stunning effort - just so long as there is a satisfactory explanation to the timeline discrepancies and the above.As for the ending, I had no problem with that at all. Yes, it was farsical that she didn't just scream at him to get out the car and run up the hill rather than the clichéd car stalling, but the actual outcome was the correct and only way to go - just could've been scripted better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't as bad as some comments say it is.I wont write about the story line...but i must say the ending was really surprising. Most drama films have a happy ending, not this one. Thats what i like about this movie. You think she made it, saved her husband,but she fails. Thats whats wrong with a lot of new films, they all have a fairy tale ending, but not this one.Don't care about the plot holes. They actually are HUGE, but while watching the movie, i didn't pay much attention for them.All in all a movie that could have been better but good enough to watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hansons, Jim and Linda, are not exactly a happy couple. Time has taken its toll. Linda's life takes a huge turn when she finds out about her husband's death in a car accident. This is the story of a depressed woman who finds out, in the worst possible way, Jim might have been involved with another woman from his office.Linda Hanson's descent into despair makes her mother, and close friend Annie, to institutionalize her as a measure for her own security and that of her two daughters. Linda begins to go backward and forward in the crucial events that leave her a widow."Premonition", which has been compared to other better made movies, is only watchable because of the allure of seeing Sandra Bullock, an actress that seems to be choosing these esoteric themes for her appearances lately. Director Mennan Yapo doesn't bring anything new to the genre. The flaw must be in the way Bill Kelly's screenplay is presented. Who knows how many changes the scenario went through before it hit local theaters? While this film will be adored by many, it will be disliked by just as many because of of a convoluted plot that doesn't make its case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Setup, but a bit annoying ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow - how can anything that involves a kind of time travel be anything less than cool? This movie kind of answered that. After watching it I felt like I had seen a movie on the Lifetime movie network for women - and not a very good one. However, the time theme and learning how the movie ended kept me watching to the end, so that counts for something.The story is basically about a lady whose husband is killed in an auto accident. Every time she goes to sleep, she seems to wake up either before or after the accident -- kind of jumping around in time. So... can she prevent the accident? This is a pretty good setup for a movie - but somehow it never very interesting. Sandra Bullock's character is never really likable and it's not easy to have respect for a character that's dumb enough to themselves psychiatrically committed.Furthermore, the story is ultimately annoying. I won't give out any details because with a time-travel scenario the value is in watching how the plot unfolds. However, when you're finished watching it, it's pretty easy to label it a sappy Lifetime movie that you almost wish you hadn't seen.If you're really into movies involving time-travel or the supernatural, it might be worth checking out ... but just barely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love.. I Hate.. Premonition !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved : the genius performance of (Sandra Bullock) she is a real great actress before being a star, the catchy plot of a chaotic week; that's quite original, the idea of the fast transit of time in always one shot; that was saying cleverly how empty the life of that wife was. I hated : casting (Peter Stormare) as the psychiatrist !!! He can be much better as a mental patient ! They put him here to be a tough horrific kind of character however I thought that he looked a bit gangster or Mafioso more than any possible doctor !, so I didn't like the mistake of the daughter being with unhurt face in the morning of the last day in her father's life who was with her in hospital the day before !!? From one point of view that unique plot could be marvelous indeed as a cinematic contribution to explain how the ones whom see the future truly saw it. As they could be that sheer authority on it simply because they lived it all before ! You'd feel that the plot seemed more powerful than the story of it ! But it's just an initial feeling. The movie had been grounded on that "disordering" condition just to solve that woman's problem, so she could grasp her goal in life and the beauty of what she was having already. Look at her while she was telling her daughters : "How beautiful you are both", "Say to your father how much you love him". She and her husband went through a phase of sensations' coldness or life's frigidity to the extent that they were both in such a misty state and about to lose the whole meaning of relationship or existence; she said to the priest : "I don't know what's the thing I'm fighting for ?!", the monotony of their life caused that obtuse weariness which made the confusion and pushed them to do some things they really didn't want as he was about to cheat on her and she was close to wish him dead. She had to traverse that journey to know how much love and power in her. Therefore she got that new baby at the end as she'll lead the way by herself after her perception what she's living for. So the strange plot after all could be something more than thrilling novel element, saying a lot about how she was living death through life by missing the point of her very being, it gave her a rare chance to reexamine her deeds, and how she could straggle to restore her love and save her family. It was a perfect plan to make her discover &amp; cherish the treasures she owns, mainly to find the faith in god, in love, in herself as by faith we afford to lose anything but without faith we may lose ourselves. Somehow it's not (Oedipus) meets (Pulp Fiction) because it's not about the fact that as long as we escape from fate we contribute to fulfill it, No.. It's about making peace with oneself and the acceptance of one's role in life. Eventually, I loved (Premonition) and it deserves a second watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was a great movie. I saw it with the wife, and her friend came to visit, and I just ignored her! The movie held me in my TV-throne ( I have a special soft chair just for my bum, used only when watching movies!! Do not send comments about this!!). The slowish pace, the clues tho' they weren't so subtle and the overall plot was just right for me. It was 10/10 about three quarters of the way. However, I thought the ending was a tad weak (and I am sure I would not be the only one who think so). I have stopped liking slo-mos during dramatic scenes and have started to dislike them! Just get on with it, go fast. We are not in the 80s anymore. I am sure many of our members could have suggested a better ending than this. I would have given it a 7, if only the clues left each day were less detailed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. This was a relatively intriguing movie. Very confusing for a while, but eventually it started to make a little sense, although a bit too late to remember all the pieces. The performances were fine and the haunting music certainly set the tone for the mystery. Unfortunately, it was my turn to go to the video store and the only reason I picked this up was because thought it would have a happy ending. I saw the preview a couple of times and it looked interesting. I like supernatural stories, etc., and thought this would have a point to it. HOWEVER, the ending is so tragic it made the whole movie pointless and a real downer. The only thing good about this movie is the fact that the next movie I watch I *know* will be better. Stay away!! I'm sure my wife won't let me pick out any videos for a while -- I even seriously thought about throwing it away instead of returning it to the video store (I *did* drive right to the store afterward and popped it into their night return slot -- I wanted it out of my house as soon as possible!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had some strong points - I'll give it that. But these strong points were far outweighed by the desultory plot: the incessant bombardment of holes and inconsistencies and WTFs. I watched the first half of the movie out of sheer enjoyment and entertainment. I watched the second half of the movie out of sheer disbelief and confusion - hoping that in any second at least one of the holes would be filled. I must admit, though, that the constant disbelief and confusion did keep me glued to the movie - maybe even more so than the first half. I was on the edge of my seat in "Are you joking?" revelry.I'm aware that most of the inconsistencies have already been pointed out (several times) - even the one I'm about to bring up - but I just have to ask: WHY DID THE POLICEMAN COME TO LINDA'S HOUSE AND INFORM HER OF HER HUSBAND'S DEATH IF LINDA WAS AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT?? COME ON!That should've been easiest plot hole for the writers/director/anybody...anybody at all...to catch. I mean seriously. And I'm sure they DID catch it, along with many others. I'm betting the whole thing went down like this:"Ouch... I just noticed something...a few things...""What?""It's kind of big.""What?""...Really big. Some things with the script. Like...wow. This is bad. I mean like...we'd have to re-shoot a LOT of stuff...""Right. Okay then... We'll scramble the scenes.""We'll what?""I've done it before. Scramble the scenes. Turn it into a...a movie about...a movie about a woman who sees the future.""The future?""Yeah, the future. Ooo, that's good. All right, let's get Sandra back here and we'll shoot a few more scenes. This isn't gonna be a simple tale about a woman grieving with the loss of her husband anymore... It's about a woman who predicts the future... And sees the past...from the future. And sees the future present from the past.... And the present future from...further in the future. Ooo. And she sees the present past from the past future. Oh, God. This is gold."Because of all the inconsistencies and unbelievable occurrences - rather than regardless of them - I'm still going to recommend this movie. Maybe it would even make for a fun drinking game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Sandra Bullock's SO UNDER-UTILIZED!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so disappointing as a thriller or a mystery or a romance, but it does make a person think about how easy it is to take life for granted...and how you should never pull a U-Turn on a hill with an obstructed view of oncoming traffic or use a cellphone while driving. Sandra Bullock is an incredibly beautiful person, but her beauty was not utilized and she became the typical, boring, irritating housewife/mother. Script and direction should have enhanced her role, both in the aspect of her stunning good looks and how that should have played a part in helping her husband's business interests as well as showing how she might have been susceptible to excessive vanity in order to enhance the contrast when she spirals downward. Making her husband's torrid romance/close call infidelity more interesting - as though he was really onto something profound - could have added credibility to the advancement of the plot and the eventual moral of the story. This movie should be remade with more attention given to development of relationships and characters' motivations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, bad ending!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the comments that say this movie had a bad ending. What would be the purpose of having premonitions if you couldn't really do anything to change the outcome? That would be terrible...to know what is going to open and when...but you can't do anything about it.Plus, in the end, I don't think one single changed from what happened in the beginning. At the start, when she listens to his message on the answering machine the first time, he says "someone is beeping in, is that". And, at the end, he says "someone is beeping in, is that, that is you". So, from the very beginning he had the conversation with her and the girls in the living room the night before (where he told them all how much he loved them) AND he had already decided NOT to have the affair AND he was turning around on his way home.Her "premonitions" were for naught. I don't see how having her end up pregnant, with a third child, in the end changed anything. Of course, each child is special, but she already had two of his children. So it wasn't like, if Demi Moore's character had been pregnant in "Ghost" and she then would have some part of him. I hope that makes sense.It would have been much better had she actually stopped the accident from happening. It would have given the premonition value. As it is, the only possible value of the premonition was that he tripled his life insurance. That's the wrong "value" message to send. The "value" would have been the continuity of the family and not having him get killed in a such a ridiculous way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linear acting for a not linear movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premonition is not a bad movie but it's not an excellent one. This movie is all about Sandra's effective acting, which made me watch this movie from the beginning to the end and also made the critics to not low rate it so much. The movie is not logical and there isn't so much sense in it, but Sandra elevates the strange atmosphere all the times. It's claustrophobic in an almost 2 hours of nightmare. This is one of those movies that you never understand what's happening or one of those ones that everything backs to happen all over again like a bad dream. I think that, if I might say that, this movie is an adult and serious version of "Nightmare on Elm Street", focusing only on the psychological matters in a world where Freddy Krueger is the time running.If you're looking for action or some kind of psychological thriller as it's kinda shown in the trailers, forget it. This is a very low time movie, everything happens slowly so you have time to follow all the steps of the story and understand all the backwards and forwards of the movie. It's not linear and it's not so understandable as you might think. Once again, this one is all about Sandra's acting because her acting is linear in a crazy time line, she starts the movie as a happy girl and ends it completely hysterical. I'm sure she picked up this movie not for its story but for her role in it and the acting freedom that it offers, and she works perfectly. I'm sure it's one of her best acting experiences in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was expecting this film to be completely "by the book" in something that I could figure out the whole movie in 15 minutes. By saying that, this film get some points for the unexpected.Story is simple: Wife has a dream husband dies, next day hes alive. Then it jumps back and forth a bit a couple of times. The idea works, because the film is meant to confuse the viewer at first and also it is basically a puzzle in itself, (which is where the gimmick is), but it works...to an extent...Without giving anything away, popping back and forth from different days kept me entertained and on my toes, but a few certain elements made me think, "Wow, they messed that up BAD." There are at least 3 or 4 key things that happen that are inconsistent with the plot of the movie as a whole.As far as the ending goes, it was better than I expected, but while watching it, it felt kind of dumb at the same time.Like I said, not a horrible film, but when you pay attention you'll notice many plot errors.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot holes, bad casting, but still thoroughly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really want to watch this movie, since I'd seen it get such bad reviews from US critics (8% on rottentomatoes). So I watched the DVD with my hand on the stop button, but somehow managed to get enthralled by it. It's not so complicated as the critics made out -"Amores Perros" or "21 Grams" or "Memento" you can get confused by, at least the first time through, but this isn't so hard to follow. It's not entirely original - the concept of influencing events by interfering with the chronology of time has been the subject of multiple movies and TV series - "The Butterfly Effect" comes to mind - but it's original enough to keep you guessing. I actually thought I had this worked out about half way through, but the ending proved me wrong. So criticism of the ending also doesn't stand in my book.There was criticism about the way it lapsed into some kind of religious sermon. I mean, what? A 5 minute scene with a priest, who gives her some history and spiritual/philosophical advice, all of which she rejects anyway, and now the film has a religious agenda? There are two obvious criticisms. One relates to the obvious plot holes, particularly the one with the cuts on the daughter's face. Why was this necessary anyway? I'd suspect that the plot hole arose because this was all added in as an after-thought. And what was that with Sandra Bullock being committed? It came. And it went. Was it just a red herring? A dream? The other criticism I'd have is with the casting. Despite critics saying things like "this will end Sandra Bullock's career", I thought she was typically superb in this film, which she pretty much carried on her own. But Peter Stormare as a doctor/psychiatrist? Dressed in flannels and God knows what else? Would you let this person stick a needle into you? He makes a great psycho/gangster, but this role was not for him. And Julian McMahon......As an Aussie, I like to see Aussie actors making the big-time, but not when it's an embarrassment like this.Still, despite all of this, I enjoyed this film a lot more than most others I've watched recently, and not just because of Bullock. A 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's not completely awful. Unfortunately that's about the best that can be said for Premonition. It has its moments but it never really comes together and what we're left with is a very ordinary, rather mundane movie. The plot seems to set up all kinds of interesting and exciting possibilities but there is no payoff. The setup is there but the execution is lacking.Sandra Bullock plays the central character here, Linda Hanson. One day she's minding her own business at home when a police officer arrives at the door to inform her that her husband Jim has been killed in a car accident. Obviously shocked and devastated Linda spends the rest of the day trying to begin to pick up the pieces. We see her break the news to the couple's young daughters. Linda's mother comes over to try to help in any way she can. Eventually Linda falls asleep. And when she wakes up...her husband is alive. Somehow it is three days earlier than it had been when she laid her head down to sleep. And thus the plot is really set into motion. For when she wakes up the following day her husband is dead again. And then the next day he's alive as Linda continues to jump back and forth in time, living out the most crucial week of her life completely out of order. She knows Jim is going to die. Can she stop it from happening? And how exactly could she do that without everybody thinking she's gone well and truly insane? That's the movie's setup, and it's not a bad one. Too bad it doesn't really pay off.Bullock gives a fine performance and as the sometimes dead, sometimes alive husband Julian McMahon is OK in his role. There are other characters floating about but it's McMahon and especially Bullock who have to really carry the film and they seem up to the task. But unfortunately the script fails them. After setting up its premise this film should have been able to go to some very interesting places but it never really takes off. For all the jumping back and forth in time there's really no energy to the film. The whole thing has a very blah feel to it. But you'll stick with it because you want to see how it all turns out...and there may be the greatest disappointment of all. It seems the filmmakers had absolutely no idea how to end their movie. Actually, if you listen to the DVD commentary you'll hear the director admit he had no idea how to end the movie. They basically just made up an ending on the spot and it falls flat. It's the final disappointment in a film which had a lot of unrealized potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fear of what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One mind, one consciousness, two worlds. At the beginning it is clear that we are going to take a trip into isolation. Linda Hanson has it all. A loving husband, two healthy young children, and a prosperous life with not that little time on her own. Seems like a pretty good picture of a well-off middle class home. Something we've seen on film like ten thousand times before, which is probably why the film isn't treated that good.When suddenly we find ourselves in a different world, seeing it all from Linda's point of view. Although she knows a lot more than the rest of the people, there is still something that remains unknown. It's because of this "unknown" thing that Linda is seen as a mentally unstable person, although she remains completely normal. It delves her further into loneliness, and this is what I think the film is best about.The middle-class perspective probably makes it easier to relate to her and also to get absorbed into hear fears. After all, like it or not, in the back of our heads we're all probably daydreaming of a life similar to her's. But this "unknown" thing, a premonition, remains. It doesn't only make her look frail in front of others, but it can make her feel bad even about her self.I think that this is a good film about loneliness, isolation and some of the darkest fears we have. And how no living standard can make these feelings go away. It's about the fear of loss. The loss of love. It's no coincidence that in the end, she remains a widow. The important thing is that this time, she accepts it differently. She accepts it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Practical Magic", she was a witch in constant danger of killing off her lovers because of an ancient curse. In "The Lake House", she got letters from the past and made time fold in on itself. Now, in "Premonition", she sees the future. What's next? Sandra Bullock is clearly in league with the powers that be, and everybody knows that magic, no matter whether black or white, always comes at a price. If she succumbs to one more supernatural script, she will go straight to hell. She should find a new agent *pronto* and get herself cast in something light-hearted that gives her the opportunity to showcase her comical talent - as displayed to everyone's advantage in "Demolition Man" and "Miss Congeniality". "Premonition" isn't quite as rotten as "The Lake House", but it pretty much wastes a fascinating plot device that might have done for the family drama what it did for the bomb scare thriller in "Deja Vu".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starting from the beginning, the movie started off a little slow, which nagged me. I did like the Tarantino-esquire presentation of jumbling the scenes around,, in order to present confusion, which is what the whole movie is based upon.. Sandra Bullock did a terrific job in this one,, similar to 28 days. You really never know if she's crazy or dreaming it up,, or if it's real, or she's trying to do her husband in,, or he somehow know's he's going to die. So pretty much you have to pay attention 100% of the time or you will be lost in this movie. The most horrific scene for me to watch was the little girl going through the storm door plate glass face first.. very gut wrenching, makes you hate the mother for not stopping the little girl. The husband we are not sure of throughout the movie, we don't know if he's on the up and up,, he takes out more life insurance the day before his death.. HM, then we have the mother on Lithium,, then seeking the help of a Priest. I watched this with my daughter, who loves movies as much as i do,, and she was glued to the couch,, which is hard these days for a 15 yr old girl,, anyways i found this movie to be very interesting thriller, i think the film would have been perfect to me if for instance it wouldn't have started so slowly, there seemed to be a few scenes that didn't need to be there, the jumbling of scenes i think was great but done just one or two times to many , and really got confusing towards the end, but i played along, other than that it was very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's going to be spoilers in this review, so be forewarned. I'll just say beforehand that people who can follow non-linear story lines will probably mostly like this movie, the rest of you will absolutely hate it. Also the title of the movie, Premonition, is a bit of a misnomer, it's not really about premonitions, it's about travelling back and forth through time in the wrong order; a premonition means you've seen the future and remember it, while still remembering the past, but in this movie she isn't travelling through the days in the right order so she sees glimpses of the future without knowing the stuff that happened before it.In the movie, we see that during the first day, Bullock is told that her husband has died in a car crash the day before. We later deduce that this first day of the movie is Thursday. We see her go pick her daughters up from school, and that's the first of their big continuity goofs. We see that the older daughter's face is fine with no scars on it. This is important because later in the movie we find out that she was injured on Tuesday when she accidentally falls through a plate-glass doorway, and sustains facial injuries that are revealed to be there upto Saturday at the very least. If she had facial injuries from Tuesday through Saturday, why doesn't she have them on Thursday too? Another continuity goof (or maybe an omission) is at the end of the movie. We see early on in the movie that she's dragged off to a mental institution on Saturday after the funeral. But at the end of the movie we see she is just waking up and it's several months later, and she's pregnant with her dead husband's baby, and she's getting ready to move out of that house. So what happened between the mental institutionalization and moving day? No explanation offered. Can you get sent to a loonie bin and be let out that quickly? Did the doctors at the loonie bin somehow come to the realization that she was right all along, and they were wrong?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't so hopeful about watching a top-class film before seeing Premoniton. Staff is unpretentious, direction and them is also like that. There was no remarkable reason to watch Premonition. But I thought it wouldn't get me bored more than my bored condition. But I was wrong and the film that I watched to pass the time in Sunday made my day worse.A woman dreaming the short-time future is intended to break of facts' flow. Linda and Jim is married with each other. Linda is worried about her husband. So she spends all her time to unit the pieces of puzzle. Only one thing about this film I can admire is similarity between children's puzzle and Linda's puzzle.The director gives the message to the one who watch it.Examining the staff, just Peter Stormare draw attention for me. Sandra Bullock is like always and I didn't like her role. I don't suggest you to watch that because such films happened out of fashion in 2000's years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandra Bullock deserves better parts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock is quite possibly the most underrated actress of our time. As highly rated a comedic actress as she is, her drama is just as exquisite and yet she continues to be snubbed better roles. And for some reason Oscar has just ignored her these past two years.In Premonition, housewife Linda Hanson gets the news one morning that her husband, Jim, has been killed in a car accident, furthering her already present depression. But the next day she wakes up to a day that finds Jim alive and well. She continues to live this pivotal week in her life completely out of order, trying desperately to figure out what has happened before it's too late.Sandra Bullock is impressive yet again in this relationship drama. Her portrayal of Linda is honest and real throughout and there's not a moment when we doubt her. That is what makes Ms. Bullock such a fine actress- she always seems realistic. The film itself is somewhat long and drawn out, though it's not wholly bad. You definitely are interested in what is going to happen. It's a very nice film to look at as well; the cinematography is beautiful. But mostly it's Sandra Bullock who makes the film worth watching, as she does every film she's in. Give her better parts! 6/10 stars...Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was kind of a disappointment for a film with Sandra Bullock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ordinarily I would jump at the chance to see Sandra Bullock, as I have always loved all her acting performances -- from Speed to this movie. However, I really was disappointed in this movie. Maybe this was not necessarily Sandra Bullock's fault. First of all the sequence of events was very disorganized and hard to follow. I understand that she was looking into the future and actually living the future before it came, but this was not evident until later in the movie. The dialog was not good and development of characters was lacking. We never really got to know her husband, played by McMahon, whose acting seemed flat. He showed no emotion whatsoever until the end. Also I thought the idea of using the same policeman who informed her of her husband's death, to stop Sandra Bullock for speeding was in bad taste, even though I understand this may have intensified the suspense. I do believe the theme of supposedly living the perfect life with a great husband was examined in this movie and its real meaning explored. Obviously the character, Linda did not have a perfect marriage at all, but to give her credit, she did try to rectify this and make amends with her husband before he was killed.This was certainly not a happy movie and not even very entertaining. I believe with a better choice for playing the husband and better dialog, it could have been a worthy effort. Also the script needed to be re-written as to sequence of events. I believe the viewer might have an easier time of following the time-line of events if not so much rambling and switching back and forth -- from present to future scenes. As always, Sandra Bullock's wonderful performance probably saved this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever thriller with no plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a woman waking up from sleep to different puzzling events concerning her husband's life.I must say that the plot is excellent. It is difficult to put together a plot that involves intertwining present and future, and not to have any plot holes. Sandra Bullock's previous film, "The Lake House", was full of such plot holes. In contrast, the plot of "Premonition" is sound and has no plot holes. The present and future interacts with each other so that every piece of information has significance in the future. What's more important is that the outcome makes sense and not contradict each other. The initial confusion of Sandra Bullock is well presented, and I sympathise with her strange experience. The suspense is excellent and maintained throughout the movie. Things are revealed bit by bit, and finally everything falls into place. The ending is the best bit, but I will not reveal it. This film really captivated me, and I definitely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many spoilers I read reviews on these types of "flashback" movies where the plot does not follow in a completely linear fashion and I am unfortunately not surprised that this plot tool is what the majority of the reviews highlight. It really was not difficult to follow, and it was written well enough that there are not really any terribly large plot holes as a result (as many people would expect). So basically, if you do not get it, just don't watch the movie, I would not want to make your sub-100IQ brain to hurt.The acting was great, the music was good, camera work and directing was also done well. However, it seems to take the lead character entirely too long to fathom what is happening and to make a logical mapping of events (at least she does that though). To the individuals who comment that she changes things in the past to make a different future: you must have seen a different film, or you fell asleep in the first half of the movie during the painful process of the Linda character figuring out what is going on. The very point of the ending is that nothing at all has changed and that, in essence, she was the very reason for her husband's death. I also find it amusing that even though she has enough sense to track down her husband's mistress, map out the accident, and even deliberately highlight her daughter's injury on that map, she does not put that damned sticker on the door while she is in the past. If she knew that the therapist was going to be a jerk and commit her, then why on earth would she go to see him? If she was wise enough to make the calender, which illustrates that she has the ability to manipulate matter through her inverse time line, then why would she not do simple things like sabotaging her husband's car so he would not die, or at least making sure her child did not become disfigured. Sandra comes off as being too smart in this role to do all of the obviously stupid things that the character does. Also, the explanation for the time displacements is sad and irritated me throughout the movie. She should have been able to will herself to make the change at the very end of the movie to "fight for her husband" and stop the accident with one more time jump, or even been arrested for her husband's death, answering her dilemma regarding her responsibility in the matter "is that the same as killing him?"</fullReview>

Good picture and visual effects (in the crash especially). i loved it for the fact that it keeps you trying to guess what is going to happen till the ending and the ending wasn't bad.

		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock is Linda Quinn Hanson, and one day she gets news that her husband has died in an automobile accident while on a business trip, and the next day she wakes up to find him preparing breakfast for their children.Linda is confused, we are confused. This is not a movie told out of order, this is a movie about a woman who experiences days out of order. The title is a reference to the phenomenon where some people can have genuine premonitions of what might be happening.Peter Stormare, the actor from Sweden, who was so good as one of the kidnappers in "Fargo", plays the Psychiatrist who treats Linda.This is not one of the better movies of 2007, but it is interesting enough, especially because it requires the viewer to think hard to figure out what is going on.SPOILERS. As Linda has more premonition days, she figures out that her husband is planning to have an affair with his new co-worker. They even plan a meeting at a motel. But Linda's interactions, including making her husband realize that what he had in her and the kids was a good thing that he should not throw away, changes his mind . As she chases him, and comes upon the place where he supposedly died, she made him stop and turn around, as a way to avoid the accident. But his car stalls, he is killed anyway. She couldn't prevent his death, but she prevented his cheating. And, as the movie ends, she is pregnant with their third child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was actually a very good movie for the most part. We were entertained and very curious about what would happen next. I would give the movie an 8, but the ending.... The ending was horrible. It totally ruined the movie for us. By the end, we had forgotten that we were enjoying the rest of the movie. I am sure it was meant to be a shocker for the viewers, but it only proved to be a let down. When the Sandra Bullock character had been through so much, you just need for her to get a break. A more fitting ending - the very end - would have been for her to be committed again after what she had been through. And by the way... that is one thing about the earlier part of the movie I didn't get. They totally dropped the ball on the whole insanity issue. One minute everyone thought she needed help, the next no one seems to have an issue with her. I really never understood what changed (other than she went to sleep).I will just summarize like this... they should have re-thought the ending. It would have been so much better another way.</fullReview>

She really sucks you in by her emotions and actions in this movie.Julian McMahon (Cole from Charmed, love his smile) plays the husband, and at first I thought his acting was kind of shallow, but later he turned around and I noticed he was supposed to act shallow; all together his performance was pretty good as well.The end is NOT what I expected, however I could have expected it looking back ;-) Anyway, I am not telling!

		<shortDescription>not that bad- a little thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it, but they could have done more. My favourite movies are those where characters act realistically, and where there is good logic/sequence to the movie. This movie fails a little bit in both, IF she is actually able to travel back and forth through time in her mind. However, I have an explanation for that.To answer some questions and issues: Why does the mother ask what happened to Sandra Bullocks' daughter and have her taken away? The movie seems to suggest that Sandra Bullock caused the cuts on her daughter's face, but at the end of the movie I think, sensibly, the question was being asked because she was a little 'whacked', i.e., that she just could not remember what was happening and that she was undergoing some odd behaviour of late.Overall, I think that Bullock's character was committed because she had suffered a mental breakdown- the trauma of seeing her husband killed.My explanation of the entire timeline is that Bullock had indeed a strong premonition of her husband's death, that was recurring, perhaps not to the clarity that the movie was providing. However, the premonition was strong enough for her to act in the way that she had.The effect of her actions caused her to realize the love that existed between her husband bad herself, something that was only just rescued because of the premonitions she had. This was the goal of the ending, the whole speech about faith, blah blah blah.Following the scene where she saw his death, she underwent severe psychological trauma, that caused her to remember the timelines in a different way (i.e., by the end of the movie). The trauma caused by watching her husband die caused her to leave the scene of the crime and forget about what had happened, and then proceed through the next days.I was fine with the ending, based on my possible interpretation.I am fine with her being committed and that she was not in fact being accused of harming her daughter.I am fine with a lot of her actions (again, based on my interpretation, because as others have noted here, If I could go back and forth for real, I definitely would have done things differently to prevent my spouse's death).I am fine with the fact that she wasn't questioned in the accident (psycho trauma) and that the officer, then, has no idea that she had been a witness to it.In spite of all this, I can't stand the whole thing about the cuts in the daughter's face. She doesn't have them on Wednesday (or, perhaps, according to my possible view of the movie, her re-constructed memory does not have her daughter with scars). But the whole thing is just dumb. Why would the daughter run into the sliding door? What was she, stupid? Why would it break (these doors are not easy to break)? And it absolutely had no real value to the overall plot, except to freak us out and sidetrack us a little.The movie could have been more. Overall it wasn't bad. The scars thing was the biggest thing I couldn't get over. The alternate ending on the DVD was just plain stupid and was completely the opposite feeling that one achieves from the cinematic ending. While some people hated the ending, I got 'closure' from it.I do agree with another reviewer, though, that it would have been better for bullock to have died in the truck wreck - this would completely have changed my explanation of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world lately, where there are many movies that seem to be the same theme over and over and sadly, ones you can figure out, Premonition is a breath of fresh air! I can't believe people are giving it a bare 6 on the ratings! This movie had a wonderful cast, intriguing storyline and a haunting ending that stays with you for days. Please see it for yourself and don't listen to the obvious negativity by some that are apparently teenagers and/or need to be spoon fed a storyline. It is not an "out there" movie. Easy to understand and very enjoyable. Sandra Bullock plays a 30 something Mom and Wife to the ever charming and delightful Julian McMahon and 2 precious girls.It doesn't let you in their marriage too much and doesn't dwell on details but rather delves into the madness that is her "Premonition". This turns out a little confusing at first but all in all when it is done, it makes it all the better impact.The whole movie keeps you guessing until the end. While you can guess some things, the ending will satisfy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beginning and Middle is Good Despite Plot Holes - Ending is Weak - Kills the Movie Completely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many have commented, there are plot holes and inconsistencies between the seven different days of the week. Those things, are bothersome at times, but can be overlooked and the movie can be enjoyed as entertainment during the first 3/4. Any momentum, and power that the film has gathered up to this point comes to a screeching halt during the final 10 minutes.I mean she is the one who causes her husbands death. Any normal person would have seen mile market 220 and said, "Honey, get off the road now. Get out of the car and get as far from the road as possible." Well, Bullock decides to have her soon to be killed by oncoming traffic husband flip a u-turn at the summit of a hill where he can't see over to oncoming traffic, right at mile marker 220. How brilliant is that? There is this wonderful message through out the film about it never being too late to have faith, or fight for what is most important to you. I think it would have solidified that message much better had the ending been done differently.THIS IS WHAT I THINK SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED INSTEAD: Sandra, while following her husband on highway 57, is opening her heart to her husband. He replies assuring her he wants to make things better too. They are so happy, and you can feel the change happening. Sandra tells her husband that she's right behind him. He pulls over and they keep expressing their undying devotion to one another.Then Sandra realizes where they are. Mile marker 220, the spot where in her premonition, her husband was killed. She is panic stricken and fear overcomes her. Her husband senses the fear in the stillness of her voice over the phone. She urges him to move the car further from the road. It stalls and will not go further. She tells him to get out and get far away from it. He does this.Meahwhile, she exits her own vehicle and is standing off of the road. They see each other. She runs desperately to him. They embrace. She says something to the effect of, "I was so scared, I thought I was going to lose you." He holds her close and reassures her, "Everything is going to be OK. I love you." They kiss and embrace lovingly.The sweet moment is broken by the blaring of a truck horn as it passes safely by. They jump and are startled, but hold tight to each other. Sandra looks at the truck, knowing what could have happened had she not had the faith and hope to fight. They kiss again as the truck, and symbol of their trials shrinks in the distance and fades.THAT'S HOW I WOULD HAVE ENDED IT.It would have symbolized their faith and renewed hope conquering the oncoming destruction of their marriage, and happiness, not just the saving of their lives.I don't say this just because I dislike sad endings, believe me, some of my favorite films have depressing themes. But the theme of the entire movie is depressing.This movie had a theme of hope, and everything that was built on that them was destroyed in one single collision and explosion. I think it could have been done in a much more powerful way, not to mention with less plot holes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As others have already mentioned, this movie is logically inconsistent. The problem for Sandra Bullock is that she, like all actors and actresses, need to feel that they are "serious" actors, and so they will always try to get a dramatic lead role. Unfortunately, Bullock chose the wrong movie. She should either stick to more lighthearted roles, or choose a script that actually makes sense. I found this plot really confusing, and unfortunately so did the director. In one scene, the husband's body falls out of the coffin, and in another scene he gets incinerated in a collision with a gigantic 18 wheeler. These obvious inconsistencies should have been caught in the screen writing stage. One bright spot in this movie is Amber Valetta. Wow, this lady has screen presence and she is utterly gorgeous. It's not worth seeing the movie just for Amber, but she lights up the screen whenever she appears.</fullReview>

It have nice dark and gloomy atmosphere, interesting and involving story, and Sandra Bullock, playing her usual dark and moody character. It also has an ending that leaves you scratching your head.The plot of this movie is pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle, sort of like Jacob Ladder. Our main character, Linda is similar to the character in Jacob Ladder who have to sort through bits and pieces of his memories to find out what is happening to him. Unlike Jacob Ladder, where the viewers are able to find "closure" along with the main character at the end of the film, in Premonition, the viewers are left with just one word: "Huh?". In short, there is no ending to Premonition, the movie just ended and the audience is left out in the cold. I have a feeling the director can't come up with an ending so he is leaving it up to us to figure it out. Otherwise, Sandra Bullock did a good job playing a woman of quiet despair, The local is nondescript but functional, and the pacing of the story is bit on the slow side. Until the director comes up with an better ending this film will feels like it is unfinished.</fullReview>

We don't know enough about her or her marriage to feel real sympathy for her and her situation. Unlike the 2004 Japanese version of Premonition (Yogen) where the characters are well done, this new version is incomplete. In the end you really don't feel any triumph for the characters and we don't really understand why this happened to this particular woman; well it has religious overtones so maybe we're not suppose to. 6/10</fullReview>

But instead it was not that way. More than a thriller I would have considered it as a drama. Never boring, never exaggerating, never irrealistic or Hollywood like, which would have been the case if Jim would not have died at the end, but saved by her premonitions. Sandra Bullock is simply fantastic in this role. Actually the whole cast is perfect. A great movie that makes you think and that leaves you with something inside.

The situation puts the woman at serious risk, also.I cannot help but think this film is the victim of the notorious IMDb bias in favor of big budget action films, fantasy blockbusters and gross comedies.

She could have given more depth to her character. Perhaps a less talented actress would have been a better fit here. I thought her lines were on the "dry" side. Not her acting per se, but, the script and the direction. I also felt there could have been a greater air of mystery to the whole setup. There was a touch of supernatural, this affect could have been emphasized to a greater extent, or totally removed and a more natural mysterious feel to the whole movie be added. Sometimes it felt like the premonition angle was sort of forced, this I cannot explain, but, sort of in the way a sitcom that is not funny has to add its own soundtrack. Either way, I would not recommend renting this, wait for HBO to show it and Sandra, please think twice before your next script choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandra Bullock in Something a Little Less Romantic (Sort of)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some unknown reason, a woman finds that she wakes up on different days of the week in no particular order. With some of the days being after her husband's untimely death and some of them before, she tries to piece together what happened to stop it before it starts... uncovering an affair in the process.I watched this film with one and a half friends (the second friend walked in late). The second one doesn't really matter, because this is the kind of film you have to see all of to really judge. The first friend, my trusted horror aficionado Jason, didn't really care for it much (despite being the one who wished to see it, satisfying his desire for Sandra Bullock). I, however, really enjoyed it.I think there may have been a few continuity errors. I was really convinced they goofed up at least once on the issue of the daughter's scars. But I might be completely wrong. And also, by jumping days back and forth, but not living the same day twice at any point, where do the missing days go? (If I go to Saturday, then Friday and acting like I know about Saturday, then to Sunday... wouldn't I have acted differently on that Saturday? But I didn't live it twice, so it wouldn't make any sense. It would exist as a gap in my memory, presumably.) There was a good tone and pacing in this film. I wasn't a Sandra Bullock fan until "The Lake House", but now I think she's moving into films I can enjoy more. And here we have a man who is trying to have an affair, kids getting busted up, and the best scene in the movie -- an open casket for a car accident victim. This is no "While You Were Sleeping"! I think this attracted some horror fans (myself included), and there's not really a strong level of horror here. Sure, you have a dead bird and some eerie circumstances. But that's about it. Especially with the film being PG-13 (making the "sex scene" come across as more tame than it perhaps ought to have been).But yes, I liked it. Time travel films really appeal to me, and this one had something of that vein in it. It's no "Donnie Darko", but what is? If you want to see Sandra Bullock in something a little darker (yet, still romantic in a sense) this is the one for you. Hopefully we will see more of this later, as Bullock has contracted Meg Ryan Disease and it's bound to reach its peak soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Time Warp Thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Linda Hanson (Bullock) is told her husband, Jim, (McMahon) was killed in a car accident, but she finds him alive and well the next morning. Then, he's gone, then he's alive, then he's gone, then?????..I am wondering if Sandra Bullock purposely goes about looking for time-bending movies ? shades of The Lake House ? because here is number two in a row. Don't try to follow this, just enjoy it and gather the clues as Linda does because you never really know when she is in premonition mode or in real-time mode. And, consider this: are the clues really clues? I thought a premonition was when someone had an inkling that something would happen in the future. In Linda's case something has already happened or wait a minute: not happened yet, or is about to happen or not or??..you really have to watch this. Yes, I think the title is wrong, but everything will come full circle in the last scenes and then you will know or you should know what really happened and you may agree that the title is wrong. What would I have titled it: why Premonition, of course. I seem to be the only one complaining and what do I know? Besides Premonition can suck people in. But if I told you the title I really have in mind it would give too much away. See me after class.Seems like many of the characters have a lot of questions and we really don't hear them put Linda on the carpet and explain things as she knows them. Okay, that's a director's trick to keep you guessing. Hey, it worked.Despite my misgivings, this is a good movie, perhaps a little long and a little to slow in places, but because you never really know what mode Linda is in you stay with it and wait things out and hope for the best for her and her family.Good performances all around. Dialogue was halting in places per the director, but the cinematography and stunts were very good. Will we do the Time Warp again in her Number 3? Anyone have a premonition?Violence:Yes; Sex: Yes, but all in the dark and you see nothing; Nudity: No; Language, Yes, one F-Bomb uttered by -By God- Miss Sandra Bullock.</fullReview>

I was looking forward to watching this film, little did I know that I should have had a notebook and pen and begun to take notes from scene one...The film went sailing at a nice pace and I really was looking for a BIG twist in the end due to the "Tarrantino" cuts back and forward..but alas it wasn't there. I was left frustrated, not by the film , but by the fact that this film could have been sooo much more as the concept was excellent...some questions were left unanswered for me and to be honest I really have better things to do than watch this film again just to understand the many complexities..I gave the film a 4/10 only because I like Sandra...Although a smile would have been nice now and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this movie last night and I am a big Sondra Bullock fan and although the story was very confusing I thought that Sondra's performance was very good. With each movie she appears in she gets better and better. The story starts out with a normal family who lives are brought to a screeching halt as the wife, (Bullock) is told by a local police officer that her husband was killed in an auto wreck that happened yesterday but could not get hold of her to inform her. The next day she wakes up and her husband is lying next to her in bed. There is constant shifting with the husband being there and then not and the rest of the picture explains what has happened to this couple. I thought it was a little confusing but overall I liked the picture and thought the cast who I was not familiar with were excellent. Go see it for an entertaining 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sandra Bullock must be having some sort of intense interest in time travel at the moment seeing as her last two big movies were The Lake House and now Premonition. Maybe it's a midlife crisis thing. Who knows? Any who, Premonition is her newest flick where she lives the days of one very traumatic week out of order, and it (of course) really freaks her out. It takes until the middle of the movie to really understand what is going on, but by the end you don't even really need to finish watching the movie because it so obvious what's going to happen.The overall flow of the movie I thought worked really well. While there were of course lot's of things that didn't make much sense (a characteristic of almost ANY time traveling movie) there were also a lot of details, and really interesting plot elements that kept the audience interested and that were obviously planned very intricately by the writers and filmmakers. I can certainly say that I was never bored while watching this movie.While the supporting cast was most certainly lacking, I think Sandra was really good I totally bought her as the mom, and the crazy person. I tend to like her in almost anything. She's not very dynamic as an actress (at least I haven't seen her in any out of the mold roles) but I think she knows that so she stays in her comfort zone and that works for her.I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed with this movie; unrealistic movies just don't usually awe me much. Although I must say I like the out of chronological order kind of movie because I think they are a tribute to the power of movies. The ability to tell this kind of story in this way is a strictly unique ability of the cinema and that is why it continues to inspire the masses. *steps off the soapbox* It was a pretty silly movie overall, a lot of over dramatics and the ending was WAY too predictable. It takes the same turn as many other time travel movies out there. I prefer to see new things in my movies.Go ahead and see it. It was entertaining enough, not topping the "greatest movies of all times list" anytime soon but watch able nonetheless. I hope you are able to figure it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performance by Bullock and smart yet hard plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bullock was the only performer in the movie and she did a convincing and noticeable role, the other actors were fillers. The plot was good and somehow new, only if you interpreted the way I did. Not saying it is "the correct way", but it is the way that made sense to me. Thursday, the day she knew about her husband death and the following 2 days did not actually happened, they were premonitions she had consecutively before she woke up Monday and Tuesday mornings. The glass doors of the porch had stickers which she never put in reality, also the other events we mingled as in a dream or "premonition" (I never had one!). The events on Wednesday including her failed efforts to prevent her husband death, were because she somehow in her mind gave him a chance on the Sunday that already passed to redeem himself and she did forgive him. That was the only thing she was capable of changing which helped her to move on, however pregnant? How and whom aren't important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was NOT that bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has taken a lot of heat for having holes in the plot, and bad acting and honest I don't see it. The idea is that this mother of two girls lives a day where her husband dies in a car wreck, goes to bed and when she wakes up it is a few days before he dies. If you accept the fact that Linda is living her days out of order then the whole thing fits.The scene with the priest could have been better, and they could have done better with the other woman. And about the third out of sequence day it kind of got old guessing what was going on.But as a fan of classic movies I think it is refreshing when a movie ends in an unpopular if not surprising way, and like it or not the movie did have closure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie if you like messed up theories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It really plays with your mind without handing you a good explanation in the end. If you like time travel/psychic abilities you'll like this movie. You can walk away with your own interpretation but I strongly believe that with all the work the writers did they planned out these so called "inconsistencies" that are mentioned by others. What would you do if you knew someone you loved was going to die, you knew it so very strongly that you can't see any possibility of you being mistaken? Wouldn't you get to the point you'd feel crazy, probably act in such a way everyone would think you were?****====SPOILER====****By definition the word Premonition means a "warning in advance; forewarning" so therefore was she really time traveling or were her "future" days all dreams during the nights between her non future days. I have yet to re-watch the movie to test this theory but it puts my mind at ease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scraps of a neat idea turn into a laughably bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, there's a poster that has nothing to do with the movie.Anyways, this movie is about a woman whose husband dies and then when the next day arrives, he is alive again. What's going on? You can find out but it'd be best to have someone else explain it to you so you don't have to deal with this. What happens is a neat beginning for an idea...until it realizes that it needs to wrap everything up and by doing so it chooses a horrible ending that never explains itself leaving you to believe the idea could have been better if it was utilized by another movie.Sandra Bullock is not the right person for this movie. Through the whole movie, I couldn't believe anything she was doing but there is one caveat to her being in this, it makes the bad parts laughably funny. At one point, she's outside hanging up laundry to dry on what seems to be a cold fall day when she slips and her hand gushes up against a dead bird on the lawn. It's pretty funny to see. There's also really obvious virtual glass that appears twice in the movie when a door breaks.If you're renting this for a serious mystery movie, you're going to be really let down. Try it on as a laughably bad movie and it'll at least make the movie a bit more tolerable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are we looking for a well-made plot or are we looking for ideas?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one comes to this movie (or any other movie) focused upon the plot, he or she is doomed to disappointment. All tragedies end badly, all comedies end better, some tragicomedies mix the two. However, some movies are more interested in ideas. In The Lake House, Sandra Bullock's character finally understands what has happened in her past and manages to change her beloved's present, enabling them to have a future. In Premonition, her character wrestles with a moral dilemma: if one knows the future and in that future the person one loves does something that betrays the "meaning" of the life they have had together, is one required to try to save them or can one let the future take its course? Bullock's character Linda Hansen wrestles with this dilemma, finally going to see a priest. After confessing that she no longer believes in God, she is told that she must have faith in something in order to act at all and warned that sometimes trying to change the future based upon a vision of the future can be destructive. In the end, she tries and, in trying, brings about the thing she fears. In the process, however, her character has changed her husband enough so that he dies not on the way to an assignation but to a return to his family. If one worries about whether one dies well or badly (as most people in the west did until recently), she has done well; if one worries simply about the present, she has not. If the question is whether it is better to be a live adulterer or a person who dies after calling off a yet-uncommitted act and reaffirms his love for his family, the movie tends to raise a very different set of issues than why couldn't the wife stop the future from happening. Linda Hansen fails to change the future in terms of the life or death of her husband, but her actions mean something to all of the characters involved in this story about whether our acts have meaning or are simply the result and the cause of accidents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I completely agree with some other comments I've seen about how this movie was not close to as bad as how the critics made it seem. No it is not a action, or comedy movie. It's a psychological suspense thriller. So as far as not being exciting... I was excited throughout the whole movie. I felt as if I myself was an investigator trying to figure it out. Also, premonitions are not all supposed to make sense. They usually don't all fit in the real life. The critics did mention that there were scenes that didn't add up, well I just felt that premonitions don't always add up. Very suspenseful, I do recommend to others. Sandra Bullock is great at whatever role she plays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>reading these reviews, i'm learning more about the people posting than the movie. this is one of those movies that lets you project your own issues onto it. some people think it's about not being able to change fate, some people think it's about how strong women can be. Those who don't like the disjointed quality are looking for things given to them a little more clearly (oliver stone fans?) the title really does say it all. my theory is that anything that happens out of time is happening in her dreams, her imagination. they are not the real events that happen that day, but premonitions about them based on current knowledge. that's why they commit her because she doesn't know what happened to her daughter's face. those funeral and commitment scenes were premonitions, she knew what her daughter's face was going to look like, but since it hadn't happened she didn't know how it would happen. by the time the accident and funeral and everything does come, she's more prepared for it. just a theory. anyway it was a freaky movie, and i'm not sure there's one interpretation or story line that's really true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i saw this movie, I had read a few of negative reviews but I like to make up my own mind and Sandra Bullock is one of my favourite actresses so i gave it a go.I'm so glad i decided to see this movie because I really do love it. I will admit that at first, the story is a little hard to follow because the days are out of sync but as Sandra's character began to get a handle on what was going on, so did I. Basically, Sandra's character will experience something on a Thursday and then she'll wake up and its the previous Monday and then the next day is the following Saturday. So, you don't know whether she had a premonition or if her character is losing her mind. Telling the story in this way really involves you in the plot as it unfolds. The days of the week play out as normal but for her character, they are non-sequential so she has to make sense of her situation as best she can.Personally, I love this movie. I love to see Sandra in a dramatic role and in 'Premonition' she really does deliver. It's thought provoking, suspenseful and the plot is original. Sandra is brilliant as always and portrays her character in a believable and endearing way. The rest of the cast do well with their roles also.Forget the negative reviews and make up your own mind because this movie is worth it if you don't mind actually having to think about whats going on as you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing reviews, I was a little wary of this movie, but decided to go based on my love of Sandra Bullock. I thought Premonition was a fantastic thriller, though I'm not usually a fan of scary movies. The characters are portrayed with extreme realism, and both Sandra and Julian bring a lot to their roles. I was slightly unhappy with the very end, but as far as wrapping up the film goes it did a good job. I was on the edge of my seat (bawling for the most part) during the entirety of this film, and to me, a movie bringing that kind of emotion out means it is a good one. It may not be the feel good movie of the year, but if you're looking for something scary, thrilling, or even one about relationships, I believe this is a must see.As an added bonus, the children in this movie are great as well. Too often kids are used as the comic relief, make everything just plain sappy, or seem to only have gotten the part due to some relation to an actor in the film, but these kids prove their merit as actors. They're in it just enough to make the family relationships apparent, without overtaking the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my wife and I walked out of the movie, we both agreed that the film was bad. We then spent the next couple hours discussing it and realized it really wasn't that bad. But, it was confusing.One day the husband is there, the next he isn't. Characters come in out of sequence. What's going on. How does one make sense of this.Then it hit me: the title says it all ... premonition.My take (I of course could be wrong) is that the wife (who, after reading another review I got this idea) may be depressed, thus her reason for sleeping late every morning while her children are trying to get themselves ready for school, is having some pretty strange dreams. In each case, her husband is dead. Is she subconsciously wishing her husband? Perhaps. But the death is first revealed with the knock on the door, and then we see the funeral and other events about the death. But every other morning, she wakes up and her husband is there! What gives? Her dreams are her premonitions ... she's having a premonition that her husband is dead which ultimately leads to the fulfillment of that very premonition at the very spot she dreamt it would occur.I like films that make you think ... this one does and I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see 'Premonition' with one thought. I don't trust Sandra Bullock to make a good film. She has been in a lot of turkeys. She doesn't seem to know a good script from a bad one. In the case of this film, her performance was quite good - better than some of her frothier annoying comedies (wouldn't be hard) Anyway, I thought this film was an adequate thriller but with a few ridiculous assumptions. Eh, why was everyone trying to stop Bullock from seeing her dead husband in the casket ? Why did her days become jumbled up ? Was Dr Roth good or bad ? I dunno. When the closing credits went up I felt that I hadn't been fully entertained. Sure, there were some good moments, especially the closing crash scene but overall, I would have preferred a proper horror film with some special effects instead. Bullock should try and get herself into a Japanese horror remake. It might give her career a bigger boost than this middle-of-the-roader.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand the hassle some people have about this film. It starts out a little slowly, granted, however overall the pacing is very good, as it develops tension throughout. The characters are very nice and Greek, part of a Greek Tragedy, that is. The father is a tragic king, larger than life. The mother is an imperfect hero. The children are clearly "princesses". Why most people don't get it is beyond me.The flaws are obvious. The character doesn't seem to put any 2 + 2 together until about half way through the movie. At the end, both characters are oblivious of their fates. Nevertheless, the logic of fate controlling the actions of the characters, despite the premonitions is highly compelling if you have an open mind.</fullReview>

Massive plot holes- would they really commit someone after three days when they haven't been in therapy/shown suicidal tendencies? I can buy the ending. But the rest? I know, I know, it's a fatalist movie (what will happen is unavoidable) but if you knew that the day after your wore a denim shirt and went to bed with a glass of red wine, your husband would die, you would chuck that shirt on and jump into bed with the bottle? Idon't think so. Bullock does put up a fair performance of a terrible script. But this movie leaves you wanted to scream at the main character to do something! You know what is going to happen so have a go at doing something about it, don't go about fulfilling every prophecy! 2/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*************CONTAINS SPOILERS************** I watched this movie having a vague idea of the plot and some high expectations, as a friend had raved about it to me. I was thoroughly impressed when the film extended even beyond those standards, having affected me to the point where I was a blubbering mess on the couch, reaching for the phone to call my other half and tell him to drive home safely from work. It is a very rare occurrence that a movie has such an impact on me; I find that most films which involve a love story are too cheesy for my liking. Take that as a high recommendation to watch 'Premonition'! The story begins with Linda (Bullock) finding out that her estranging husband, Jim (Julian McMahon), has been in killed in a car accident. After a horrific day, she wakes the following morning to find her life playing out as if the previous day had never occurred - her husband is fine. At first she assumes it was just a nightmare, but the following day when she wakes up, she finds that her nightmare reality has taken over again and her husband is gone once more.Linda comes to the realisation that her experience is much more than a dream, and as she continues to wake up to different days, in which Jim is alive, then dead and so forth, it becomes apparent that the alternate reality of Jim being dead is a premonition of what will become her only reality, unless she can prevent his accident.Eventually Linda begins to piece together the days, by order of the chilling occurrences that she and her family are faced with, in conjunction with Jim's death. She figures out that Jim will die on the Wednesday, on a road between home and his "business trip" destination. Unfortunately, by the time she has figured this out, Linda has also discovered that Jim is planning to cheat on her with a colleague before he dies. She endures a period of anger and false nonchalance, in which she convinces herself that perhaps Jim's impending death is with reason and that they might just be better off. At this point, she decides not to stand between Jim and his fate.However, in a moment of desperation, she coerces her husband into a confrontation, where she tells him that she misses him and wants their relationship to be what it once was, before they had children. The couple make love (for probably the first time in months) and Linda makes Jim promise to wake her before he leaves for his trip in the morning.When Linda awakens the next day, Jim has taken the girls to school and left for his "interview" (and a hotel room he is to be sharing with the colleague he intends to begin an affair with). Linda jumps in the car and speeds off in an attempt to reach the spot where she foresaw Jim's accident and save his life.In the meantime, Jim is on the phone to Claire (his potential mistress), telling her that he won't be coming; he has had an epiphany and wants to make his marriage with Linda work. As he's leaving a message on the home answering machine (the one that Linda hears in the beginning of the movie, saying that he loves her and wants to try again) Linda calls him and tells him the same. The couple exchange a few "I love you"s and Linda catches up to him on the road. She tells Jim that she's behind him and to pull over. He does, but then she sees that his car is right next to the sign from her vision, so she tells him to turn around and come further back down the road. As he's turning around, a car swerves around him from behind, narrowly missing him. Linda, relieved that he has averted the accident that was meant to kill him, jumps out of her car and begins to run to his. At that moment, a giant petrol tanker looses control on the road. Jim can't turn his car back on, or get out in time; the truck collects his car, crushing it and dragging it several metres.It is then that Linda sees the full truth of her premonition: what she saw was what would happen WITH her attempts to avoid it. Telling Jim to turn his car around actually causes his death. The petrol tanker and Jim's car explode.Closing scene: we see Linda wake up yet again; this time it's about 5 months after Jim's death and she is visibly pregnant. She recalls what a priest said to her right before Jim died, when she was trying to figure out what to do. From this recollection, she is filled with a knowledge that Jim's death was never meant to be prevented - nor was it able to be. She was simply meant to help both of them recognise that their life together was abundant with love and potential happiness, that they just needed to find it again. Linda sees that although she could change their feelings towards each other for the better, no one has the power to change a person's ultimate fate. She finally sees that, despite the loss of Jim, it was better that he died when their love was rekindling, than if he had died in the midst of planning an affair, with Linda knowing of his intentions and feeling bitter about them. Linda looks at her daughters and is grateful, for her life is truly blessed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh ye of little faith, go back to church, is the message of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was clearly written to try to scare people into going back to the Catholic church, which is losing its congregations in the light of spiritual evolution and Catholics outgrowing their need for priests, confession, and all the hell and purgatory they promise to those who don't follow their religion. If you still need church, by all means, enjoy the lessons in the movie. Otherwise the movie will leave you flat and is a waste of time, unless you just happen to like Sandra Bullock in whatever movie she stars in. I was really disappointed that Ms Bullock would star in a movie designed to tell people they need to go back to church so they can have faith, hope and love in their lives. I have all three and I'm very happy without the old-school religions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Premonition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film, it sounded like it was sort of borrowing the same concept from Final Destination, but when it came to actually watching it, that wasn't completely the case. Basically Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) has moved into a new house in the suburbs with husband Jim (Fantastic Four's Julian McMahon) and their two daughters. On a Thursday morning, Linda wakes up and takes her daughters to school as usual, and receives an odd phone message from Jim, and a few minutes later, a police officer knocks on the door to tell her he is dead. Over the next few days and nights, Linda wakes with Jim alive or dead, and she later realises that her week is playing out in random order. She writes the order of all events to happen so that she can piece together when Jim is happen to die for real. She finds out however why certain things will happen, and one of them sees that Jim was going to cheat on her with his secretary Claire (Amber Valletta). So there is a point where she questions whether Jim should live, but she realises she can't let her children lose their father, and he did stop himself going ahead with it. So the day he is meant to die comes along, and he goes to save him, but just after forgiving him and stuff, it is too late, and he is blown up by a truck, so in the end nothing could be done. Also starring Big Momma's House's Nia Long as Annie, The Prince of Tides' Kate Nelligan as Joanne and Minority Report's Peter Stormare as Dr. Norman Roth. Bullock seems to be playing her role with hardly any real passion, the pacing is all over the place, and the silly little scares don't create any tension at all. But the biggest reason to give this film such a low rating is because it's too complicated while trying to be clever, the mixing days thing just confused me too much, a dreadful supernatural thriller. Poor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie. Had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. It's very cleverly written and well though out. Everything made sense. However, they snuck something quite scary in there. Something very traumatizing if it were to be seen in real life. This particular scary scene lasted a couple seconds, but still.. It was intense! Nonetheless, this film was touching and relatable. The movie itself has a sad, tragic feel to it. If you liked "The Butterfly Effect", you'll love this movie. Don't get me wrong, these two movies are completely original and unique. They do however, share the same theme. Thus, making them comparable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a bad feeling about this going into the second act. For me the premonition made sense, which was that the movie would have a bummer ending. If that was the only thing wrong, I'd have rated it higher. Yes the acting was good, and I cared about Sandra's character, but her passivity and the time sense jumble that did not pay off made it seem like a waste of time. Have we seen time travel movies that end up with the same thing happening the protagonist is trying to avoid, if in a different way? Plenty of times, so this was not a brilliant plot point. And the faith stuff thrown in at the end - yeah, it felt thrown in. When you have been manipulated through a movie that ends like this, I sometimes wonder if the director is not out there giving me the finger. Yuch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This should be rated higher, frankly. Sandra Bullock delivers an honest performance. The story is quite gripping and Bullock's execution of her character is insightful and intelligent with a beautiful heart.The choices she faces are unique, but I think nearly all women can identify with her character on some level, which renders this film a near must-see for any woman in love.I won't spoil the movie as many have, so this review will not contain any details of the plot. I WILL say, however, that it has been compared to the Butterfly Effect, although I enjoyed this far more. The story is enigmatic and compelling throughout, which is more than previous reviewers led me to expect.All in all? I like it. I own it, and have watched it several times to catch some of the finer details one inevitably misses on the first viewing. This film is a great Friday/Saturday night's viewing, although some insecure men may be made uncomfortable by it.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit when I saw the commercials for this movie before release, I expected some kind of psychological horror movie. Don't get me wrong, I love those too. It's why I looked twice. But, after I bought it and watched it, I'm still bawling my eyes out. This has got to be the greatest tear jerker of all time. I'm still crying. No movie has ever yanked these kinds of emotions from me before now. I like to think my books will do that but this is the greatest tear jerker movie I have ever watched. It ranks up there with Casablanca, Awakening (Robin Williams) and Old yeller. I don't know if that was the intention, and the terror factor was very real. I expected everything from someone trying to make her think she's crazy to actually trying to put her away but I never expected to bawl my eyes out the way I did. I'm still crying and typing takes some concentration but I hope Ms. Bullock knows that her performance in this movie moved me. I'm glad I bought it. And I shall probably cry every time I watch it. It is excellent. Grief is no stranger to any of us and she portrayed not only her investigation but her emotions as well in a realistic manner that anyone of us can relate to. I applaud her and all the fine people on that movie. Now, if I can stop shedding tears, I will get back to my next book. Thank you.Patricia Oshier Bruening</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PREMONITION, in my opinion, is one of the most spellbinding, touching, and edge-of-your-seat thrillers I have ever seen. When I saw all the cuts and whatnot on Bridgette's (Courtney Taylor Burness) face at one point, particularly after crashing into the sliding glass door, I got a really uneasy feeling in my stomach. If you ask me, it was really weird how Jim (Julian McMahon) could be alive one day and dead the next. Every time I watch this movie, I ask myself how that could be possible. All in all, this was a really great movie with superior performances, lush production design, and excellent costume design. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to all you Sandra Bullock fans who haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think PREMONITION is an awesome movie; in fact it's a bit predictable and has nothing really new to this genre of supernatural/fantasy drama. However, it has a strong message of faith and inner strength that is the most valuable feature of the movie.The plot tries to be a little mysterious and confusing at the beginning, but soon the viewer will begin to understand what's going on and disclosure its ending. It's really predictable. Yet it's not bad, I must say! This film not being great is not bad either; it's kind of average, fits in the middle. I just think there are some answers that should have been given (and they were not?) and some "untied" scenes near the end? Nevertheless, its message about faith and devotion to something that gives you the strength to carry on remember us that if we can't change the past we can always change the future!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premonition was really good and interesting - until the end. The actors did a great job, the cinematography was beautiful, and the editing was really good. The storyline, however, could use a little work. I have done almost nothing but analyze the plot over the last few days, and it simply does not make any sense. I hate to give away the ending, but what is the point of having a premonition if you cannot change things? By having these premonitions, the premonitions came true. Somewhat of a Catch-22, which did not make a lot of sense. If Keanu Reeves can end up living in The Lake House, then the husband should be able to live in Premonition. Granted, certain things are going to happen regardless, but if it were not for these "premonitions," if you can really call them that, the story would not have ended in the same way. It was not logical, and everyone that I have spoken to that has also seen this film feels the same way. I do not exactly recommend the movie, but I would say to watch it to judge for yourself, especially if there is nothing else on at the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bullock's husband cheats on her? What an absurd idea...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't bother reading this comment. It cannot in any way compete with IMDb's glorious synopsis. Someone actually bothered to map out the unmappable "logic" of this maze-like movie, day by day, trying to make heads and tails of an average week in the life of Sandra Bullock and her dead/undead husband. Talk about optimism bordering on untreatable insanity. Read it and laugh, or weep.Sandra could have used some premonition herself, given what has happened to her in recent days. "Premonition" - very "premonitially" - was supposed to serve as a dire premonition to Bullock of a laughable, destined-to-fail marriage about to crumble. But when you're so daft as to actually believe that a white-trash tattooed biker who was once married to a porn star would make ideal husband material, then you shouldn't cry about it when you get burnt. Talk about the grandomania/egomania/narcissism of a grade-A Tinseltown thespian who had convinced herself that she is such an amazing catch, such a goddess of womanhood, such an irresistible slice of rare perfection, that even an alpha-male bad-boy womanizer who had more partners than a Bombay hooker would drop all his Sunset Boulevard lady friends in order to channel all his sexual attention on the Divine One, the Mistress of Formulaic Comedy and Bad Movies, the Sandra, the Mother of all Sandras, the Bullock Woman, now a proud owner of the most overrated statuette in the history of garbage awards.I had always said that Bullock cannot make a good movie if she lived to be as old as Yoda, or Bob Hope (whichever comes first). While "Premonition" - of all the filmic debris she had ever done - did come closest to being a good movie, it ultimately also managed to fail: this time in the final meters. The ending is asinine: it suggests that the voice Bullock heard on the answering machine on the first day of her acid-trip-like fortnight(?) was that of her husband being called from a cell-phone by none other than her future self. But this "Twilight Zone"-like cliché was nothing compared to the abysmal implication that Bullock indirectly helped kill her own husband by trying to save him. I can see this working in some bizarre slapstick fantasy, but in a movie that tries hard to build on mystery, suspense, and supernatural drama, it just comes off as silly.The moral of the story: "do not try to save anyone's life, because, honestly, you'll just make things worse." Another unintentionally funny, hence utterly unnecessary, scene was when her husband's head rolled out of the coffin: that's more slapstick right there. Bullock delivers the dumbest line I've heard in a while when she tells her husband: "If tomorrow is Wednesday, don't..." It's stupid to a fault. If tomorrow is Wednesday. Hilarious, almost Edwoodesque.Casting Peter Stormare, looking more serial-killerish than ever before, as a psychiatrist, was a rather idiotic touch, too. I mean, I get it, he's supposed to look/seem menacing, but let's have a bit more realism, people.The very last scene has a pregnant Bullock rising out of her bed. So she's about to have a third child with her dead husband. And? What do we care if she does? How is this possibly relevant in any way to the previous 100 minutes? All that it tells us is that they had sex on that Sunday. Big deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but not bad either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot was confusing to me at first, because I looked at it as a time travel story. I think a lot of people did not like it because they also thought of it as a time travel story, and the plot doesn't make sense -- it didn't to me at first either.-- spoiler --But after I realize what it really is -- hint: the title... PREMONITION -- I realized I got it all wrong, and now it makes sense. She's using her premonition -- what she sees in her future, to piece together all the information. For example, she sees the pills in her premonition of Saturday, where she was "committed" so in her real Tuesday, she visits the psychiatrist (who doesn't know her yet) to find out what's going on, so she can PREVENT the future she sees from happening. Saturday (or Thursday or Friday) never did happen the way she saw it.Once you realize the difference between time travel (that Saturday actually happened) vs. premonition (it's the future she SEES), you will understand how it all makes sense. Now, it doesn't mean the film is perfect. There are still enough consistency to confuse the audience. I think that's the problem with the filmmakers -- they didn't make it clear enough, so the plot gets a bit convoluted. I've heard there was a different ending, but they shot a new one for the release, and that may explain why some of the pieces don't quite fit.As for the ending, I think it's fine. I expected something different but then I realized it was just my wishful thinking because of the direction the story took, but in hindsight, I think the filmmaker made a good choice of not giving in to a happy ending. However, I could also see that they could have gone a darker route (and they hinted at that). Perhaps that's the alternate ending everyone was talking about. But as is, I find the ending interesting, even though I didn't expect it. And it's not too sappy to make me barf.To me, this mystery is sort of a philosophical meditation: What if you can change your life, even if you can't change the devastating event that happens? What are the most important things in your life? I think given the themes of the story, the ending is fitting.</fullReview>

I, as someone else mentioned, also noticed the scars not being on her daughter's face the first day she found out her husband died. That point drove me insane.

		<fullReview>Soon after the movie begins and Bullock is informed of her husband's death in an auto accident, what does she do, or not do? She doesn't ask to see the body, the place of the accident, or any verification that the reporting officer had indeed correctly and conclusively identified her husband. She didn't ask where the body was, didn't respond as though she was interested or emotionally hurt by the event. That set the tone of unbelievability and disinterest for the rest of the convoluted and hole-filled script.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: On the other hand, I disagree with many who hate the ending, which I Thought was perhaps the most imaginative and appropriate conclusion as opposed to the typical tacked-on upbeat resolution meant to provide a Hollywood happy ending after serving up almost two hours of downbeat drama.All in all, a disappointment. Not recommended, but not a total waste either.There have been many more successful movies dealing with time warp drama. If you want a much better movie in this genre, please sample the 2006 movie "Stay" (Ryan Gossling, Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor).</fullReview>

I understand when she got pregnant but didn't get what that had to do with anything. I still thought I was great though. It gets a tad confusing and if you miss anything you will be lost. I still think that as predictable as it would be if he were to have decided not to go on the trip and stay with his family instead it would have been better, but like I said all in all it was great. Don't expect it to be something it's not and you will enjoy it. For anyone who has ever had the feeling that something bad is about to happen and then it does - this is a film you will want to see.Sandra Bullock however, was gorgeous and as awesome as ever. The whole film is worth seeing because of her. I give the movie and overall A- but I give her an A+ - that girl has chops - it's too bad the academy is blind. She's great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I know every one is verbally accosting this film due to it's, for lack of a better word, confusing final scene. I mean, come on..... Sandra Bullock has proved once again that she is getting better with age and this movie is a perfect example of that. There were quite a few holes in the plot, actually more than a peg board. However, it was entertaining to watch her fanatically put various pieces together which ended up resulting in the inevitable. I do have to add that it was refreshing to watch Julian McMahon play a role that didn't involve him with a scalpel or wearing a metal mask because of some galactic storm. The movie definitely kept your attention throughout, but left us asking ourselves "DID I MISS SOMETHING HERE?" Over all, a mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help with some troublesome topics?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the movie Premonition to be extremely well done and very well written. Is contained a lot of information, and required much thinking, but overall a great movie. There are a lot of parts in the movie that are hard to comprehend at first, and I find that most people find this movie not so entertaining because they don't like to think about it. One main part of the movie that people have trouble with is How is it possible for the police officer to come to her house and tell her about her husband..when she watched him die? That's a very easy question to answer. Because she had all of the facts in the future..she know what was coming..and how his death was coming. She was the one who tried to prevent the incident, and in the end..she caused it..making the story/future change. The police officer didn't need to come anymore because of what we know. It's a hard movie to understand, but once you think about it, then it should come fairly easy. If you don't enjoy movies that inquire thinking, then this is definitely not the movie for you. Great performance played by many of the actors, and an overall sad theme. I found the ending good because it's based off of an old saying. Once someone dies, another is born. She is having his kid, which sort of makes up for his loss. I hope this can be assistance to you, if you have any questions please let me know. I will help the best way I know how.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Mom and I had seen the preview and, being the Sandra Bullock fans we are, decided to go see it. It starts out simply; she goes through her day (with a peek into the future) and loses her husband. Yet when she wakes up, he's alive. This pattern continues (with a Kate and Leopold bell leading the way) as Bullock's character pieces together the days by seeing the effect before the cause. Time runs out and the day of her husband's death arrives giving her the opportunity to use her premonition gift to fight for her beliefs. I loved the ending because it summarized the words of wisdom she had been given. Overall, if you're looking for a great thriller, a recent Sandra Bullock, or a film that presents the idea of "living life like there's no tomorrow" in a classy way, watch Premonition!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There aren't really any plot holes in this movie, which is HUGELY rare, it's just complicated, so if ur an idiot, you won't get it. The acting was great, so those who said it wasn't just were mad cuz they didn't get the intricacies of the movie. I don't usually like movies with no action, but this was well done enuff to win me over. People say they don't like the ending, but the ending is what made the whole movie, it wouldn't have made much sense with a different ending, again, you have to be above a certain intelligence line, however low that line is, to see it, altho admittedly, to get the end, the line is a little higher, say, a bit above trainable retarded. The most impressive thing about this movie, and what took it from an 8 to a 10 for me is the incredible difficulty in not only making a movie with non-linear time flow and/or time travel which stands to logic and science, but one that's actually plausible, that's right, i said PLAUSIBLE. I totally did not see that coming. Forget the bad reviews, no movie that works outside of linear time/space is ever plausible. That was the clincher on an excellent movie.</fullReview>

But with this movie, no happy events at all.many complained that a lot of questions remain unanswered, well sure there are unanswered questions, but why complaining? The most thing that got my attention (at least did not make sense to me at all), is that Sunday night, when she was out in the backyard, while she did not really try to do anything to prevent her husbands accident, why she did not try to put the stickers on the glass door to prevent her daughters accident? the movie is not bad at all. A car accident can happen to any family, and the loss of the father can happen to any family. Here is just a try to make a twist of the story so it becomes more interesting. The only thing that will remain with me after seeing this movie, is how hard it can be to lose one of the parents in a family with little kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw it I thought it was gonna be another regular thriller. But after I saw it, I found it was really a beautiful and touching movie, with sadness and tears. When the movie moved on you became to feel more and more sad and even a bit depressed. But when the end of the movie came up you finally found what was going on, and all left for you was to be touched with the tears. Go to see it if you miss someone deeply and to cry a bit to express your depression of missing out. Then you will feel way much better I think. The music in the movie was really quite good, they always appeared at the right time to touch the most sensitive part of your heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophy of Premonition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, sometimes it is great that being educated in philosophy helps. Not only to see the logical errors and holes in a script but also getting the whole picture.When the whole picture is considered, this film is a very good one. Do not care about the script errors and holes. Think about the whole picture. THe whole picture is a philosophy f time. If you go to past. If you still have time to change things you can change some of them isn't it great. This is a philosophy when regarding Hollywood and America at first sight is a great philosophy to make a film over. The case is we are willingly forgetting that we going to die. It is the terror of our own death. We do remember our own death when we see someone die. Or someone we love dies. Because of this very reason I stated above. Go watch this movie. What it helps. It first of all makes you remember that, your husband or wife (I do not have any luckily) can die any moment. What does that mean ? Why this movie ? This movie because in this very forgetfulness a movie which is both visual and also someone trying to change her life, which really is boring for her and unfaithful, without hope. We do sometimes feel so. How can we escape from this boringness and unfaithfulness, moreover how can we change it ? Is t not the case that a lot of movies tell us to do so. To change a life. Urgent need. They are like some viewed soft philosophy books. For that reason go watch his movie. And remember me and also the need you have to do something about your life. It is never too late.</fullReview>

I also liked this movie because it wasn't too Scary, or to Gory! IT had an Awesome Cast and a good setting. The only down side is, some might not be happy with the Ending, even though i liked it because of how different it was from other movies!

		<fullReview>The main problem i have with this movie is this: since bullock witnessed the accident why the heck does the movie start with a cop notifying that her husband died in a car accident?????? after she witnessed the accident i doubt that the next day a cop came and told her "we had trouble reaching you earlier, you husband died yesterday." i think it's a major plot flaw to start the "mystery" of the death and what did or didn't happen. Another problem i have is that it seems to be a "lesson" about faith and religion and it's sad that when she renews her belief, she loses that which motivated her to get it back. I realize that is how life is, but gee, we go to the movies to escape harsh reality, don't we?</fullReview>

At 1 hour 38 minutes there's no time wasted, and the pacing of the story is perfect.The adult theme (meaning persons 12 or older) taken together with the mainstream American values (including --- ohmygawd -- religion) might explain why a SANDRA BULLOCK movie is an independent production which got only a quick pass-through at our junk-infested multiplexes.

		<shortDescription>There are no premonitions...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the end, I was disappointed, like many others... until I found another way to understand what happened.I don't agree the theories which say that only some days are real and others are premonitions. All these theories say that premonitions begin at Sunday evening when she goes to sleep. So How could she talk to the priest about premonitions a few hours sooner ? When she talks to the priest, premonitions haven't begun.So I think that the only real day is at the end, when she's pregnant. She tried to relive these days in her imagination, or in her dreams, she tried to find a sense about her husband's death, she feels guilty and dreamed (or imagined) she was there and failed to save her husband's life.Some facts look like what happens in dreams. Dead bird, the face of her daughter, scared or not, coffin which falls, letting the head roll, doctor and mother who lead her trapped like if she was dangerous, and seriously ill.Something happens in all these imagined or dreamed scenes : she talk with a man about a quiet place to restart her life.We'll never know what really happened when her husband died, and what happened before and after. We only see how she thinks about these days. He probably had an affair with another woman and she probably wanted to get a new life. So we know that she's trying to understand, and how she tries. We see all the facts through the way she wants to know the truth, and tries to hide the truth in the same time.We understand that their relationship was almost dead. And now she feels free, and guilty (she wants to believe the tried to save her husband). So all the days we saw are her imagination, or her dream, melting real facts with others.The very last scene doesn't happen a few months later. Scaries on her daughter's face are still here, so it only could happen two or three weeks later. And she's pregnant, and we can see it. As we can see that, two or three weeks sooner, she didn't appear as pregnant.So I think that the only real moment is the very last scene, all the other scenes are the way her mind tries to relive what happened before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated by critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie which, along with "The Reaping" and "Perfect Stranger" has been underrated by the critics, in my opinion. Others will tell you that this is a movie about a suburban housewife, played by Sandra Bullock, who lives in a time warp or a personal psychosis in which she does not live her days consecutively. I will tell you that this movie comes close to being a horror movie or rather, straddles the border between horror and sci-fi. The movie starts out with Linda's storybook wedding, and the couple purchasing a very nice older house. Then we have some routine scenes in which Linda fixes breakfast for and takes her two children to school, showers, and jogs. These mundane scenes serve to heighten the tension by filling in daily aspects of Linda's life.The ending car accident, done with typical if horrifying Hollywood flourishes, reminded me of Kurt Russell's "Breakdown." One of Linda's angelic children crashes through a plate glass window causing her to have ugly though temporary scars on her face. The bearded psychiatrist is sometimes an intimidating character, particularly when he applies a sedative with a needle to Linda's arm. There is a somewhat intimidating cop who brings Linda the tragic news of her husband's death, and he appears later in a routine traffic stop. Even Linda's mother is intimidating and I found myself wondering at one point if she might be part of some plot against Linda. There are lugubrious funeral arrangements and a frightening scene in which the body falls out of the coffin when Linda demands to see it,a sorrowful funeral,and what comes very close to being an extramarital affair between Linda's husband Jim and a coworker. In real time, Linda and Jim seem to have a fairly idyllic marriage. As in "The Reaping," there is a priest who has a significant, if minor, role, urging Linda in a touching scene to find "something outside yourself" to live for, telling her each day can be a miracle, and giving some historical examples of people who could see into the future. Linda has been thrown into a tragic situation that would justifiably drive many people crazy and the audience are participants in her insane ride. Linda consults friends to try to figure the whole thing out--why she wakes up one morning and her husband is dead, and the next morning he is there. Finally she figures out what is happening to her and decides to make a calendar of events, something some people would perhaps be too disoriented to do. This calendar enables her and us to see more clearly what has occurred. The ending is admittedly a little weak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I didn't really know what to expect from this movie initially, since I haven't seen Sandra Bullock or Julian McMahon in thriller movies usually. However, since I am a fan of both actors, I decided to give it a shot and was very pleasantly surprised. The plot, even though it has been done before, was surprising in the sense that, it keeps you guessing in the way that the final destination series never did. I was fidgeting all the way through, trying to figure out what was coming next. The performance of both actors is spectacular. I was excited to see how well sandra and julian portrayed their characters. Towards the middle of the movie I got a teensy bit bored but then the movie picks up and keeps you on tenterhooks. I'm not even going to comment on the ending, since I enjoyed it very much. All in all, it is an excellent movie and you should go see it asap!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More melodrama than time travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever felt so certain a relationship was going to screw up that you went and did things that would have ended it anyway?Sandra Bullock does comedy so well, but I like to see her take a dramatic challenge without falling back on that quirky smile. Premonition, a story of a woman grieving for her husband before he's dead, provides that opportunity. When the sheriff says her husband's died in a car accident, we are glued to the screen, waiting to see how she handles it. Then explain it to her two small children. The melodrama is handled well. Bullock rises to the challenge. The camera gives her all the time she needs. An unobtrusive score underlines, rather than dictates, our empathy.Other aspects of the film are rather more controversial. The real themes are fidelity in marriage, reaping what you sow, and sowing wrong things for the right reasons. But it's also about time dislocation - hence the title - and it crosses genres rather less successfully. Especially if we have geared up to expect high-art of the likes of Memento, Fight Club or Donnie Darko. Even worse, the success of the Hitchcock-style ending is arguable. You could waste time arguing over continuity or simply take a dislike to it. A key to enjoying Premonition is finding its level and enjoying it without straying too much.Bullock plays Linda Hanson. As Premonition opens, there is an almost dream-like sequence (shot in stark, bright, bluish tones) when her husband surprises her with a new house. She finds it hard to believe they could afford it, but he has the front door key in his hand.There is a visual contrast as we move to the scene inside the house, shot now with warmer lighting and natural colours. Linda awakens and takes the kids to school (Dad's away). Shortly afterwards the sheriff breaks the sad news. She is plunged into grief. Memory flashbacks to her wedding - again the bluish-white tones - and Linda falls asleep on the couch. When she wakes again, she is in bed. Moreover, her husband has let himself in.Linda's days now alternate worryingly between two realities - her husband is dead and funeral preparations are under way - or he is alive and she is dreading the accident happening. The cinematography sucks us into her mental state. At one point she is in a dream-world, gently meditative, driving along and nearly crashing the car. When she snaps into ferocious activity, it is signalled by hand-held-camera movements - such as when she slips and hurts her hand, covering it with blood.When Linda awakes in the 'bereavement' reality, she looks for clues to find out what is happening. Days come at random, like a jigsaw puzzle. Details mystify, only to be explained when she later dream-experiences the day of their cause. She tears a page out of a phone book, or her daughter scars her face running through a sliding glass door. Yet the missing page, or the scars and stitches, appear at first like a frightening riddle. Events become self-fulfilled as earlier days fit into the enigma.Linda's husband gets withdrawn - is it concern for her mental state or is he hiding something? She is needy in her affection towards him, terrified that he will die on a certain day. At one point she is on lithium - a strong medication used to treat bipolar disorder (or manic-depression), a disease that is characterised by periods of extreme moods (lithium is not usually prescribed lightly, and the casual way her doctor writes the prescription is worrying). Linda throws the tablets away.Increasing preoccupation with her husband's faithfulness leads her to contemplate the rights and wrongs of his 'death'. Consulting a priest, she finds examples of premonitions in history. People who have lost their faith may have a blank space inside that can be 'taken over'. Pleasingly, the film stays largely within the realm of the psychological rather than escaping into some half-baked paranormal explanation.Bullock commands the stage throughout. Although the children act quite convincingly, the other characters are mere ciphers - appropriate, perhaps, in case we are being lured to the view that it is all in her mind. Premonition manages to steer away from formula just enough to keep us in suspense.A recent study on world-wide attitudes to marital fidelity characterised Americans as fixated about it to the point where concern over possible infidelity threatened what pleasure they derive from 'normal' relationships. Whereas many cultures accept affairs as an almost inevitable, if undesirable, concomitant to marriage, Americans obsess over it. They are poor at deception, and the wronged spouse may be destructively obsessive about finding resolution. Failure is not an option, and they find it increasingly hard to re-kindle passion in a light, flirty, sexy way. This applies very much to the film's characters. Linda, when she suspects her husband is having wandering thoughts, becomes clingy and demanding. He is often caught with guilty or evasive expressions, acting increasingly reserved.It is a testament to the breadth that Bullock brings to her role that she manages to break through the coldness with which she is faced in the marriage. We see the story totally from her point of view. But if we invert it, and imagine it from her husband's viewpoint, it makes not only an equally compelling tale but maybe more sense.The other important theme in Premonition is positive attitudes - and the destruction that negativity can wreak. Although tying up the ends of the 'premonitions diary' can be fun (and the scene where she tells her ruby-cheeked daughters that their dad has died is particularly annoying); the best way to enjoy the movie is perhaps by viewing it as twisted melodrama.Sci-fi fans should be warned off. Premonition plays more to female sensitivities - and American preoccupation with affairs of the heart and soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviews have trashed Premonition; I would say wrongfully.The ending was more than what I expected it to be; I was expecting a happily-ever-after, but it seems we got a bitter-sweet ending. This, in itself, made Premonition extremely unique and original. The storyline kept me awake and thinking; it was a very well thought-out plot with all the appropriate hints placed to keep avid movie-goers awake. I was certainly actively keeping track of the days! The screenplay was very thorough and left very few plot-holes in such a complicated movie.It is a very visually extravagant film; very beautiful to look at and very strongly put together. Very effective cinematography. Sandra Bullock's performance is remarkable; some of her best work, no doubt. The soundscape was also very effective; sound effects, music, and all.I think the main message in Premonition was that while bad things may happen, it's a lot better to live and love than to regret later on. An important life message for all! Certainly NOT a bad film, and definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does almost everyone hate the movie just because the ending is not what they wanted (keyword: 'wanted', not expected)! So what if a gripping psychological thriller (much like Premonition) has a somewhat happy ending? ***MINOR SPOILER*** Well, yeah, the husband dies at the end, as he does in the beginning, but the good news is, Linda (Bullock)is pregnant. ***MINOR SPOILER ENDS***.It is almost sickening to find that everyone wants a shocking/disturbing/violent ending to every horror or thriller movie. Why can't it be different for once and just be a happy ending? I mean, you got your shock at the ending, but then it went on to something happy. At least you got some of a shock! And, there were absolutely no plot holes, except for one: how can someone wake up and all the days are mixed up, and someone being dead one day and alive the next day? But that was the only one that made the movie unrealistic. Otherwise, excellent storyline, almost no plot holes, good acting, awesome movie, and a gripping psychological thriller.Official MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Violent Content, Disturbing Images, Thematic Material, and Brief Language My MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Violent Content, Disturbing and Violent Images, Thematic Material, and Brief Strong Language My Canadian rating: PG: Mature Theme, Frightening Scenes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant! Logically developed! Some viewer background helpful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movies are few and far between. "Premonition" is one of the greats.But not for everyone.The acting was exquisite. The screenplay excellent. The plot unfolded logically and understandably. The ending was appropriate.The plot was easy to understand for someone with the right background and metaphysical understandings. It would be difficult to follow for someone who is embroiled in everyday, common, causal perceptions such as Monday's following Sunday, single time-stream reality, and abdication of one's personal co-creation of reality.On the other hand, for one who has thought about branching and cyclical time-streams, non-contiguous or non-sequential time (or at least the illusion of time), or perhaps has read Richard Bach's books "One" and "Bridge Across Forever", and who has pondered the variations and integrations of free-will and determinism, and how much or little one could change the future if one could see the future, then this movie will be one of the best movies that he or she could imagine.This story is also about how attitude, love and relationships are the true essence of life, regardless of the surrounding external events.Some of the write-ups billed this movie as a "psychological thriller". Although my wife and I normally avoid thrillers, we were intrigued by this film's possibilities, so we saw it anyway. It exceeded our expectations! Most movies are simple, predicable plots ? variations on any of a number of human clichés. This movie was a refreshing change, well worth the price of seeing it in the theater. Although quite intense, "Premonitions" dealt with spirituality, relationship development, and complex metaphysical concepts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Poignant, Meaningful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except for the very last two second shot of the movie, I would have rated this movie 9 out of 10. The cinematography and the soundtrack were superb in providing the eerie mood and the out of kilter, juxtaposition of the entire movie. Unlike "Groundhog Day" or "Momentum," this classy mystery thriller contained a large amount of substantive acting and camera shots that really went to the depths of emotional, relational, and moral reckoning. The most commendable element of this movie was avoiding the obvious overacting, melodramatic, and weird experience and instead opted for a character-driven, indirect more experiential piece with a mish-mash of clues and elements that required time and peace of mind to sort out. "Premonition" contained some of the best single element edited shots for impact that appeared to grab the audience and hold them in suspense. This was a meaningful thriller with excellent directing and twists but for a last unnecessary and overused horror plot device. Eight out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>
