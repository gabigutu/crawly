		<shortDescription>Mildly amusing kids film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absent minded professor discovers a new type of rubber that can be harnessed as an energy source. However his discovery causes him to miss his wedding and lose his girlfriend. While trying to demonstrate his discovery to Sara Jean to win her back, he gets the attention of mobster Hoenicker who wants the discovery for himself.The story here is unimportant - it's all a bit daft and if you look too closely at it, it all falls apart. For example - the professor has created a flying robot that has full intelligence and character but yet he hasn't made any money for himself or his college!, is the flubber alive or not? etc. But really it's all about the set pieces and the jokes. As such it falls down a little - it's good for kids but there's nothing in the crude slapstick for adults. Jokes include the usual "people getting hit in the head" style humour.Williams character is not funny at all - a bit of a weakness in a comedy lead. In fact his forgetfulness is just stupid at times and doesn't have any charm to cover it. The funniest bits actually revolve around McDonald's Wilson - he doesn't get good lines but he has lots of incidental laughs. Ted Levine and Clancy Brown have both done better than this and are limited to comedy thugs - although both were probably glad to be in a big movie. Other well known faces include Raymond J. Barry and Wil Wheaton, although these are also underused. It's not really a movie about performances but I think it's still important.The best characters are Weebo and the flubber. Weebo is quite funny and actually has a deep character - she's the secretary in love with her boss type - she also creates a strangely moving scene. The flubber is good - best in one big musical number halfway through and I wonder if they could have had more imaginative scenes with it as a character rather than just a bouncy ball.Overall it's a kids film - don't expect anything more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically impressive and enjoyable, but somewhat forgettable too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a lot of potential. While technically impressive and very enjoyable with some genuinely funny moments, for some reason it falls short. Of course there are redeeming qualities, such as the fun music score by Danny Elfman, one of my all time favourite film composers and an amusing turn from Robin Williams. Also the special effects are greatly improved from the effects in the Absent Minded Professor, and Flubber who is so cute steals the show. The performances from Clancy Brown, Ted Levine and Marcia Gay Horden are entertaining, and Jodi Benson (who voiced Ariel in the Little Mermaid)is a delight as the voice of Weebo, whose death is absolutely heart-rending. However the story is very predictable, and offers few surprises, and the physical comedy was better than the patchy script which in places felt uninspired. That saying some of the physical comedy has strong hints of deja vu, and is rather hit and miss. Of course kids will lap it up, but adults probably won't like it as much. The second half of the movie is more meandering in quality compared to the first half, very little of interest happens and some of the situations come across as ridiculous. All in all, somewhat forgettable, but for a kids movie it is pretty entertaining. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Williams' best role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flubber came out during the mid/late nineties. This is the time where I believe Disney began losing its magic in the movie industry. Disney movies before always had the magical feeling and good stories. Flubber does not not have either. The main good thing it has is the acting. The acting is fairly good. This is not Robin Williams' best work, but he does a good enough job.The story revolves around a naive and eccentric inventor and college professor portrayed by Robin Williams. he creates a "living" specimen of goo that can shape-shift at will and is incredibly bouncy, but his dedication to it's creation causes him to forget his wedding. He ends up using the 'Flubber' to get his fiancé back and save his college from threats of closing down. I have no idea how the movie tries to make it work. I didn't really understand as a kid and I don't get it as an adult.The plot is weird, the directing isn't very good, and many of the characters are wooden. Overall, this Disney flick can be skipped. You won't be missing much</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Mainly For The Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a fun remake of "The Absent-Minded Professor," with special-effects the main show here. We see and hear the following impossible things: inanimate objects become human (with feelings, no less!) and a flying computer called "Weebo." Obviously, this is just a far-off story designs only for laughs (I know one person who actually took some of this stuff seriously.)Despite a bowling bowl repeatedly hitting someone in the head, it's a fairly harmless movie with no language problems, which is a rarity in a Robin Williams film. Robin is the "absent- minded professor," in this "Dr. Philip Brainiard." You can call him, "Dr. Phil." There are one or two sneaky-vulgar lines but nothing much.With the flubber-substance making balls bounce forever, into every object, you get a lot of slapstick scenes that are either stupid or laugh-out-loud funny. The story, geared a lot more for kids than adults, has a nice lighthearted feel to it. For adults, one viewing is plenty, but kids will enjoy it multiple times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked it when I was a kid. Not so much now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a boy, I was always impressed and amused by the movies that I saw. Some of them bring back memories of me watching whatever kids movie that made me excited. But as time goes on, those memories are still embedded in my memory bank. And sometimes, an fellow movie-goer can sometimes get teary-eyed by going down memory lane. Some of those movies do hold up well. Some of them, well.... get lost in my mind.Take Flubber, for example. Flubber is the kind of movie that I enjoyed as a young boy. But, I've grown up over the years and to tell you the truth, it doesn't hold up for me. The story was originally from the 1961 comedy film, "The Absent-Minded Professor". In that film, Fred MacMurray played the lead character. MacMurray's character was a complete nut case who invents a new and improved substance that can bounces off the floor due the amount of energy stored inside. The substance was named Flubber, due to the fact that it is flying rubber. The absent-minded professor tried to convince his colleagues that flubber can saved their university from going into shambles.Here, Robin Williams plays the absent-minded professor. Professor Phillip Brainard, (who could be a distant relative or son of the original Absent-Minded Professor), is in the process of creating a new substance that can raise money to save the college from closure. Brainard's colleague is a flying robot called Weebo. Brainard soon discovers flubber and from the start of it, Flubber doesn't want to settle down. The story deepens as Brainard tries to convince the college president and his fiancée, (Marcia Gay Harden), but it doesn't turn out the way he wants it to go. He even expands the idea of flubber by converting the substance into a liquid and then into a white cream. In one particular scene in the movie, Brainard tries out the flubber by spraying it onto a basketball that can bounces as twice as much as a regular basketball. The idea even becomes more popular when it spreads onto a basketball team. Their sneakers are also sprayed with flubber, making them bounce more higher and faster than ever.There are, however, bad guys in Flubber, and their job in the movie is to try to steal the substance from Brainard. But, to tell you the truth, you seen these bad guys before in a movie. And it's no surprise that these characters are ripped right out of Home Alone. It's ironic because the script for the movie was written by John Hughes.I don't know what happened to John Hughes back then. He started off his career with good movies like Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. But, after the big success of Home Alone, I believe Hughes dropped his pen and started depending on recycled material from his other movies to substitute in his scripts. Recycled material soon resulted in forgettable movies like Dutch, Career Opportunities and Curly Sue. Bad career move. And I supposed Flubber can be included in this specific category of forgettable John Hughes' movies.Robin Williams looks as if he was practically on speed throughout the entire movie. At certain times throughout this movie, I thought he overacted as being the main character of the story. The slapstick did not work this time around since it didn't make me laugh the first time I saw it as a young boy. The flubber wasn't even worth my time since there wasn't anything special about the green goo. In fact, when Flubber soon shows up, the movie goes downhill from there with the green gelatin bouncing around the movie, breaking windows and panes of glass. I realize that after the movie was over, I forgot how many times Flubber went through a window or a pane of glass. It was very tiresome and boring the second time around.Is there anything else I forgot? I don't think so. Except to say that I won't be looking forward to seeing this movie since this is one of those kids' movies that I like to forget. But, don't worry. There's plenty of other good or great kids' movies that I saw in my childhood. Flubber wasn't one of them. &#x2605; 1/2 1 1/2 star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and visually impressive, the film nevertheless falls short of the joyous satisfaction found in the original AMP</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philip (Robin Williams) is a chemistry professor at a college with financial woes. On a side note, the school's president, talented Sara Jean (Marcia Gay Harden) is Philip's girlfriend and she is deeply disappointed that he has left her standing at the altar THREE times. Yet, Philip truly loves Sara. His problem is, of course, that once he is into an experiment, he loses touch with everything else in his life. The day Philip misses his third trip up the aisle of love, he discovers something big...that is, flying rubber or flubber. Knowing this could be the invention that turns the college's ledger into the black, he is eager to tell Sara of the news. Unfortunately, she won't talk to him and is receiving the attentions of a rival chemistry prof at a nearby university. It is this rival's intention, along with a host of others connected to the school, to steal the rubbery substance for their own purposes. Will they succeed? This is a mildly entertaining film, mostly due to Williams star power and the spectacular visual effects the movie offers. Flubber, indeed, takes on a green personality not unlike the Pillsbury doughboy and bounces all over the place, causing much fun and havoc. There is also a tiny robot-computer, living with Philip, that is very appealing. Add on the eye-treat of flying cars and basketball superduper jumpshots and you have a technically impressive film. Yet, somewhere along the way, a bit of the original film's soul and joyous freshness is lost. No, its not the fault of the talented Williams, Harden, Christopher McDonald or the other cast members. They are quite fine. There are also some laugh out loud scenes, such as the one where Professor Philip starts giving a lecture, not noticing that he is in a figure drawing class, or the ones where a neighboring boy, quite rightly fears, to his father's consternation, what is outside his window when flubber is out and about. In summary, the film's problem is probably a case of trying too hard in the special effects category and not enough in the remaining aspects of film making. Even so, it is not a stretch to say that most families will like Flubber, as everyone will be amazed by the stunning look of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flying Rubber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney got Robin William's who became popular in the 1990s with family entertainment films to remake the The Absent Minded Professor. Popular with kids at the time mainly because it was co- written by John Hughes who put some of his Home alone slapstick formula with two comedy henchman played by Ted Levine and Clancy Brown.William's discovers discovers some kind of flying rubber which may save his college which is in a financial crisis. So excited he is with his invention that he forgets his wedding day for the third time. Why his bride to be could not make sure that in case he forgets, he is accompanied by two people to drag him to the church on time is anyone's guess.His girlfriend who also happens to be the College Dean gets the attention of a love rival and a mobster wants the formula for flubber and sends his henchman to retrieve it.Williams is assisted by an Artificial Intelligent flying robot called Weebo which strangely is not marketed by Williams to save the college.The film is knockabout slapstick squarely aimed at kids and they will appreciate it the most. Adults will find the film too silly, flawed and simplistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good as "The Absent Minded Professor" But Pretty Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tastes and times have changed drastically since 1961 when Fred MacMurray originally introduced the super-elastic stuff called 'flubber' to film audiences in Walt Disney's "The Absent Minded Professor." In the high-tech, 1990's Disney remake "Flubber" reinvents itself as an animated, gooey-green, silly putty blob of flying rubber that talks and dances. Actually, flubber resembles a combination of the Pillsbury Doughboy crossed with the shape-shifting water creature in James Cameron's 1989 fantasy thriller "The Abyss." Inventive, excessive, but tolerably entertaining, director Les Mayfield's remake of "The Absent Minded Professor" will captivate both young and absent-minded audiences. Happily, "Flubber" succeeds as a resilient special effects laden tour-de-farce. Sadly, the remake lacks the wit, warmth, subtlety, and comedic irony that distinguished its black &amp; white predecessor. The spectacular morphing effects of George Lucas' Industrial Light &amp; Magic Company and the visual wizardry of Peter Crosman, Tom Bertino, and Douglas Hans Smith cannot offset the film's hopelessly befuddled plot.The story by John Hughes and the late Bill Walsh follows the zany efforts of a scatterbrained university chemistry professor. Dr. Philip Brainard (Robin Williams of "Popeye") accidentally cooks up a gravity defying concoction called 'flubber.' Generating its own perpetual motion, 'flubber' has uses limited only by the imagination. Unlike the limp lump of 'flubber' in "The Absent-Minded Professor," the 'flubber' "Flubber" radiates a mischievous personality, but the filmmakers never solidify its amorphous character. Not only will Brainard 'flubber' rescue Medfield College from bankruptcy and closure, but 'flubber' will also redeem him in the eyes of the long-suffering sweetheart that he wants to wed: Medfield College President Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden.) Brainard heads up Sara Jean's you-know-what list. Three times in a row he has left her stranded at the altar! If things aren't bad enough, Brainard's old academic nemesis Wilson Croft (Christopher MacDonald of "Thelma &amp; Louise") lurks in the background. Oil and conniving, Croft plans to pilfer Brainard's fiancée as well as take credit for his 'flubber' formula and the millions of dollars that it is sure to reap. The professor's next bigger enemy is perhaps his worst: corrupt businessman Chester Hoenicker (Raymond J. Barry of "Mad City"). Hoenicker's bratty son Bennett (Will Wheaton of TV's "Star Trek: The Next Generation") flunked Brainard's class. Consequently, Bennett got suspended from the basketball team. Initially, all that Hoenicker sought was a simple change of grade so Bennett, the top hoopster on the Medfield basketball team, could resume playing. When Hoenicker senior learns more about 'flubber,' he joins forces with the equally avaricious Croft to rip-off Braniard's discovery.Women have come a long way since the 1961 original. Disney has promoted the fiancée from being the college president's secretary to the college president! Although Sara Jean presides over Medfield, she cannot keep it out of the red without the help of a good man. "Flubber" implies that women indeed have come a long way, but not far enough to get by on their own wits. Moreover, Sara Jean's romance with Brainard appears to occupy her every waking minute instead of the financial crisis that threatens her small, private college. Her priorities appear demeaningly misplaced. WEEBO, Brainard's flying female computer, serves as a sort of bad girl here who gets her just comeuppance for tampering with Brainard's social life. At one point, WEEBO creates a cyber-Siren image for herself to detract Brainard from Sara Jean."Flubber" sounds like a can't-miss-hit from this description. If anything, "Flubber" proves that absent-minded audiences appreciate movies with an absence of drama. The original movie contained a richer plot with a variety of nuances that heightened its hilarity. "Flubber" smears on obvious slapstick to churn up laughs. John Hughes' script relies on his tried and true "Home Alone" routines. Hughes deserves the blame for this half-baked farce. For example, Hoenicker's henchman, Smith (Clancy Brown of "Starship Troopers") and Wesson (Ted Levine of "Silence of the Lambs") are clearly stand-ins for the Joe Pesci &amp; Daniel Stern duo from the "Home Alone" comedies. Brainard's flubber clobbers them literally in the form of a golf ball and a bowling ball. Smith gets nailed by a non-stop golf ball, while a hard flying bowling ball wallops Wesson. When either object strikes them, these goons hit the deck like pole-axed ten pins.Director Les Mayfield of "Encino Man" and "Miracle on 34th Street") and scenarist John Hughes cannot make up their own minds about flubber. Flubber has endless possibilities, and its embryonic personality can be playful but occasionally snappish, too. WEEBO accuses Brainard of giving flubber "too much free will." Flubber never seems to live up to its potential unless it is exploding, flying through rooms, and cronking noggins. Most of the humor comes from how flubber reacts to different situations more than how Brainard applies it. Because they never define the nature of flubber, its wide open character lacks dramatic clarity. For example, the filmmakers don't set any limits to what flubber can do. Perhaps Mayfield and company chose green as flubber's lime-green color because the special effects were so expensive.Credit goes to director Les Mayfield for the get-up-and-goo pace of dizzy Disney film. He does a find job of seamlessly integrating the over-the-top special effects with live action, too. "Flubber" is aimless but predictable fun. The villains seem less villainous this time around, and Christopher MacDonald's bad guy appears simply to give flubber something through which to fly. The bowel humor here and there adds little to the humor and seems out of place in a juvenile movie. Parents may find themselves in a curious moral dilemma trying to explain to their kids why Brainard's cheating tactics should be condoned. He applies flubber to the basketball team's sneakers to help them beat their tall, merciless opponents on the court. Danny Elfman's lively music emphasizes the fast, bouncy pace of "Flubber" and helps the film scoot right along to its inevitable happy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives Remakes a Bad Name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can be disappointed even when you are not expecting much. There was no fault in wishing to share "The AbsentMinded Professor" with a later generation, but it had to be remade. With Robin Williams replacing Fred MacMurray, the professor could be more boisterous and physical. With 1997 replacing 1961, the special effects could be much more sophisticated. So it's win-win, right? No, but a few things did go right. Two things, actually. Robin Williams had one good scene. In the opening, Dr. Brainard is introduced as a man who is so out of touch with his surroundings that he could step into the wrong lecture hall and deliver an elementary physics lecture to an art class. Other than that, the role and the actor were forgettable. Also, the Danny Elfman soundtrack was very lively, particularly the Flubber Rumba.This time around, the flubber has anthropomorphic properties. That change was simply an excuse to have the computer-animated dance scene, which was fun in a Scrubbing Bubbles kind of way. Other than that (and color), the special effects fell considerably short of the 1961 version. When people fly, they look like they are hanging on wires. When they fall, they look like they are hanging on wires. When they bounce -- well, you get the pattern.These days, movie makers are free to do quite a few things that were not allowed in 1961. Unfortunately, many of them feel a need to remind us by including a gratuitously vulgar scene in everything they release. This time we get a man blowing flubber out his rectum. It was as if to say, "Take that! We've already got your money!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flubber, the get together, family film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the reviews for this film, I was expecting something very poorly made and bad quality. True, for an adult without a kid it isn't ideal, but why buy a film if it has a cover like this when you're not a child any more? Everywhere online it says this is a great kids flick, for families and more. If you're like me and read reviews before buying or renting a film, then you'd know not to get it.Getting to what the movie is like, these aren't the best graphics, but what do you expect in an 1997 film? The Flubber, Weebo etc. are already neatly done, which I find quite impressive for a film made at that time. The humor in this may not be the jokes, but not all kids understand certain types of joke, so in the film they just went for the classic 'Bad Guys Whacked In The Face' type. There is no gore or extreme violence in this, everything has a light-hearted touch to it and the flubber truly seems fun to play with.Robin does do a good job as the professor, making many wacky inventions and always forgetting. Weebo played by Jodi, continues to be the kind, thoughtful person - or in this case computer - that she is when she plays Ariel in the little mermaid.Overrall it's a pretty good film, not ideal for adults but then why get a kids film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a great family film then this is it! The characters are great. The professor was very funny and sweet so whenever he feels sad you feel his pain. Webo the flying robot is also funny and the close relationship between her and the professor really brings a family feel to the movie. But when they experienced a great loss later on in the film, their relationship began to make me feel a little comfortable. When I was younger I remember feeling so sad but eight years later as teenager that part of the film was simply weird. I found the professor's wife was rude and annoying until the end and her partner (when her and the professor break up) is just as funny as the professor. Seeing the way they try and disguise their hate for one another was a good laugh.Overall the movie is truly unique. Flubber is a great character who young children will fall in love with immediately. You'll really enjoy Flubber's great dance number! Forget the bad reviews and give this film a chance. It's been eight years since I saw the film for the first time and I still smile whenever I think about it.Judge for yourself. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's flying rubber... It's, Flubber!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of an old black and white Disney flick called The Absent Minded Professor that has long since gotten a bit stale, Flubber took all the best elements of that and breathed new 90's life into the premise, most of the pep in its step coming from star Robin Williams. Keep in mind it was a critical bomb though, which just doesn't make a shred of sense to me. It's fun, lighthearted, hilarious and just a bit raunchy in places where it can pull it off. For whatever reason, it didn't sit well with anyone other than fans like me who will furiously shove a copy in your face if we hear that you haven't seen it. Williams is college professor Philip Brainard, who is so absent minded it borders on dementia. He leaves his lovely fiancé (Marcia Gay Harden) at the alter TWICE, prompting the advances of irksome college dean Shooter Mcgavi- I mean Christopher Mcdonald. He's on a quest, you see, an obsessive quest to find the formula for... something. That something turns up after a destructive whirlwind of disasters in his basement lab, and in the form of Flubber, a lovable ball of green goo, infected with incurable ADHD and an inexhaustible sense of humour. While the utter the life of the party, Flubber does have its practical uses, such as making cars fly and turning the hopeless varsity basketball team into a bunch of flying Tasmanian devils who nail every dunk. This all gets the attention of insidious local philanthropist and lowlife Chester Hoenicker (Raymond J. Barry) who greedily wants the discovery for his own. He sends his two goons Smith (Ted Levine) and Wesson (Clancy Brown) to rob Brainard of his precious sentient mucous, which turns into one of the most hilarious displays of slapstick comedy since the Three Stooges. Oh, did I mention Williams has a little flying UFO sidekick named Weebo, who has a perfect GIF reaction to everything, before GIF's were even a thing? So much to love about this little classic. Williams is his usual buoyant self, with some of his trademark razor focus diminished in favor of doe eyed, vacuous forgetfulness that would make Jason Bourne guilty for ever whining about his predicament. Special effects are top drawer too, Flubber would look dapper in Blu Ray if they ever felt so inclined as to release one, not to mention aforementioned airborne automobiles and dear little Weebo. Can't give enough glowing praise to this little treasure, and hiss enough venom towards those sourpuss critics who assaulted it. Flubber for the win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK the film is enjoyable and funny but after Sara and Phillip got together, the film ended really fast. Are they trying to finish up the film quickly? There is some slow parts. But most of them are fast! I feel sorry for people that didn't see much of flubber and Sara and Philip being together. Im glad that weebo released flubber even Phillip told her not to. Or we wouldn't see more of flubber. He transforms into different forms of beings. Just like morph from treasure planet does. Now for the ratings:I will rate each element of the film! Story: The story is about professor Phillip working on something new that will get Sara to like him. He made a green flying rubber that names flubber. He makes flubber liquid mix to the spray and the can to make the object bounce upon impact on the ground or something. So i like the story. So i rated it 7/10Dialogues: the dialogs are fine. But weeber has no dialogs. But shows the videos explaining about whats going to happen or expression. Some of her videos are funny. So i rated it 8/10Casts: its pretty well matched with the characters. They coulda put Jim Carry as Phillip and the film will be hilarious! But they needed a actor who is the best for the professor. And thats the guy who's the expert at lab work. So i rated it 7/10Good title for the film? Well yes. Because its about flubber! Why not?</fullReview>

It's a shame to see Clancy Brown (Kurgan from "Highlander") here too. Will Wheaton is OK and nobody plays a giant douche like Christopher McDonnald. My favourite character in the entire movie was Weebo (voiced by Jodi Benson), Philip's hovering robot assistant.

		<shortDescription>Flubber is for the kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the remake of 1961's Absent-Minded Professor, where Robin Williams plays Professor Phillip Brainard. He works with his assistant Weebo, a talking miniature flying robot, and created a rubber-like substance called Flubber, which can make objects fly through air. His scientific research has caused him to miss his wedding to fiancée Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden), who ends up going out with Professor Wilson Croft (Christopher McDonald). Therefore, Brainard works to get Reynolds back, and deal with a couple of criminals who want their hands on Brainard's scientific work.I haven't seen The Absent-Minded Professor, so I couldn't compare the two films. But, to evaluate this movie alone, I'd say it is just an average movie with some whimsical fun and silly slapstick comedy, and a plot that really goes all over the place. Williams looks pretty odd in the movie, Harden did an OK job in her role, and McDonald was just plain annoying in his performance. I enjoyed the Weebo character, voiced by The Little Mermaid voice actress Jodi Benson. The little flying robot reminded me of the little aliens in the sci-fi flick *batteries not included, and her little TV screen that shows various Disney cartoon scenes whenever she makes emotions is a clever touch.Overall, I didn't think it was a really exciting movie, but for its whimsical, slapstick and childish elements, this movie is best left for younger children to enjoy.Grade C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONLY for the late Robin Williams this film is actually hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this as a kid and I found it really funny,but I haven't seen this in ages so I decided to buy the DVD of it this year and watched it last night.The story is about a professor called Phillip(played by the late Robin Williams) who creates this rubber like substance and calls Flubber. But problems arise as he ends up getting late for his wedding which causes trouble with his relationship with Sarah(played by Marcia Gay Harden) .Meanwhile the professor's assistant(who happens to be a robot called Weebo voiced by Jodi Benson who is the voice of Ariel in The Little Mermaid), is actually very jealous of Professor Phillip's relationship with him and Sarah and she is the reason why he forgot his wedding. So she starts to have feelings for him and in one scene she creates a hologram of a woman just to get close to him(which sounds kinda silly but still though she was made by the Professor).Overall it was a really long time ago since I last seen it but it was a funny movie,the slapstick is great and Robin Williams is such an energetic person. He will be sadly missed and may his legacy move on forever in our hearts. RIP Robin WilliamsNot the best of Williams career but hey if you are a fan of the late Robin Williams then check it out.6.5/10Last edited: 15th of October 2014</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish Flubber was real, because if it was, I would be playing with it right now. We watched this in Science class once because it has to do with atoms and stuff, and we were learning about that. I think we were learning about atoms. OK back to the movie. It was just a bit boring. No, it was a lot boring. Only like 5 scenes were interesting. Robin Williams acting as the professor was a bad choice, because he is like 20 years older than the woman he likes and gets married too. Well he looked like it anyways. I would love to have a house like the professor, though. It was so cool and he really did not have to do anything, just have Weebo or his master inventions do it for him. This is a very kid friendly movie. Nothing frightening or sexual, just kissing. No drugs, maybe a character smoking. Very mild profanity and some violence.8-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie , i would say is an 8/10 it is both great for the family of all ages, and great for the lone watcher.I would have to say that anyone who hates this movie, has a dislike for a character or director as there is very little to criticize it for otherwise, it has a highish budget, which means it has potential and it delivers, so ignore haters and give it a go! The general plot is a clumsy Professor created a new life form made of flubber with strange properties, I cant really say more as it would ruin the plot. However i can say that children will love the film, adults will like the film and elderly will find it amusing, which in my books is good enough reason to buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Half of Everything !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is : _Half laughable. (Robin Williams)'s buffoonery here is unbearable, misses with no hitting. There are some good ideas yet in the half of it you must feel bored. After that the whole rest is weak and disgusting; the Flubber comes out of the evil guy at the end !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!? That will live long in the mind of anyone watched it, not as a funny memory, but as sick one. You'd feel that (Williams) with Disney wanted to remake not (The Absent Minded Professor) of the 1960s, but (The Nutty Professor) of the 1990s as modern near success of absolute rudeness ! Thank god that Walt Disney isn't alive anymore to witness this rubbish !._Half good in its especial effects. Although the first movie was years ago, and the CGI wasn't here yet. But the original's special effects were much sane and much droll. Here it's sheer technique without even the ability to be comic or memorable. And by the way what's the necessity of the Flubber's dance at home ?! It's just an excess show for showing off ! _Half attractive. In 1998, one theater showed this movie in special day for kids, yes, I was in my 20s already but I insisted on watching it there; since I didn't watch it before, and considering what a treat watching a Disney movie among audience of enthusiastic children was. But .. To tell you truth, at the end of the first half, I was having my way out ! Of course I watched it later in complete just to find out if I was wrong or right, and how right I was ! _The only things that I loved : (Danny Elfman)'s music, (Marcia Gay Harden); how you feel that the movie doesn't deserve her, and for sure the creative sophisticated opening credits, it's without a doubt not the best of the movie only, it's better than it ! _Comparing to the original The Absent Minded Professor's 2 movies, this is less than half of the fun of any of them.The Last Remark : at the beginning of the movie one character asks (Robin Williams) as Professor Brainard about how he handles his I don't remember what, and hearing mistakenly he replays about how he handles his "private parts" !??.. Even as an adult I hated it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Inner Minds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>17 years on. Not a bad time to evaluate a film for merit. Supposing it doesn't work ? this one doesn't ? we have a chance to reflect on its place in history. Yes we have the beloved Robin Williams in his least lovable mode: physical slapstick and Asbergers brilliance. We have Elfman at his least attractive self as well, before he assembled the creative team that makes catchy honking jingles in his name.We have no change from the quantum states of film scientist: evil or goofy or the guy that-saves-the-world. We have John Hughes and his brand of injury slapstick just as it was becoming unfunny. The CGI creature was not technically impressive; it had been half a decade since Cameron's liquid metal.But we do have one element that is really interesting. If you have not seen this recently, we have a genius scientist/inventor of the Tony Stark variety ? someone who can both 'invent' chemically and construct robot gismos. One of these is a humanized floating globe robot, who seems to be primarily a companion. The way this is written, the robot is physically real and combats the bad guys.But she occupies other interesting spaces as well. She is (has been created as?) a love interest. She (using an ordinary Windows machine) is capable of creating a holographic projection of a perfect female to 'love' our professor. The romance plot turns on her loving him so much that she heals his romance with the real girl, a tepid soul. (The voice is Jodi Benson who will be known in countless households as the Disney Princess Prime.)Much, much more interesting is the role of the floating orb as the inner voice of our Asbergers Autist. What she actually says is uninteresting; how she says it is fascinating. When something important is to be communicated, she pops up a screen that has a short scene or image from an old movie (from the Disney archive). As it happens, this is not for the professor to see. He often isn't looking. It is for us to see, a direct connection with the audience, but presented so that we understand it as the image in the shared mind at that moment. It is a pretty remarkable device, having memories of film illustrate what is in someone's mind. It is perhaps the fundamental challenge of film. Books can take you in the mind and soul. Films can show you things that indirectly have to do so.Robin Williams had nothing to do with writing this or elaborating it as he often did. But now that he is gone, it is tempting to redo these scenes and composite in the film sequences that were likely in his hyperactive mind, as far from Asbergers as one can get without destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good possibilities that don't pan out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phillip Brainard (Robin Williams) is the absent-minded professor. Chester Hoenicker (Raymond J. Barry) threatens to close the college run by his girlfriend president Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden). He keeps forgetting to go to their wedding and she vows that this is the last attempt. His work with a new compound as an energy source can save their college. He has a mechanical assistant Weebo. His hated old partner Wilson Croft (Christopher McDonald) visits after stealing all of his ideas and now is after Sara. Chester's son Bennett (Wil Wheaton) is failing Brainard's class and he expected his father had already bought the grades. Chester sends his henchmen Smith (Clancy Brown) and Wesson (Ted Levine).There are a lot of good possibilities that don't pan out. Weebo is not cute and a bit of an annoying jealous brat. There is an uncomfortable man-machine love story. Also he has a flying robot. HE HAS A FLYING ROBOT! That is probably enough to keep the college going. Professor Brainard is not lovable enough. Christopher McDonald is too good at being creepy and I can't buy anybody even liking the guy. MGH is not likable either. There are too many broadly unlikeable characters. The Flubber itself is fun for a little while and Williams has good imaginary chemistry with an imaginary object. It allows him to have some physical humor. Although it gets very repetitive. There is only so much Home Alone slapstick that should be repeated. It's also very stupid that people saw the basketball game without figuring it out. This should be funnier but it's not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really all that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm, I was told that this movie is cute, and cute it is, but it is not the best that I have seen. I must admit that Robin Williams is a funny guy, but this is not one of his funniest movies. The best scene in the movie was when he walks into a life drawing class thinking that it is his physics class and goes ahead and teaches. Other than that this movie is rather ordinary with lots of clichés to fill it up. I enjoyed it, a bit, but I have seen better.Basically, a college is about to be shut down and Robin Williams is an absent minded professor who has missed his wedding three times. It is interesting that he has a robot that is in love with him and is forcing him not to marry the woman who he loves. This is all very cute but I thought that it was a little silly. The professor is very smart but, as is introduced rather quickly, somebody else always steals his ideas and gets the fame for it. The guy is basically the bad guy who is milking the professor for all he is worth. Then there is the corporate boss who thinks that solving problems is done by throwing money at it. He wants his kid to get straight A's so he throws money at it.When we look at the movie we see once again the theme of the American Dream. Everybody can become happy and rich if they simply work at it. All problems can be over come by ones own ability and that the end is always happy. This is a very shallow and idealistic theme which generally annoys me. Even though, Flubber is a kids movie though it has a few interesting scenes thrown in to keep the adults interested, because it is the adults that must take their kids to see the movie. Flubber is a Walt Disney movie, and I generally don't like Disney for some unknown reason, I guess because it is reaching into the minds of children and manipulating them into clones of themselves. All of us who grew up on Disney has been forced into a Disney mindset. I am far more critical of children's movies, and those who specialise in them, because our children follow them more than adults. Adults watch movies, children believe movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great kids movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this as a kid, when I was probably about 5 or 6, and I thought that it was hilarious. I just recently took it out of the case to watch it again with a friend, and found that it was still funny! By now, I have seen both this and the original Absent-Minded Professor, and loved both that and Flubber. Yes that is possible. This movie is about Robin Williams who plays a professor who is also an inventor and invents a lot of robots to help him around the house, but is so focused on his work that he misses his own wedding...three times. He invents a green rubbery substance that can make things fly and do a lot of other things that will be fun to watch if you are, or ever were, a kid. Eventually, the bad guys try to get it for themselves, and the race is on! If you want an absolutely perfect movie, than this is NOT the movie. But if you want to watch an AMAZING comedy, than this is the one for you. And for those of you who are wondering why I gave what I called a not perfect movie a 10 out of 10, it is because I believe that in it's own way, it is perfect. A perfect comedy, and one of my favorites. If you can get your hands on a copy I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have young kids, or know young kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironically, it has no bounce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nineties variant John Hughes combines his two favourite kinds of movies - variations on the 'Home Alone' formula and remakes - to produce this rehash of 1961's 'The Absent Minded Professor' in which Robin Williams is engaging as a scientist who creates a green goo that makes his car fly and a college basketball team bounce across the court. I didn't expect this to be much good but the amount of mind-numbing tedium on display came as a bit of a surprise. The story rambles around with no real internal logic, there's too much lame slapstick, Les Mayfield directs with no flair and the movie is devoid of charm. The original was no classic but it sure beats this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kids' movie, one which could have been worse, but is still nothing special (at least not for adults)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this film more than once shortly after it came into stores (I would have been around eleven years old at the time), but can't remember exactly what I thought of it, so I obviously didn't absolutely love it or hate it. Would I have watched it years later if I never saw it before? Probably not, and DEFINITELY not for any reason other than Robin Williams' starring role. However, since I had seen it while growing up, I decided to try it again, and unsurprisingly, it turned out to be average overall.Professor Philip Brainard is an absent-minded professor with a living computer named Weebo that floats through the air as his assistant. He is in love with Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds, the president of Medfield, a college which is in financial trouble. Brainard is busy trying to create a substance that will save the college, and has failed to show up at his attempted wedding more than once. Sara gives him one more chance, and if he fails to show up this time, it will be the last straw! That night, he successfully creates a living green substance which he calls "flubber" (after Weebo says it's "flying rubber"), and it appears this substance will do the trick! Sadly, he also misses the wedding again, and Sara is fed up. Nonetheless, he thinks about how he's going to use flubber to save Medfield College, and tries to once again win the heart of Sara, who is now going out with Wilson Croft, Brainard's rival. Meanwhile, Bennett Hoenicker is a spoiled student whom Brainard has failed, and his father, the extremely wealthy Chester Hoenicker plans to persuade the professor to pass his son! Robin Williams is a very talented comedian, but that doesn't really show in this movie. He's a bit tamer than you may expect, in the kind of role you may expect one to act crazy in, and he is certainly not very funny. After saying that, I should also point out that "Flubber" as a whole fails as a comedy. I certainly didn't laugh, or even smile very much, and the part that I remember laughing the most at wasn't even supposed to be funny! The scene I'm talking about is the one where Sara says "This is going to be the very last time I try to marry you," which reminds me, the relationship between Philip and Sara is a rather awkward part of the story, and I guess there are problems with the script. The only really good INTENTIONAL gag I can think of is the "Let him have it. Give it to him. No, give it to him. Stop that and give it to him..." one. Another problem I can't forget is the villains, ones which may not belong."Flubber" is a remake of the 1961 Disney film, "The Absent Minded Professor", which I haven't seen (I didn't even know "Flubber" was a remake until around the time I last saw it), but know the 1961 original is generally considered superior. Well, it is a common thing for remakes to be inferior to their predecessors (I'm certainly not saying they always are, but it's not uncommon for fans of the original to be disappointed to some degree by the remake), and I'm sure this one is no exception. Whether you've seen "The Absent Minded Professor" or not, and whether you like it or not if you have seen it, you have to remember that "Flubber" is a kids' movie, and for most adults, other than parents, it is an insignificant flick, and probably not worth it.</fullReview>

This time Hughes replaces a kiddie with the title glob to bash the adults around in the big finale. And unlike any kid, the flubber is at one point able to race thru a bad guy's anus!! Up until his usual antics, Hughes laughless script revolves around Williams discovery and those who want to steal it. But that's it! It's played out like a drama as that becomes the main plot. Then there's the infamous basketball sequence from the original film years ago, with nothing new put into it. Even the Fred McMurray classic, still kiddie-fied, was at least pleasant as it had fun with the flubber. Here its used to knock stuff over and race around the room and smash into the aforementioned goons. How many times can Hughes remake this lousy formula??!! Quit if for God's sake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still somewhat enjoyable as a kids movie but it had more potential really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really feels like a wasted opportunity. With so many talent involved, how could this movie turn out to be so disappointing? It probably is due to the messy script that uses too many plot lines that never get fully developed or that work out completely the way as they were suppose to. You can say that the movie feels incomplete. I don't know, were they in a hurry or something to complete this movie? I have a feeling that a month or two more work on the movie- and perhaps its script, would had made this movie a better one.It's still somewhat decent entertainment for the kids. The characters should be enjoyable for them and some of the comical situations are good enough to make them laugh.Robin Williams is always fun to watch in a comedy but however in this case it feels like he's holding back to not completely play a nutty professor. It's perhaps a bit of a disappointing to most. When you know Robin Williams plays the lead role in a comedy you would expect some more fireworks and hilarious situations from him. His talent is wasted, a real missed opportunity for the movie to become a great one. Christopher McDonald plays a typical 'villainoush' Christopher McDonald role and he does it once more really great. Other well known actors in the movie are Marcia Gay Harden, Raymond J. Barry (boy, he's beginning to look really old now), Ted Levine and Clancy Brown. But none of the characters feel really developed well enough in the movie, with the exception of the robotic character Weebo. Of course it's not a very good sign when the best developed- and featured character of the movie is not even an human...Also the use of 'Flubber' is highly below par. From a movie named "Flubber" I expected something more from the green slimy stuff. It however doesn't play a that significant role in the movie and the things that are done with the Flubber are far from original or interesting. The Flubber itself however looks fantastic through some early computer effects. Remember that this movie was released in 1997 when the special effects were of course not as advanced as present day is the case. The effects from this movie look great and really fully convincing. Too bad that it isn't featured very well in the movie.The story is of course predictable from A to Z and the movie has absolutely no surprises in it. It makes "Flubber" a very easily forgettable movie that is far from great. The movie had far more potential really. If only that had made some better choices with its story and perhaps picked a different director...The movie is good and professional looking, so from a technical point of view the movie does really not disappoint. Also the fun musical score by Danny Elfman makes the movie a watchable oneThe kids will probably still enjoy it but still the movie feels like a big waste of some far more and greater potential, which the movie really had.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flubber (1997): Dir: Les Mayfield / Cast: Robin Williams, Marcia Gay Harden, Christopher MacDonald, Raymond J. Barry, Wil Wheaton: Flubber is green goo that bounces and stretches. Robin Williams plays a professor who creates the substance and it has the ability to render people or objects air born, which makes it difficult to control. There is a subplot regarding a student whom Williams flunked who just happens to be the son of someone they owe payments too. Formula plot mixed with stupidity with an ending that achieves the same affect as a kick to the groin. Director Les Mayfield creates a mess. He previously remade Miracle on 34th Street so now he is remaking The Absent-Minded Professor. Talk of machines with souls is unnecessary and laughable. Special effects are appealing but acting is terrible. Williams is basically rehashing old acts and his marriage ceremony scenes is actually offensive. Marcia Gay Harden is given the thankless role of girlfriend. Christopher MacDonald plays the villain, as if that is a surprise. Raymond J. Barry also makes an appearance as if this was some kind of grand career move. Wil Wheaton plays a snot nose little brat whom Williams must take down school wise. The special effects form many objects and fancy the mind with music but screenplay isn't quite so lucky. Pointless puke family crap that eventually turns to guck. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

It was in the scene where Weebo released the flabby "flubbers" and saw them multiply and soon began dancing. It was a great scene; that one I love! It was an impressive vocal by the way in what movie was it. My other suspects would be Inva Mula and Mado Robins.

It's nice to invent a gooey green subtance which generates energy, but a totally different thing is to give it a personality. Well, come on, it's just chemicals in an experiment. Also, robots that have emotions and intelligence are not feasible, not to mention them falling in love, or "dying".With that said, the movie still could have been made FUNNY, especially with Robin Williams. However, the funny parts of the script were cut to a minimum, leaving only CGI pyrotechnics. Well, I didn't go to this movie to see CGI, I went for Robin Williams, which is my favorite actor, and discovered that even a great actor can't save a bad script.The script was so unamusing, that I would have stopped watching it in the middle if I weren't with my girlfriend.

		<fullReview>"Flubber" is nothing special or extraordinary, but it is a funny one although, for such, it's important not to take it too seriously, otherwise...While certainly not a great movie, the movie is very underrated and for sure not as bad as many people make it sound. It's one of those movies which I think people tend to exaggerate on their criticisms. Of course that this is just my opinion. You don't have to agree with me, as long you respect my opinion in return.This is kind of a silly comedy, one of those made purely for laughing, fun and entertainment - its major priorities. To make sure it would be a crazy comedy, they chose «the man of the 1000 voices», Robin Williams, as the absent-minded/nutty scientist professor Philip Brainard. The result is, of course, a real scream, with this actor in a funny role instead of certain ridiculous roles he plays (such as that in "Birdcage"). Anyway, lots of humorous gags and laughs are a guarantee in this movie, even if the movie isn't super.Nevertheless, I seriously think that its biggest strenght is on its first half, while the second half is less funny, become a bit more ridiculous. But in general it is a watchable movie, one that is not as bad as you might think and also without bad stuff or bad surprises. I loved the Weebo character, just for the record.I confess that I never saw the original movie and I didn't know this was a "remake" of an old movie. But I hope to see the original sometime and compare them both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flubber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was young, this Walt Disney Pictures film used to be quite amusing, especially because I was a big fan of Robin Williams after what I saw in Aladdin and Mrs. Doubtfire, and it is still a pleasant film. Williams plays the really absent minded Professor Philip Brainard. He has tried two times before to marry his love, Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden), but he fails for a third time. The reason, because he has invented a living green chemical thing. It lives, it flies and it is like rubber, so he names it Flubber. He tries to win Sara's heart back by proving his new discovery works and can save the college from closing. Also starring Christopher McDonald as the mean Wilson Croft, Raymond J. Barry as Chester Hoenicker, Clancy Brown as Smith and Ted Levine as Wesson.. The special effects are great, Williams is amusing and the comedy is fun for the kids and adults together. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly underrated comedy classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what's with everybody, but I think this a great Robin Williams flick, and is truly underrated. It's been a while since I last saw this film before today. When I watched the movie, I forgot how funny the movie was. I was rolling by how funny some of the gags made in this movie. It's definitely worth more than a 4.7. I really didn't see what was so bad about the movie. It's definitely worth it for your whole family to take a look at. It may not be the best comedy of 1997 (Liar Liar is. Hands down.), but it's definitely the best Disney comedy in a long time. It's also John Hughes best since Home Alone. John Hughes best of all is Save Ferris! (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). But anyways, if you want to see a good clean comedy, see Flubber, because I thought it was a very entertaining Disney flick (and I'm fourteen) so that's showing something that it's not just for kids. It can also be for teens and adults. A movie highly recommended! 10/10. But as for the average it's not a movie everyone will vote a ten. As the average, it desrves from 6.5-7.0/10. Not a 4.7.</fullReview>

Except a few scenes everything is like in The Absent Minded Professor. Only with better effects.I gave this movie a 3 out of 10 for 2 reasons: 1.

		<fullReview>A few good jokes, tolerable special effects, that's all. This film doesn't try to be a great piece of art, it wants nothing else than to entertain people, mainly children. And for children and also other people who don't think about it any longer, it's fun and therefore able to bring the producers a lot of money. For people like me, it rather hurts. A machine falling in love with a professor? Is that cute? A man who misses his wedding three times? Not really. Luckily, we're told in no uncertain terms that John Hughes is responsible for this: the "Home Alone`-head-bangings come up again and again. And everybody's laughing...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When your most interesting character is a computer, you've got problems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Flubber" is based upon that old comedy cliché, the absent-minded scientific genius. The central character, Professor Philip Brainard, is a brilliant inventor who has not only invented a robot that will do the housework for him but has also cracked the artificial intelligence problem by producing Weebo, a computer with its own personality that can not only talk to him but also fly. At present he is working on "flubber", a rubbery substance that will allow cars and other objects to fly through the air. For all his intellectual brilliance, however, his private life is so disorganised that he has forgotten to turn up to his own wedding to his attractive sweetheart Sara, not once but three times.The plot turns upon Brainard's attempts to produce his flubber, which he sees as a solution to the financial problems confronting the college at which he teaches and of which Sara is the principal. (Like another reviewer, I found myself wondering why he didn't just try marketing his domestic robot or his talking computer, inventions which I thought would have had just as much commercial potential). Along the way, he has to fight off Wilson, the handsome but too smooth principal of another college who is his rival for Sara's affections, and a corrupt businessman who wants to use the flubber for his own selfish ends.The film was clearly designed as a comedy for children, and works quite well as such, aided by a good deal of slapstick humour, mostly involving Robin Williams as Brainard. Unlike some children's films, however, such as the "Harry Potter" series, this one does not have much in it to keep adults entertained. Williams is clearly a talented comedian, but strangely enough, with a few exceptions such as "Mrs Doubtfire", he has been most successful in films with a serious purpose like "Dead Poets Society" or "Good Morning Vietnam", although even in these he often manages to find a use for his comic talents. In many of his comedies his talents just seem wasted. "Club Paradise" is an example, and "Flubber" is another. All the other characters, with one exception, just seem like stock figures with little individuality about them.The one exception is Weebo the computer. The British computer pioneer Alan Turing devised what has since become known as the "Turing Test" for deciding whether a machine can be said to be intelligent. A human judge engages in a conversation with two other parties, one a human and the other a machine; if the judge cannot tell which is which, the machine is said to pass the test. Unfortunately, if the human involved were one of those in this film, Weebo would fail the test. She (Weebo has a female voice and personality) is smart, funny, sensitive and lovable, much more so than anyone else in the film, so it would be easy to tell them apart. And when your most interesting character is an electronic rather than a flesh-and-blood one, your film has got problems. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember one Christmas i wanted this film, it was 1998, i was 4 years old. I don't know what attracted me to this film, i don't even think there was a cinema near me when this film was out. It must've been an ad on TV or something, i can't remember but at least i got it in the end!My mum says i watched it loads of times, that's probably true. Then i stopped watching it, don't know why i can't remember. Now, the video's lost, and for some reason i've never bothered to by the DVD.Then, as i was reading the TV Guide, i realised it was on BBC1 on Sunday afternoon, of course not having seen it in years and years i decided to watch it, and it was still as enjoyable as it always was! Well okay, i probably enjoyed it a lot more when i was little but i still like it now! I definitely going to get my hands on that DVD someday.The film it's self is about a professor in financial trouble who invents a strange rubber substance with a life of it's own in an attempt to solve his money problems. However, his plan takes an unexpected turn, leading to all sorts of crazy happenings!So overall, this film is fun and suitable for the whole family.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Flubber" flubs it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of Disney's 1961 classic, "The Absent-Minded Professor", stars Robin Williams as Professor Philip Brainard, who invents a hyperelastic polymer which returns more energy than is put into it. This basically means that if you throw it at something, it will bounce back harder than you threw it. He names his invention "Flubber" (flying rubber).For reasons never explained, Flubber's amazing hyper-elasticity also allows it to hover, change course in mid-air and dance the mambo. And in a remarkable stroke of luck for Hollywood's legions of character animators, Flubber is also intelligent and imbued with a lively and playful personality.No Disney movie these days is complete without a cute little sidekick-who-messes-things-up-but-then-saves-the-day. In "Flubber" this role is played by "Weebo", a flying pet robot that Brainard invented. Strangely enough, while scientists, car companies and bad guys are all getting excited about flubber's potential for flying, no one seems to give a passing thought to Weebo's fully functional Artificial Intelligence and apparent mastery of antigravity.Okay. so Disney films aren't meant to be physics dissertations, but it would have been nice if at least one of Newton's laws of motion had survived more than three minutes beyond Flubber's first appearance. If you wonder why your kid is failing science, look no further.Robin Williams is wasted in this movie. He has few, if any, good lines, and his hyperactive humour never seems to go much beyond dodging flubber-propelled projectiles.If you enjoy watching glassware get smashed up and seeing bad guys get hit on the head with bowling balls -- repeatedly -- then maybe you'll enjoy "Flubber".Personally, I preferred the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flubbery flop of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was greatly dissapointed in this film. It was supposed to be a remake of the older Dinsey hit, "The absent minded Proffessor". Which I think was released around the late 1950's, or early 60's. That film was a Disney classic, but this was just another flubbery flop of a remake. The plot is an absent minded proffessor has just asked his girlfriend to marry him(I think for the fourth time), but every time he leaves her standing at the alter because he forgets. And his hovering robot friend Weebo always "forgets" to tell him(because the robot is jealous of his girlfriend). So to prove himself he shows her his newest invention Flubber, a gooey substance with(regretably) a mind of it's own. She shows no interest, so he takes it to a highschool basketball game. You kind of know what's going to happen next. Although the acting was decent(more so on Robin Williams behalf,but you can tell he couldn't fully get into his normal kind of acting, because of the other actors. He could obviously not get through to them as he did with the actors in Hook,and other movies like that.)It's a story of how one absent minded proffessor, wins back the day with FLUBBER. I was dissapointed in this film, and only little kids would be entertained by it's slapstick comedy. 2 and a half/5 stars. note.-I saw an early commercial for this movie and they actually had it advertised as, "the absent minded proffessor)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately Pretty Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flubber can be imaginative with its usage of the special effects, but the movie can also seem dull and uninvolving (perhaps it's because most of the settings in Flubber look murky). The pacing is leisurely and script tends resort to some tiresome slapstick throughout. Every once in a while, some interest and/or some energy can be generated but the special effects in certain areas serve more as an exhibition that really doesn't bare a connection with the story and feels like padding in the process. For example, there's a dance sequence involving the Flubber. Scenes on certain occasions feel stretched out and the movie at one point, throws in an absolutely manipulative thread into the story.</fullReview>

In "AMP", Fred MacMurray's Brainard explains what Flubber can be used for and why it works. In "Flubber", Robin Williams' Brainard discovers Flubber and just starts doing stupid things. Many of "Flubber"'s scenes have nothing to do with the story, (Example: The scene with the dancing Flubbers was only there to make children laugh and to show off 3-D technology). And then there's the scene where Brainard and his "love interest" mourn the death of a robot. YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING!</fullReview>

His rival, Wilson Croft (Christopher McDonald), plots to steal her away and the Flubber from Brainard. A corrupt businessman Chester Hoenicker (Raymond Barry) tries to force Brainard to pass his failing son Bennett (Wil Wheaton), but he soon takes an interest in Flubber after hearing about it from his flunkies (Clancy Brown, Ted Levine). After using Flubber to fly over clouds in his 1963 T-Bird, Brainard realizes Flubber can also improve the performance of the school's pathetic basketball team. I laughed at some parts of this remake, but I don't think you should mess with the originals. Flubber isn't one of Robin Williams' better roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Flubber!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Meet Professor Phillip Brainard, a very intelligent but very absent-minded professor. He spends his time performing experiments and inventing things. He's got a chore-performing machine Weber and a small flying companion named Weebo. Today was an important day for Phillip but he could not remember what it is he was supposed to do. Weebo was supposed to remind him but chose not to. Today was Phillip's wedding day! He would be marrying fellow college professor Sara Jean Reynolds. This would be the third try. They tried this several times before and Phillip just kept forgetting. At Medford University, which was in trouble because greedy businessman Chester Hoenicker was trying to shut it down, Phillip began teaching the wrong class, then he's later visited by rival Rutland college professor Wilson Croft. They compete for many things, including Sara. That night, Phillip began experimenting some more and mixed a whole bunch of chemical and biochemicals together and KABOOOM!! An explosion rocked the lab but created a small, green, flexible compound. It was elastic, bendable, flexible, moldable, and very bouncy. When Weebo tried to take its picture, it bounced all over the room and out into the neighborhood. Phillip luckily caught the flying rubber and named it Flubber. Meanwhile at the church, the wedding was set. The bride was there, so was the minister, witnesses, bride's mates. One thing missing: the groom. He was still at home experimenting with Flubber. He tried to make it controllable but by then it was 6:30 in the morning. He had missed his wedding. Phillip tried to apologize to Sara but she wouldn't even talk to him. He tried showing her Flubber but she didn't care a bit. A student of Phillip's, Bennet Hoenicker, had been given failing grades and kicked out of the university and his father had "arranged" it for Bennett to get straight A's. Naturally when they talked that over with Phillip he forgot so Hoenicker sent his two bumbling goons Smith and Wesson to Phillip's house to find something to blackmail him with. At his home, Phillip had turned Flubber into a cream solution as well as a liquid solution. He applied the cream to a golf ball which bounced all over the room and hit Smith in the head. He next tried it on a bowling ball which bounced all over the room and hit Wesson in the head. Both balls then flew into the air. Phillip then attached the controllable chemical Flubber to his car, rendering it airbourne. He and Weebo went for a fly that night. They nearly crash into a few houses but the view is extraordinary. Phillip shuts off the engine but then they start plummeting back to Earth. Luckily the car started again before they crash. They get a glimpse of Wilson and Sara together. They made a little wager on the university basketball game and if Wilson's team won, Sara would accompany him to a stay in the mountains. Phillip just had to help Medfield win. Phillip applied some liquid Flubber to the basketball and the player's shoes and the game was on! In the first quarter, the big bad Rutland players beat the small, puny Medfield but then the Flubber took effect and Medfield was flying all over the court and won the game! Phillip tried to tell Sara it was Flubber that won but she still wouldn't listen. Phillip returned home distraught. Weebo felt sorry for him so she recorded him saying how much he loved Sara then Weebo went to Sara's house and played it for her. So they finally make up. Next they go to Ford to try and market the flying car. Also that night, Smith and Wesson break into Phillip's lab and steal the Flubber. They destroy poor Weebo in the process. Phillip and Sara return home too late. Weebo completely lost power by then but before she went out, she told them a word, "Stork". Phillip punches it up and it was a file Weebo had made with a message for Phillip and plans for her daughter, Weebette. Phillip and Sara then fly to Hoenicker's house. Phillip was mad and it was time for a showdown. With the help of liquid Flubber, they give Smith, Wesson, Bennett, Chester and even Wilson who was in cahoots with them, a workout they deserve. Well, in conclusion, Phillip and Sara are finally married and go on their honeymoon with Flubber and Weebette. I'm afraid I didn't like this movie very well. I'm a big Robin Williams fan but this is one movie of his I didn't like. I like the Flubber effects and all but that's it! It's based on the 1962 film The Absent-Minded Professor. Christopher McDonald is here too, so are Marcia Gay Harden and Edie McClurg. I wish Robin Williams would do comedies again, all the films he's been doing lately are serious. That's no good! But anyway, I don't really recommend Flubber, but if you want something that will entertain your kids, then for you I recommend Flubber but that's it.-</fullReview>

Too violent!They didn't use the Flubber very much, only in the creation scene, and in the scene where a robot invention lets it out of its tank.I did think the part where the Flubber bounced all over town was funny because it was bouncing all over everything and making shape imitations of the things it saw. I wish it had done more of that.I would recommend it, except for the kissing scenes, and the painful scenes of getting hit in the head. Why did they put that in?

Here Williams plays a tad introverted, brilliant scientist who invents a substance that's highly kinetic which leads to the usual assortment of hi-jinks and hilarious situations involving the bouncy substance. I say "hilarious" depending upon your take of Robin Williams and your sense of humor. I've reached the point where for now I don't like the material Williams decides to appear in. Perhaps he's just run his course with me or maybe it's just these types of movies.In Flubber's defense, I think it was primarily made for children. I find it hard to see this movie being aimed at anyone over sixteen years of age. It's a Disney movie starring Robin Williams after all. Not Spartacus by any length of the imagination. That's it's own explanation. This is indeed a kids movie. If your young, I'm sure this movie is delightful. All a child's mind asks is to be entertained. In this case, see Robin Williams in all of his glorious silliness, mugging it for the camera, and to laugh over some popcorn or candy. It's harmless and it's forgettable. Like-minded adults are forewarned.</fullReview>

There is this part where Phillip's car is flying. Phllip makes goo and it starts acting like the goo is a human. Well Sara and her other husband make a deal that if the team wins they go out to dinner but if they lose they go to the mountains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flubber was an excellent movie. There was excellent dialog, and the story line was one of a kind! Children of all ages will enjoy this exquisite movie! Flubber starts off as a ball of flubb. A science experiment goes horribly wrong, and suddenly, the ball of flubb that was, becomes an unstoppable machine, much like the terminator. The mad scientist (played by the great singer Robbie Williams, who sings such greats as "Lets be a Better Man" and "Doing it with the Kids")is a kooky old dude with an attitude to kill. The special effects are amazing, as the director has managed to capture the true essence of flubb. Viewers will be amazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time for some wacky, funny, scientific fun with Robin Williams as he takes the stage as the "Absent-Minded Professor" in Disney's 1997 remake of that movie, known simply as "Flubber!!!!!"He has a robot assistant, Weebo, and he was late (again) for his wedding, all because he was making "flubber," flying rubber as it was known. He used the flubber to try to explain everything about his no-show, from falling off his classroom window (which didn't work), to a high-flying basketball game!!!!!"Flubber" is one of those films that is better than the original. Sure, both are excellent pieces of "genius," but this one blows the competition away. Which is why I give it 10 stars!!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have just watched Flubber for the first time. I expected to be disappointed since I was such a fan of Fred MacMurray's version. Who else could do justice to the role of the absent-minded professor! I was to soon learn that Robin Williams can (and did). It was a delightful movie with no profanity or vulgarity. I can't say there wasn't any violence, but it was humorous violence, and one realized that nobody was really hurt. I felt really good and uplifted after watching and, unfortunately, I can't say that about most any movie nowadays. There were some very funny moments. I particularly liked the little boy who saw things that weren't really there (according to his father, that is). Of course, it was the brilliant comedic acting of Robin Williams that made the movie a success!</fullReview>
