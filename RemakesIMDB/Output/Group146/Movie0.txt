		<shortDescription>Good Fun for the Whole Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been years since I have seen this movie! I am glad to see that it is still fun and my girls really enjoyed (4 &amp; 6). What was kinda neat was that the Alonzo Hawk character also returns in Herbie Rides Again (same actor, same personality). Small coincidence, because the movie was also directed by Robert Stevenson.So, if you are looking for a film that will not offend, and offer a few chuckles and will captivate your child's attention, check out The Absent Minded Professor.Also, IMHO, do not wast time with the Flubber remake.CheersC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic MacMurray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best live action films Disney has ever released. Fred MacMurray once again proved how great a comedic actor he was and this film is just a confirmation of it. Also, Nancy Olson was great as his frustrated fiancee, Betsy. However, the real scene stealer in this film is Keenan Wynne as old man Hawk. Mr. Hawk was probably one of the biggest weasels in cinematic history and Tommy Kirk is also great as his son Biff.Also, the best scene in the whole film is the basketball game. That scene alone is what makes this film a classic comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Absent Minded ProfessorClassic family from from Walt Disney that stars Fred MacMurray in the title role as a rather forgetful and absent minded professor who invents a strange putty substance that drives him and his close contacts bonkers. The movie is much more inspired, likable and family-friendly (not to mention funnier and more charming) than the remake starring Robin Williams, which was written by John Hughes long after his career had fallen downwards. This version is the definitive version--don't let the kiddies convince you to rent the other one before you see this one!**** / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Bounce To The Ounce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Absentminded Professor was the second film that Fred MacMurray in his second career rebirth with Walt Disney as the midwife. He scored an enormous success in The Shaggy Dog and Disney films together with his My Three Sons TV series established MacMurray as the quintessential family father figure which would endure for the rest of his life.I do remember seeing this in the theater back as a youngster and back then the younger ones in the crowd were looking at Tommy Kirk who was at the height of his Disney popularity. Nevertheless MacMurray gives a delightful performance as science professor Ned Brainerd who's accidentally invented a variation on rubber which has a great deal more bounce to it.He's so wrapped up in his experiment that he's even forgetting his wedding day to Nancy Olson, AGAIN. She's about had it with him and ready to fall for the wolfish English professor Elliott Reid.MacMurray has his own troubles. Other than helping his college win a basketball game with a team that they are way overmatched against, he's not quite decided what use this stuff he calls flubber is good for. But wealthy Keenan Wynn sure wants to get his hands on it.Funniest sequence in the film is Keenan Wynn after MacMurray and Olson trick him into wearing flubberized shoes is seeing bounce slowly into the stratosphere before a quick thinking Tommy Kirk devises a way to counteract his flubberized dad.The AbsentMinded Professor was so popular with audiences that Disney did another version with almost the entire same cast in Son of Flubber.That one was almost as funny, but this still has a lot of laughs even after almost fifty years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch This Fun, Screwball Romp - but ONLY If You Are Not Jaded and Have Lost Sight of What Simple Fun Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is time this movie is reviewed by its positive qualities and not just centered on how utterly sophisticated the reviewer would like to be remembered by the readers of IMDB.com.First of all, let me say there is nothing wrong with "hokum" or old American values or screwball comedies or old Disney movies. As with anything, it's always in the eye of the beholder. This movie was fun to watch and funny in enough places to warrant a watch by any self-respecting human being with a warm sense of humor.Second of all, The Absent-Minded Professor elicited a wonderful collection of chuckles from me. Perhaps I didn't expect them...but they did come and especially in one joyful moment during a basketball game. Believe me, I am not even an NBA fan...but that scene cured a lot of ills. Maybe it was my frame of mind on that particular day. But, the record stands that I did laugh, and with some old-fashioned "glee", I might add.Third of all, I believe comedies are sometimes taken too seriously: As if we were supposed to come away with some vastly profound elucidation from the experience. Fourth of all, one has to be rather shallow not to appreciate the the wonderful collection of character actors in this and many Disney movies - before the prohibitive cost of making movies made it impossible to have a diverse collection of actors. I miss this kind of movie where character actors litter the celluloid landscape as if in some garden of earthly theatrical delights "a la Frank Capra or Preston Sturges".One last thing, it was a travesty that this 1961 movie, though nominated for some Oscars, did not win at least in the Technical categories. Yes, it's goofy to us in these 'Post-2001 A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, ET, Independence Day' times, but all of them owe a bit of thanks to the legacy of the past. And this movie is part of that legacy of fun effects which advanced us ever so kindly into our present state of "sophistication", and sometimes, Ungrateful Complacency and Ennui.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Absent-Minded Professor was a typical Disney classic that I watched when I was younger. In short, this film is about a professor who creates an anti-gravity substance known as 'flubber'. This substance makes his car fly, sort of reminiscent of the car in 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. Of course, someone is trying to kidnap this idea, and it's up to some children to save the day.I am not sure what children today would think of this film, but I did find it enjoyable, and I would have seen it in the mid-1980s. I would like to think that children today would find it just as enjoyable and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old movie; now we know what Flubber actually is!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney made this movie in 1961. "The Absent Minded Professor" is about, well, see the title!!!!! He makes this flying rubber stuff known as "Flubber," and it can do many things from bounce off walls to making automobiles fly in the sky!!!!!This was seen in two versions: the colorized version, which I recall played on the Old Disney Channel so many times, and the B&amp;W version, the version that I had seen first. My family rented this original version on VHS back in January 1998.And now, check out what I found in the trivia section: a recipe for Flubber:"To one pound of salt water taffy add one heaping tablespoon polyurethane foam, one cake crumbled yeast. Mix till smooth, allow to rise. Then pour into saucepan over one cup cracked rice with one cup water. Add topping of molasses. Boil till lid lifts and says 'Qurlp'."As Bill Nye says, "Well Now You Know!!!!!"10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was younger, Fred MacMurray was my Colin Farrell. He was everywhere, and never seemed to make a bad movie. Sure, they might be campy and silly, but that's what works for a younger age group. And this one holds up. The flubber is quite possibly one of the neatest inventions in movie history. And though the Robin Williams remake gave it the new age CGI, the black and white gives the movie such a good feel. I still get a kick out of Fred torturing the man trying to muscle in on his girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I saw this with our four young sons when it was first released, and we thought it was great. We have seen it several times since, and it is always entertaining. Unlike some critics, I thought Fred MacMurray was perfect in the title role, and the supporting cast was great. The humor may seem a bit unsophisticated and hokey by present day standards, but in my eyes it makes the movie even more enjoyable. Show this film to your unprejudiced younger children and grandchildren and watch them delight in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original 'Flubber' Is A Bit Dated But Has Its Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some parts of this are very funny, some parts are silly stupid and all parts are very dated and make little sense. Maybe that's why someone figured a re-make was appropriate. That, and the fact that it's still a very entertaining movie, almost a classic. The re-make was done in 1997 with the movie, "Flubber."Fred MacMurray, Nancy Olson, Keenan Wynn, Tommy Kirk.....wow, there are some familiar names from the '50s and '60s Olson had lost her youthful looks from "Sunset Boulevard," but that had been a decade earlier. MacMurray didn't look a whole lot different from his 1944 film noir classic of "Double Indemnity," proving once again how much better men age than women.Kids of today would still laugh at this film, although they have dead spots in here which are not prevalent in modern-day films.</fullReview>

I was an unsophisticated kid, who didn't see too many movies in my youth, and those I did see tended towards the non-controversial. I'm glad they did, there was plenty of time for me to learn about "sex, drugs, and rock and roll later in my movie-going career. MacMurray, Kirk, and Wynn (and the others) played their roles to perfection, leaving me in open-mouthed admiration.

		<shortDescription>Great classic family film for the whole family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie when I was a kid, and was happy to share it with my own kids when they were small some 35 years later. I think a film that can be shared from generation to generation like that qualifies it as a classic.I never saw the original release but saw it as a kid on its re-release to theaters around 1975. I thought it was hilarious then. Yes, it looks a little dated now, but what film that is almost 50 years old doesn't. I think my favorite character was the dog, Charlie. He was just too cute, and the way he could perk his ears up on command. He had as much expression as any of the actors! The special effects for the time were quite good - and garnered a Oscar nomination for special effects. My favorite part as a kid was the flying car. AMP did this 7 years before "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" came out in 1968.Fred McMurray is extremely adept as his portrayal of the clichéd absent-minded professor. It would have been easy for the part to come off as an almost cartoon caricature. But he makes it seem realistic and believable. I'm impressed at his range of acting talent - as in his classic film noir "Double Indemnity" to this lighthearted comedy. I also think Keenan Wynn is very good as loan shark Alonzo Hawk.While my kids enjoyed this when they were small, they would probably consider it "lame" now as teenagers. But I still believe this is a great family film for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually a very fun movie. And also somewhat funny. It is more of an entertaining story than an outright comedy. I saw this on AMC and the guy presenting it said The Absent Minded Professor is Disney's second live action film. He also pointed out that a remake of this was made starring the late Robin Williams. Anyway, the special effects are dated (if you can actually call them special effects) but the scenes with the Professor's car lifting into the air and flying off are somewhat magically; especially in black and white. This film is fun for all ages and I highly recommend it. The movie is about a scientist who keeps forgetting his wedding because he is so focused on his experiments. He ends up inventing a substance with exponential potential energy and uses it to make a flying car, help basketball players win a game and help him win back the heart of his soon to be bride. Like I said, it is fun and you'll enjoy it. I'm not sure why it is only ranking around a 6.8 on IMDb but whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fred MacMurray and Flubber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie all the time when I was a little kid. we have it on DVD and my sister and I would watch it constantly. Even though I haven't seen it in years I can still remember plenty of scenes. Professor Ned Brainerd (Fred MacMurray) is a professor at Medfield College, who is known for (among other things) constantly missing his wedding to the school president's secretary Betsy Carlisle (Nancy Olson). The day Betsy finally gives up on Ned is also the day that Ned discovers flying rubber and tries to interest the school, the government, and Betsy into the idea of using it. Unfortunately the only person interested is greedy businessman Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn). And when Hawk steals the flying rubber it's up to Ned to get it back. It's a very entertaining film, and the Hawk character would go on to appear in 2 other Disney films, Herbie Rides Again and Son of Flubber. The acting for the most part is good and MacMurray is really fun to watch here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Stevenson directed this Disney comedy that stars Fred MacMurray as Medfield College professor Brainard, an absent-minded man who can't even remember his own wedding, who invents a new substance that is a kind of flying rubber he names Flubber, which he uses on his Model T car or on the shoes of the basketball team to make them jump higher. Only crooked businessman Alonzo Hawk(played by Keenan Wynn) has faith in the discovery, but of course he wants to steal it for himself, and tries to enlist his son Biff(played by Tommy Kirk) to help him. Silly film has some funny scenes but is just too lightweight and the comedy too broad to succeed. Mostly for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent live action Disney fare, definitely better than the 1997 remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Flubber", starring Robin Williams, more than once in the late 90's, I guess when it was new to the video format, but never knew it was a remake until I saw it again last year, probably for the first time since late last decade, and wasn't all that impressed (not sure exactly what I thought of it before). Over a year later, I've finally seen the original, "The AbsentMinded Professor", a live action Disney flick released in 1961, starring Fred MacMurray. I wasn't absolutely blown away by it, nor was I expecting to be, but I was expecting it to be better than its 1997 remake, with more laughs, and I think my moderate expectations were basically met.Ned Brainard is an absent-minded physical chemistry professor at Medfield College. On the day of the third wedding attempt (the professor failed to show up the first two times), Betsy Carlisle, his fiancée, waits for him, hoping he will show up this time. Unfortunately, he gets carried away with his experiments, trying to uncover the mysteries of the universe, and despite how hard his housekeeper tries to remind him about his wedding, she does not succeed. However, he does discover a powerful new substance, which he calls "Flubber"! Every time this substance hits a hard surface, it gains energy! He attempts to bring attention to this new discovery of his, but his efforts prove unsuccessful, as people are generally skeptical. It only seems to catch the attention of Alonzo P. Hawk, a scheming businessman who threatens the future of the college, and plans to use Flubber for his personal gain! For me, "The AbsentMinded Professor" was far from consistently hilarious, but there were definitely times when I laughed, even if the laughs were usually light. When I wasn't laughing, I think I was often smiling. A couple explosions early in the film, plus the main character playing tricks with his flying Model-T, getting his foe in trouble with the police one night, and some of the other things done with the Flubber, to be good comical moments, some more than others. MacMurray plays a likable lead, and the story is also interesting enough. Such scenes as the flying car ones are memorable, which brings me to the special effects. For the time, special effects like this were obviously an accomplishment. Sure, the effects in the 1997 remake are obviously superior, since it came 36 years later, but this 1961 film still deserves praise for the effects, and as for the remake, well, the special effects aren't enough to make up for the flaws in that film.This live action film from Walt Disney Pictures may be a bit dated now. I guess it hasn't aged as well as many other movies from around the same time or before, and probably can't please as many people today as it could upon its original release in the early 60's, during its box office success. However, it's probably still entertaining for many different age groups today, though maybe just to a lesser degree than before. "Flubber" obviously has more modern aspects than "The AbsentMinded Professor", but had potential to be so much better than it turned out to be, especially with Robin Williams in the lead role, and its predecessor remains superior. Even after all this time, this is a reasonable family film, clean and lighthearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still as funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was years ago when I saw this great movie in the cinema and I can recall the belly laughs. Viewing again I was surprised and delighted that it is still hilariously funny. You don't get those belly laughs that often. THe basket ball game with the flubber is a scream, I was sick with laughter. The effects are as stunning now as when I first saw it. As for those scenes in the car it s simply amazing. I was surprised to see the film in colour as I thought it was in black and white, perhaps I am thinking of reruns on TV. Fred McMurray was perfect. You actually don't like him at first because missing the wedding three times is an incredibly cruel thing to do but once you see his passion for inventing and the love he really has for his fiancé it really does not matter. You warm to the character and he is just perfect for the role. Nancy Olson is no sickly sweet Disney leading lady and she gives a lively spirited performance. I used to hate it when women just stood back in fight scenes biting their hands looking terrified but Nancy is actually a gutsy gal. Keenan Wynn is a fine nasty and there's a lovely little cameo by the great Ed Wynn, Keenan's incredibly famous father. The gorgeous and brilliantly talented Tommy Kirk is there too. What a superb talent this guy was. I hope he is still alive and doing well. Tommy was loved by many fans! I loved the reliable older actors especially the two cops, great performances and of course the wonderful house keeper or maid. Its a gem.</fullReview>

So much was I into this that in Christmas of 1962, my parents bought a 1/2 scale Model T (gasoline engine, you can see them on Ebay if you look for mini model T) as the present of my life.

		<shortDescription>A funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Double Indemnity" and "The Apartment" Fred MacMurray proved adept at drama. In this Disney, family comedy he shows his strenght as a comedic actor. MacMurray plays Ned Brainerd, a collegiate professor who devises an invention, "Flubber" (flying rubber) which is super-bouncy and allows his car to defy gravity. A rich alumni, Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) wishes to get his hands on the invention and the millions of dollars it is guaranteed to garner, so he uses under-handed methods to try to wrest control of Ned's spectacular discovery. Their is good humor throughout this movie, particularly when Hawk's desires become known to Ned and Ned uses "Flubber" to make Hawk bounce out-of-control. This film is one of the Disney Company's first comedies and one can only wish that their later one's are half-as-funny as this early venture. This movie gets a grade of A- and a very strong recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small town chemistry professor, known for his forgetful, befuddled nature yet something of a closet science-genius as well, accidentally creates a rubbery substance in his garage laboratory which generates its own energy (flying rubber--or, as Fred MacMurray keeps reminding us, Flubber). Trouble is, he can't seem to get anyone's attention long enough to explain his discovery (flying his car around the city at night instead of in the daytime probably doesn't help). Sub-plot about the college's main financial contributor hoping to close the campus and turn it into a supermarket is fatuous padding, and the caveat that his son (Tommy Kirk) is the number one player on the college basketball is unintentionally funny (sleepy, despondent Kirk looks ready for nap). Box-office hit most likely squeaked by on its special effects; those not in the mood for leaping, bouncing slapstick can amuse themselves by counting the number of times the editor cuts to MacMurray's dog for quizzical reactions. Sweetheart Nancy Olson's pained expressions run them a close second. Followed by "Son of Flubber" in 1963; reworked as "Flubber" in 1997. ** from ****</fullReview>

Despite all the precautions, he still can't make it to the ceremony after a lab accident which creates an incredible substance Flubber. Professor Shelby Ashton is all too happy to pick up the pieces with Betsy. Ruthless businessman Alonzo Hawk is threatening the college by withholding a loan renewal and building track housing over the college. He is also not happy with Brainard's treatment of his failing son. Brainard keeps failing to explain Flubber to Betsy. Alonzo Hawk figures out Brainard's secret and looking to make a bundle off of Flubber. However, Brainard wants to give his discovery over to the government.This black and white Disney film is fun magic for the first hour. Fred MacMurray is full of charms. I really like the small town feel. It's so much fun. The only drawback is the involvement of the military. It doesn't feel like the right fit for a fun family movie. Also it doesn't make sense that people still don't believe him after seeing it in action. The second half does have its silly charms and its idiotic fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Absent-Minded Professor was the 1961 Disney classic about a nerdy college professor, delightfully played by Fred MacMurray, who invents an anti-gravity substance that comes to be known as "flubber", which he uses to make his automobile airborne and help his college's basketball team finally w in a few games, while keeping a corrupt local businessman (Keenan Wynn) from stealing the substance for itself.After playing an adulterous slimeball the previous year in The Apartment, MacMurray proved that he could play a nice guy too and pretty much carved out an entire new career for himself, which included the TV series MY THREE SONS and a few more Disney comedies. Nancy Olson is lovely as the professor's neglected girlfriend and great veterans like Elliott Reed, Edward Andrews, and Leon Ames register in key supporting roles.Bill Walsh's screenplay is well-mounted by Robert Stevenson, whose next directorial assignment would be a little thing called Mary Poppins. The film was followed by a sequel called Son of Flubber and was remade in 1997 as Flubber with Robin Williams. 7.5/10</fullReview>

Could the flying Jesus in "Vita" measure up to Nancy Olson and Fred spooning amid the clouds in the Flubberized Model T? I think not. And forget the menage a trois in "Jules and Jim". I prefer the sexual tension between Fred, Nancy, and Elliot Reid.And Flubber will finally be put to good use for the benefit of all the civilized nations of the worlds.I love this movie. You will too. God Bless America. And Fred MacMurray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absent-Minded Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man creates flying rubber in his garage using gamma rays, blissfully unaware of what gamma radiation can do to the human body. A stupid but enjoyable comedy from Disney, with MacMurray well cast in the title role. Olson is his ever-patient fiancé. Interestingly, the movie careers of MacMurray and Olson peaked in a pair of Billy Wilder classics, "Double Indemnity" and "Sunset Blvd.," respectively. This film is aimed at the kiddie set and they should find it generally amusing. The basketball game is funny initially but becomes repetitive, thanks to the uninspired direction. The last part in Washington seems to be tacked on just to make sure the movie is long enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Disney Hokum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a good idea was this deemed to be that Paramount followed it with Jerry Lewis in "The Nutty Professor" two years later. This being a Disney production, we know what to expect, and we certainly get it. Cheerful, brainless nonsense is the order of the day, with generous helpings of good old American domestic values.Medfield College is a pleasant small-town campus peopled with pleasant clean-cut students and staff, and conspicuous among the latter is Ned Brainard, the Absent-Minded Professor. He is so engrossed in his scientific experiments that he forgets to show up at his own wedding - not once, but three times. The lame stereotypes come thick and fast as the barmy prof blows up his own lab. Just as nutty scientists are supposed to do, he builds a labyrinth of bubbling tubes and flasks in his own garage - and this, too, blows up.The eccentric professor (played solidly and reliably by Fred MacMurray) discovers a marvellous anti-gravity gunge which he christens flying rubber, or 'flubber'. He fits his Model T Ford with 'the goo that flew'. Naturally, being an absent-minded professor, he is still driving a Model T in 1961. And naturally, he is able to fly his flubber-enhanced car around the airspace of Medfield town. However, all is not well. Betsy, his long-suffering fiancee, has grown tired of being stood up at the altar, and has started dating the nerdy Professor Shelby Ashton.Medfield College is in difficulties. Funds are low, and Alonzo P. Hawk, the rapacious local entrepreneur, is seeking to develop the campus as a housing estate. Keenan Wynne plays the villain Hawk with great relish. His son Biff has been excluded from the College basketball team because of bad grades (having been flunked in chemistry class by Prof Brainard), and without this star player, the Medfield team is being trounced by Rutland College at half-time. The eccentric professor saves the day by ironing flubber onto the soles of the Medfield players' gym shoes, and the home team bounces to victory.The scheming Alonzo Hawk steals the professor's flying car and replaces it with an ordinary Model T. Meanwhile, Betsy is going to the college dance with Prof Ashton. There is a genuinely funny scene in which Brainard paints flubber onto his own shoes and pings around the dance hall. Disappointment follows when the Pentagon top brass come to see the new invention, but the 'dud' car won't fly. All is not lost - at least Brainard gets his girl back, because Betsy feels sorry for the bewildered genius and promises to help him recover his flubbermobile.The production is not exactly a lavish one. Shot in monochrome using simple sets, the film relies throughout on 'bouncing' jokes, as various characters discover the properties of gravity-defying flubber. The special effects are all fairly crude attempts to make people bounce and cars fly, using wires for lift and undercranking the camera. The written gags are weak, but the slapstick humour has a certain appeal.The plot's loose ends are neatly (and predictably) tied up, save that the Hawk-takes-over-the-campus theme is dropped without explanation. Brainard gets his car, Hawk is rescued from an uncontrollable flubber-bounce when he is tackled by the college football team, and the absent-minded professor flies his car to Washington to place his invention at Uncle Sam's disposal.Mildly enjoyable tosh as it is, the film somehow lacks gusto. The script is pedestrian and MacMurray, though likeable and photogenic, lacks the brio of Jerry Lewis.</fullReview>
