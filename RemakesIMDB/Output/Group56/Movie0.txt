		<shortDescription>Rock 'n roll update--not all that different, but dispiriting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unskilled, belligerent group of young boys on a losing Little League baseball team get an alcoholic coach who eventually cleans up their act--and his own. Any film-buff well acquainted with the 1976 Michael Ritchie film "The Bad News Bears" will watch this remake in a perpetual state of deprivation. For every new ingredient added (a kid in a wheelchair, Hooters waitresses on the sidelines, a skateband interlude), there's a classic sequence dropped, funny lines omitted, a bracing sense of importance missing, and uncharismatic, non-plussed child actors who walk through their roles colorlessly. Of course, Billy Bob Thornton is a terrific substitute for Walter Matthau, but Matthau didn't carry the original film all by himself, and Thornton isn't fully in-character anyway (he's just breezing through). The whole early morning feel of Southern California Little League is missing, and the urgency of the original is gone, too (those kids had something riding on these games). Director Richard Linklater obviously was fond of the 1976 version, but he knows the notes without hearing the music; he supplies updated comedic touches without seeing the relevancy, and his tone and narrative are doggedly straightforward (except for the strange opening sequence, which immediately gets the picture off on the wrong foot). A sad botch. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When filmmakers get the idea to remake a classic movie, often it's because he or she feels that something was missing from the original. They feel that, by placing their unique stamp on the new film, they can satisfy unanswered questions, plot points, etc, while maintaining the basic dignity and character of the original.So...based on that theory, Billy Bob Thornton's rationale for the remake of "The Bad News Bears" was that the original had too many letters in the title (in a bold and highly daring move reminiscent of Ed Wood at his finest, Thornton decided to drop "The", changing it simply to "Bad News Bears"), not enough swearing...and a kid in a wheelchair. Oh, and he changes enemy Yankee pitcher's last name from "Turner" to "Bullok" for reasons unbeknownst to anyone but himself. With revolutionary alterations such as these, don't be surprised if you pick up the rental box half a dozen times while watching the movie to make absolutely sure that you have indeed rented the correct film.Basically, the plot can be summed up as "Bad Santa coaches a group of misfit kids". Yawn. We've seen this role, this performance, from Billy Bob Thornton one too many times. Thornton wants to bowl us over with the 'shocking' vulgarity of youth, but a trip to "Hooters" and Tanner teaching a boy in a wheelchair to curse both turn out to be so lightweight that it is likely that only the Reverend Jerry Falwell would take offense.At best, the casting was marginal, and at worst, the audience is forced to wonder if the director actually auditioned the kids or merely closed his eyes and chanted 'Eenie, Meenie, Mynie, Mo" while holding a stack of acting resumes. Sammi Kane Kraft (as Amanda) was a great baseball player with limited acting ability, and Timmy Deters was only modestly successful in trying to recreate the role of Tanner Boyle. Tyler Patrick Jones as Timmy Lupus was far and away the most talented of what basically amounted to a mediocre cast of child actors, but he was utterly wasted in this film and was limited to a few one-liners that must have ended up on the cutting room floor from "Bad Santa". Naturally, Thornton is no match for the venerable Walter Matthau as Buttermaker. Whereas Matthau was irascible and cantankerous in a lovable 'Grandpa's dipping in the cider again' kind of way, Thornton's version of Buttermaker is creepy enough to make us think of adequate background checks and the stupidity of parents who would willingly leave their children alone with him.Per his film tradition in his post "Sling Blade" days, Thornton goes out of his way to remove any heartfelt sentiment from the plot, and thus the friendship between Timmy Lupus and Tanner Boyle never materializes. That adds to what is perhaps the most irritating part of the film: the introduction of a new player (Tony Gentile as Matthew Hooper). It is an unnecessary plot device, possibly added only because the always classy Thornton had some good 'kid in wheelchair' jokes that he was just itching to use, and adds a touch of surrealism to a movie that should be imminently grounded in realism. In fact, Thornton changes one of the most touching moments of the original movie by handing it to Hooper (a character who, let's face it, has no redeeming qualities other than the fact that he's in a wheelchair) in one highly unrealistic scene; he thereby successfully strips even more of the heart away from the original film. Which, judging from Thornton's film-making history, was probably exactly what he intended to do.In short, there are undoubtedly worse remakes out there ("War of the Worlds" and "Bewitched" come to mind), but not many. If you're thinking of renting this film because you're desperate for some true seventies banality, allow me to suggest that you save the money and instead try catching either the rerun of "Alice" where Flo says "Kiss my grits" for the eighteenth time or the action-packed episode of "My Three Sons" where Fred MacMurray lights his pipe. If you choose to rent the film anyway...well, don't say I didn't give you any other viable options.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Billy Bob - but he ain't no Walter Matthau. Every character is just plain flat - with nothing to act off of. You don't really care about anyone in the movie. Linklater is a much better director and you are better off watching any other movie that either he or Billy Bob has made. A waste of money all around in my opinion. Just go and watch the original - you won't regret it. (They won't let me make my comment unless I have 10 lines of text - but I have nothing else to say. Guess I'll just have to keep typing until they let this go through. Opps not enough yet - how about this time. Still not enough - I think this will make it)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who are they making this for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to know exactly who Mr. Linklater was trying to appeal to in this movie. Not only is the kids' sport genre tired, they are geared primarily for children most of the time. But with Billy Bob Thorton (who I thought was hilarious in "Bad Santa"), one would guess they are trying to bring in the older audiences.The movie feels like it has split personalities. There is a ton of swearing and adult humor that would definitely NOT appeal to parents of younger children, but many of the jokes just weren't funny to me because they were aimed at the younger children. The movie is not terrible, but its not good either. It is simply a forgettable movie, which is a shame because I think Richard Linklater is a great director and Billy Bob Thorton seems like a natural when it comes to comedic timing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible, just horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this had been the original, it never would have been remade. Here are my observations of where they went wrong: The original was well acted and believable. The remake was an over the top farce with some of the worst acting I've seen in a major motion picture in along time.In the original, Kelly and Amanda looked 12. In the remake, they looked 17. Watch them walking with the other Bears, they are about a foot taller.The Coach Turner character in the first was clearly defined. He was an over aggressive sports dad pushing his son and team relentlessly, eventually melting down and hitting his son in public. The audience was never given a feel for the new Turner, except that he was somewhat wimpy, but unreal as far as any person anyone has ever met.They removed the scene of Turner hitting his son, then telling his wife that it was because Joey could have killed Engelbert. In reality, Turner was p'd off because his son disobeyed him. In the remake, Turner seems genuinely concerned for Engelbert.There was almost no character development in the remake. When I saw the first, I felt like I knew the major characters. In the remake, we learned very little. For instance, Lupas in the original was a painfully shy kid who would prefer to be left completely unnoticed. In the remake, he was just a weird kid who had trouble catching.The emotion was totally gone. The scene where Joey wouldn't throw the ball to put Engelbert out to get back at his father; the scene where Lupas begs not to be put in and Buttermaker tells him he didn't come into this life to watch from the bench; the scene where Lupas finally catches the ball to get the Bears out of the inning; the scene where Kelly gets thrown out at the plate; I could go on forever.There seem to be strippers in the remake for no apparent reason. The Buttermaker character is supposed to be a sad loner type. To think that Buttermaker is dating strippers take a lot of the sympathy away from him.Ultimately, there was no magic in the second one. And quite frankly no reason to remake this movie. It occurred to me that the producers of the remake didn't quite get the point of the first one. Or they are insulting teenagers by not believing they are smart enough to get it.I thought that changing the sponsor to a strip club was funny. And having the representative who sued the league be a woman was a nice update. Other than that, I see nothing where this movie adds to what I already saw. And I didn't even list half of what was worse about it.If you honestly thought the new version was better, can I ask specifically what you thought was flawed about the original and how the remake did it better?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Further redundant proof that movies, among other things, were better in the Seventies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with others who were born in the late Sixties, I felt that seeing the new *Bad News Bears* was somehow mandatory, if only to indulge in the guilty pleasure of nostalgia. We all knew it would suck, didn't we? -- but we had to see it anyway.Let it be said at once that Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Buttermaker is quite a come-down from the immortal Walter Matthau in the same role. Since the script of this new version is quite identical to the original, much of the degradation displayed here must be put at the feet of Thornton, a notorious ad-libber. None of us, young or old, need to be subjected to exclamations such as "You guys look like the last s--t I took." Or to hear copious references to Greg Kinnear's family jewels. But whether through the script or through Thornton's egregious improvising, director Richard Linklater reveals a complete lack of control. Evidently, the best that he feels he can do with this material is to allow it to subside deeper into crassness than the original. The whole enterprise becomes a dreary exercise in upping the ante: Matthau's Buttermaker was a pool cleaner; Thornton's Buttermaker is a rat-exterminator . . . in the '76 version, the Bears are sponsored by Chico's Bail Bonds; in the 2005 version, they're sponsored by a strip-club. Get the idea? What had been a gritty, rather incisive look at everyday Americana has become merely an exercise in crudity. This degeneration of standards can legitimately be argued away as the eternal complaint of the old, but the feeling persists that the original *Bad News Bears* was still made for KIDS, despite the more realistic dialog, situations, and characters. (And Matthau was never a scene-stealer; Tatum O'Neal shone just as brightly as he did. And rightly so.) The Little Leaguers in this film are sadly subordinate to the leering Coach -- guess who the intended audience is? (Hint: not kids.)By the way -- speaking of come-downs -- the iconic role of bad-boy Kelly Leak as portrayed by the super-iconic Jackie Earl Haley has been utterly neutered, here. The new Kelly is played by some incipient Calvin Klein model pretending to be a skate-punk. Pee-yew, man. Hey Jackie Earl, wherever you are: your status as the preeminent prepubescent bad-ass is, like, totally safe.1 star out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of you may be wondering what exactly the "Bad News" in "Bad News Bears" really means. Well it is supposed to mean bad news for the other teams in their baseball league, as it did in the original movie. Howevair, with this movie it means bad news for the viewers.All kidding aside, it really eats monster butt. Sure, there are a few good one liners (3 maximum), but not nearly enough to hold the movie together or make it enjoyable for that matter. Oh, and if you are a fan of the art of acting at all, it's a good move to side-step this one. The child acting is HORRENDOUS on all accounts, nearly making it unwatchable. But definitely making it un-rewatchable. Then there are the lame updates in the script only topped in horribility by the complete changes to it.Fans of the original don't taint your memories with this god awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Masterpiece, but Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With some skepticism and fairly low expectations, I rented this film. Understand, I'm a big fan of Richard Linklater, and an admirer of Billy Bob Thornton's work, hence there were certain expectations coming into this viewing. For the most part, my expectations were met. This film is certainly worth a watch.There is no point in comparing this film to the original, so I won't bother to do so. The two were made during different eras by different actors and filmmakers, so why stack them up against each other. This film stands nicely on its own. Richard Linklater has simply become the master of the early teen film. He beautifully handled his mostly non-professional cast in 'School of Rock' (though it must be said, he did have Jack Black to help him pull it off), and the same can be said for this cast of mostly neophyte actors. Linklater is somehow able to draw a certain feeling of realism from his youthful actors. I think this is because he's not afraid to go for naturalism, and he certainly doesn't pull any punches. Linklater allows his young cast members to be just as crass, cruel and feisty as you would expect from a group of 10 to 12-year olds in this modern era. At the same time, however, he is able to instill in his characters a sense of youthful innocence and a continuing level of 'wide-eyedness' that make his characters lovable. In addition, Linklater is careful in his characterization, he makes sure to provide a distinct personality for each of the kids in this film, something that isn't easy to do with 12 kids in under two hours.The other big bonus of this film is the enjoyment of watching Billy Bob work. Billy Bob is great in these roles as the 'sexy sleazoid' who just manages to skim the surface of life. Beneath the somewhat reptilian outer skin of Billy Bob's Buttermaker is a human being who has compassion and understanding for others who are in his 'peer group', that is, the rejects and also-rans of life. He does a convincing job creating an empathy within his character for these kids who are all castoffs from the mainstream. In addition, Billy Bob delivers a lot of very funny lines that are steeped in naturalism, and thus guaranteed to create a great deal of offense to anyone concerned with propriety and/or political correctness.I'm not guaranteeing a cinematic masterpiece with this review, but I will suggest that if the film is given a chance by objective viewers, it will be guaranteed to provide nearly two hours of laughs and entertainment. Don't expect a 'Little Giants' here, with a lot of gross sentimentality...this children's sports film gives you something a bit different!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally am a Richard Linklater fan and consider Mr. Thorton one of the finest actors and writers we have. I'd like to kick them both dead on in the nuts for this one. The original was a structurally flawless piece of work and their version was horrendous and stupid. Everything the original did with grace, skill and humor they trampled over needlessly. Every time they changed Lancaster's original script they did so without tact and screwed up the rhythm of the piece See the original. It remains a masterpiece and one of the greatest sports movies ever made. This is a cheap remake that should have never been made. So many great scripts and premises have been screwed up, why not remake those and start with JJ Abrams original screenplay of "Regarding Henry" another movie where a top notch director did not do his best work. Now that should be remade how Abrams envisioned it.He's never written anything better, nor have most of the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say that it's been years since I saw the original and not being a baseball/softball player myself, I couldn't remember a thing about it. I thought this movie was funny and had some good messages promoting "team concepts", even though it was hidden sometimes under crude language, sexual innuendo and other subjects not appropriate for very young children. I am a Billy Bob Thorton fan and I thought he played the part well and was exactly the guy for the role. You generally wouldn't expect to see him in a PG-rated movie anyway. I just want families with young children to keep this in mind when choosing a film for all to see. A few families walked out after the first few minutes that contained some language not appropriate for their young children. The child actors in the movie are great and make the picture enjoyable to watch. The other benefit to this film, again for the appropriate aged audience is that it is about two hours long so you feel like you get your money's worth!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa and the Bad News Bears remake to 2005 after a 29 years since the original film. The film has changed to modify today's world where computers rule the world which I said at 10 years old to an skeptical neighbor and where even a handicapped wheelchair-bound boy can play baseball. Thornton plays Buttermaker, the major league baseball player who turns coach rather than get a jail sentence. The mother of one his players is played by the divine Marcia Gay Harden. I think the kid from Bad Santa also has a role as does Greg Kinnear who plays a competitive coach. I love watching the kids learn the sport by killing insects since Buttermaker is an exterminator and they sponsored by a strip club. They start getting better in the beginning. They are lovable losers who face ridicule and humiliation every day at school. Suddenly, they get help with a girl pitcher and a guy who's a rebel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had no reason to get made. I loved 'School Of Rock' and went to see it because Richard Linklater directed it, but it looks like it was shot in a day and the acting from the kids is horrible. Billy Bob Thornton looks half-comatose throughout the film. Some reviews say this movie is edgier than the original. That is in no way true. This one seems to want to have a heart to it, which ruins the film. Very disappointed throughout. I saw this at the dollar theater and felt like I should ask for my money back. The whole film has an improved feel to it, almost like there was no script whatsoever. There is hardly any music underscoring also, which makes the pacing of the film entirely too slow. Highly unrecommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, sometimes I go for a mindless film. This movie was pretty mindless but I expected it to be. It was foul mouthed and showed the kids trying to beat the snot out of each other. After "Bad Santa", I really didn't expect any less.Someone else commented that there were long pauses left in for laughing. I'm not sure where he lives, but the people in my theater were all laughing their butts off most of the movie. Maybe it's an age difference - this was a mostly 20-something crowd enjoying this film.Under no circumstances would I want my children seeing this film until they're at least 15, though. It IS an adult film and I don't think that kids need another movie to get bad ideas from. An R rating would have suited the film better, especially if it meant raunchier scenes.All in all I enjoyed myself. It's not a film for everyone, that's for sure - but if you enjoyed "Bad Santa", you'll probably like this film.</fullReview>

Few people can fall down in a drunken stupor as convincingly.I didn't see the original so can only rate this in it's own right. I'm not a fan of baseball either so have no idea if it is a true reflection on the game.There are a decent bunch of suitable misfits playing the Bears, and a suitably repulsive rival coach admirably played by Kinnear. The kids do their part well, and can't be blamed for the fact that there is very little originality in the story.There are some really funny moments from a decent script and direction, but by the end of the movie Billy Bob and his antics are looking tired. Still, worth watching for a few cheap laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A month or so before this movie was released, and I didn't know it was in production, I was talking with some friends about movies that should be remade and had mentioned Billy Bob Thornton as being perfect to star in a Bad News Bears film. Thornton is fine in the role, but the movie feels like the producers just found a copy of the 70's movie script and simply re-filmed it. Updates do exist for 2005 and I thought the idea of the strip club as the sponsor was funny, and there is a tribute to Chico's Bail Bonds (the sponsor in the original). Greg Kinnear doesn't quite pull off the Vic Morrow role. Morrow was the father trying to relive his childhood through his son whereas Kinnear comes across as the yuppie who wished he has been the stud.There is nothing spectacular about the kids in the movie, although the kid who plays Lupas bears a stunning resemblance to the original actor. I almost had the feeling though that the kids were shown the original several times and then told, go do that.This isn't anything special but there are worst ways to spend 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad News Bears (2005): Dir: Richard Linklater / Cast: Billy Bob Thornton, Greg Kinnear, Marcia Gay Harden, Sammi Kane Kraft, Sonya Eddy: Advertised as a family film while lurking in the gutter of profanity and lewd behaviour unfit for its target audience. It is a sports comedy about retaliation and the team of misfits taken to championship level in baseball. Ever since the original Bad News Bears was released in 1976 audiences have been bombarded with shameless imitations and this one is one of the worst. It is a curious project for director Richard Linklater who seems able to work with any genre. He previously made Dazed and Confused as well as the overrated School of Rock. Billy Bob Thornton plays a former player now exterminator who agreed to coach the team. This is a xerox of his Bad Santa role in attitude but has little of the depth of that role. Thornton basically goes by the motions without challenge. Other roles are even worse off including Greg Kinnear as that ever familiar ignorant rival coach, and Marcia Gay Harden as that ever familiar mother of one of the players who will warm up to Thornton. The children are not quite on par with Tatum O'Neal from the original film. Teamwork and sportsmanship is not the item here. This film is promoting a vulgar version of what it was and for parents falling for its advertisements that is clearly bad news. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed twice, which for a comedy approaching two hours long, is not impressive. There are more laughs in disaster movies. This was a disastrous movie. I rarely write reviews, and unfortunately, I had to give this one star, as there wasn't an option for minus ten.I had actually ordered the original and received the remake, so I decided just to keep it (before watching it). A comparison of the two films would make an interesting study on how much Hollywood has nosedived even further into a pit of filth in three decades.Some people think that this is a "family film". Why? Because there are no F-words? There is just about every other swear word used multiple times. I could barely believe my ears. It was pointless, tedious and embarrassing. I guess some "adults" just get off on little children using bad words.First and last time I watch a film starring Billy Bob Thornton or directed by Richard Linklater."Suitable for 12 years and over," should read, "Suitable for IQ of 12 or under." If you have haemorrhoids, invite your friends round to remove them with scissors. You're bound to have more laughs than watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By Travis &amp; Annette: Both of us really liked the Walter Matthau version, but we feel this remake, while adhering to the original story (almost verbatim in some places), was a total bomb.ANNETTE: The kids were not nearly as cute or spontaneous as in the original. I just couldn't develop much empathy for them. And their interaction with Thornton as Buttermaker was not nearly so humorous and engaging as with Matthau.TRAVIS: Massive agreement there Annette. I wasn't impressed at all; although I still liked the Tanner kid and his cocky attitude. But, strangely, I was also favourably impressed with the kid that played Kelly. I don't think I've ever seen that kid before, but he might just have what it takes to make a decent actor. Sorry about the vagueness in my reasoning, but I can't really put my finger on why I feel this way. He just had a "presence" that impressed me for some reason even though his character was a lesser one.ANNETTE: Sadly, Hollywood is very inept it seems in the remake department. Just look at such disasters as "War of the Worlds", "Bewitched", "Dukes of Hazzard" and this atrocity. Usually Travis is much harsher in his criticism of movies than I am. But, in this case, it's the opposite. I felt that, while this movie hashed through the same story, somehow it lost the "soul" of the original. My rating is a 1.TRAVIS: I'm going with a 4 on this. I was impressed with the Kelly kid, Tanner was still cool, and there was "eye candy" in the cheerleader department (Ouch! Annette socked me for that).We'll be kind and round up our average to a 3. Our suggestion is watch the original Matthau version and don't waste your time with this poor excuse for a remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who bothered with this? It seems that Billy Bob Thornton got a bundle of cash thrown at him to take Bad Santa to the Disney set with horrible results. The movie doesn't even have the dignity to show the audience the movie but throws all the exposition in the first ten minutes of the movie in some of the oddest dialogue ever committed to film. The audience is left to assume this is Bad Santa 2 and honestly, it fails at that.The film then dissolves into vignettes that wouldn't be out of place in a particularly rancid '80s sitcom. Let's put it this way: there was no reason for this film to be made unless someone really wanted a pathetic sequel to Bad Santa. While that film worked on some level, that does not translate to this at all. It's not even worth a bargain bin price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the premise isn't anything new. Some grizzled veteran goes in to teach kids what the real spirit of (insert game here) is, thus turning them from underdogs into champions. This one has the "Bad Santa" twist: Billy Bob Thornton being very rude around children. Because, see, he's saying very profane things, and they're like, children, you see? That's funny. It's a joke, get it? In case you didn't get it, we'll repeat the same joke for about 45 minutes before we get into any sort of exposition.The exposition basically involving this: the team is getting better, but they can't win until they get GOOD players. See, because that's just heartening to see the underdogs have to have some amazing big kids come along and win their games for them. Then we get some more rude language, a sappy bit of twelve-year-old trying to be an adult (because, see... she's twelve. But she thinks she's an adult. And kids, like... they're growing up so fast now. And that's funny. So we're going to repeat that joke for the duration of the movie...), and that's basically how it goes until the climactic game against the evil "Last-year's winning team" that is distinctive only because they're bigger in stature than our heroic team. Because the other team is a bunch of bullies, but then again so is the team we've been following. And that coach, he's a big meanie, but then again... so's the coach we've been following. In fact, this movie is just kind of watching a bunch of bullies be bullies to each other, only the one kid who isn't a bully... well he never succeeds, he drops the ball all throughout, but hey, at least the crippled bully behind him becomes a better person when he catches it! It does, technically, have a good message about having fun, and the fact that it doesn't exactly turn out the way you expect is nice too. But who cares about that when it undermines that theme by ending with, again, kids bullying each other? "That's what I'm talking about!" So, wait, that's what I've spent the last two hours of my life doing, watching kids continually say the Big Bad S-word repetitively? C'mon, Linklater, I know you can do better than that.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total and complete waste of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no "good news" about these "bad news Bears". How can anyone have respect for a film that shows no respect for anything. These losers don't seem to learn from their mistakes. Instead of a "feel good" movie, this is a "feel bad" movie. Very predictable. After watching this movie, I was totally depressed, and embarrassed that I wasted my time &amp; money renting it. What a mess. I honestly can't recall ever seeing a worse movie than this. I need to apologize to my kids. It's truly sad to see kids using bad language, and its even worse when considering that they're the target audience for this film. There is no inspiration here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake is no remake. BNB 2005 has not one scintilla of the charm or humor of the original. Bad News Bears 2005 is nothing more than another perverted film producer pimping out an American classic for monetary gain. It is more a documentary about America's cultural slide toward degeneracy. The movies' child actors are victims of child abuse and any parent who would take a child to see this movie is guilty of child abuse. Is there any question why box office revenues are plunging when the entertainment holy land Hollywood and all of its artistic geniuses continue as if addicted, to produce obscene and offensive rubbish? BNB is essentially a tragic chronicling of the dissolution of the once great American family and the "new virtue" of celebrating moral depravity. The bad news is that "Rome is burning". Addition on 2/4/06. Where in heaven's name is the possible "spoiler"? Sheesh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comments about movie...Not positive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a remake, so I went in there expecting a letdown. I am the kind of guy that wants some things to remain the same, forget the times. I thought they did some good things by not having Roy (the Yankees manager)smack Joey (his kid) on the mound. It IS 2005, and you just can't show something like that. Or the Bears drinking REAL beer at the end...I accept that too. But there are some things that didn't ring true to me.Why did they make Kelly #5 in the movie? That stole something important away from me and all the other fans. That final inning, he comes up and is announced, that's one of the great moments of anticipation in sports movie history. You KNOW he is swinging away anyway, and that announcement makes you realize who he is...How good he is...How IMPORTANT this at-bat is...But they get the number wrong. Several numbers were wrong, but this one is the most glaring.Tanner Boyle, as expected, doesn't use the same colorful curses as in the original. In a PC world, it's expected that he would be a little more tame...But ANYONE that saw the original and Bears II knows that Tanner can NOT be tame because he is the epitome of attitude. To "water-him-down" is a gross injustice, and he should have been a foul-mouthed little bastard that fought more people than just Engleberg. He kept going after him, and not the whole team. They could not have let him be the original, agreed, but why did he play second base? Tanner is the SHORTSTOP, which is the perfect irony because he is terrible and his position is the most vital in the infield for a team that faces so many right-handed batters.There is no Albert/Alfred Ogilvie. The brain of the team, the scout, the first one to get on base with 2-outs in the last inning of the championship. That weird Armenian kid played a sort-of-afterthought role, but it is BS. The little speech of being "0-14 and next to Timmy Lupus, probably the worst player in the league" was gone from the movie. The time it was delivered in the original was DETRIMENTAL to the plot, and showed the comeback with the proper perspective. Ahmed didn't bunt, some weird new kid did...Little Miguel is supposed to walk because of his size...Um, where was that? Kelly is supposed to bat last, with the bases juiced and 2 away. Why is that Armenian kid hitting there? Kelly slapping a hit earlier in inning and being on-base is like the end of Bears II, but that Armenian kid is no Carmen Ronzonni, let alone Kelly Leak. The Armenian, Aztec, Argentinian, African, whatever he is kid should be on the cutting room floor.Timmy Lupus making stupid statements...He eats poop I think I heard...What have they DONE to the underdog hero? He was a quiet, shy kid that had a moment. He isn't even a boogie-eating moron now, he eats poop and is too weird to be a factor in the hearts of any viewers. If I were Quinn Smith, I'd try to sue BIG TIME. Anyways, he doesn't even get to make the catch to redeem himself. He misses that too, and this WHEELCHAIR kid Hooper makes it. I get it, Hooper=Looper, Gay for the pun...Yank, yank on my lower extremity. A wheelchair...OK, it was funny...But you stole the glory from Lupus. He has no respect from the viewing public now.Hooper should have been named Ogilvie, and played that role. Let him bat in the sixth, and get walked when a ball hits his chair or something...Then he hits super-speed on his chair or something and scores on Ahmed's bunt after stealing a base or two...The girl that played Amanda has boobs. Couldn't they cast a flat girl with some ANGER in her acting to play the Bears ace? This kid had no spunk, no attitude, no talent for acting. And the bra line was lost because of her body. Period line? Cheap replacement.I did like the ending parts between Buttermaker and Amanda, them being friendly and maybe a bit tender. Better way to see them ride into sunset...Although the dugout scene with her arm in ice was lacking, considering what they couldn't or wouldn't say in this day and age. Kelly and Amanda kiss...BULL. A terrible thing. Since she won't be in a sequel (BETTER NOT BE, DON'T MESS THE SERIES UP MORE,)why tease us? There are so many other problems I have with this movie, but there is not enough time or space to list them all. Yeah, I'll buy it on DVD when it comes out to add to my COMPLETE sports movie collection...But I guarantee it will remain sealed. I wouldn't let anyone that saw the original poison their eyes with it.The thing that makes me most angry though, is the fact that in 10 years or so, I'll be telling my kid or some kid (I coach baseball actually) about how anyone can make a great play. I'll bring up the Bears and say Timmy Lupus or something, and the kid will say "the kid in the wheelchair?" Or after a loss, I'll say that some calls are just wrong...Like Kelly in the last at-bat, and they will argue and say it was some Armenian kid. I hate that most kids growing up today won't see or know about the original movie. This piece of crap is all they will know, and it is just WRONG to pass this off as the same. It misses a lot of detrimental parts that shaped the movie, and lines that should never be forgotten. RESCREEN the original in theaters for us, that would be fair. The movie would kick ass these days, and great ratings. Do it and make a fortune, as well as cool me off.</fullReview>

Vic Morrow was more believable than Greg Kinnear and so on and so forth. In the original, I actually found myself rooting for the Bears but in this one, they weren't a group of kids that I cared anything about.Just rent Bad Santa and you'll pretty much get the role that Thornton plays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A former major league baseball player agrees to coach baseball for a team of 12-year olds.I think this is a setup. More on that later.I wouldn't take young kids to see this movie due to all the language, sexual innuendo, and just plain crass behavior by the kids as well as adults (mostly Billy Bob). Go buy the DVD of the original, which is far better. However, I will say, as the movie progressed, the language and rude, crude, and crass behavior, for the most part, disappeared. Why they didn't start that way is a mystery second only to the Pyramids. Maybe no one wanted to upset Billy Bob's record of playing bad characters like in Bad Santa.There is one thing I will say in defense of Billy Bob's character (Morris Buttermaker) and that the character was always level-headed and never intense and never out of control. I had to admire that. I mean kids can get on nerves at times. Yes, there were a few laughs in this, but not really out loud guffaws. I feel this is a set-up because of some issues were not resolved and we should see Bad New Bears 2 fairly soon before the kids outgrow their sneakers. Buttermaker's relationship with his ex-wife, who was supposed to attend the championship game, was a no show; his own life was a shambles before and while coaching the team wasn't entirely resolved although he did learn a lot from the kids; and his relationship with the lawyer (Hardin) who talked him into the coaching gig and who had the hots for him as well was never really defined. Well, maybe these things don't have to be resolved, but just watch. Oh, yeah, there is one more issue that needs resolution, but I cannot make it known here. In the end, Buttermaker lets the kids be kids and allows the chips to fall where they would. And, that part was very good and entertaining. Before that it was all about winning.With so many and I mean many, many remakes out there I think the people doing these remakes have some kind of responsibility to make the new movie conform to the original and if not, then title it something else. But don't take us into the bathroom to see it and pretend it is like the original when the remake is nothing like it in tone and uses language and behavior that the original would never have attempted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poor Way to Honor the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavy drinking, cranky former baseball player Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is recruited to coach a Little League team full of misfits. Can he turn the team around and lead them to the championship, despite caring only about his paycheck? The original Bad News Bears was pretty good. It had an original story and a lot of funny and interesting characters. The remake tells the same story but it has a lot less heart than the original. The misfits story has been done a lot since the original has been released. The remake seems to be just another retelling of the same story minus the interesting characters, fun and comedy. The film did have potential though. It's from the director of School of Rock and the writer of Bad Santa. Add in Billy Bob Thornton and you get a nice lineup. Unfortunately, the film is average at best.The cast isn't very good. Sure, there's Billy Bob Thornton and he raises the film to mediocrity but most of the kids were awful. Thornton plays the same character from Bad Santa. If you liked that film than you will probably like him here too. He's no Walter Matthau but at least he was kind of funny. The kids in the original film were mostly all funny and interesting. The same cannot be said for the remake. All the kids seemed out of place and none of them were really that funny. The worst had to be the girl who played Amanda. I didn't expect her to be as good as Tatum but she was the worst choice for the role. Yeah, she can play baseball really well but she can't act at all. All the other kids were mostly forgettable except maybe the kid who played Tanner. There's also Marcia Gay Harden and Greg Kinnear but neither do anything special.I thought that the comedy seemed forced. Most of the kids were more annoying than funny and some seemed awkward in front of the camera. The movie starts off promising in the beginning but than becomes dull and most of the jokes fall flat. They also kept reusing jokes throughout the entire film so it became tiresome to see the same thing being used over and over again. The ending is also a little overdone. They could have edited it a little but I guess they wanted each bad player on their team to do something for the team. I wouldn't call the remake a complete travesty but it was certainly unnecessary. In the end, I was expecting so much more from this and came out disappointed. If you're a fan of Thornton than maybe the film is worth rental but I think renting the original would be a better choice. Rating 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Bob is no Walter Matthau and this tepid remake of the 70's semi-classic comedy with the terrific Tatum O'Neal is also not nearly as good as the original in any way.Billy Bob could have slept his way through this dud(maybe he did), as his flaky, drunk, cursing, sleazy, womanizing Buttermaker coach role was just the way he is in real life. The filmmaker obviously hired him for his Bad Santa "presence" and surely not for anything else, as his trashy bad boy act is wearing pretty thin these days as he "plays" it in every film he is in. Maybe filmmakers just love it, but it is really getting old and worn, especially in this film that got no spark at all from his lead character. It just was just plain flat all the way to the end.The only thing that made me stay to the end was the kids, as their typical rowdy and funny antics were by far the best thing in this movie. Marcia Gay Harden was sabotaged by a dumb part as a hypocritical super-mom, and Greg Kinnear was way too bland and fair-minded for his All-American dad role as an opposing coach of the best team. He played exactly like Pat Boone would have played it, with not nearly enough yin, "win at all costs" opposition to the yang Billy Bob part. Vic Morrow, with his great underlying but veiled "kill or be killed" menace, was so much better in the original it is beyond comparison.Finally, there was no essential dramatic tension anywhere in the story, even in the final championship game. No good film will ever be made without it. Blah, boring, dull, vapid, banal, ho hum...how many more pejoratives are there for this sorry loser that should have never been made? See the original instead. Save money and have a way better time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Bad News Bears" was a hit because it was funny and even a bit shocking for it's time. Unfortunately this remake is not funny or original and only shocking in how bad it is.The original movie had enough character development that you could relate to each of the kids and the adults. This remake does not take the time for character development and instead seems to rely on the viewers knowledge of the previous movie. The kids characters made the first movie interesting but this one chooses to ignore that fact and tries to focus on Buttermaker (Thornton). Tanner Boyle, Lupus, and Engelberg were main characters originally but are uninteresting and one dimensional in this version. While I'm sure these kids are fine actors they aren't given much of a chance to act in this film.There is no originality in this new version. I assume a couple of very small changes, such as changing the team sponsor, were thrown in so the writers, producers and directors could claim they had not just blatantly ripped off the old movie.Billy Bob Thornton turns in the same old performance we have seen from him before. When he is given a part that challenges him, Billy Bob seems to rise to the occasion. It is clear this part does not challenge him and his acting can only be described as "the usual." Jeffrey Davies plays Kelly Leak and Sammi Kane Kraft is Amanda Whurlitzer. Their characters are downplayed to the point that it would be easy to forget they were even in the movie. Again, character development is non-existent and the two actors are not given anything to work with.If you have not seen the original movie then this might not be a complete waste of your time. It is such a copy of the original movie, although not a good copy, that you might find some humor. Most, if not all, of the politically incorrect humor from the first version has been eliminated in an apparent effort to not offend.In short, go and rent the 1976 version and enjoy the original for what it is. If you are a die hard Billy Bob Thornton fan and absolutely must see this film then wait for it on DVD and save yourself the trip to a theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better alternatives to this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is basically that type of film most of us growing up have seen: a group of delinquent/reject/loser kid stereotypes are involved in some sport. They suck badly. Along comes an unlikely coach. Insert about an hour of the same jokes you'd expect, for example how gross the fat kid is, how unsporty the nerd is, etc. Along comes an aloof/rebellious outsider who is amazing and comes to help the team out. They make it to the finals where they battle the other team, most certainly made up of mean bully types with a narcissist for a coach! We have seen this formula in a number of films: The Big Green, The Mighty Ducks, Little Giants, and even the adult Chinese film Shaolin Soccer to name a few. It's not a bad formula and while not super complex it is nonetheless usually enjoyable and amusing. However this film has a pacing issue I felt. Some things just didn't click as well as these other films. It made me think how some scenes were just overstaying their welcome.Basically it's this: if you are wanting to watch the kids team underdog trope then you're better off with Mighty Ducks or Little Giants. If you want to watch Billy Bob Thornton make some comedy with some kids then watch Bad Santa.</fullReview>

It is a trueism that most re-makes fail to hold a candle to the original. This one demonstrates that,cubed! Thanks for trying guys, but maybe one day we as a society will awake from all of this myopia, cut the chase and begin to allow filmmakers to "capture a moment" as it is/was, rather than insist that self esteem or some equally irrelevant concept must be applied to the process.

Presently, low-cut Marcia Gay Harden (as Liz Whitewood) hires him to lead son Ridge Canipe (as Toby)'s Little League team, against tight-shorted rival coach Greg Kinnear (as Roy Bullock). Can Mr. Thornton transform a "ragtag group of inept players" into a group of successful ballplayers? Well, duh...The filmmakers were obviously struggling to see how many times they could get the letters "s", "h", "i", and "t" to appear consecutively in the script. Yes, "Bad News Bears" is a tailor-made PG-13-rated pre-teen pseudo-comedy. Yet, it manages to funny. You can watch it if you're post-teen, and occasionally laugh. Sammi Kane Kraft (as Amanda Whurlitzer) and the age appropriately cast baseball team are the most valuable players, overcoming clichs with natural performances.***** Bad News Bears (7/22/05) Richard Linklater ~ Billy Bob Thornton, Sammi Kane Kraft, Greg Kinnear, Jeffrey Davies</fullReview>

I'm also a huge fan of Thornton's however, was he not feeling well during this shoot? His acting is sub-par. The casting directors also could have spent a little more time finding kids who could actually act to play the roles of Kelly and Amanda. The movie went down hill with their appearances in the film. This is also one of those stories that other than the clothes, needed no modernizations, IE: computers, Hooters Girls, Music, etc. Buttermaker should have remained a pool man and it would have made him a lot more interesting character than an exterminator.I admit, they ALL had a tough act to follow, Tatum O'Neil (Amanda Whurlitzer), Walter Matthau (Morris Buttermaker), Jackie Earle Haley (Kelly Leak)and who could forget, Chris Barnes as Tanner Boyle! Everyone I've talked to who has seen both the original and the remake agree that the 1976 version was lacking nothing and was a much more enjoyable film to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is a drunken lazy pest control worker. He's a former pitcher who actually got to the majors for 2/3 of an inning. Liz Whitewood (Marcia Gay Harden) hires him to coach the little league team. Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear) is an opposing coach. The team is full of misfits and he recruits Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft) to play for him.This one pales in comparison to the original in almost every aspect. I even like Buttermaker's original job of pool cleaning better. Billy Bob Thornton is a great actor but he doesn't have quite as much apathy as Walter Matthau. His drunk acting isn't as good and his anger is more threatening. The kids just don't have the same charisma. And Sammi is no Tatum O'Neal even though she could really bring the heat. Director Richard Linklater is given not much more than a copy of the original to work with. And it toned down the edgier material. The original was a scathing indictment of kids sports leagues. This one is trying to be too cute about it.Every change seems to make this inferior. The kid in the wheelchair idea is stupid. They dropped the lawsuit idea. The dwarf joke doesn't work. The kids don't have the same chemistry together. Tanner Boyle and Timmy Lupus had such a great feel the first time around. Greg Kinnear is nowhere near vicious enough. They whimped out on his key moment with his son and what his son did in the original is so much better. Then there is the lack of an Oscar winner as the girl. They figured that they can't match the acting so they didn't even try. Of course, there's no way they would even consider using real beers. They could have done so much more than simply whimpify the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colossal waste of enormous talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone said it was pointless to compare this movie to the original "The Bad News Bears" of 1976. What? This is a remake of that film, so not comparing the two would simply be willful ignorance. But I suppose ignorance is bliss to some.However, even if you don't compare the two, anyone with a semblance of standards would realize that the 2005 "Bears" incarnation is simply a colossal waste of enormous talent, starting with director Richard Linklater (whose "Dazed and Confused" and "School of Rock" were spot-on), to its stars, the great Billy Bob Thornton and the sublime Greg Kinnear, to its co-stars, including the always great Marcia Gay Harden to a cast of some very talented child actors.The 2005 script was, at best, a broad farce, whereas the original was sharp-edged and authentic. What's more, the new version includes a variety of pointless changes (changing the Yankees coach's name from Roy Turner to Roy Bullock?) alterations clearly designed to titillate (Councilor Whitewolf in 2005 is now a man-hungry cougar; the team's sponsor is no longer Chico's Bail Bonds "Let Freedom Ring" but a strip club; the league dinner has been moved from Pizza Hut to Hooters), yet the "evolution" reveals the new film's true lack of sack. (Appropriate, I suppose, since science is showing men now in their 20s apparently are exhibiting a decline in testosterone and other male reproductive markers.) Even the smoking-hot Turner's mom (Shari Summers) of the original film has been replaced by a thin-but-frumpy housefrau. Don't even get me started on the new Kelly Leak comparison to the ultra-cool one portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley.Some other reviewer said if you liked "Bad Santa" you'll like this. I'm wondering if he saw either film: "Bad Santa" was brilliant, an amazing display of Thornton's unchecked id surrounded by career-making performances by Tony Cox, the late Bernie Mack and other talent at the top of their game. The 2005 "Bad News Bears" was simply a bummer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good For a Remake, but it Doesn't Come Close to the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw a commercial for this, the first thought was "I hate it when classics are remade". But after awhile, I decided it may be worth seeing, so I rented it, it was better than I thought I'd give it that, it's not what I'd call great, but it's worth renting or seeing on TV.One of the biggest minuses if hardly any of the kid's in this movie couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. The only kid's who were believable when it came to acting would be Tanner and Engleberg. The rest....sorry kiddies, but no cigar. Then of course there was this remake Kelly Leak, uhh correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Kelly supposed to be tough!?!?! What exactly is tough about this guy? The old Kelly smoked, got arrested (or at least in trouble)by the police, and he looked small and weak but obviously wasn't. Maybe the problem with this Kelly is the problem with most of the character's, COULDN'T ACT, he and the actress who played Amanda in this showed no emotion whatsoever when they talked example: at the Hooter Bar, Kelly- "What time do you get off work?" he said it nowhere near as cocky as Jackie Earle Haley (original Kelly)when he said "I have a Harly Davidson, a Harly Davidson, does that turn you on??"but when this Kelly said his line, he said it with no emotion, he actually sounded rather sad, this teaches you to never let kid's with no acting experience past auditions, it's like American Idol, you don't let them through if they can dance but need to learn to sing, they get through if they can sing and you teach them to dance.But aside from all that, Billy Bob Thorton takes Walter Mathau's shoes greatly with his hilarious one- liners and natural tipsy- like acting. And even though the kid's can't act, they still made this movie pretty good.</fullReview>

Of course, I watched the original first, so after almost dying of laughter from The Bad News Bears, this film had a lot to live up too. Unforutnatley, I don't think this film worked as well because of the dates, the 70's, films still seemed like they could push it to the edge, while into today's world, we have to be more PC. Not to mention the kids were more annoying and punky than the lovable punky kids in the original.Buttermaker is a has been baseball player and now an alcoholic, he is given the job of a little league coach for the Bears since no other fathers are taking the job. But he's definitely taken back when he finds out that the team he is coaching are kids who are, well, I guess you could say "lacking" in the department of knowing how to play baseball. But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with, but when their first game comes along, the kids get creamed 26-0, Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league, but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids, a girl who's mother he used to date, and a rebel without a cause. The kids get better in each game, but it's a matter of Buttermaker getting his priorities straight when he lets the game get the worst of him... and he's an alcoholic! Billy Bob did do a good job as the new Buttermaker, but he seemed to be the softer version than Walter, so I'd have to vote for Walter if I want the real Buttermaker. Tanner, I was incredibly disappointed with, because he just turned into an annoying brat than a fun little punk, not to mention I was ticked off that they changed the line "shove the trophies up your..." to the other kid, that was Tanner's line and rightfully so! While Bad News Bears had a couple laughs, it just wasn't needed, stick with the original.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Bad Santa here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Had hoped that this would be a return to Bad Santa form for Billy Bob. And while it starts out nicely in the first act, it slowly grinds down to your average goody-goody-team-spirit flick. It doesn't work as a comedy and as a pure children's/sports venture, it really isn't anything special.And it is a shame too, because Bob's character - a disillusioned has-been and drunk - could really have been fun to watch, as he would struggle with his dark streak. But instead he almost instantly redeems himself as the winner coach of a talentless team against all odds.Seeing that this is a remake, and not having seen the original, maybe I'm missing something here. But as a standalone feature, I don't see much to recommend here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind foul and abusive language, it's my vernacular all day long. I've heard it reflects ignorance, but it's only ignorant when you work at swearing as hard as these producers did: (paraphrase) "Hey kid, get me a sh*tt*n' Coke, and hurry up you little sh*t". I'm not offended, I'm just bored. Who was the target audience for this? The language was geared to older teens, but the storyline to kids; so everybody loses. The gimmick with the wheelchair kid was funny, in a Matt Stone / Trey Parker kind of way, but they went no where with it. The sexual references were way inappropriate for the target audience, I loved explaining "got my period" to my 8 year old. I'm no prude, h*ll, I'm actually pretty liberal and cut my kids a lot of slack on language (I subscribe to the old 'sticks-and-stones...' theory), but even I was put off by this picture. Skip it, it's just ain't worth a sh*t.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had no story, no characters and no point, other than the continuing problems of Hollywood and why they can't seem to make money. Because they fail to do anything original and try to milk old movies for as much money as they can because the cost is low. Glad I didn't spend one dime on this film, other than waste my time. All this film does is loosely follow the original plot, except they try to be more vulgar and crass in the process. Spitting out one liners may be good for stand-up comedians but not a 2 hour movie. I could not feel anything for any of the characters. All the actors just seemed to read their lines with no feeling at all. Billy Bob wasn't too bad, I mean he was the best of the bunch. Greg Kinnear was just too over the top and not nearly mean enough as his character is supposed to be. He was more of a putz than someone to be taken seriously.SLIGHT SPOILER This movie was just a slap in the face of the original. I can't believe we are supposed to believe it was so horrible of the coach to flip the hat of his son and then tap him to the ground that his son would throw the game and his mother be so upset (as fake as her performance was). Got to love political correctness. In case you didn't know, in the original the coach slaps his kid in the face, hard. In front of everybody. It was clearly wrong and portrayed that way, but even that is politically incorrect nowadays to portray in a film. I may have to check out the original film on DVD to make sure they didn't pull a Lucas and edit the slap out. You can give extremely young teenagers non-alcoholic beer so they acquire a taste and grow up to be alcoholics, but you can't hit your kid, even when the hitting is to be demonstrated as wrong. Unbelievable.Avoid this film and watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the worst film I have EVER watched in a cinema. It truly is god-awful &amp; if I hadn't been with a couple of young nieces there's no way in hell I would have stayed to the (bitter) end. Yeah, I know it was made for children, but I used to be a kid too and I can tell the difference between good and bad children's entertainment. The knackered and utterly worn-out plot revolves around a hard-drinking ne'er-do-well character coaching a Little League baseball team of misfits and trying to do as little as he can get away with until a rival coach takes the p**s out of him, then he experiences a "conversion" and moulds the team into little champions. Yes, it sounds extremely tedious - AND IT IS! Every clich' you can imagine is pumped full of embalming fluid and wheeled out again and again (and again). Whenever Hollywood runs a trailer for a movie - any movie - they always show the best bits, but even THEY aren't amusing and that should give you some clue as to the other 99% of this crap. Please, don't force your kids to endure this terrible film unless they're been very VERY naughty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the original, but went to see this not because of my affection for the 1976 movie, but because I really liked the raucous comedy of BAD SANTA, written by the same writers and starring Billy Bob. Unfortunately, this remake was disappointing in almost every regard. There are about five great one-liners, a couple of well-chosen updates to the original, and that's about it.Everything else is flat and unremarkable. The biggest problem is the casting of Amanda. Yeah, she's convincing as a baseball player. But as an actress, she makes you shudder the first time she says a line. Can't act a bit, and her voice might be lower than Billy Bob's. The kid who plays Kelly Leak has none of the original's casual menace. And Billy Bob wears sunglasses throughout almost the entire movie. You never see his eyes, so you have to really look for the comedy. And it ain't there. Don't waste your money...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These Bears are bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not so long ago, Billy Bob Thornton played in a movie which reflected, if not tarnished, one of the most anticipated events of the year, the Christmas season. This time around, the baseball season is what's seen as another much anticipated traditional annual celebration.Other than the differentiating themes, the premise for "Bad News Bears" is pretty much a rehashing of "Bad Santa", minus the festive red suit.Once again, Thornton portrays a drunken womanizer with the dialect of a sailor, whose profession requires him to work with children. In this case, an exemplary disposition on his part isn't all that necessary, since the children he monitors already seem headed down a path of juvenile delinquency themselves.This is yet another project which adds new polish to a classic endeavor, but in this case, the restored product doesn't quite equal improvement.Thornton takes over the role that the late, veteran actor Walter Matthau originally embodied, as Coach Buttermaker, who after once enjoying the victories of a star player back in his prime, has now been reduced to making a living as a rodent exterminator.Buttermaker is assigned to a group of young misfits by an attorney and mother (Marcia Gay Harden), who wants her son to be given an equal chance to participate in a social activity.And so begins Buttermaker's efforts to condition his team of negative players in order to meet the challenges posed by the opposing team led by an obsessively competitive coach (Greg Kinnear).With the team becoming increasingly more hopeless, Buttermaker eventually calls on the help of his tomboyish estranged daughter (Sammi Kane Kraft), and a rebellious biker (Jeffrey Davies) to save its reputation and its final game.The movie often tests the boundaries of social sensitivities in the way it portrays racial minorities and physical limitations. It also attempts to offend with its gratuitous use of profanity, not only by the adults, but by the young performers as well. In contrast, this makes director Richard Linklater's recent "School Of Rock" seem like "Mr Holland's Opus" by comparison, but in a generation far removed from the 1970's, I doubt it will have the same ability to elicit a shocked reaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie About Children That Shouldn't Be Seen By Children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally gave the original Bad News Bears a 6 and thought that I may have perhaps underscored it by a point. I'm giving this version a two in that that the only redeeming factor in it is Billy Bob Thornton, doing his same old thing (albeit pretty well-done). My fear is that I may have over-scored it by 1 or two points, but there isn't a zero. Maybe it was I, being on the upper side of the generation gap and literally dragged to the theatre by my 18 year old grand daughter (who judged the movie hilarious), but I did not find this "work of awful" very funny or very inspiring. It is a story about children that shouldn't be seen by children?.or anyone, for that matter. Do not waste your money. This movie has very little merit.Fact: In 1965, the U.S had a population of a little over 200 million people; and about 45 million people attended movie theatres every week. In the year 2005, the U.S has a population of almost 300 million people, but the movie theatre attendance is less than 25 million per week. If Hollywood keeps on producing this kind of movie and the formula shoot'em up-blow'em up stuff, and with ticket prices approaching the $10 mark, Hollywood will go the way of the Roman Empire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bad News Bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad News Bears, is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name. The film is about an alcoholic exterminator named Morris Buttermaker, who agrees to coach a youth baseball team basically for the money. When he first meets the team he realizes that they do not know how to play baseball at all so he tries to get them into shape to win the championship game. To help him do this he recruits his daughter Amanda (from a previous marriage), who he has not seen in years and a troublesome motorcycle rider named Kelly. Coaching one of the rival teams is Roy Bullock, a coach who is obsessed about winning. With the bursts of anger and alcohol problem the kids will have to get used to Morris, and he will have to get used to the troublesome kids as well. This remake of The Bad News Bears, is by Richard Linklater, who is one of my favourite modern day directors and after a bunch of cult and independent films this is his third mainstream film after The Newton Boys (which I have never seen), and The School Of Rock. The film also stars Billy Bob Thornton, who I thought was very good in such films as Sling Blade, and Bad Santa. With a good director and good actor I thought this film would be pretty good but it isn't. The character of Morris Buttermaker, is very similar to Billy Bob Thornton's character Willie in the film Bad Santa, and in some ways the film is a lot like Bad Santa (so seeing as two of the screen writers did Bad Santa, is not surprising). The film tries to deliver the same type of rude and profane jokes that worked wonderfully in Bad Santa, but makes the jokes a lot tamer for a PG-13 audience and they just don't work. They almost feel like rejected jokes from Bad Santa. And the film didn't do a whole lot for me and it was fairly predictable and in a lot of ways you could see where the movie was going. I have not seen the original 1976 version of The Bad News Bears, but I'am a person who strongly dislikes remakes and does not think that they are necessary at all. This is a remake that probably didn't have to be made because it falls flat soon and not even the talent of Richard Linklater, or Billy Bob Thornton can bring it back to life. A big disappointment from both these talents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave the remake a 6. I consider the original a 9 or 10. As a kid the original BNB was as close to the actual Little League experience one could get. Growing up in the 70's and seeing the original as a kid has over the years, made me appreciate the original BNB more and more over the years. Tanner is one of my favorite characters in moviedom.The new version while staying very close to the original, has none of the spirit of the old classic. All of the actors fail to live up to any of the original's grit and toughness. The new Tanner is a joke. He looks like Tanner, speaks like Tanner, acts like Tanner, but he is not Tanner. Same goes for everyone except for maybe the Timmy Lupis character. He was passable. Billy Bob was and still is the only choice to play Buttermaker, but even he can't pull this one off. There is just no reason for remaking this classic.The kid in the wheel chair was just ridiculous.Why?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Bad News Bears" remake serves its purpose but don't think that it's any improvement over the original. Thornton is excellent and some of the new additions (such as the crippled Matt Hooper) add some new elements to the movie. However, some of the best parts of the original are either toned down or left out, including the classic "Kelly Leak's one bad mother" scene (which is one area where the original script should have been followed 100%). The worst part of the movie in comparison with the 1976 version are the parts of Amanda Wurlitzer and Kelly Leak. These two characters are not performed nearly as well as in the original, especially the pivotal role of Amanda. However, the movie is still very enjoyable and worth seeing if you're a fan of the 1976 film.</fullReview>

By going to see this movie with a clean slate, you'll get more than enough laughs for your money and a great night out! I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good laugh and who is tired of all those gory horror or predictable drama movies.

		<shortDescription>Poorly acted and cast - why was this remade?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was bad on many levels: Walter Mattheau's Buttermaker was a lovable loser - Thorton's Buttermaker is a jerk. He's not likable and is basically the same character he played in "Bad Santa." Nothing he says in the movie rings true including his turnaround in the third act which seems completely forced. And maybe it's just me, but are we supposed to think that wig he wears is real? He wears it when he's not making movies all the time. I think he's forgotten he made some movies where he was bald.In the original version, the team or misfits ends up getting a great pitcher who is a girl and the local juvenile delinquent to join the team and help the win. In this version, they get a girl and a thug who are clearly 5 years older than every one else to join the team. You'd think the other teams would want to see birth certificates.In the original, the little black kid idolized Hank Aaron, which was credible since Aaron was still playing and regarded as one of the greatest players ever. In this film, the black kid idolizes Mark mcGwire who has been retired four years already. So that means when he retired, the kid would have been around 6 or 7 (I'm guessing more like 4 or 5). Why does he idolize a player who's been long retired at such a young age? But the worst thing of all about this movie is the complete lack of acting skills by the girl playing the daughter. Her "performance" is dreadful and makes a weak movie bad. I looked at her IMDb profile and I see she has no other acting history and got the part because of her baseball skills. Unless there are any other baseball movies for her to be in, you could probably guess her "acting" career is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad News Bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Because the commodity society can only function on the basis of disembodiment, its members are consumed by a hunger for images of the body, including one's own body image." - Peter Sloterdijk "The Longest Yard" (1974) with kids, Michael Ritchie's "Bad News Bears" (1976) revolves around a group of young, seemingly incompetent baseball players and the foul mouthed coach (Walter Matthau) who leads them.The majority of Ritchie's early films focused on the competitiveness and ruthlessness of a then contemporary United States. Consider "Smile", a satire which focused on interstate beauty pageants and which contained the line "Boys get money for making touchdowns, why shouldn't girls get money for being cute?" That question's answer is, in a way, present in "Bad News Bears", which focuses on the way in which sports, and human relations in general, suffer when commodified.Significantly, all the baseball players on Matthau's team are deemed rejects or incompetents. They're discarded, branded useless by a goal and profit oriented culture. Matthau attempts to build his team into a suitable product, but meets resistance. The kids literally can't play. What Ritchie then goes on to suggest is that this is okay. His multiracial cocktail of kids, like a band of turn-of-the-century immigrants fresh off the boat, reject a world based on gain and push. They make their own American dream, their own community, and then reject the game outright. For the kids, sports is, or should be, a vehicle for creativity, self-expression, affirmation and cultural growth, be its players black or white, male or female (the film's star pitcher is a young girl). This is a one-sided view sports ? sport and competition can be viewed as an art, a performance, drama, something aesthetic and refined ? but such a stance is necessary for Ritchie's allegory, and was common in sporting movies of the era (see "Slap Shot").Odd for a "children's film", Ritchie's kids are jaded, foul mouthed, world-weary and lost in a wasteland of Jack-in-the-Boxes, Pizza Huts and McDonalds. They're coarse, obscene, some are on the pill, others are already seeing shrinks and most find themselves surrendering their identities to forces far greater than they are. The adults, meanwhile, remain proudly oblivious to the problems of the kids. Competition triumphs. Let the twerps shape up or ship out.Ritchie's "Downhill Racer" featured a battle between an egotistical racer who refused to give up his personal values for the larger values of a team and community. "Bears" does something similar. But though it bashes the contradictions between the logic and values of capitalism and the values which the United States as a nation professes to represent (honesty, fair-play, truth, unity, freedom, equality etc), it also celebrates the possibility of personal accomplishment and achievement. The way the film pulls in opposite directions leads to its confused ending, the contradictions of US life far too complex for Ritchie's simple narrative.Released in 2005, Richard Linklater's "Bad News Bears" is a remake of Ritchie's film. Linklater makes a few changes, and casts Billy Bob Thornton as our foul mouthed coach, but for the most part his film is a shot-for-shot remake of Ritchie's. In both films the "coach" character initially sees his own daughter as but a utensil, his relationship with her a tool used toward a very specific end. Likewise, both films find their kids becoming a kind of "microcosm of the disenfranchised" (minorities, third worlders, girls, women, working class kids, alienated geeks etc), the children working together to reject American-bred success-at-all-costs competitiveness on behalf of their own little half-baked revolution. Like Ritchie, Linklater then sells anarchy and community under the ironic gaze of a patriotic American flag. Such middle fingers clash uneasily with the needs of a mainstream movie, though, as both versions of the "Bad News Bears" see the kids simultaneously losing AND winning, our heroes jointly losing their baseball match and celebrated for thumbing their nose at traditional sportsmanship and WASP manners. This kind of "have it both ways" ending was also typical in the 1970s.While Linklater is a gentle soul who clearly identifies with his material, his remake is nevertheless much too similar to its predecessor. Linklater's also stuck in a world of Little Leagues and suburban misfits, when today the situation he delineates is far more amplified. Today, it's not just a national pastime which has become a showcase for corporate ownership and corporate values. No, contemporary human beings are so colonised that everything - from our conceptions of time to even the simplest human actions - is now conceptualised in terms of the logic of capitalism. Our very language and thought processes reinforce a tendency to view and treat all objects, relationships, and conditions as presumptively subject to exchange. This mania is treated well by directors like Olivier Assayas. Linklater, meanwhile, remains stuck in the 1970s.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite often, the quality of a movie depends heavily on the expectations of the audience going into see it. In the case of the 2005 remake of The Bad News Bears, expectations were most likely lower than the average baseball film. Though it is helmed by the enormously talented and creative Richard Linklater, little of his talent is utilized in this otherwise bland and, at times, disjointed tale of a group of ragtag Little League rejects who form together to create an unlikely winning combination.Billy Bob Thornton as the alcoholic coach Morris Buttermaker is at times likable and sympathetic while at others he is a complete and utter wretched person. Though this would work in some scripts, here it feels cheap and rings false, with Buttermaker and most of the rest of the cast being used by the plot as puppets. Hardly any of these characters' actions feel genuine or reasonable; rather they seem to be acting in a movie.The best part of the film, the championship game which takes up the last twenty minutes or so, reveals some nice touches but still is not quite capable of capturing the right balance between salty adolescence and sympathetic losers. Greg Kinnear's antagonist also seems to fall into the all-too big category of bad guys being bad simply for the sake of being the protagonist's obstruction. Whether this is a better film than the original 1976 must be decided by the audience, but it certainly fails to be any more surprising or memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen the original "Bad News Bears", which is probably why I managed to enjoy this movie. I didn't get stuck comparing the two versions, I saw this remake as a movie in it's own right. With that said, it still isn't a great film no matter how you look at it. Billy Bob Thornton mouthing of to kids is a bit that never gets old, but all of this stuff has been done better in "Bad Santa". And eventually they find out he's pretty kind behind his rough exterior, yadda yadda yadda. Luckily there are still some hilarious lines worked in here and there, the writing occasionally take a break from lazily connecting the dots and actually come up with something original. The kids also act surprisingly well, although I say that about pretty much every child actor who doesn't look at the camera more than twice a scene. "Bad News Bears" isn't anything you haven't seen before, but it's entertaining I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, sometimes a low expectation of something can really give you a pleasant surprise. This Richard Linklater remake of a great 1976 Walter Matthau movie isn't close to being brilliant or remotely fresh. In fact the term "if it ain't broke then why fix it" springs to mind, because an update wasn't needed at all. But to me, and a few other hardy {foolhardy} souls, this Bad News Bears is immensely funny and far from hindered by its predictability {Linklater and his team stick rigidly to the original film}. And while nobody, and I mean nobody, can do sarcasm and hang-dawg like Matthau, Billy Bob Thornton is no bad substitute to have coming off the bench. His delivery of some truly priceless lines alone make the film worth watching. That he is at ease with the array of child actors on show also eases the film thru its sticky {potentially sickly} moments.In a sports based genre that is full of like for like pictures, The Bad News Bears original is still one of its acerbic highlights. This remake does fall well short in the class department, but on a gags to laughs ratio? It nicely hits the ball out of the park.5.5/10 to many weary observers, 7.5/10 for me and the rest of the Morris Buttermilk appreciation society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly inferior to the original, but decent enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was no way that this film would be as good as the classic from 1976, no way. That being said, I had rather low expectations. I mean, were they just going to remake the original but with different actors? Would they do an original take on the story? Well, they kind of stay loyal to the original with a few variations. Billy Bob Thornton is no Walter Matthau, but he gives a good effort and has some great lines. The real weakness with film is in the supporting cast, which is vastly inferior to the original. Greg Kinnear pales in comparison to Vic Morrow and is rather marginalized compared to the original. However, the real problem with this film involves the kids. Tatum O'Neil and the kids that starred in the original were very accomplished and so much more entertaining. The Bears in this film are just weak. None are very accomplished as actors and it shows, big time. Not one gives a really decent performance. Added to this is the poor edit job. I mean, we see the Bears lose every game, then, they win one game and in the next scene, a character says we are one game away from the Championship. What!? How is that possible? I guess the more I talk about this movie, the more I realize that it is vastly inferior to the original, despite the Thornton performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody remember Psycho(1998) with Vince Vaughn, I know what your are saying, I don't either. This movie is also an example. I saw this one in theaters, and thought it was okay, but then I saw the 1976 version on DVD. And thought what was the point of remaking this. The thing about the original, it was interesting, there were things you usually didn't see in kids movies at that time. Now don't get me wrong Billy Bob Thornton is funny as the new Morris Buttermaker, I like that he did not do a imitation of Walter Mathau(the original Buttermaker). He plays the role his own funny way. Walter was funny also. The kids did pretty well also. Other then that this movie is pretty pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Bob Thornton Steals The Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And therein lies the problem.This "remix" of the original was hardly surprising to find, and even less surprising to find that it doesn't measure up to the original, but what could? It might have been better to change sports or venues to separate this one from the original classic, but even without doing that, the movie didn't have to stray so far from the story's roots. The PC influences are strong: the bad kids aren't as bad, even if they are more brazen in some of their behaviors, and Greg Kinnear lacked the evil intensity of the borderline child abuser that Vic Morrow brought to the screen (and which his son the star pitcher hinted at even further). The film focused way too much on the adults and not enough on the kids.The story is strong enough to make the movie tolerable, but it wasn't done justice this time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that is inferior to the 1976 version in most respects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Billy Bob Thornton as an actor in most his movies. I did not like his role in "Bad Santa" and I do not like his role here as former major league pitcher (2/3 of an inning with a 36 ERA) Morris Buttermaker, who is hired to manage a down and out incompetent team the (bad news) Bears. This, in addition to his regular job as an exterminator of various pests. (One scene he is shown dumping dead rats into a dumpster near the ball field.) Greg Kinnear is good as Roy Bullock, the manager of the Yankees, the winners of the league championship the prior year, and clear favorites to repeat. One bright spot in the movie is former unknown Sammi Kane Kraft, who got the part of Amanda Whurlitzer via an open audition of real baseball girls. She is a pitcher, and a good one at that, which makes her role very believable. She also did a very credible acting job, as the daughter of a woman Buttermaker used to be married to.As an aside, young actor Ridge Canipe played Toby Whitewood. Canipe was in another 2005 movie, "Walk the Line", as the very young Johnny Cash who was fishing when his brother was injured by the wood cutting machine.I didn't like this remake because it was too full of fussing and bad language, both by the kids and by Buttermaker, to the point where it became tiresome. Maybe kids behave like that nowadays but I don't like it, and I don't enjoy watching a movie that depicts such bad behavior. I would not recommend it to any of my friends, but maybe to a few enemies!SPOILER -- Buttermaker gets Amanda to pitch, and finds another kid who can field and hit very well. Plus he coaches the other kids into better players. In the climax of the big game against the Yankees, it looks like the Bears will win, until Buttermaker takes out some of the stars to let all the kids play, even the one in a wheelchair. It still looks like they might win in the bottom of the 6th, but what looks like a home run is caught, and they lose 8 to 7.</fullReview>

The concept of foul mouthed politically incorrect kids and the drunk but lovable coach is definitely a winner but everything after the original has missed the mark. I must preface by saying that I was about the same age as the kids in the original so that may bias some of the review. That being said, I felt that this new crop of child actors was not quite up to the challenge of taking these great colorful characters and making them shocking but lovable. The Amanda - Buttermaker relationship I felt was the main culprit of this, just not enough there to make me buy it. If you or your kid play baseball this is a maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many movies with child actors and have been amazed at how incredibly strong are their performances. Unfortunately this is not true with this movie. All of the child actors were stiff as amateurs in their first performances. The real blame falls on Casting - they totally have no clue about what children can do as actors.However, I would be remiss to not mention the skill of the child actor who played "Joey." Although his part is small he is utterly convincing as the Yankees coaches' son.But the movie is not all bad. Billy Bob Thornton is genius in this remake of the original with Walter Mathau. Although it is a remake it is entirely new for this era. I have always disliked "modernized" old movies - the themes from the past do not lend themselves easily to modernization. However, this one is done very adeptly by both director and Billy Bob. (It's Billy Bob's performance which made me give this movie a high rating - 8 out of 10.)-ZafoidPS: I think this is a movie for fathers with kids in Little League than it is a kids movie.-Z</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be undoubtedly buying it when it comes out on DVD because I'm an avid collector and also a fan of Billy Bob and I do find it fairly entertaining. It is even probable that this movie will grow on me, but nonetheless I found it very unimpressive the other day when I walked into the theater expecting another Bad Santa.First off, I found the child acting quite embarrassing to watch at times. Some of it was decent, but for the most part it seemed they had a lot of trouble delivering their lines. The kid who played the little blond potty mouth was terrible. He sounded so phony every time he swore. If they were better they might have been able to hide some laziness evident in the script, but instead only accentuated the lack of substantial comedy. I mean, honestly, the best thing they had was the cripple in the wheelchair and after awhile even he got old. Also, a lot of the dialogue seemed unnatural and just kinda forced.At only eight or nine minutes short of 2 hours, it was obviously too long and the big game at the end was horribly paced. It seemed like it went on and on and on and on for like forty minutes (I know that's an exaggeration, but not much of one.) I also know it stays true to the original and that it's somewhat of a sports movie, but half of the movie is just kids hitting baseballs, which, at an hour and fifty one minutes, makes for a lot of bore.This updated version of The Bad News Bears comes out phony and with everything not as good as it was in 1976. Matthau beats Thornton (for a reason I cannot quite lay my finger on) and it just shouldn't have been made, since they improved on absolutely nothing.</fullReview>

Not only was the movie not funny, but who was the jokes towards; Children? Adults?Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thorton) was a drunk couch who hangs around hookers. Two long scenes take place in the restaurant, Hooters. But, besides this, there's man who couches kids, and their team strives to win everything! Is this a kids movie, or adult movie? The scenes with the sexual jokes and scenes with hookers is anything but for little children, but where they play baseball and strive the win and be the best, that part would bore the adults to death, (it did for me.)I would rate this movie 4 out of 10, because most parts were boring, and it was a very stupid movie over-all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Bad News Bears" is one of my personal favourites. I can watch it time and again and it never fails to give me a blast. When Richard Linklater's 2005 remake came out the reviews were so negative that I didn't watch it on purpose -- why spoil a wonderful memory? I finally caught up with the remake last night and actually enjoyed it. The negative reviews had got it wrong. Richard Linklater captured the spirit of the original and time-tunneled it thirty years (if you catch my drift). The role of grumpy coach Morris Buttermaker, played by Walter Matthau in the original, suits Billy Bob Thornton to a T. The other roles are also well cast, Greg Kinnear as the uptight Little League coach Roy Bullock and Marcia Gay Harden as the cougar baseball mum stand out. Most importantly, the kids also stand the comparison to their 1976 peers.The original was noted for being edgy and non-PC (a term that wasn't even invented back then). Coach Buttermaker is a relentless alcoholic who drinks and drives, and even hands out cans of beer to his wards, and wild child Tanner refers to his fellow players as a bunch of "Jews, sp#cs (and) n#ggers". Some detractors criticise Linklater for selling out to political correctness because he doesn't repeat these scenes verbatim. They overlook that a remake is not the same as a rip-off, and that the rewritten script packs enough edge, for example when Buttermaker makes the kids fill in for him in his day job as an exterminator.It's sad that nonprofessional reviewers seem to be prone to howl with the wolves and denigrate a perfectly good remake as an epic failure.</fullReview>

I really liked School of rock. Replacing Walter Matheu is Billy Bob Thornton, who does a very great job. We have all seen the original. WE should all know the plot to this film. A drunk loser coaches a baseball team of young ones and they are all weird, there are foul mouthes, and a bunch of other odd children. I think that this film is very funny. Though there may not be a ton of originality here. Greg Kinear plays a character that he plays a lot. Or it seems that way. Marcia Gay Harden also plays a characters that she usually plays, or seems like she usually plays. Bad news bears is a very good remake. Though a lot of people gave it a pass, I don't think you should. Billy Bob Thornton should've gotten nominated for something. He does such a good job as the coach. Just his performance alone makes this movie work. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

In my opinion the plot is pretty good, but by now has become more than a little formulaic and boring. The script is however fairly good. Most of the dialogue works and the lead character at least has character development. The performances are strong by Greg Kinnear as the "villian" and particularly Billy Bob Thornton in the lead. Unfortunately everybody else is either wooden or way over the top. The direction is fair, Linkleter has so much more to offer than what he does here though. What almost kills the movie is the editing, which is just simply and painfully horrible and crude. Worth watching because of Thortons performance and some really funny moments.</fullReview>

Billy Bob's performance was so strained it looked like he was doing a bad impression of himself from "Bad Santa.

The young cast managed to upstage Thorton by spinning out vulgar and disgusting jokes that actually make you laugh. There's a good side plot with Thorton and his daughter that brings a dramatic side to the film.

Ol' Billy Bob manages plenty of laughs and I'm glad they kept in (most) the politically incorrect humor.

Roy Bullock gets under his skin and decides he wants his team to be good to beat Bullock's team. He recruits his daughter he never sees to be the pitcher and gets the bad boy to join the team who is a good athlete.The Bears fortunes change and they start winning. The kids go from whining about losing to gloating and just being very unsportsmanlike. For some reason during the last game, Buttermaker decides winning isn't the most important thing but fun is and lets all the kids play, including the one in a wheel chair. I don't think that went along with his character.FINAL VERDICT: It's funny in a sick sort of way. If you like raunchy humor, you will like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying to redeem the inherently worthless?!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable film and will entertain the viewer on a slow Sunday afternoon. It is let down by two main drawbacks: the rating, preventing it from using more realistic language, and the hopeless nature of the basic premise.The rating first: B.B.T. has done simply outstanding work as a down-on-his-luck, self-loathing drunkard. His efforts in "Bad Santa," for example, represent some of the finest acting ever put on film in Hollywood history. Regettably, in this film his talent and his range are limited by the censors; he neither uses the correct language nor the four-letter-word-laden expressions we have all come to love and enjoy. Anyone naive enough to think this sort of censorship will actually "protect" children has probably not paid attention at the local playground. Without the profanity and vulgarity that is natural to 12-year-olds, the film simply comes across as fake, and, ironically, insulting...The second flaw is the premise. The film focuses on the children, and this choice turns out to be a terrible mistake. Like most children, the ones here actually have far less to offer society than the anti-hero, their coach. Though a drunk, the coach can at least make his own way in the world and has a job, albeit not a glamorous one. In contrast, only one of the children is gainfully employed (the female -- is this another example of political correctness, I wonder?).On the other hand, this is a fun film. Some scenes drag on, like the training scenes and the date scene at the skate park; both were predictable and bordered on pandering. Still, I give this 7 out of 10. If only it had more profanity, more drinking (see Badder Santa, the unrated DVD!), and less hopeless PC efforts to redeem children (Why?!) this could be an 8 or even an 8.5.</fullReview>

This isn't a 'bad' movie, just not very good but above all, not very funny, in fact I think it was a good half hour into it that I actually managed a laugh.Billy Bob Thornton pretty much plays the same character he did in the far superior Bad Santa, the 'plot' is stretched out over nearly 2 HOURS (comedies should not, I repeat not, last 2 hours!!) and the kids are largely obnoxious barring Sammi Kane Craft as Billy Bobs daughter.The movie does have a small redeeming factor in it's 'winning isn't everything' finale but other than that it's as painful at times as watching baseball.</fullReview>

And if it's not bad enough to see the black mike hanging overhead like the sword of Damocles, they dropped the mike with the sheepskin on it into one scene, reminding me of someone holding Albert Einstein by his ankles over the scene. One close up scene of one of the kids had the mike just inches from his head...I would have been nervous, myself.

		<shortDescription>Home Run of a Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Richard Linklater has once again done a bad, bad thing that has made him so so good. He has directed a movie about perverse characters who you cannot shy away in rooting for. He did it in "The School of Rock", he did it in "Suburbia", he did it in "Before Sunset" &amp; "Before Sunrise", and he did it in "Dazed &amp; Confused" and he did it in "Bad News Bears". So let us focus on the latter of Linklater's directorial resume: "Bad News Bears". The remake of the 1976 little league baseball classic film was pretty much errorless. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Coach Morris Buttermaker, the same role which Walter Matthau claimed to fame in the original. Thornton yet again has managed to execute another impressive performance as a drunken rebel with a cause. The premise of the remake remains loyal to the original: a bunch of outcast little league baseball kids led by an inebriated manager whose pitiful play gets a inspiring makeover and become winners of all baseball movie fans. As far as the lineup of kids: the remake still consist of the power pitching gal Amanda Whurlitzer, the rebel baseball kid Kelly Leak, the plump catcher Engelbert, the bratty shortstop Tanner Boyle, and the gentle black kid Ahmad Abdul Rahim. However, the remake does include a few lineup enhancers which empower its comedic hitting average: Matthew Hooper the paraplegic and Prem Lahiri the intellect Indian. The junior auteur ensemble of "Bad News Bears" was clear of any foul play, at least not in their acting. Many of these child actors have never performed before which made it even more of a reason to single them out as the "Rookie Child Actors of the Year'. Greg Kinnear was antagonistically superb as the obsessed opposing coach who definitely "auto focuses" himself on winning instead of enjoying the game. Screenwriters Bill Lancaster &amp; Glen Ficarra, who also scribed "Bad Santa", continue to deliver the comical dialogue goods with uproarious wordage. Those are my "bear" facts why the 2005 "Bad News Bears" will not strikeout with movie fans. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen the original of this movie. But I thought this movie was pretty good. The kids weren't that great of actors but the few that had acted before were okay... Meaning like two of them... The kid who played Toby, and Timmy Deters (Tanner). I've always grown up with baseball and my whole family would be outside playing in the snow if they could so I liked being able to watch this movie about baseball but it didn't always focus on just that. I can relate to some of the kids I guess. Sure, I never had a drunk coach, or a kid in a wheelchair on my team but there was always those few that couldn't play at all. So I guess that when it comes to being angry at losing I knew all about it. But even though I liked a few of the actors I wouldn't say this was the best film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty bad remake of a pretty bad original. The only thing shining about ithis film is Billy Bob, who does his usual outstanding job. Greg Kinnear is a poor replacement for Vic Morrow, who was a very mean man. Marcia Gay Harden is way over the top--too bad because I usually like her. Sammi Kane Kraft (in the Tatum O'Neal role) is a great ball player but not much of an actress. Must have been hired for her pitching talent.The script pretty much sucks. Not nearly as cleaver as the original. The directing was mediocre, as was most everything else about this film.Pretty much a film to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad At All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I had recovered from "Bad Santa", I venture into Billy Bob Country with "Bad News Bears". Billy Bob Thornton is a trip without the luggage! And the kids hold their own right along with him. I wasn't shocked to hear the cussin' from Billy Bob but when the kids started in with him and each other, for some strange reason, I laughed harder! (South Park has numbed me to profanity from kids, I suppose) Greg Kinnear was a bit weak but I wasn't expecting much from his character anyway. I knew when I first saw him on screen that his character was a fake. I could feel the slime oozing off of him! I haven't seen the original to compare this remake to so I can't say if it's better or not but just seeing the new Bad News Bears has renewed my interest in the original.The trailers were just a teaser cuz the movie went above and beyond the call of duty for comedy! I was ROLLIN'!!! Lookin' forward to the next Billy Bob Bad Azz movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the original, so I went to see this with a bit of hesitation. First, Mr. Thornton was phenomenal. It's a lot easier for me to believe that he had a thing with Amanda's mom than did Mr. Matthau.However, aside from his performance and a few cute scenes, I still prefer the original. The kids in the earlier version are much more believable (especially Tanner and Amanda). Even though the movie was still about the rough-and-tumble Bears, it was trying to be more PC than it should have been. I remember Kelly smoked, didn't he? And Buttermaker drank real beer? Although it doesn't hold up to the original, it's still a cute movie. It would have been better if they'd had some of the original kids make some cameo appearances in this one. My favorite of the originals was, of course, the BNB in Breaking Training since I'm from Houston. Where would the Bears go now? to Minute Maid Park? I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bittersweet and funny: a fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amazed to learn that IMDb voters have (at the time of this writing) given "Bad News Bears" only a 6.2 rating. I have given it an 8. Based on some of the comments about the movie that I have read here it appears that it is being down rated because it is a remake and because it is raunchy. Both criticisms are true but in my estimation don't hurt the film at all. Note, however, that IMDb voters weren't crazy about the 1976 original, either, It gets a 6.8. As much as I loved the 1976 original of "The Bad News Bears" I thought that this one was at last as good.Billy Bob Thornton, as the drunken exterminator and washed up ballplayer, is, as always, effective -- and extremely funny. The kids in the movie are wonderful and Greg Kinnear as the Little League Father from Central Casting is a delight. The movie just works. It is bittersweet, smart, and funny.Although the language is blue there is noting sexually explicit in the film. I'm not sure that it would be entirely appropriate for 6 year olds but it should be fine for any kid over 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original is sooooooooo much better! The jokes were better, the kids were better actors, Walter Mauthau is a much better Buttermaker...Billy Bob just made the role sleazy and unsympathetic. It was much more shocking back in the 70's also...now the humor just seems crass and sleazy. All the magic from the first one was absent in this one. It seems like they were trying way too hard to copy the original and somehow got lost, ending up with a dud of a movie. Why mess with a good movie anyway? It's like trying to remake Grease...you just can't do it. Just an overall BAD remake. 1/10.Skip this one; see the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fathers, don't forget that Baseball for kids is just for fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First i want to say that i haven't watch the original "Bad News Bears" and i just watch this film for the director Richard Linklater and because i like "Bad Santa", so i can't compare both films.The film is about Butermaker (Billy Bob Thorton) who is an ex-professional Baseball player that now works as the coach of the Bears, a Baseball team of kids, and that is always drunk. The Baseball team is full of kids who doesn't know a thing about Baseball and most of them are social misfits. Now Butermaker must deal with this kids and try to make a "real" Baseball team.The main plot of this film is nothing special and in some way this is nothing but another Baseball light comedy but there are very good lines and a very cool character (Butermaker) that makes this a very entertaining film and with a good message to all the fathers that have their kids playing in a Baseball team. And well i really like the character of Butermaker is almost the same of "Bad Santa", both are always drunk, have ladies just for sex and most deal with kids that have some kind of admiration to them. And Billy Bob Thorton is perfect for this type of roles. The kids are just good, also with some great lines and the music is another terrific aspect of the film, specially when the song "Cocaine" ( the version of Eric Clapton) is playing and all the kids and Butermaker are singing.About Richard Linklater: the first film that i watch of this director was "School of Rock" and i enjoy it a lot. Later when i watch "A Scanner Darkly" i just want to look out for more films of Linklater because is great but and finally i get this film a couple of days ago. Is not his best work but i like it and i think he is a good director.Conclusion: this is a very entertaining film with enough good lines to make it a nice comedy. So make some popcorn and enjoy this light comedy about Baseball. 7.5 out of 10DVD: is really good but a lot of bonus material like commentaries, deleted scenes, making of the film and some more material.PS: the Mexican title for this film is very different, is "Los Osos De La Mala Suerte", that means "The Unlucky Bears".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improved piece of Americana, but still no grasp on the message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of Bad News Bears (the 1976 "classic" little league movie with the crass kids talking about different races with disgust at times) was a lot more interesting, to me, than the Walter Matthau version. I'm not going to bother with the plot (as you can get the outline from the main profile on the film here), but it does improve with the remake.There's actually music that drive the scenes now (instead of nothing like the original had) , and the acting was a bit better than the first one. Yes, I know they're all kids and the kids back in '76 were about the same, but they aren't. This cast is a superior blend of what the vision seemed to be stating from the first film.Billy Bob Thornton plays a better Mr. Buttermaker, too. Not to outshine Matthau (because Mr. Buttermaker is one of his classic character's that he might be known for always), however the character plays better as a bit more lively, a bit younger character. he's got the tattoos and the hard-lived attitude towards the game better than Matthau had as well. The characters were more refined (as they should be with a remake), like the main woman who has her kid in every club and sport she can fit into her son's schedule. That was a surprise.I still only give the movie about 6 stars, though (whereas I gave the original 5). I thought it was an improvement, but I didn't even take the original to heart. The characters get thrown into each others' ways too quickly, and the way they respond to the initial meeting of each other (like when Thornton meets the whole team) is one of boredom and very uneventful. I advise you to check it out, though, at a local rental store. It was good enough to remember what the original was trying to get across, but with more activity and modernization thrown in to keep the attention span going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad News Bears was a movie I saw 2 weeks ago with my uncle, and I have never been amazed at how brilliant this movie is. Some say it's not as "bad" even though i heard a lot of swearing, including two "f" words from buttermaker (i wish the kids went farther with their swearing). I believe this movie should be rated R, though, for strong language.WARNING SPOILER!!!!!!! PLEASE Don't READ IF YOU Don't WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE CLIMAX! I felt disappointed that they didn't win the game because it set a bad note on a good movie. However, the blond kid screaming "see ya next year b****es!" was hilarious. However, they're going to have to do a lot of editing if you want to see this on TV.Final Review: Great, with some flaws, makes for a good movie. I recommend this movie for ages 12 and up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You guys swing like Hellen Keller at a pi?ata party. " - Buttermaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the thing I like most about the 2005 updated version of 'The Bad News Bears' is that it isn't cheesy. Unlike Will Ferrell's stinker 'Kicking and Screaming' about coaching a little league soccer team, 'Bad News Bears' doesn't get all sentimental and Hallmark-y at the end. That's not to say it doesn't posses certain moral values, but it also has some well-needed comic dirtiness. Billy Bob Thorton's character is a drunken degenerate and the kids he coaches are foul mouthed little brats. 'Bad News Bears' isn't a great movie, but it is very entertaining and certainly worth the price of admission to see it in the theaters. I was expecting the remake to the 1976 classic starring comedy legend Walter Mathau to be a bit of a train wreck, but it ended up being one hell of a fun movie.'Bad News Bears' follows Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thorton), a pathetic cigar-smoking drunken washed-up minor-league baseball star who lives in a trailer park and coaches little league when he's not working removing rodents from people's houses. Buttermaker coaches the worst team in the little league, and competes with the nasty, back-stabbing plum smuggling (he constantly wears tight shorts showing off his testes ? yuck!) coach of the best team in the little league, Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear). To prove to Bullock he's not just a washed up has-been, Buttermaker trains his team to be the best they can be recruiting his ex's teenage daughter and the town's "bad boy". Buttermaker's foul-mouthed band of misfits with behavioral issues starts winning, threatening Bullock and starting a huge rivalry. I found this version of 'Bad News Bears' to be far funnier then the Walter Mathau/Vic Morrow version. The 2005 installment garners many laugh-out-loud moments and it has a decent amount of sentimental charm towards the end. The humor is dirty, but nothing as dirty as Thorton's 'Bad Santa' which had to offend anyone breathing (I still thought it was hysterical, though). Thorton plays his character almost exactly as Bad Santa only with more comedic charm and less callousness. The kids are all very talented in this, especially Brandon Craggs who plays the funny wise ass fat kid on Atkins and Timmy Deters who plays the extremely aggressive and sarcastic little guy. Greg Kinnear plays a good jerk, but I felt Academy Award Winner Marcia Gay Harden's talents were put to waste in her small and very unimportant role. All these performers are good in their roles, but it's Billy Bob Thorton who steals the show with his character's genius one-liners and hilarious twisted view on life. Bill Lancaster, who wrote the 1976 original, provides a nice script and Richard Linkwater provides decent direction. When it comes down to the wire, 'Bad News Bears' is a very funny movie that will win over most who aren't too offended by the dirty-humor and foul language. For the kind of movie 'Bad News Bears' is, it's superior in almost ever way. I recommend you see it in the theaters if you are looking for a good semi-feel-good comedy. Grade: B- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 8/08/05)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My impressions on leaving the cinema: The script has a light touch. Despite being a film about stereotypically misfit kids and a washed-up single father, you never get any serious Hallmark moments, thank God.What a strange and joyously un-PC film! It's actually refreshing to hear adults/kids insulting each other, and not necessarily apologising for bad behaviour. Even a cancer joke - wow! Sure, some characters learn to believe in themselves or whatever, but there's no great epiphany / family reunions, and the kids are still misfits at the end. Refreshing.What happened to the editing? Not to spoil anything, but there was at least one minor storyline that was mentioned throughout the film but never seemed to happen!? Over all: a nice film. Only a few laugh-out-loud moments, but you'll smile all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest, as well as Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, the "sports" movie has become a genre unto itself, and good or bad, these films are for the most part well received by a significant cross section of the population who hold the fundamental belief that sports=America=patriotism. And filmmakers know it. That's why most of these films feature thematic variations rooted in the "Win one for the Gipper," "It's not winning, but how you play the game" and "There's no 'I' in 'team'" mentality. How refreshing, then, when one like "Bad News Bears" comes along to provide a much needed perspective on our society's preoccupation with sports in general, and amateur athletics in particular.Based on the 1976 screenplay by Bill Lancaster and updated by screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who successfully teamed up with Thornton for 2003's "Bad Santa"), the story is about a local little league that has excluded a group of youngsters for failing to live up to their standards of physical prowess (they just aren't good enough to play with the "real" eleven and twelve year old "athletes"), the mother who sues the organization so that her son can play, the resultant team of diverse "misfits" the league must accommodate, and the man hired by the mother to manage that team.That man in none other than Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton), a former professional baseball player who once pitched 2/3 of an inning in the Big Leagues and who now makes a living by exterminating rats. "Boilermaker" Buttermaker likes to drink, frequents the local Hooters and doesn't give a fig about what anyone thinks about him. Not that he's a rugged, iconoclastic individualist; far from it. He's just a guy who refuses to play the game anymore (and we're not talking about baseball here). On the surface, he's probably not the guy you'd choose to be your kid's role model, mainly because of all the things he "isn't." Upon closer examination, however, it becomes apparent that being a hypocrite is among the things he "isn't," and it's very telling as to the man's true character.On the other side of the fence, meanwhile, there's the manager of the Yankees, Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear), a real coach's coach, a pillar of the community (he's a car salesman) and the very personification of The Great American Role Model. He's as American as apple pie, and if there's a high moral ground in evidence here, he's on it. And, he is by all that's holy, going to take his team to the championships. His team is going to win, no matter what, because, after all, winning is everything, isn't it? Even if it means expecting your twelve-year-old to play like a Major Leaguer with a multimillion dollar contract, and publicly chastising him when he doesn't.And therein lies the beauty of this film. Without preaching, without pointing fingers, but simply by presenting a realistic depiction of one of our sacred institutions, the "coach," the true nature of what millions of kids are subjected to in the name of "sportsmanship" year after year in this country is exposed, and with no apology necessary. At the same time it says that kids are worth more, much more, than what the Roy Bullock philosophy has to offer. The Roy Bullocks of the world will tell you that this kind of treatment "builds character." I beg to differ. And it's up to the Morris Buttermakers of the world to level the playing field. And when the rubber meets the road, I'd want my kid on Boilermaker Buttermaker's team rather than Bullock's any day of the week Director Linklater assembled a superb cast for this film, beginning with Thornton, who makes Buttermaker a very real, if flawed, flesh and blood human being, quite different from the likable caricature created by Walter Matthau in the 1976 original version. Kinnear delivers, as well, by capturing the very essence of a character that anyone who has ever been near a little league-- or any sports field-- has known in real life. And in the confrontations between Buttermaker and Bullock, Thornton and Kinnear give it a ring of truth that is beyond anything you'll ever see on any of the "reality" TV shows.Add to that a credible performance by Marcia Gay Harden as Liz whitewood (the mother who sues the little league), and an amazing group of young actors: Sammi Kane Kraft (Amanda); Ridge Canipe (Toby); Brandon Craggs (Mike); Jeffrey Davies (Kelly); Timmy Deters (Tanner); Carlos Estrada (Miguel); Emmanuel Estrada (Jose); Troy Gentile (Hooper); Kenneth Harris (Ahmad); Aman Johal (Prem); Tyler Patrick Jones (Lupus); Jeffrey Tedmori (Garo); Carter Jenkins (Joey); and Seth Adkins (Jimmy), and you've got a movie that's going all the way to the World Series.The acerbic humor and biting satire of "Bad News Bears" is without a doubt going to generate some mixed reviews. Some viewers will be offended by this film; others will be outraged. But that's because the truth hurts, and the fact of the matter is, there's a lot of Roy Bullocks out there, and they'll all be expecting a movie that confirms their point of view and sanctions their own sanctimonious belief that the lessons learned on the diamond, the court or the football field are all positive, the stuff that "champions" are made of. Instead, they're going to see a film that has the guts to call a spade a spade, that isn't entirely politically correct and in the end may make it necessary for them to take stock and reevaluate the real world that exists out there beyond the shells of the cocoons in which they've ensconced themselves. And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BAD NEWS BEARS (2005) **1/2 Billy Bob Thornton, Greg Kinnear, Marcia Gay Harden.Serviceable ? yet play-by-play ? remake of the '70s comedy classic.Remakes are such a tricky creature in the cinematic world. Why bother remaking something that has an audience that loves the original in the first place is the $64,000 question most average filmgoers would be saying aloud and I'm hard-pressed to disagree? If it ain't broke, why fix it? But if you are going to do it, perhaps you should I dunno make it better?In the latest Hollywood misgivings about damn-to-hell-what-the-audience-wants-let's simply-recycle-a-hit-from-the-past-and-worry-about-the-conseque nces-later offering the result is a practically serviceable yet play-by-play 'safe' remaking of the comedy classic that starred the lovably gruff, messed-bed persona of the beleaguered Walter Matthau in all his schlumpy glory as the grizzled, beer-drinking never-was of a big-league ballplayer reduced to cleaning swimming pools in sunny Southern California musing about his one time only appearance in the majors while managing a ragtag little league ball team of misfits, losers and foul-language spewing tykes which unearthed a new sports themed subgenre: the pathetic team of misfits, losers and foul-language spewing tykes which have been seen in everything from THE MIGHTY DUCKS to the recent REBOUND with its pedestrian scripts and bathroom humor that has run stale since the original BEARS' first unworthy sequel!Well now indie cum Hollywood darling Richard Linklater (SCHOOL OF ROCK, DAZED AND CONFUSED) comes equipped with a faithful yet raunchy enough screenplay by BAD SANTA scribes Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who manage to update the Bill Lancaster script and Michael Ritchie's direction with enough pallid political incorrectness (except for one glaring omission in one of the lines spoken by the most foul player, Tanner Boyle (which I'm going to do likewise in fear of rebuttal; yeah, that's the times we live in folks, but dammit the line is funny and it's a JOKE!) and sexual humor to make the most hardened go-figure curmudgeon chuckle.Thornton fills Matthau's shoes as Morris Buttermaker, a drunken ex-ball player who is now an exterminator here but still a souse with a lousy demeanor, who is coerced by an attorney child-rights activist named Liz Whitehood (the sexy Harden) and an undisclosed check to coach the Bears, the worst team ever assembled (thanks to the political correctness we know have an Indian nerd and a chubby kid in a wheelchair rounding out the token black kid, two Mexican brothers and the fat kid whose on Atkins and not a junk food junkie).Buttermaker enlists the aid of Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kraft), a tweener pitching sensation he knew from his ill-fated relationship with her mom, when he realizes the kids really deserve more than the shellacking they received in their debut to the much-hated rivals, the Yankees led by Roy Bullock (Kinnear substituting yuppie weaseldom from Vic Morrow's gruff general bullying) who wants Buttermaker to take a hike.Also tacked on is grungy trouble making Kelly Leak (Jeff Davies) who Bullock can't stomach but proves to be a true athlete in power-hitting and displaying a keen touch for the outfield to boot as Buttermaker suddenly realizes the Bears may actually have a shot at the championship title.The film pretty much stays fast and loose but connect-the-dots similar to its original (even in an uncanny shot-by-shot of Leak's batting practice homer gliding into an actual game!) Not necessarily a bad thing but even though the screenwriters give Buttermaker a more active sexual life (sporting a bodacious babe here and there and even taking the kids to Hooters for a post-game celebration is inspired) it makes one wonder where it could've gone had they gone the R-rated route (which frankly the original came close to skirting as well). Thornton's sardonic Southern fried delivery is priceless ? he's more chicken-fried steak than Matthau's salisbury and elicits enough contempt to distill the easily found treacle bubbling below (making the kids into winners) and Linklater, a personal fave of mine, seems to have found a unique niche: making kid films adult friendly.While it isn't an instant classic like the first flick ? I blame that for the frankly carbon copies of the kids shown here ? to wit, Tatum O'Neal actually emoted as Amanda in the '76 version! - (hell the Tanner kid looks and sounds just like the first one's! it's scary!) but they seem to be having a ball. Not a homer but more like a ground rule double that had triple written all over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you complain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know about the rest of you, but I found the New Bad News Bears to be absolutely hysterical. Yeah, there were some spots that were funnier than others, but I still left the theater with pains in my stomach and hips from laughing so hard.Many people lately have been complaining over this summer of Remakes, and I have sometimes been one of them, but I found that this Bad News Bears did what a remake should do: update a classic to reach a new audience without insulting the integrity of the original. Many of the same characters are included in this film, and several scenes from the original Bears have simply been reinserted into the remake.Billy Bob is great, once again channeling is Bad Santa attitude as Coach Buttermaker, and easily steals the beginning of the picture. Soon, much like the original, the bad attitudes of the kids come into play, and the humor comes directly from the various Bears. Tanner is still the funniest, and many of the characters are different from the original, including a wheelchair bound Bear who often makes his physical situation a cause for argument.And while all that is good from this film overlooks the bad, there are some bad spots, primarily Amanda Whurlitzer. Much like School of rock, Richard Linklater chose an actual pitcher to play the role, and while she has some awesome pitches, it is painfully obvious she is reciting lines. The Kelly role has also been toned down, as he is more of a silent bad ass than an obnoxious one.Overall, though, I must say it is NOT a kids movie, as many people in the audience in my theater thought. As it turns out, half the mothers with children in the theater left after the first 20 minutes, because Billy Bob uses at least one or two bits of profanity in every sentence (just no f-bombs). Same with many of the kids, especially Engelburg and Tanner, but really it almost seems like an R movie that was simply reworked to fit to maintain the PG-13 rating. But my lord, was it funny...</fullReview>

The story begins with down and out of luck exterminator named Morris Buttermaker, who use to be an awesome baseball player, these days he is washed up, he can't go a single day without getting drunk. But he soon gets a chance to revive himself. When he is asked to coach a pre-teen baseball team. But the problem is that they are a bunch of misfits, who lack any baseball skills, and seems to have no confidence in winning. Can Morris bring them up to a winning streak, and give them confidence? Billy Bob Thorton was very funny as Morris, he played off the kids very well. The kids were also funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The couch is not bad enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film, although it's not as good as "Bad Santa." In "Bad News Bears" Billy Bob Thornton plays a drunk little league coach, who is bad bad bad, but just not as bad as in "Bad Santa." Well, at the beginning of the film, he was pretty on the mark (being bad), and then he seems lost his edge to be a bad guy, you know, bad in a good way. I don't know much about baseball. My understanding of "three strikes you are out" is to be locked up in a prison for good and "married to some guy named Big Bear." Billy Bob Thornton's baseball team is formed by underdogs, those who suck in play balls, including a kid in a wheelchair. Who are they against? The privileged well groomed mean middle-upper class kids in their nice uniforms. So when these underdogs behave badly (and they do), we cheer and laugh and feel exhilarated. It's our culture to feel pleasure seeing the fortunate to get screwed, that's why we have so many paparazzi make a good living digging dirt of the celebrities. But when Billy Bob Thornton is not bad enough in the film, I am disappointed. This is a fun movie to watch, but I left the theatre feeling not complete satisfied and wanted to watch the "Bad Santa" right after that to achieve an orgasm. Did I learn anything about baseball after the film? Not a damn thing, although it's hell of a lot more fun than watching a baseball game on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is sportsmanship that important anymore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think that bad taste is funny...be ready to laugh your butt off. This is not to be confused with the Walter Matthau Bad News Bears of 1976. Watching this team of misfits is somehow refreshing. Morris Buttermaker(Billy Bob Thornton), a former major league pitcher who saw 2/3 of an inning in the big leagues, is hired by Liz Whitewood(Marsha Gay Harden)to coach her son and a group of little league rejects. Butterworth, currently working as an exterminator; drinks beer constantly, chain smokes cigars and doesn't particularly like children; but reluctantly takes on the job of coaching these talent-challenged kids. A thorn in Buttermaker's side is the coach(Greg Kinnear) of the returning champions. To the rescue comes his estranged daughter(Sammi Kraft)and a neighborhood tough guy(Jeff Davies). Thornton is hilarious as the grousing coach. Nobody could play this role any better. And impressive is Kraft, who was discovered in a public park and reportedly can throw a 72 mph fastball. Crude, rude and a whole lot of fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood might be going through its slumps, and people can complain about the lack of originality out there, then something like this happens. This film is bound to irritate a few people with their rather colorful vocabulary, and it's o.k. It's used quite appropriately. At first, it's all over the place, highlighting the frustrations of a team of misfits. This film is NOT supposed to be cute, and what we are witnessing are the portrayal of some very real archetypes.The film moves along very well, showing the progress of the bears on their way to the exciting and very funny climax. With the help of Billy Bob Thornton and some very talented newcomers, the ride is quite enjoyable. Most of amazing of all, it is how it manages to keep its protagonists real, and its attitude is overwhelmingly sweet-natured.Once again, the film is a good example of great directing and incisive writing. I can't stop this without mentioning a very interesting soundtrack, too. Let's play ball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake, but where's stein?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Bob Thornton pulled off what no one other then the late Walter matthau could do, and that's play failed baseball player Morris Buttermaker to a bunch of rag tag kids. The script does great service to it's much needed updates from the 70's(including Amanda going from selling maps to working in a vintage clothing store), to modern times work great, with out losing the effects of the original. The barbs trading back between Amanda and Buttermaker are funny, as THornton has a great screen chemistry with his younger co star. Not suing Kelly Leak in the original, and not having the classic Rudy Stein characters are a few of the drawbacks,as is not using Amhad's hank Arron loving character (this time around Admand's favorite player is Mark McGwire, who the producers decided correctly to make a punchline) but the biggest drawback is Greg Kinnear as the Yankee's coach. Years removed from battling Ben Stiller to pull off the worst performance in the 1998 crapfest Mystery Men, Kinnear is stiff, not believable, and pretty much close to effeminate. kinnear almost pulls the whole movie down by himself with his wooden performance. While no one can even touch the late Vic Morrow's portrayal in 76, Kinnear's performance in terrible, and him being casted in the role is outright unacceptable. Tanner Boyle was thankful toned down from the 1976 classic, and is no longer spoutting racist words. He still manages , however, to be the team's badass with a mouth that would make sailor's blush. And he's absolutely funny at it as well, and is perhaps acting talent on the Bears roster. Worth the price of admission, and don't buy the hype, the girl that plays Amanda does a fine job in her own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charters look nothing like in the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing about this movie that I must say is that the charters in this movie look nothing alike the original charters. At least most other movies try to make the charters look some-what alike when doing a re-make. For example: the original Bears had kids with really blond hair, such as the kid who played Timmy Lopes. The new Timmy Lopes looks absolutely nothing like the original. As well as the rest of the team. I think they could of done a much better job with the charters. But I honestly think this film was pretty funny. But the acting was not good at all, and I think all this kids in this film were kind of ugly. I like the original much better. But I think if they spent more time picking the people to play this film, it could of been much better. Really, the only thing I hate about the movie is that the charters look nothing like the original. Thanks for reading my comment. Hope you agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming from someone who hasn't seen the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...this is a pretty good movie. So if you're one of those people who worships the original "Bad News Bears," you may want to stop reading this. I'm pretty liberal when it comes to remakes. Sure, there are a lot of bad remakes, but those are caused through bad writing and film-making and not from the sheer fact that they're remakes. I'm a big fan of Billy Bob Thornton, as an actor, so that was the main reason I was looking forward to this film. And of course, Billy Bob is pitch-perfect when it comes to playing a deadbeat, as we've seen before in "Bad Santa." The movie starts off with a bang, with one hilarious scene after another, including plenty of great one-liners. I was laughing to the point where I was almost out of breath. Unfortunately, the movie runs out of steam about halfway through, as it fizzles into predictable kiddie sports movie schmaltz. And like you'd expect, Billy Bob's character suddenly turns into a softie for no apparent reason. A problem that I've seen in several sports comedies of recent years is that halfway through they cease to be comedies, and concentrate too much on "the big game" or preparing for the big game. Why can't there be a sports movie where it's comedy all the way through? "Mr. 3000" suffered from the same problem. It starts out making the best of its hilarious premise, and spends the rest of the film making you feel sorry for Bernie Mac's character and forcing you to believe in his comeback in the game. Once "Bad News" takes a serious turn, it seldom recovers. That was very disappointing for me, since I loved watching Billy Bob play this deadbeat. But no, we're living in politically correct times and we have to spend the rest of the movie focusing on him teaching the little brats sportsmanship and all that crap...blah, blah, blah. Who cares?!! "Bad Santa" had its flaws, but at least it had the guts to let Billy Bob play a sleazoid to the very end. Overall, I'd give this movie a recommendation, but it could've went a lot farther.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best remake I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to be the only one (on IMDb, at least) who thinks so, but I felt that this film was a minor masterpiece. Granted, I haven't seen the original version, so, you know, everything I say is suspect, blah blah blah. I just thought that the film was astonishingly well-directed, that they didn't wuss out on the cursing or the sexual stuff, that it had a good message, and that the film was painfully realistic. I mean, have you ever been to a Little League game? It's horrifying.If you will permit me to digress a little, I once saw a man at a Little League game holding an umbrella. It was raining, obviously, but the players were still playing, including the umbrella man's presumably older son, since the fellow was sitting next to his younger one. The tinier kid tried to grab the umbrella from Daddy, or possibly just move it closer to his own body; I'm not entirely sure (I was sitting behind them). Anyway, Kid grabs the umbrella, and Pa, apparently mad at something, grabs the kid's hand and SLOSHES ALL THE DAMN WATER OFF THE UMBRELLA AND ONTO THE KID'S FACE! Kid starts crying, and POPS SAYS IT'S HIS FAULT! What a horrid jerk!Anyway, the Bad News Bears is a damn good movie regardless of its remake status, and I encourage everyone to go see it, because it really is a superlative example of American popular film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of classic foul mouthed comedy, is not quite as good as the original, but still pretty funny in its own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater's updating of the 1976 classic film is an odd beast. At times faithful, at times not, this film has no real reason to exist except that its very very funny at times.The basic plot, of a drunken coach taking on a team of losers and misfits is pretty much the same, even many of the jokes are the same. The team make up has been altered slightly, though there still is Tanner who appears not to have changed in 25 years and will still take on the sixth grade single handedly, there still is an overweight Engleberg to be his foil and of course there is a girl to be the star pitcher. Here she's played by Sammi Kane Kraft, who looks and acts like a 12 year old tom boy, better than Tatum O'Neal ever did. Frankly she's someone to look out for down the road.What intrigues me about this movie is that it has other things on its mind other than being funny. There are attempts to look at parent child relationships, race, and what it means to succeed or fail in life. While some of the additions make for a very bumpy ride, they are at least an attempt at doing something other than a straight remake with the material. (I'm curious as to what was cut and if any missing or extended scenes will show up on the DVD) Its not perfect, but who cares since ultimately its very very funny. Some of the jokes worked the first time, while others could only be done now. It amused me for two hours more than many films I've seen lately and I did hurt myself laughing on an occasion or two. Do you need to see this on the big screen? No, TV will be fine, since its probably going to end up in eternal rotation much like the first one.In the end the question of which is better does go to the first one, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see this one too since it has some really big laughs to offer and will, in the end make you smile (even if it can never erase the image of the original).7.5 out of 10- rounded up to 8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie if You Haven't Seen the Original + Tons of Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would just like to say that I haven't seen the original and I thought this was a good remake of a 70's sports movie.When I got home I was watching some show and they brought up this movie. They said that this is one good remake and they brought up that they kept the name of the kids and the way they looked. Later they showed two pictures of the original kids and the remake kids they did look somewhat like the original.Next I would like to say I'm 12 and I'm saying to you people who want to take your 5 to 10 year old kids to this movie beware almost every kid swears, but, not all. Plus, when they swear it's not like ''Ah Sh*t''. Try ''Shove it up your a$$e$ B*tches''. Thats some of the weak language too.But I didn't find this any problem at all. I'm just saying that some kids will think that it's cool to say stuff like that and go to school saying all these swears to other kids.Anyways, this is a funny movie and some kids won't get the language like my brother. Some of they will get though.I think I'm going to wrap this up now. Don't want to start giving it away. You'll get your money's worth don't worry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bears" is a laugh-a-minute riot!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "Bad News Bears" is a remake of the 1976 classic of a bunch a juvenile kids that lack basic motor skills that have a once pro-ball player turned loser drunk as a coach named Morris Buttermaker. The kids are stubborn and don't listen to Buttermaker and threaten to disband the team until Buttermaker acquires the help of his fast-ball throwing daughter Amanda Whurlitzer, and biker bad-boy Kelly Leak. Then the team bands together to reach championship caliber.Billy-Bob Thorton plays Buttermaker from the original movie who was played by Walter Mathau. He plays the role perfectly and provides almost all of the laughs in the movie. The other laughs are provided by Mike Engelberg and Tanner Boyle. All these two do is bicker and call each other vulgar names. Engelberg is always jumping on people for calling him fat. Boyle will never miss an opportunity to throw his glove at someone, or start a fight with a fellow teammate.Bad News Bears is one of the few remakes in Hollywood that manages to live up to the original. Sure it might not have the magic the 1976 one did but it is really close. Also, some of the jokes are re-used in the 2005 version but it's nice seeing it delivered by a new actor or actress. Also, the new jokes more than make up for the twice used jokes. In the end, if you were a fan of the original, or are a newcomer than have no fears this new updated version will have you laughing all the way out of the theater to your car and on the way home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stunningly better than it's original, Bad News Bears is one of the funniest sport-comedies ever made. An awesome cast and good directing make this one of the best comedies. Not exactly heartwarming, but hilarity makes your heart feel good enough. Excellent acting by the newcomers, bravo! I don't know why the rating had the word *sexuality* in it. There was no sex at all. Well, there was some humor, but they didn't show anything. They left it all to your imagination! Anyway, on with the real important parts of the movie.Billy Bob Thornton is very funny, but it seems like every movie that he is in, his character as an extremely dry sense of humor. Don't get me wrong, the dry sense of humor is funny, but it gets old. He just does it a little too much in every single movie he stars or co-stars in.Sammi Kane Kraft, who plays Amanda Whurlitzer, did an outstanding job in acting. And my birthday is the same as hers, just wanted to say. And everyone else in the movie did a brilliant job in acting. A perfect combination of comedy and sport and drama! In short, Bad News Bears is hilarious and awesome! A definite 7 out of 10!Violence/Gore: 2/10, Sex/Nudity: 3/10, Profanity: 10/10 (no F-words, just constant S-words, B-words, etc., etc.), Drugs/Alcohol: 6/10Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Rude Behavior, Language Throughout, Some Sexuality, and Thematic ElementsMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Rude Behavior, Offensive Language, Some Sensuality, and Thematic ElementsMy MPAA rating: 14A: Coarse Language, Language May Offend</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad News Bears was Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film stays very true to the original, just modernizes it a bit. The humor in the 1970s version would never fly with today's easily offended and politically correct audience; however, only one character (Tanner, of course) actually spouted any racial slurs in the old version.This remake captures the "Archie Bunker" spirit of the old version and combines it with the edge of "Bad Santa" and "School of Rock", directed by Terry Zwigoff and Richard Linklater respectively.I highly recommend going to see this film. It is perhaps one of the funniest movies you'll see for awhile...well, until Art School Confidential.The best characters are Lupus and Tanner (just like in the original). The plot is the same, the scenes are very much alike, and and characters are slightly more diverse. Where in the old version there was the team of white kids, and a black kid, and 2 Latino boys... In the remake, it's a team of white, Latino, middle-eastern, Indian, black, and paraplegics.Awesome movie. Don't miss it.-alex-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds at what it attempts, but could have attempted more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the "shot-by-shot-remake-o-meter," on which the Vince Vaughn "Psycho" is a 10, I'd rate this about a 7.5, somewhere around "Point of No Return"/"La Femme Nikita." I thought Billy Bob Thornton was well-cast, and all the kids did great jobs. But in revisiting this classic, I think the filmmakers missed an opportunity, especially considering that original screenwriter Bill Lancaster got to pen this version.The charm of the original movie, for me, was the unvarnished realism with which it depicted childhood. I was about the age of the original Bears kids, and scene after scene rang true -- especially the fight at the hot dog stand. Even with the dramatic flourishes that distinguish every film from real life, that movie really conveyed what it felt like to be a grade school kid in 1976.The remake also does a good job... of conveying what it's like to be a 1976 grade-school kid. I've got nephews that age who play ball, and their lives are different from my own childhood in countless ways. But the new movie settles for superficial updates: Amanda bets Kelly over a skateboard maneuver, not air hockey. The bookish kid has a laptop instead of a scorebook. One of the kids is Armenian, and another is disabled, so the "motley bunch" construct is a little more au courant. Swell. But Tanner still has his 1976 hair, and the presence of two Spanish-speaking kids in southern California is still presented as a notable occurrence.More importantly, all the themes are the same. If they had really cracked this one open and reworked it on a deeper level, they could have come up with new approaches that would resonate for years with the kids of today, like the original did for me. I don't know if today's kids will see themselves in this movie.The most substantive update -- Marcia Gay Harden as the adult Whitewood character, instead of a man -- leads to a subplot that involves the adults almost exclusively, and is completely abandoned.The remake is watered down in ways that are not surprising, in terms of Tanner's invective and Roy Bullock's treatment of his son on the mound. But the power of those original elements isn't replaced by anything; it's just missing.Finally, a little generational boosterism. Jackie Earle Haley was a waaayy badder badass as the original Kelly Leak.I don't have the blanket disdain for remakes that I'm seeing elsewhere on IMDb, and I did find this film to be entertaining and enjoyable. But it could have been so much more than it was. Perhaps the best thing about its release is that it has stimulated showings of the original on cable TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good news: There's still the original; forget this 'Bad' version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most endearing thing ? in my opinion ? about the 1976 comedy, "Bad News Bears," was its total irreverence, which was the basis for its charm. In fact, it was politically-incorrect before the term was ever coined. Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal, along with a cast of smart-mouthed kids, turned this film about a group of Little League losers into a huge winner, as well as a beloved classic that almost everyone can quote from. Now, following on the heels of "War of the Worlds" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Hollywood has remade another hit from another era, and, like "Charlie," this one was totally unnecessary. The newest "Bad News Bears" is so much like the first, you wonder why director Richard Linklater ("Before Sunset," "School Of Rock") did not try something a little different with the premise. In fact, it has everything the first one has except wit, charm and laughs. Plot has alcoholic exterminator and former Major League pitcher (he is credited with two-thirds of an inning for the Seattle Mariners in 1984) Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton, fresh off his legitimate sports take in "Friday Night Lights") being paid to coach a team of losers and rejects, playing in the South Valley Little League. The team, the Bears, exists only because of a lawsuit filed by the mother of one of the boys (Marcia Gay Harden, Oscar winner for "Pollock" in 2000), so none of the other clubs has even the tiniest bit of respect for them. And it's no wonder. None of the players has any ability whatsoever. It makes you wonder why these kids even took up the game, since none can play and no one enjoys the activity. Buttermaker is no help, though, making the kids help kill rats and constantly getting drunk. When the hated Yankees score 18 runs in the first inning against them, all the Bears want to quit, but the addition of a great girl pitcher, Amanda Wulitzer (Sammi Kraft) and a power-hitting rebel, Kelly Leach (Jeff Davies) turns the team around, gives them confidence and pushes them into the championship game versus the pinstripes. The Yankees coach is the win-at-all-costs, Bullock (Greg Kinear, "As Good As It Gets"), who spends most of the time huffing and puffing about the "joy of the game." Thornton can play outrageous, having done so in the dark comedy, "Bad Santa," but here he emotes only every now and then, making few believes he has any stake in the team or cares about even being in this film. The names of all the characters are also pretty much the same as the 1976 picture (Tanner, Engelberg, Lupas, Ahmad, et al), the plot is the same, and the dialogue while a little raunchier ? is basically a complete duplicate. The only real difference is the inclusion of a kid in a wheelchair, and a gaggle of Hooters groupies who seem to cheer for the kids at every game. So, with all of that, why even remake a classic comedy that is still funny to this day. What's the point? After seeing this film, I still cannot figure that one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I don't understand why everybody is bagging on it. Bad News Bears is not meant to be some intellectual masterpiece, its just supposed to be funny. And I think it was. This is a good family movie, though there are parts with strong language. A little kid wouldn't be paying attention to the parts where there are bad words, personally think they only payed attention to the baseball parts. Plus, its not like they know what those words mean and they don't know they're bad. And if they don't know they're bad, chances are it will just go in one ear and out the other. Usually I don't like Billy Bob's movies but I think he did a good job in Bad News Bears.The new Amanda and Kelly were good too, though many people probably won't agree with me there. This will always be my favorite baseball movie, no matter what any of the critics say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I'm going to go shopping for a file cabinet this weekend. I've been meaning to get my life more organized, and I figured it'd be a good idea to start filing things. I'll pick up several folders as well, and I'll be sure to label one "Unnecessary Wastes of my Time." Under "U" of course. And while I'm at it, I think I'll go ahead and make "Remake of The Bad News Bears" the first entry I file.I actually expected to be fairly entertained by this movie, so I was quite shocked by how pedestrian it is. Billy Bob Thornton as an alcoholic Little League baseball coach? Come on, that's gotta be pretty funny, right? Well, you'd think. But strangely enough, Thornton is quite subdued, and apparently the writers thought it'd be absolutely hilarious if they made the kids raunchier than Thornton. Perhaps the writers could use a course on how to more effectively think things through.I never dismiss a movie immediately just because it's a remake. I always give it a chance to stand on its own merits. Unfortunately, this is a remake that seems content with touching all the main plot points from the original, and then just making the kids cuss more. Sorry, but I fail to see the humor in 11 year olds running around saying God-d**n and the like. Har har har, yeah, there's some crisp screen writing there. If I see an 11 or 12 year old using that kind of language in real life I can't help but think it's a punk who hasn't been taken to the woodshed enough. I certainly don't cheer them on. Same thing with the kids in this movie.I'm all for a good underdog story, but this is one of the least inspiring underdog movies I've ever seen. I was actually rooting against the Bears. Talk about the biggest collection of annoying kid actors I've seen in a long time, especially Tanner (Timmy Deters). It's bad enough that his stupid girly hair makes him look like a young Natalie Maines, but his taste for the profane and penchant for getting into fights indicate to me that he's just going to be another drain on taxpayer money when he's sitting in a jail cell in a few years. He's a prime example of why you shouldn't spare the rod.The movie also tries way too hard to attempt to be controversial without being all that offensive. For example, the uniforms are sponsored by Bo Beeps strip club. This doesn't offend me so much as it insults my intellect due to the fact that it's just not very funny. "Haha, look at how irreverent we are! This is edgy stuff! We have now thusly taken the kids to dine at Hooters! Bow at our over-the-top vulgarity!" Um, I'm not too impressed. "Well you should be! Fine, we will henceforth throw in another instance of a child using a curse word! That shall surely induce fits of laughter!" Not really."Oh, well, then we shall have Billy Bob say such taboo things as, 'This is not a democracy! It's a dictatorship, and I'm Hitler!" Woo, yeah, that's really crossing the line there. Nice try. Maybe if you have a sequel you can replace "Hitler" with "Stalin" or "Hussein" and REALLY cross the line. Good job, guys, you've got some ready-made quotes just sitting in the queue.Give me a break. Billy Bob does have his moments, and he's obviously the funniest thing the movie has going for it, but at times the movie seems like an awkward attempt at letting him just monologue in an effort to come up with a memorable one-liner. After each failed attempt he's allowed to keep going, as if we're being treated to a deleted rehearsal scene or something. "The audience didn't laugh? OK, let's try another..." Oh, and let me get back to the kids for a second - for the most part they're all really bad actors. Especially Sammi Kraft and Jeff Davies. I know they didn't have previous acting experience, but sheesh, it sticks out like Paris Hilton at a virgin convention. I started to feel embarrassed watching Ms. Kraft trying to spit out a simple line like, "You. are. a. lazy. drunk." My sister thought she recognized the girl and asked me, "Where else have I seen her?" I responded with, "Not acting school." And poor Jeff Davies - sure, he can hit a baseball, but he looks like Corey Feldman going through an awkward stage of puberty, and his line delivery is just as unemotional as Ms. Kraft's. I just didn't buy him as the bad boy that Jackie Earle Haley portrayed so well in the original. It's not often that I'm actually shocked by truly bad acting in a big screen release, so congrats, Bad News Bears! You've got that going for you! After about 35 minutes, when I realized this just wasn't going to be a very funny movie, I decided to start counting how many times we were expected to laugh at dropped fly balls, booted grounders, turd jokes, and the kids insulting each other and getting into fights. After I had exhausted all 10 fingers within the course of about 5 minutes I decided to just give up, lean back in my seat, and ride it out. T'wasn't easy, especially since this inexplicably lasts almost two hours, but I survived.Whenever Billy Bob announces who the Bears will be playing next he asks them what that means for the opposing team. The players yell out, "Bad news!" How ironic that the same mantra can be applied to what you can expect if you fork out your hard-earned dough to see this on the big screen.</fullReview>
