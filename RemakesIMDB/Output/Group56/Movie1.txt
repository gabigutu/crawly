		<fullReview>I was really impressed with how well this movie has "aged." Walter Natthau plays that role of the alcoholic wash-out to perfection, and Tatum O'Neal portrays the struggle of a young girl trying to enter adolescence without losing her sense of "self" with delicacy and skill. It's a good story,with quite a bit serious to say about human nature and the understandings and misunderstandings between generations; it makes me mad that it never received the attention it deserved because it's "just" about kids. On a sadder note, I also couldn't help being impressed with how far this culture has regressed since 1976. The children's use of even mild profanity would never be permitted now in a "family film," and the wonderful scene at the end would certainly send the Thought Police running for their placards and boycotts. It's worth watching this film again just to remind ourselves that only 30 years ago children still enjoyed some autonomous space in which to grow, and the iron doors of the Nanny State had not yet completely swung closed upon them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be required viewing for anyone who coaches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bad News for the Athletics!" This movie should be required viewing for parents and coaches of any sport at any level. It reminds me of what is wrong about youth sports, but at the same time what makes youth sports great. There are many lessons to be learned from this movie. It is sad, but many parents and coaches continue to make the game about themselves and not about the children playing. Bad News Bears shows just how ridiculous that type of attitude regarding youth sports is.Bad News Bears is the original kids/sports movie without the Disney cliches. There isn't a clear cut bad guy, each coach (Buttermaker and Turner) have there faults and motivation. It is also refreshing that the movie does not have the typical Hollywood ending, but instead one that is fitting for the team sponsored by Chico's Bail Bonds.Bad News Bears is also a great reminder of life in the late 1970s, the uniforms, clothes, cars, etc. Finally, it is an entertaining movie, especially for anyone who has played little league baseball (or any youth sport). It makes me laughs every time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Single Greatest Kids and Sports Movie EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that is an exaggeration, but I truly believe that this movie sets the standard by which all other "kids and sports" movies will be measured.What it does that is unique is that it keeps the swearing and fighting where it belongs: on the field. This movie does not even try to make anyone look good, for the sake of making them look good. It just shows the kids at their very essence: booger-eating morons, just out to have a good time trying to play baseball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cutthroat Little League--in all its sprinkler-system, sun-&amp;-Schlitz-drenched glory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scrappy pool-cleaner (and former ballplayer) in Southern California gets talked into coaching Little League to a bunch of no-talent boys. I don't think I've ever seen another movie that captured this bit of Americana so vividly: you can almost smell the freshly-cut grass and the cigar smoke in the air! One of Walter Matthau's many triumphs, and Tatum O'Neal as the pitching ace is also terrific (especially in the dug-out scene where she tries involving Matthau in her life and he cracks, sending her away in tears: "You don't wanna go, fine, no big deal."). The young boys are mostly all wonderful: Alfred Lutter, from "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore", as the nerdy brain; Jackie Earle Haley as the cool kid with shades and motorcycle; Brandon Cruz, from "The Courtship of Eddie's Father", as the pitcher for the enemy-team. The film has some overacting and is occasionally sloppy (with the boom-mike showing, as well as O'Neal's stand-in in a wig), but is otherwise extremely well-written and designed and directed. In 1976, this had kids and adults lining up to see it, so I wouldn't consider the picture a 'sleeper' or an underrated film. It was a big commercial box-office hit and there is an audience for it wherever there's a DVD player and a screen. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb movie. I don't think it will ever become dated--not as long as little league baseball is in existence. I remember first seeing it at a drive-in when I was ten, shortly after my own little league season had finished. Walter Matthau is excellent as Buttermaker, the beer-soaked coach who takes on the unwanted task of coaching a team of misfit kids who were allowed to play in the league only after a civil action law suit was won in their favor. Tatum O'Neal shines as the team's recruited pitcher Amanda, whose mother once dated Buttermaker. A touching subplot involves the relationship between Amanda and Buttermaker which turns from distant to warm as the final game approaches. Vic Morrow gives a frighteningly good performance as the out-to-win-no-matter-what coach of the opposing team who was never happy with the fact that the Bears were allowed to play in the first place. Joyce Van Patten is also good as the butch, outspoken league supervisor.It's the kid players that really give this movie the edge. All performances are top-notch, and director Michael Ritchie splendidly keeps the focus mostly on them and their feelings about the whole ordeal. Stand-outs include Jackie Earl Haley as the heroic Kelly Leak and Chris Barnes as shortstop Tanner Boyle. This film should be a warning to relentless adults who try to achieve stardom on the backs of their children, be it on the baseball field or on the ballet floor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Childhood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bad News Bears" came out in 1976, the summer that I started playing little league. I know I am not breaking any new ground when I say that this film is a classic, but hopefully I can educate some of the younger viewers and posters as to how realistic this film is, in some ways.First of all, I believe that anyone who has ever played organized youth sports has had a Tanner Boyle, Timmy Lupus and a Kelly Leek on their teams. This is just how it is, and for better or worse, it is one of the galvanizing factors that make youth leagues etch themselves indelibly into the memories of all those who have participated in them.Second of all, kids curse. I don't know who the "nay-sayers" out there are, but they should look back into their own memories and try to figure out just when they learned to use the F-word. If you didn't learn it from your parents, you learned it from other kids. Granted, not all of us knew exactly what the words meant at that age, but we still used them. It was a small measure of rebellion at the age of seven.When Tanner Boyle makes the comment that the team is filled with "niggers, spics, Jews and now a broad," it would be a crass, hateful comment if it had come from an adult. Yet, as a youth, Tanner gets a laugh because we all know that he doesn't really mean it, he is just repeating what he has heard at home -- not to condone what might have been said over the Boyle dinner table. The proof of this is obvious when Tanner "takes on the seventh grade," and makes a valiant attempt to preserve Timmy Lupus' honor before he gets thrown into a garbage can. Regardless of Tanner's racist remarks about the team, and his shunning of Lupus, "Lupus, why don't you sit over there? (abbr.)" he is willing to fight for those same people.Third, (sorry for the digression), that's what parents are like. It is a truth that goes down through the ages: when it comes to their children, all adults are a-holes. When it comes time to see their children strive to excel at something, they become the obnoxious, bullying, chest-beating sh**s they have warned their children not to be. For the most part it is an extension to the children for what the parents' couldn't be in the first place, e.g. a good shortstop.And Fourth: Losing. There is something about those pinstripes and even the moniker "Yankees" that make some of us want to do violent things to a couch. Mind you, I am not a native southerner, nor am I a Red Sox fan. I am just a man who can see the fact that pinstripes and the word "Yankees" symbolizes a corporate juggernaut that tries to annihilate the concept of fair play. For the Bears to ultilmately lose to the "Yankees" is just. They got beat. Perhaps it is an irony that this movie came out one year after the last choppers left Saigon, that defeat was in the air, so to speak. There was still a message to this movie. A message that I have carried throughout my adult life. A message that Churchill had during the Blitz, and Giuliani had in the post 9/11 rubble. Once again, a line from Tanner Boyle: "Hey Yankees, you can take your trophy and shove it up your ass. Just wait until next year!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who better to leave your children's care than in the hands of an alcoholic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOL, I know I stole that line from I love the 70's, but I just thought it was so true and that was my exact thought from the first minute I started watching The Bad News Bears. Now to the movie, The Bad News Bears is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time, I almost died laughing throughout the whole movie. I obviously heard about this movie from the show I love the 70's on VH1, way before the remake with Billy Bob Thorton. It always slipped my mind though when I wanted to rent it, but finally I remembered and I am so glad that I got the chance to see it, because this is one of the best comedies to come out of the 70's.Buttermaker is a has been baseball player and now an alcoholic, he is given the job of a little league coach for the Bears since no other fathers are taking the job. But he's definitely taken back when he finds out that the team he is coaching are kids who are, well, I guess you could say "lacking" in the department of knowing how to play baseball. But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with, but when their first game comes along, the kids get creamed 26-0, Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league, but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids, a girl who's mother he used to date, and a rebel without a cause. The kids get better in each game, but it's a matter of Buttermaker getting his priorities straight when he lets the game get the worst of him... and he's an alcoholic! The Bad News Bears is just so funny, Walter Matthau was just too perfect for this role as Buttermaker, he was so believable. I think my favorite Bear was Tanner, because the role could have been over done, but the kid did it just right, not to mention his last line of the film is just classic and fit the movie just right. I loved how the film wasn't your traditional your favorite team is always going to be out of no where champions, this was an awesome comedy that anyone would just fall in love with.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated 1970's comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!! Any list of the top ten films from 1976 should include "The Bad News Bears," but most probably don't, since this film was, and remains, an underrated classic. I can't say enough about how much I love and appreciate this film, and it remains fresh and vital nearly 27 years later.Walter Matthau is Morris Buttermaker, a washed-up minor league pitcher turned alcoholic San Fernando Valley pool cleaner. He's hired by a client, Councilman Whitewood (Ben Piazza) to coach a pathetic baseball team called the Bears, made up of pre-teen Little League rejects. This doesn't sit well with Roy Turner (Vic Morrow), unofficial head of the League and hard-case coach of the best team, the Yankees. He's p.o.'d because Whitewood sued to have the boys accepted into the league instead of letting them play in less competitive leagues in the Valley. His contempt is shared by his assistant Cleveland (Joyce Van Patten), an undecidedly nasty piece of work. Buttermaker, however, couldn't care less since he only agreed to coach after Whitewood agreed to pay him, since noone else would do it. And it's no wonder: this is the most pathetic group of losers you'd ever imagine--all of them the type of kids that would be picked last in any P.E. class. (I say this affectionately since I was the type myself.) There's fat Engelberg, the emotionally unstable catcher; Ogilvie (Alfred Lutter), the brain and expert on baseball stats; Whitewood's amiable son Toby; the token African-American Ahmad Abdul-Raheem (Erin Blunt), a Hank Aaron wannabe; Jewish pitcher Rudy Stein, who couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat; the Mexican Aguilar brothers, who don't speak English; Regi Tower, an average kid with a typically overbearing Little League father; curly-topped Jimmy Feldman; and most famously Tanner Boyle (the terrific Chris Barnes), a foul-mouthed, hot-tempered and fist-happy runt and his nemesis Timmy Lupus, a shy, quiet back-of-the-class type who Tanner berates in the film's most famous line of dialog as a "booger-eating moron."The plot proceeds according to form: the teams stinks, they fight, they lose their first game in embarassing fashion, all the while Buttermaker drinks himself into a stupor and barely notices. But after seeing the kids humiliated--and being insulted himself one-to-many times by the apallingly arrogant Turner--he decides to get serious and pulls a couple of secret weapons out of his hat: his former girlfriend's eleven-year-old spitball-throwing daughter (Tatum O'Neill) and the town juvenile delinquent Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley), a chain-smoking, skirt-chasing, motorcycle-riding hellion who is a seriously talented ballplayer no one else wants because of his attitude. And to everyone's amazement, they manage to turn the whole league upside down.There are many things to like about this film but I'll start first and foremost with the script, which was written by Burt Lancaster's son Bill Lancaster. This script should be taught in every screenwriting class on how to write for the screen. There is not a single wasted line of dialog, wasted scene or wasted moment in the entire film. Every line of dialog advances either the plot or character development, every scene is necessary and runs exactly the right length. And it is absolutely astonishing that in merely 102 minutes, the film deals with 18 major characters (13 team members, Buttermaker, Turner, Cleveland, Whitewood and Turner's little jerk of a son Joey) and gives every one of them a moment to shine and a distinct personality while not straying from it's central theme of the importance of teamwork and perserverance. And the entire film takes place on or around the ballfield, the exceptions being when Buttermaker visits Amanda and takes the team along on some pool-cleaning jobs. And the film is refreshingly unsentimental. When the story starts the kids dislike Matthau and he dislikes them. At the end, they still aren't wild about each other, but they have developed mutual respect. Buttermaker's relationship with Amanda is also something to behold--he refuses to admit how much he cares about the kid even when she practically begs him to. In one particularly memorable scene he actually throws a beer at her; I'd have to say anyone who doesn't think Tatum O'Neal can act should watch this scene and they'll know she's capable of better than she's given over the years.Michael Ritchie's direction is also something special and probably as responsible for the tight construction of the film as Lancaster's script. Not once does he let the action get out of control and he coaxes good performances out of all the kids, especially Haley, Lutter and Barnes. Matthau is terrific, but then Matthau is always terrific. Morrow is also perfect as Turner, especially in an astonishing scene when he confronts his son about an "inside pitch." And the ending is perfect, and ironically similar to that of 1976's other crowd-pleasing sports movie, Best Picture Oscar-winner "Rocky."In 1976 the main source of appeal of the film was the four-letter words spouted by the kids, which was something we hadn't seen before in an era of squeaky-clean Disney family films. And while some of the lines are hilarious, they are also the weak part of the film. It's believable that kids would talk this way, especially around someone like Buttermaker, but not during a Little League game, especially the championship game where they threaten each other with bats, kick each other in the groin, give each other the finger, etc. It's just not believable. Also, as another poster wrote earlier, "ringers" aren't allowed so Amanda probably would be ineligible to play. But these are minor quibbles. "The Bad News Bears" is a winner, and in spite of the "family film" reputation it has because of it's bowdlerized TV version, it is actually for teens and up. In other words, it earns its PG rating.I have one rant: Once again, Paramount video has let DVD viewers down. The current DVD consists of absolutely no extras of any kind. No documentaries, no commentaries, no trailers, no nothing. I realize Ritchie, Lancaster, Matthau, Morrow and Piazza are no longer living and therefore a commentary track might not have been as informative as we would have liked, but producer Jaffe, Joyce "Cleveland" Van Patten, O'Neal, Haley, Cruz and the rest of the kids are still alive, so a commentary track would still have been possible. Also, a "where are they now" documentary on the kids and their experiences making the film would be informative and fun. So, how about it, Paramount? Why don't you stop being the bargain basement, stingy DVD outfit that you are and start taking your job as film restorers and historians seriously and give classics like this the DVD treatment it deserves. (See Disney's Vault Classics for instruction on how it should be done.) Thanks for nothing. ****1/2 (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, and all the more for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I am not a huge sports fan, but several sports movies have sparked my interest, such as Hoosiers, Breaking Away and Remember the Titans. I saw The Bad News Bears mostly for Walter Matthau and I really enjoyed it. While it could have been a tad longer perhaps, and one or two scenes could have been tighter in the pace, it is a very good movie. For a sports movie, it is quite different, taking on the underdogs taking on the big boys scenario for example, and it works wonderfully.The production values are very nice, and Jerry Fielding's score compliments each scene beautifully. The film's script is quite gritty, but it is also funny and thoughtful, while the story is always engaging and well-thought out with the relationship between Morris and his team particularly pulling you in. The direction is solid, while the acting is excellent. Walter Matthau is simply brilliant as the boozy coach Morris, while Joyce Van Patten gives great support and the child stars are more than a match for Matthau. Especially Tatum O'Neal, who is quite charming yet very spunky and likable, and I personally think she has better screen presence than her dad.All in all, a very enjoyable movie, and whether you are a fan of sports movies or not, this movie is recommended. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad News Bears..The MOST deliciously UN-PC movie in history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this classic again now that I am well into my thirties reminds me just how bland and painfully sanitized movies of today are. Can you even Imagine a movie made today in Hollywood, with a PG or even PG-Thirteen rating, coming anywhere close to the wonderfully political incorectness that this film had? Just off the top of my head I have made a list of the PC no-no's that this film gleefully rips to shreds. 1. Coach Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau). Constantly smoking cigars and downing more beer than a super bowl party held at A sports bar; in front of and in plain sight of little leaguers. My god, he even has, in one scene, one of his players mix him a martini as he lounges back on a lawn chair. If thats not enough, at the end of the movie he breaks out a cooler of bottles of beer and starts passing them around to the kids to drink! Remember these are not 17 or 18 year old high school kids, these are 11 and 12 year olds grade school kids! Yet nobody in the movie makes a terrible stink about it. Don't get me wrong, I do not in anyway condone underage drinking, but this is just a movie and I got to admit the way it was done was funny to watch. My point is that there is no way in hell you could pull that off today in a PG, PG-13, or maybe even R rating film.2. Tanner Boyle AKA The little Bigot. I have got to tell you, the character of Tanner Boyle was so UN-PC by todays standards that I am amazed that they got away with it 30 years ago. This kid is a hotheaded foul mouthed little punk that berates everyone and is always spoiling for a fight. Worst of all is his unabashed use of using several racial slurs to impune his fellow teammates. I will not repeat what he says but suffice to say that it strikes you with all the subtlety of a bucket of Ice water. However, just like the alcohol, they way the movie handles it is funny. I think the reason it works is that it doesn't pull any punches when it come to showing children in different lights. Kids are as diverse and complicated as adults. Some are kind, friendly, intelligent, caring, some are shy, troubled, frightened, introverted, and like it or not, some, just like this kid, are mean, nasty, foul-mouthed, and yes bigoted. You could NEVER get this kind of dialouge or this type of little racist in a PG or PG-13 movie today. Once again, I don't condone what the character is saying, But looking back on my childhood, I Knew a good number of "Tanner's" who acted just like this kid. Like it or not.In Conclusion, Bad News Bears is a very funny movie. Some people may be put off by its Political Incorectness, for the reasons I have already given, but I urge you see the film as a brutally honest portrait of not just kids in sports, but kids in general. My whole point was to illustrate how movies of today have lost there edge when it comes to dealing with delegate subjects, exspecally when kids are involved. All you have to do is look at the remake of The bad News bears a few years ago. While it did have some residual elements of the original, It was horrificaly gutted and cleaned up for todays crowds. Is that a good thing? Are the Un-PC moments I have mentioned here not better to do without completely? Well....It boils down to a matter of opinion. In my opinion, as I have stated before, it depends on how it is handeld. To me, if its honest or trying to make a point, it should not be hidden just to spare our feelings. I think we go to the movies to be entertained, yes, but remember one persons idea of what is "Trash" can also be another persons "Tresure". The Bad News Bears While being rough around the edges is a unpolished gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film for the first time in many years (thanks TCM), and it's still very funny. It's also touching, as the portrayal of early-adolescent personalities is often quite moving, between gut-busting guffaws. The stereotyped "Little-League parents" are drawn very realistically as well, and Joyce VanPatten's turn as the bitch of an equipment manager is superb. Having been unathletic as a child, I still get damp around the eyes every time Timmy Lupus catches that fly ball. Even though I would've hated him if I'd known him in school, I now admire the spunk and tenacity of Tanner. There are lots of great lines in this script, and I look forward to seeing the film many more times. Bears rule!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Their Lives Before The Trophy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:When we first meet Buttermaker, he is half drunk openly mixing boilermakers in the baseball field's parking lot. He is taking this job to supplement his pool cleaning job. He is handed the usual collection of the world's worst baseball players. He is forced to bring in his estranged daughter Amanda, the ace pitcher, and recruit the local juvenile delinquent played by a very young Watchman's Earle Haley. The film deepens as he molds them together, though realistically, tensions never quite disappear. The scene where Amanda tries pushing him to go out on a date with his ex plus Amanda gets quite ugly verbally. Now we understand two things: why she wished to be on the team and why he drinks. Why this endures plays out as Buttermaker beholds the villain of the movie played by Vic Morrow who drives his poor charges with a whip and a chair. There is a hilarious speech where Morrow acts like if they lose this game the earth's magnetic field will reverse polarity. This, with the brave unconventional ending, is why this is a classic and the sequels disappeared like lightning. It is not phony, Buttermaker gets caught up in winning and begins to turn into Vic Morrow. His team starts looking at him differently and I don't mean positively.The epiphany comes when Morrow's son, the pitcher, tries to bean his chubby nemesis on the Bears. Morrow comes up and slaps him hard, publicly, in a scene that never could have been shot today. The kid bravely holds the ball, on the next play, allowing all the Bears' runners to score. He then walks over and drops the ball contemptuously in front of Morrow and walks away with his mom. This experience changes Buttermaker, the camera zooms on his face, he pulls all the starters out and puts the bench in. Oglethorpe, the dreadful pitcher, warns him,"Don't put me in, I stink!" The parents have a baby; the director toys with you, allows you to think they might pull it off but realistically they lose. He tops it off by giving them all beers. The essence of its success is where Lupus, the worst, smallest player, catches an outfield fly ball. He learns, after witnessing the cruelty of Morrow, to see the children inside of these uniforms. He chooses them over fulfilling the parents' need for reflective glory drawn from their children.This is why even if you don't love baseball, like I do, you should watch the movie. The humor can be quite profane at times. It had a little too much profanity for my taste. Yet, the core message is why it resonated: you are there to guide them and help them not to use them for your glorification. They see he cares more for them than for the trophy and they return back to him. He had been pushing them away, like Morrow, they began to see themselves as only instrumentalities for his self aggrandizement. Within the profanity, there is a beautiful movie about a lost, depressed man estranged from his family coming back by helping these kids. The quintessence of the movie is when he existentially turns from becoming another Vic Morrow to caring for the children in the uniforms. He sees their souls not the trophy. It lives on because beneath the baseball it has a deeply moral base. Yes, parents, the language and the drinking are problematic for little ones. Teenagers would be a better audience. In giving and guiding them, he is changed and they bring him back from the edge. Never underestimate the transformative power of helping the helpless. He pulls them up and they pull him back to life. A Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right up there with The Sandlot as best kids playing baseball movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sandlot and Bad News Bears are by far the two best movies involving kids playing baseball. You have Walter Matthau as Morris Buttermaker the beer drinking coach of the team. Tatum O'Neal plays his stepdaughter who becomes his star pitcher. Jackie Earl Haley as the bad boy Kelly Leak the motorcycle riding kid.Buttermaker makes this team of misfits into a winning team when the league didn't even want to let these kids play.The movie is most definitely primarily a comedy but there's a lot more depth to it then just that. It's about a team of kids who aren't very coordinated and a lot of them who are quite frankly afraid of the ball. At first Buttermaker doesn't put that much effort into his coaching but eventually starts to care about the kids and gets them to play better and they turn things around.</fullReview>

Or 11 year old girls who go on dates to Grateful Dead concerts to persuade the local hood, Jackie Earle Haley, to join the team? Haley ends up chasing after Tatum O'Neal, whom Walter Matthau has bribed to join the team with the promise of free ballet lessons. So Halley, wearing cool sunglasses, has crashed a ballet lesson and ends up putting the make on an adult ballet student in tights twice his size with the line: "Do you live around here? I've got a Harley-Davidson. Does that turn you on? A Harley Davidson?' And then there is the overweight catcher who throws the ball back to Matthau covered with chocolate. During practice Matthau lays down a bunt and the catcher just stands there. Matthau tells him it is his job to get the ball and throw it to first base. The catcher is highly annoyed.So then in the first game when the Bears are being pummeled, a hitter lays down a bunt. What does the catcher do? He tries to get the runner out at home by throwing it to a very puzzled umpire.There are, I hear, some people who for some reason do not like Walter Matthau. Well, this is one of his truly great roles. Watch how he interacts with the kids and reacts nice and slow. There are parts later in the movie where he gets really angry, very convincingly, but mostly he is very relaxed, and his acting looks real natural. Some of the kids may have been a little stiff, I think he brings out the best from them with this style. It is great acting because he is so natural.I decided to re-watch this after an aborted attempt to make it through the remake, which lacks any of the charm and believability of the original, and said, hey, isn't that Moocher from Breaking Away as the hood? Sure enough, it was a younger Jackie Earle Haley. He's an interesting actor.If you like The Bad News Bears you might also like Breaking Away, which is about some teenagers who enter a bicycle race. One of the great sleeper movies, though at the time of its release everyone it seemed was talking about it.And if you like Matthau in this, check out Hopscotch. Another great role of his is in Mirage, with Gregory Peck, as a private eye -- a hard to find movie.Because of the swearing, this may not be suitable for little kids. Really, it is a movie for adults to watch and learn from, especially parents involved in kids sports. Come to think of it, Bad News Bears was ahead of its time. It is about adults who get bent out of shape trying to push the kids, a growing problem we've read about in the news in recent years. The lesson is its about learning to play as a team and have fun, and to be a kid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buttermakers's Bail Bond Backed Bears.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rewarding for both adults and children, this funny and astute movie revels in poking the ribs of Little League Baseball whilst casting a cautionary eye of the obsession some have with winning. An on form Walter Matthau stars as Morris Buttermaker, a now washed up ex minor league player who, prompted by a financial carrot, becomes manager of a multi-racial team of Little League misfits. It's originally a rough road as Buttermaker is more concerned with drinking beer, while the kids themselves don't know which end of the bat to hold. But things start to pick up when Morris enlists his talented daughter Manda (Tatum O'Neal) to pitch for them. Not only that but the town rebel, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earl Hayley), with points to prove, has also been prompted to join.Directed by Michael Ritchie and written by Bill Lancaster (yes, Burt's son), The Bad News Bears never sinks to being a preachy fable. It also delightfully doesn't resort to type for its finale. Making this a very clever and aware film from a genre of film so often troubled by safe playing and a too frothy approach. It would spawn two so so sequels in the next two years, inspire an imitation, get a TV series make over and was remade in 2005 with Billy Bob Thornton taking on the role of Buttermaker. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foul-mouthed comedy with good sportsmanship values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any of the kids in "The Bad News Bears" were your child, or if you had any acquaintance with a youth sports coach even remotely like Morris Buttermaker, you'd be outraged and embarrassed. At the same time, the film delivers a message that all involved with youth sports probably couldn't hear enough of. In other words, do as "Bad News Bears" implies, not as it says or does and take the foul language and poor behavior at comedic face value only.Walter Matthau stars as Buttermaker, an drunken former minor leaguer who coaches a little league team because his job as a pool cleaner isn't exactly lucrative. His job is to coach the Bears, a group of untalented misfits, most of whom have attitude problems. Basically from Buttermaker and the other adults involved in the league all the way down to the rebel kid, Kelly (Jackie Earle Haley), who tears up the field with his motorcycle, not a character has respect for another. Kids talk back to adults, adults yell at kids -- it's an ugly scene. How "Bears" redeems itself is something of a feat.You can't deny "Bears" its heart. Every lesson there is to be learned from youth sports finds its way into this film. At the very beginning the Bears give up 20 runs in the first and forfeit. Quitting and adopting a counter attitude is present from then on. Then there's the balance between winning and playing the game, something many parents and coaches still lose sight of even today. Despite filling its cast with rotten blonde kids and insensitive adults, "Bears" sneaks this in naturally. The film nearly gets dramatic at times considering the extent to which the disrespect does become a serious part of the story.So on one hand, you have a little blonde kid saying "Great, we have a team full of (insert racial slurs here) and now a girl!" and then you have examples of good sportsmanship winning out. It's tough to call "Bears" a family film or a kids film for that reason, but then again, some kids would really benefit from the values. Most of all parents of kids in youth sports need to see this movie as it really speaks at them.As a comedy, a good chunk of that nastiness earns a good deal of laughs, especially when it involves the innocence of kids rather than the awfulness of the adults. If blurring the line between acceptable behavior in films and comedy is fine by you, "Bears" is as good a sports comedy as any. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I played Little League way back when, and this movie is pretty true to my experience. The parents are all into it, and their competitiveness rubs off on the kids. If a kid isn't good, he gets beat up by other kids. Hey, this is what makes America great, right? It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, and hitting that home run is basically no different than selling that house, getting that raise, or getting into that country club.Those considerations aside, baseball is a wonderful sport (much better, in my opinion, than football and basketball.) It has a grace and honor all of its own. And the lessons you learn playing as a team are what really count.A highlight of this movie is the team manager's insistence on risking the championship by letting the "bad" kids play.Another highlight is a kid deliberately letting the opposing team get a home run after his father/coach loses it and hits him on the field.The juvenile delinquent kid trying to pick up the ballerina was a classic scene.One of the charms of this movie is that the kids -- many of whom look so innocent and angelic -- are foul mouthed, talking back to the adults and making racist and sexist comments.Why is this not offensive? Why is it refreshing? Because we live in a politically correct (read: dumbed down and hateful) age in which the ultimate sin is to offend anyone -- even those who have it coming. But only because of that.Walter Matthau is perfect as the alcoholic coach who finally cleans up his act a little bit and gets back into the spirit of winning.The classical music that goes along with movie is wonderful, even though that might seem to be an odd choice of music for a movie like this.There is really no way to convey the delight of this movie through words. You just have to see it. Would I show it to my kids? Mmm. Don't know about that. But it sure is fun viewing for adults!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sportsmanship versus winning at all costs - Little League Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never was in the Little League. Probably it was just as well, as I never really got into any sporting activity until I discovered swimming. But my nephew was in the Little League in Connecticut, and his career was distinguished by being in the outfield, and enjoying looking at the sky and clouds, or the green grass, or the back wall - and rarely looking at the thing mattered most: the ball.It has become a commonplace piece of knowledge that for many kids being on a baseball team in the Little Leagues around the country is a nightmare. The kids look forward to the fun of playing baseball games with kids their own age. The problem is that all too often the enjoyment of the game (and the teaching of good sportsmanship) are sacrificed for the sake of the grown-ups who are in the background (parents, patrons of the teams) and the managers. These grown-ups are only concerned about winning. They have taken the view that winning is the end-all and be-all of living, and that second or third or fourth place in the standings is worthless. Unfortunately too many grown-ups feel this way. After all, how many people are active fans of the real major league teams that constantly are in the cellar? Occasionally such a team (the old Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1920s - 1930s or the original New York Mets comes to mind) do have such a following, but that is a rarity.THE BAD NEWS BEARS was the first film that tackled this problem of bad sportsmanship and enshrining winning within what should be the purest form of baseball. After all, Little League is for kids...isn't it?There are similarities in the film between the character of Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau) and Tom Hanks' character in A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, about the women's baseball league of the Second World War era. Hanks and Matthau have serious drinking problems. Hanks is in the majors with a Chicago team but is washing himself up with management - and takes this job managing the woman's team as a last chance to square things with his boss. Butterworth was a promising rookie in the minor leagues, who once (in a practice game) struck out Ted Williams. But contract disputes (he claims) prevented him from getting into the majors, and he takes the job managing the Yuma Bears for a salary. It is obvious that the parents behind this (led by a Councilman played by Ben Piazza) have little faith in his long dormant abilities - the Councilman even tries to palm off an unsigned check to Butterworth for his services at the beginning (a real sign of contempt). Subsequently the Councilman even drops supporting the team when it loses it's first game by a score of 26 to 0.Certainly the team is full of misfits, an overweight kid with a loud mouth (Gary Lee Cavagnaro), a would be African-American militant (Erin Blunt), and two Spanish speaking kids (Jaime Escobedo and George Gonzales) being only a portion of them. And initially the opportunist in Butterworth makes his work as manager become second-rate (he rarely trains them when sober, and he even has them assist him in his job as a swimming pool cleaner). But their unhappiness at their first defeat is too much. Also there is the unasked for and patronizing advise of fellow Coach Roy Turner (Vic Morrow, in a good performance), who is stressing how embarrassing the Bears are, and how they have no place in the league, and should quit. Matthau takes such a dislike to him that he is determined to turn the team around.He does this first by actually training the team, so they start cohering together (and start actually playing the game correctly). Then he goes after his one great discovery. When he was romancing her mother, Butterworth was training Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neill) on pitching and fielding, so that she is a powerhouse (though not as good as a hitter). He manages to get her to join the team, agreeing to pay for her ballet classes and for a pair of European jeans she wants. Later he also manages to get another good all-around player, Tanner Boyle (Chris Barnes). The result is that the team soon is zooming up in the League to the point that it and Turner's "Yankees" are to play the deciding game of the summer.Butterworth does not realize that Amanda's willingness to go along with him is based on the hope that he (a man she actually idolizes) will marry her mother. As for Tanner, he's a pint-sized hood who happens to decide to join the Bears only because he dislikes the self-important Turner (who keeps harassing him on the baseball field).The final twenty minutes of the movie deals with the "price" the poor kids in both teams pay for the glory of the adults. Butterworth shows a mean opportunism that the kids resent on his team, while Turner manages to permanently louse up his relationship with his son and wife by humiliating the boy for not following his orders. By the way, Turner's son gets one of the best revenges on an adult I've ever seen in any movie dealing with inter-generational and family relationships. Let us just say Turner is not facing a happy future when the film ends.A comedy about an area rarely touched until then in films (a scene in the James Garner - Kim Novak comedy BOYS NIGHT OUT was one of the few that dealt with Little League before this full study of it), THE BAD NEWS BEARS is a nice reaffirmation on what sports is supposed to be about: fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than A Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many of us growing up 30 years ago when "The Bad News Bears" first came out, this is the film that peeled back the suburban sheen of middle-class American life and used that anchor of conformity, Little League Baseball, to lay it all bare: the false values, the fear of mediocrity, coming to grips with the hard truths of life. Like many gut-punch films, like "Great Dictator" and "The Graduate," it takes the form of a comedy, a pretty funny one that dares to show kids swearing and being themselves.The Bears' arrival is bad news for the West Valley League of southern California, forcing them to accept kids deemed not up to their high standard. There's a shrimp named Tanner Boyle with plenty of fight but no coordination, a fat kid named Engelberg who smears chocolate on the ball when throwing it back to the pitcher, a pair of Mexicans no one understands, a bookworm who keeps track of foul balls but can't hit for beans, and Timmy Lupus, a painfully shy small fry who Boyle calls a "booger-eating spaz." Coaching the team is ex-minor league pitcher Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau), now reduced to cleaning pools and drinking himself into semi-consciousness.Making no bones about telling Buttermaker he's not wanted is the manager of the West Valley powerhouse Yankees, Roy Turner (Vic Morrow): "It's not us. It's the boys. The boys themselves want it that way, and that's the way they want to keep it." Buttermaker just wants his check, but he finds himself regaining a fighting spirit as others shove their arrogance down his throat and those of the boys he is charged to look after.When the team tries to quit after getting pasted by the Yankees in their first game, 26-0, Buttermaker delivers a line that resonates, like so much in this movie, down through the years: "This quitting thing, it's a hard habit to break once you start." Matthau is terrific, creating a wisecracking but poignant center. Director Michael Ritchie and screenwriter Bill Lancaster knew what they were after and deliver it, a pitch-perfect social satire dressed as a sports film with a cast of mostly unknown kids who lack for professional finesse but seem to lay their souls bare to the camera.It's not perfect. "The Bad News Bears" struggles at times to keep things funny as Buttermaker's self-loathing and the falsity of the other adults threatens to overwhelm the thin comic casing. Buttermaker's solution to overcoming the Bears' respect problems also feels a bit of a dodge: He brings in a couple of ringers, Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neal) and Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley), both of whom add to the film, but water it down some, too, diluting the connection between Buttermaker and the original Bears.But there's a lot of depth to the film, depth of a dark but compelling kind. Buttermaker and Amanda try and fail to patch up their long-ago relationship as substitute father and daughter. Roy Turner, a fundamentally decent man who just lost sight of what's important, deals with the realization he has probably lost his son to his all-or-nothing winner's mentality. Timmy Lupus tries to melt into every background God gives him until called upon to do something special like mixing a martini for Buttermaker. Baseball may be treated as a joke in this film, but there is something vital to it, too, a rite of passage very different to the kids themselves than to the adults, who like Turner look at the scoreboard and miss the bigger picture."You didn't come into this world to sit in a dugout all your life," is the way Buttermaker puts it to Timmy Lupus. I identified with Lupus, which is probably why I winced through the movie watching it in a theater in 1976 and embrace it now. It's a real slice-of-life film with all the discomfort that implies. You may go in thinking you are going to see a nostalgic, foul-mouthed spectacle of spunk and charm, and you are, but you may well leave like I did wondering if there's a little of you still lying on that baseball field, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is required viewing for all parents trying to relive their high school glory days through their kids. Only one adult looks good in this movie and it ain't Walter M. This movie is a classic example of how adults should not behave during their kids' sporting events.This movie is probably rated higher than I normally would because it was one of my favorites growing up. I actually thought that music from "carmen" was original "the BNB's" song. Now watching it again after twenty-some years I see my tastes in movies has changed but it was still surprisingly good. It definitely made up my mind - I have absolutely no desire to see Billy Bob's version. The plot - stereotypical come-from-behind-feel-good-for-your-effort sports movie that I will admit this is one of the pioneers for that genre. The acting lukewarm - the dialog - forced, but it is still worth it to demonstrate what jerks we can all be trying to be supportive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A former minor-league pitcher (The late Oscar-Winner:Walter Matthau), who is now a pool cleaner and he's also a grumbling beer-guzzling man. He's been hired to coach a team of kids, which they are a band of half-pint misfits. Which these kids hardly played baseball in their young lives. The coach decides to add two new players in the team, am smart talented young pitcher (Oscar-Winner:Tatum O'Neal) and an trouble-maker (Jackie Earle Haley), who can play catch and hit the ball. Which could bring them to the championship game with the help of two new players, who could actually play the game.Directed by Michael Ritchie (Cops and Robbersons, The Coach Trip, The Golden Child) made an believable, original, cleverly funny baseball film. Matthau is good in the lead, O'Neal is amusing as Matthau's former father figure and now coach. The Kids are also fun in this movie. Some of the major appeal of the classic 70's film was hearing the kids cursing. The movie manages also to have some strong dramatic moments (especially the late Vic Morrow as Matthau's rival in a standout scene towards the conclusion). The language may be lost on television but it's always worth seeing in it's original version.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer, which it is also grainy at times but always sharp in the picture quality. DVD also has an fine digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in the original Mono soundtrack). Sadly, this DVD doesn't have any features including the original theatrical trailer. This movie was a major surprise back in 1976 and it was also one of the top grossing films of that year. This film is followed by two sequels, t.v. series and a 2005 remake (Which is fairly faithful to the original). Written by the late:Bill Lancaster (John Carpenter's The Thing).

		<fullReview>Someone else mentioned that they were surprised this movie isn't rated higher. I feel the same way. This movie is very good. I too played Little League for many many years (like some other posters here) and I have to disagree with the posters that say this movie is a completely inaccurate depiction of Little League. I saw a fight or two in Little League and some drunk parents were ejected from games a few times. I have seen kids smoke pot in the dugout and smoke cigarettes at practice. Anyway, this film was magical when I saw it as an 8 year old in 1976. Back then, many of my friends and I wished we could be Tanner or Kelly; we wished we had the courage and independence to tell an adult to go to hell and say or do whatever we wanted. I love the final scene when the Bears lose and tell the Yankees to shove the 2nd place trophy you know where! This may be considered bad sportsmanship by some, but considering what the Yankees represent, the Bears do the right thing. I'm going to buy the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebels/Misfits Are Always The Heroes In Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a hit back in the mid '70s because of several things. Walter Matthau was funny in the lead role as a Little League manager. The kids were varied and interesting. Feminists liked the movie because the best pitcher on the team was a girl. Tatum O'Neal, at 12, became an instant star because of her role as "Amanda," the great pitcher. She wound up living a tumultuous life as a child star and later as adult marrying another spoiled-brat rebel, tennis star John McEnroe.The public seems to always love shows in which ragtag misfits somehow come together to beat the powerful "establishment" teams or groups or companies or governments. Liberal Hollywood has always loved that rebels-make-good theme, and always will, from "Rebel Without A Cause" to "Easy Rider" to "Revenge Of the Nerds" to "Dirty Harry," on and on. The worse you act, and the more you rebel against authority, the better they will portray you. In this movie, the manager, "Coach Buttermaker," is a drunk, is profane and a misfit himself but, of course, he gets it all together, too, and winds up a hero along with these bratty kids. And just to make sure you get the point, the biggest rebel of them all - "Kelly Leak" (Jackie Earle-Haley), is some 12-year-old who thinks he's Marlon Brando on a motorcycle. He's the best hitter on the team and an indispensable member of the squad, if they are to win. He's so cool with that bike and a cigarette in his mouth....wow!All of these movie clichs work, though, and the film was fun to watch and a big hit 30 years ago, spawning numerous lame sequels. It's another one of those '70s irreverent films that were new and "cool" back in their day, but a bit dated now</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely Maybe the Best Fictional Sports Film of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Rocky" was about an athlete overcoming obstacles to pursue a dream, "The Natural" centered on an older man's comeback in professional sports, and "Jerry McGuire" told a story of transcendence between a sports agent and his fiery unpredictable client, "The Bad News Bears" focused much more on organic down-to-earth issues. Aside from films derived from real-life true stories, such as "42", "Hoosiers", and "Rudy", "The Bad News Bears" may be the most poignant fictional sports film ever produced. "The Bears" deals with prejudice, inequality, injustice, racism, and obsession, on one hand, while simultaneously searching and finding acceptance, bridge-building, and determination. Yet, the characters and setting are so real, the dialog so true-to-life, you don't realize you're being offered these larger ideas. They just emerge from the plight of the characters. Who knows whether or not the filmmakers were setting out to make a social statement, but they did which is the mark of a truly great story.The essential plot is pretty basic. A group of junior high school age baseball players are thrown together to play on a team called "The Bears". They only have one thing in common: they are, for the most part, terrible. They can't pitch, they can't bat, and they can't field. Walter Matthau, in one of his best performances since "The Odd Couple", plays Morris Buttermaker, a swimming pool cleaner who is asked by a City Councilman to coach this team of athletically challenged misfits. The Councilman had filed a lawsuit against the city because the Little League was excluding players with less ability, and the Bears team was the city's "restitution", allowing less-skilled kids a chance to play the game.What makes the film as good as it is has to do with the characters of the players as much as Matthau as Buttermaker. These kids were literally ripped right out of reality, and seem so similar to the kids I played with when I was of junior high age that it's almost scary. I can't name them all, but I offer a few of the ones which stick in my mind. In no particular oder: Toby, son of the councilman, who's probably the most vocal of the kids, Ogilvie, the most intellectual of the boys but not the best player, Amanda, their best pitcher and the only female in the league, Kelly, the trouble-maker who smokes and rides a Harley but is an amazing outfielder and hitter, Tanner, my favorite character, the shortest but craziest of the team who would give Napoleon Bonaparte a run for his money when he takes on the entire 7th grade. He defends Lupus against some bullies at one point in the film. Lupus is perhaps the worst player on the team and shows little knowledge of social decorum. At first Tanner and the others are put-off by Lupus, but at one point the team appreciates him.At first, there seems little hope for this group of unskilled oddballs when they're slaughtered during their first game. However, as the film progresses we learn more about the characters and how they start to pull for one another. Several of the Bears are either dismissed or harassed at various moments in the story, and the teammates begin to learn to stick up for one another, both on and off the field. As a result they slowly begin to play better. Even Buttermaker changes during the story. At first he's not the best coach, but he starts to see things in his players the other teams around the league don't see. We also witness the obsession and over-zealousness of the parents, whose attitude becomes more about the kids winning than simply experiencing the game. In the climactic final game, Buttermaker makes a realization which is as profound as any in sports films of this type.This is just an incredible story which says much more about modern culture, particularly about young people, then it may have set out to do. The dialog seems like it was derived right out of a junior high school baseball diamond. While most child characters speak dialog which is unrelated to their age and experience, the script of the Bad News Bears must have come from the mouths of babes, literally. I imagine the screenwriters must have spent time at actual Little League games and written down the dialog. The ending is one of the best in all of sports films, and it is not only completely believable but it fits with the rhetoric of the entire film. An absolute breath of fresh air, especially if you're tired of those fictional sports films where you can guess the outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the Bad News Bears as a teenager close to when it first came out, and thinking that yeah, this was a fun movie that kind of reminded me of real life. The movie was famous at the time, and I never remembered it being anything more than a fun entertainment. When I watched it again a few days ago (perhaps the first time in 30 years), I was really startled. This movie was not just funny but impressive, capturing something of the truth about the way adults and kids really interact with each other in our society. The kids are gritty--they swear, they fight, they are insolent and belligerent, they are cruel (sound familiar?). The adults are hyper-competitive, drunken, prone to selfish projection, lazy and insensitive (sound familiar again?). The movie becomes much more than a feel-good underdog story (although it would inspire many such imitations) but rather becomes a desperate struggle for dignity among all the participants in a situation that is full of snares. This is a really good movie, not particularly for kids to view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buttermaker (Walter Matthau) is a drunken ex-minor leaguer. He gets hired to coach a little league team of misfits. One of the fathers had sued to get the kids into a competitive league. However after a humiliating opening loss, the father figures the team should quit and so do the kids. Buttermaker try to save the team by getting a couple of ringers, his former girlfriend's kid (Tatum O'Neal) who happens to be a little girl and a juvenile delinquent (Jackie Earle Haley).This isn't simply a good kids movie. Quite frankly, parents today wouldn't want their kids to see this. The language is rough. A parent hits his kid. The kids swear, smoke, talk sex, and drink beer. I don't know how they got PG.The kids are great. Walter Matthau is his grumpy best. Tatum O'Neal is wonderful. It works as a good underdog movie. And then the last act explodes into something wonderful. It's heartbreaking when Buttermaker rejects Amanda for simply wanting a father figure. Then it goes all out as both coaches go super competitive. It's a real indictment of the ugliness of kids' sports culminating in that slap. It's not just a simple underdog movie, but a movie about real sportsmanship. It is a great original that the 2005 remake cannot touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bad News Bears still stands as an impressive film. In a world where some little league teams apparently don't even keep score anymore, this film provides some valuable nostalgia. It isn't hard to forgive the ancient "sports movie" clichs about a bad team somehow learning to win against their more privileged competition when you take the entire film into account. The laughs generally keep coming as Walter Matthau stars as an alcoholic ex-ballplayer hired to coach a pack of misfit kids. Apparently these kids have won some type of lawsuit to be able to participate in an exclusive tween baseball league. Not a lot is said of this legal aspect, and once the games start, its basically forgotten. Matthau's Bears are made up of mostly "Jews, Sp*cs, and N-words", as the foul-mouthed kid named Tanner points out. Its frankly kind of jaw-dropping to hear little kids use that kind of language, but by the end you're used to it. This is one of those PG movies from back in the day that are more harsh than some of today's PG-13 movies.The story progresses as you might expect it to. The team stinks, they get made fun of, it looks like they're going to have to quit, etc... Then Matthau pulls an ace out of his sleeve. Tatum O'Neal plays the daughter of a woman he used to date. She has a hell of a pitching arm and after he bribes her into playing, the Bears are suddenly contenders. A local juvenile delinquent also helps out, if only to annoy off the arrogant coach of the rival Yankees. Naturally the league championship comes down to the Bears against the Yankees, and the outcome was at least not so much clichd.The Bad News Bears succeeds because it can do so many things at once. Not only is it funny, but it has some arresting moments involving over-aggressive parents and stunning bad behavior from some of the kids. There are also some touching moments. One has O'Neal try to suggest Matthau and her mother reconcile, or at least maybe they could do something together after the season like a father and daughter. Matthau angrily rebukes this olive branch and admits he's just using the girl for her fastball. She walks away heartbroken, and as a viewer you're kind of stunned. You sort of presumed there will be a happy ending with the little girl melting the old drunk's heart, but it doesn't happen. The cast is good enough. Matthau is perfect as Buttermaker. Vic Morrow is memorable as the slimy coach of the Yankees. His career of course would be cut short in a horrific accident on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie. Tatum O'Neal had definite charisma, and you really wish she could have had better guidance growing up. She ended up too much like her dad, unfortunately. Most of the kids are pretty funny. The Tanner kid steals plenty of scenes. You have to listen close in many cases to hear some of the hilarious things these kids say in various situations. In one scene for example, a kid is hit in the groin by the ball. He collapses in agony and you hear one of the adults call for a stretcher. Listen close, and one of the kids says, "a stretcher? For his balls?". Lots of funny moments like that! The film also makes great use of classical music throughout. Definitely take another look at this film. But not the sequels, and the remake was likely also a dud. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An all-time favorite past-time: Baseball! I've always loved the sport. With this movie, I love it even more. "The Bad News Bears" is a classic movie about the love of the sport. This team of misfits lead by the drunkard coach(Walter Matthau, 1920-2000) who whips the team into shape by having a female pitcher(Tatum O'Neal) to help them be winners. They have a young kid with a short fuse, and a foul-mouth. One named Abdul(Erin Blunt) who's not ashamed to say anything, but in one game, his "jewels" take some real punishment. In the final game against the Yankees, the foul-mouth team member said his stuff to them. Now that's team spirit! The comedy, the drama, and plot is all there. The cast are great. This movie to me is a home-run, you can steal bases, steal hearts, or even slide into home. You need to require more than just popcorn. You'll need all the munchies you can have. And a phone if you bust your gut! 5 stars! A homer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still priceless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 9 went it was released and I still have more emotional attachment to it than any other movie of childhood, even over Rocky or Star Wars. We had a "second run" theater nearby where you could see films for a dollar or 50 cents before 2 o'clock, so I know I saw it at least a dozen times (it played at the theater for about 3 months). My Father coached little league for years for my older Brother and myself. Both are now deceased and I finally took a view at the DVD this week after not having seen it in more than 2 decades. To call it memory evoking is an understatement.Dad was neither a Buttermaker or a Turner as a coach. He would come right from work to the field and would be knocking out balls for fielding practice with his dress pants, Florshiem shoes, and always puffing that pipe filled with Middelton's cherry-blend tobacco. We won our share of games and he always made it a priority that everyone played, and that the game was first and foremost, fun. We had our share of "Turner's" in our leagues, and dad disliked those types to no end. I don't know how many times later in life when meeting someone and they heard my last name, they would ask "Did your dad coach little league? I had him one year as a kid, he was such a cool guy to play for." Dad thought that BEARS was a bit over the top with the drinking and language, but always admitted that gave him more laughs than any movie he had seen.I never saw any of BEARS sequel's, the TV show, or the 2005 remake. There was just no point. Without Matthau, O'Neal, or Morrow, I'm sure they are as substandard as can be.BEARS really pushed the envelope for it's time, forever shattering the Disneyesque mode of kid-films. What was inappropriate for 1976 is now intolerable, and deservedly so. But it is those attributes that makes the film so unique.I think the character that stands out the most for me is Roy Turner, having been the son of a "coach-dad". I always left the theater loving dad even more for not being like him. Turner gave us a look at what I call "Lombardi-isim". Vic Morrow was such a great actor. It was hard seeing him playing a villain character when I always thought of him as the heroic Sgt. Saunders of COMBAT. When the championship game is over and the Yankees win, I picture that huge trophy sitting in an apartment years later, collecting dust and being just about as worthless as the wood and plastic it's made of. Still in the possession of a bitter old lonely man wondering what happened with his family.Some time back, I spent a lazy Sunday just driving around and came across a league game of 13-14 year olds. I felt compelled to stop and watch a few innings. Oh how things have changed. The "game chatter" has been replaced with vulgar trash-talking. I saw a verbal exchange between a pitcher and hitter that led to a head hunting pitch. Nothing was done about it, and on the next pitch the batter took one to the helmet. The batter ended up being OK (I guess helmet technology has come a long way thank goodness), and the pitcher was ejected. I left the game feeling pretty disgusted, and for a brief moment I asked myself where was Roy Turner when you need him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bad News Bears is one of the biggest "Don't judge a book by it's cover" movies you'll ever see, yeah it's one of those "Team of Missfits Coming Together" kind of movies that you see all the time, but this one is different, it's the original, no predictable victories or Disney clichs'. The movie is about an alcoholic low key unfriendly pool cleaner named Morris Buttermaker who is payed to coach a team of little leaguers after one of the kid's Dad sued the league for the right to play, the team is of course a team of underdogs, the kind of kids who you wouldn't want playing on your team in gym class; with Toby: The Nice guy who's gonna finish last Lupous, the shy one Tanner, the short- tempered, overbearing, runt Ahmad, the token black kid Engleberg, the fat kid Rudi Stein, the uncoordinated awkward guy Ogilvy, the smart one Jimmy, the curly top Jose and Miguel, the foreigners and Regi, the redhead with an overbearing sports Dad One thing I liked the best is that they give each kid a reasonable amount of screen time, some (Amanda, Kelly, Tanner,)more than others, but each a good amount, so you can know each member all pretty well, unlike most sports movies, where you only get to know a couple players, while the rest are pretty much extra's.together, they do not make a good team, but after Buttermaker's ex- girlfriend's daughter, Amanda joins the team to prove to Buttermaker she can still pitch and the local bully "lone shark" (as Ahmad said), Kelly Leak joins the team to tick off the A$$hat Yankee's coach, Roy Turner, the Bear's eventually get their act together and become a great team, going to the championship (and losing), still think it's sounds boring? Trust me, it's not, it has just the right amount of physical and subtle humor with the right added drama and is -somewhat- realisticto make a classic movie, heck, I had to almost literally drag my Mom to see this movie, and she liked it, so once again, just cause it's one of those movie's that has the most reused plots ever, doesn't mean it'll suck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Sports Movie Ever !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always tell people that this is my favorite "sports movie" of all time. Inevitably someone will say something like "but what about a serious sport's movie?" That ticks me off, because this is a serious film. The story centers around a bunch of leftovers from the Little League draft. One of the "rejects" not drafted by a Little League team, has a father who is also a City Councilman, can you say lawsuit? So the League is forced to take all of the kids that nobody wanted and put them on a new team, the Bears. A drunken pool cleaner who used to kick around in the minors is chosen to lead them. Well, the coach and kids soon learn that sports is not that fun when you are the laughingstock of a very competitive league. So, the manager has to start making moves off the field to change the way things are. The movie deals with all kinds of sensitive topics, like elitism, racism, alienation, despair, etc. Yes, I know it is a comedy, but seeing a Coach strike his kid on the mound, seeing players from the rival Yankees degrade the misfit Bears' players, seeing Buttermaker push away one of his players because she wants him to be a father figure, there is real drama at work here. Of course, the revenge angle is at play here as well. Moreover, the actual revenge is quite different than most suspected it would be. Of course, I love the wonderful comedic lines and comedic performances turned in by all. And for my money, there will never be a better closing line in a movie than the one given by Tanner to the Yankees. Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal made movie history with this one, a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Required viewing for parents with kids in little league</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad News Bears should be required viewing for parents with kids currently in little league.This is a movie mainly about cheering for the underdog, which we all like to do. But this film gets more than it bargains for. It is by far the most true to life movies about baseball on the little league level. The emotions of the kids and parents on and off the field, the vulgarities, and especially the way the parents take the fun out of playing baseball by putting enormous pressure on their kids, are all wonderfully portrayed here. Not to brag, but I was a little leaguer myself for several years, and I feel like an authority on the subject. I'm here to tell you that this movie nails it. My favorite aspect of the film, is how it deals with teamwork. You might not have the most skilled players, but if a team sticks together, they can work wonders.And let's not forget the great performances by Walter Matthau, Tatum O'Neal and Vic Morrow. My favorite character in this movie though, was Tanner Boyle, the shortstop. He could practically be every kid I ever played on a little league team with. The next film where they play in the Astrodome was almost as good as the original, but don't waste your time with the one where they go to Japan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...Bears" is about playing a sport, not worshiping it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the best-loved movies centered on sports are about the sport as an icon. They are tributes to the sport; love stories about something we idealize. "The Bad News Bears" is one of a handful of movies that evoke what it was like to play a sport. It may be the best of such movies, although I would place it in a tie with the brilliant "Personal Best."For any one who played an organized sport when they were young, "...Bears" should ring true. We didn't just know these kids, we were these kids. Trying to balance a developing sense of pride with the gratification that comes from being an appreciated part of a group. Trying to learn how to enjoy the journey as much as the destination. And trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with the adults who were supposed to be guiding us.For most of us, we figured it out. We may not have realized it, but we did. For some, "The Bad News Bears" may have been an important part of that. Anyone who hasn't had a moment like Tanner's when he realizes that he may not like Timmy, but Timmy is "TEAM!" probably never played a team sport. And I especially liked the way the film took advantage of the (at the time, new) inclusion of girls on Little League teams. I had aged out of Little League by then but "The Bad News Bears" reminded me that I had often wondered when I was playing LL if there weren't girls who could stay on the field with us boys. (As an aside does anybody remember the "Silver Bullets?" I firmly believe there are women capable of playing MLB caliber baseball, especially at 2B or SS.)As "film," "The Bad News Bears" is a great piece of work. Watched today, almost 40 years after its release, it seems classic, undated. The script has moments of brilliance (the aforementioned scene where Tanner discovers he's a team player and Tatum O'Neal's line about "up there" are favorites), the cinematography preserves the reality of suburban Little League settings, the direction is crisp but unobtrusive and the story is so well-crafted that it stings like an 11 year-old's fastball to the ribs. And the acting, especially among the players seems less like performance than candid documentary. These kids look, talk and act like pre-adolescents. They are old enough to be hearing "act your age" from the adults around them but present without affectation the confusion that is inherent from hearing themselves answer "But...I'm 11!" This more than anything else is what makes "...Bears" such a realistic film about playing a sport. These youngsters are being taught to compete, taught to win, but what they are doing is trying to have fun. It is confusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Baseball Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aging, down-on-his-luck ex-minor leaguer Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau) coaches a team of misfits in an ultra-competitive California little league.Tatum O'Neal as a "reformed tomboy" is a bit odd. Not that she is bad, but her line delivery seems a bit flat. Is this intentional? And it is interesting to see Jackie Earle Haley as a kid (he is in all three "Bears" movies) now that he has reinvented himself as an adult, with such roles as Freddy Krueger or Rorschach in "Watchmen".Roger Ebert called the film "an unblinking, scathing look at competition in American society", and that can be one commentary the film is trying to make. But more importantly, this is the precursor to every kid's baseball film out there, including "The Sandlot". Who cares if it has a political message? It is just a fun film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, but with a serious edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bad News Bears", a modestly budgeted comedy, turned out to be the fourth highest grossing movie of 1976. Watching it today, it doesn't take long to discover why audiences of the time found it appealing. After decades of movies showing kids to be pretty sweet and innocent, the viewpoint of kids in this movie is more realistic, not just with their use of dirty language. The movie also shows the adults who push kids such as these into sports to have a pretty dark edge to them - it's obvious they are living off their kids' winning or losing. Despite the movie's prominent serious edge, the movie for the most part still manages to be an amusing experience, and manages to get the audience to sympathize with the Bears and root for them to win in the end. Better than that is the movie's biggest message: that sports, at least when it comes to kids, should be more of a FUN experience than a competition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad News Bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Because the commodity society can only function on the basis of disembodiment, its members are consumed by a hunger for images of the body, including one's own body image." - Peter Sloterdijk "The Longest Yard" (1974) with kids, Michael Ritchie's "Bad News Bears" (1976) revolves around a group of young, seemingly incompetent baseball players and the foul mouthed coach (Walter Matthau) who leads them.The majority of Ritchie's early films focused on the competitiveness and ruthlessness of a then contemporary United States. Consider "Smile", a satire which focused on interstate beauty pageants and which contained the line "Boys get money for making touchdowns, why shouldn't girls get money for being cute?" That question's answer is, in a way, present in "Bad News Bears", which focuses on the way in which sports, and human relations in general, suffer when commodified.Significantly, all the baseball players on Matthau's team are deemed rejects or incompetents. They're discarded, branded useless by a goal and profit oriented culture. Matthau attempts to build his team into a suitable product, but meets resistance. The kids literally can't play. What Ritchie then goes on to suggest is that this is okay. His multiracial cocktail of kids, like a band of turn-of-the-century immigrants fresh off the boat, reject a world based on gain and push. They make their own American dream, their own community, and then reject the game outright. For the kids, sports is, or should be, a vehicle for creativity, self-expression, affirmation and cultural growth, be its players black or white, male or female (the film's star pitcher is a young girl). This is a one-sided view sports ? sport and competition can be viewed as an art, a performance, drama, something aesthetic and refined ? but such a stance is necessary for Ritchie's allegory, and was common in sporting movies of the era (see "Slap Shot").Odd for a "children's film", Ritchie's kids are jaded, foul mouthed, world-weary and lost in a wasteland of Jack-in-the-Boxes, Pizza Huts and McDonalds. They're coarse, obscene, some are on the pill, others are already seeing shrinks and most find themselves surrendering their identities to forces far greater than they are. The adults, meanwhile, remain proudly oblivious to the problems of the kids. Competition triumphs. Let the twerps shape up or ship out.Ritchie's "Downhill Racer" featured a battle between an egotistical racer who refused to give up his personal values for the larger values of a team and community. "Bears" does something similar. But though it bashes the contradictions between the logic and values of capitalism and the values which the United States as a nation professes to represent (honesty, fair-play, truth, unity, freedom, equality etc), it also celebrates the possibility of personal accomplishment and achievement. The way the film pulls in opposite directions leads to its confused ending, the contradictions of US life far too complex for Ritchie's simple narrative.Released in 2005, Richard Linklater's "Bad News Bears" is a remake of Ritchie's film. Linklater makes a few changes, and casts Billy Bob Thornton as our foul mouthed coach, but for the most part his film is a shot-for-shot remake of Ritchie's. In both films the "coach" character initially sees his own daughter as but a utensil, his relationship with her a tool used toward a very specific end. Likewise, both films find their kids becoming a kind of "microcosm of the disenfranchised" (minorities, third worlders, girls, women, working class kids, alienated geeks etc), the children working together to reject American-bred success-at-all-costs competitiveness on behalf of their own little half-baked revolution. Like Ritchie, Linklater then sells anarchy and community under the ironic gaze of a patriotic American flag. Such middle fingers clash uneasily with the needs of a mainstream movie, though, as both versions of the "Bad News Bears" see the kids simultaneously losing AND winning, our heroes jointly losing their baseball match and celebrated for thumbing their nose at traditional sportsmanship and WASP manners. This kind of "have it both ways" ending was also typical in the 1970s.While Linklater is a gentle soul who clearly identifies with his material, his remake is nevertheless much too similar to its predecessor. Linklater's also stuck in a world of Little Leagues and suburban misfits, when today the situation he delineates is far more amplified. Today, it's not just a national pastime which has become a showcase for corporate ownership and corporate values. No, contemporary human beings are so colonised that everything - from our conceptions of time to even the simplest human actions - is now conceptualised in terms of the logic of capitalism. Our very language and thought processes reinforce a tendency to view and treat all objects, relationships, and conditions as presumptively subject to exchange. This mania is treated well by directors like Olivier Assayas. Linklater, meanwhile, remains stuck in the 1970s.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't not like it! THE BAD NEWS BEARS, with an acidic script by Bill Lancaster, is directed by the 70's premier satirist - Michael Ritchie. Like Ritchie's earlier SMILE, TBNBs pokes fun not so much at an American institution (in this case little league baseball), but at the frequent nitwits who run this type of thing. Walter Matthau, at the height of his acting power, is Buttermaker, a ne'er do well pool cleaner railroaded into coaching a team of troubled (and awful) little leaguers. He gets a lot more than he bargained for as he realizes the kids are actually quite a bit sharper than most of the adults. It's wicked and very funny. Alfred Lutter, Jackie Earle Haley, Chris Barnes, and best of all Gary Lee Cavagnaro (as Engelberg) fight to steal every scene they're in, including the ones they share! Vic Morrow as Matthau's tightly wound coaching nemesis is excellent and Tatum O'Neal is very good as Matthau's secret pitching weapon. O'Neal and Matthau have several great scenes together.

		<shortDescription>The First Honest Portrayal of Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made this movie so groundbreaking when I first saw it in the summer of 1976 was that kids were portrayed as they really were instead of as the innocent, sometimes mischievous cherubs that most movies presented. These kids were real. Real brats, but real nevertheless. They cursed, they acted like little jerks and psychos, that's the way many boy athletes are. Now, this doesn't pack too much of a punch because every movie in the world does this now. But it's still fun to watch. It's a hoot watching the high-spirited Tanner in action. You have to admire that kid for having guts. That little side story between Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal could have been left out without hurting the story. He simply could have found her somewhere, or maybe he was her daughter, but without all the issues. That business just seemed to get in the way of the story. Also, I half expected her to walk away from him when he threw his beer at her during a game or practice. It would have served him right if she did. Favoite line: PITCHER: Well, well, if it isn't Englepuke again.ENGLEBERT: How would you like me to stick this bat where the sun never shines? I still fall apart every time I hear that line. The kids' exploits, though I am certainly not an advocate of them has lost its punch over the years. Still fun to watch, though. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this on one of the HBO channels. I wanted to get one last shot at seeing an "original" before my memory is ruined by another Hollywood "General public is too young and/or stupid to remember" remake starring Billy Bob Thorton.No remake can touch this. Vic Morrow isn't far from the role that made him famous. I almost expected him to say "Joey, take the point!"Anyway, it would be interesting to find out what happened with the "kids" from the original cast. They could have done with this remake what they did with the Cape Fear remake; use some in the original cast in a different role for the remake.The reason there is animosity between the teams, though, is a story all too familiar to us in the present day. A class-action lawsuit that put a feather in the councilman's (read: lawyer) hat with no regard or thought to the realities of the consequences, and who has to bear the brunt (the kids). And soon as the reality hits that a bunch of misfits thrown together actually play like a bunch of misfits thrown together, the instigator of the scheme wants to disband the team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memories of Little League Baseball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have stayed with me like "The Bad News Bears". I first saw it when it was released in 1976 and, at the time, I played little league (well, the Canadian equivalent). It was easy to cheer for this gang of misfits back then. The surprising this is, I always find myself tuning in to catch it whenever it appears on TV. It remains a surprisingly accurate portrait of young ball players, snobby league officials and overbearing parents. Walter Matthau is Buttermaker, the coach assigned to lead this motley crew of talentless kids. Their fortunes change somewhat when Matthau convinces the daughter of an old girlfriend (Tatum O'Neal, just coming off a shocking Oscar win for "Paper Moon") to pitch for the team. Buttermaker taught her to throw a mean curveball prior to divorcing her mother. The Bears go from losers to winners when the local juvenile delinquent, Kelly Leak, joins the team. He's a virtual one-man team, swatting home-runs and catching everything in sight. The Bears end up going all the way to the championship game against the hated Yankees. The cast is excellent. Matthau is completely believable as a washed-up ex pro ball player who drinks too much. O'Neal is convincing as the star hurler, and Jackie Earl Haley ("Breaking Away") makes a strong impression as Leak. Ironically, this is one of the few movies where Haley is one of the bigger kids. In later roles, he would always be the short guy in the group. Vic Morrow is perfectly smug as the Yankees coach who can't stand to see the Bears succeed. It sets up a classic battle in the championship game. The Bad News Bears was the forerunner, of sorts, of The Mighty Ducks. The main difference is that The Bad News Bears gets the baseball details right, whereas few American films have portrayed hockey in a realistic way. I still cringe at the thought of "Youngblood". It also set the stage for two vastly inferior sequels (without Matthau or O'Neal). No, The Bad News Bears is a cut above most sports films because it helps you understand what it's like to compete at that age. It also makes great use of music from Bizet's Carmen. After seeing this film, you'll immediately think of the Bears when you hear the "March of the Torreodors".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies to be treasured. It's by far my favorite baseball movie, and gets big points for not dumbing down the kids in the movie. They talk, act, and swear just like real kids. They are foul mouthed, unlikeable in many cases, but every kid presented in this film is 10x more realistic than in any kid's movie you will see nowadays. Plain and simple, this film would not be made today. It is TOO realistic. Little league is just like this. Little league PARENTS are just like this. I think the film does an excellent job showing how the parents sometimes take the fun out of the game for the kids. Walter Matthau, Tatum O'Neal, Jackie Earle Haley, and especially the late Vic Morrow (coach of the Yankees) all turn in excellent performances. Not only that, but the film reaches some incredibly dramatic moments that catch you off guard. You're not supposed to like all the characters, but taken as an overall whole, The Bad News Bears is a movie in which the filmmakers really did their research. I think it gets underrated because it is a "kids movie", but It is without a doubt one of the best movies in my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad to read all the other comments here that understood there is a lot going on in "The Bad News Bears". It is a very intelligent, thoughtful and usually hysterical take on this country, little league, and air hockey! Everyone is perfectly cast, and I enjoyed Brandon Cruz's couple of scenes the most. His big moment with his father (Vic Morrow) had a minimum of dialogue, but it spoke volumes about their relationship.I cannot say enough great things about this movie - even the soundtrack is memorable. I saw it on its first release and then again yesterday, and it is ageless and thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dream never realized is the one we cherish the most. It's as if hope itself was out there calling to us, urging us to keep trying. And if this is not enough to make you want to achieve the impossible, then you must recoil back to square one. But this kind of retreat is not in the character of Buttermaker, a lonesome beer-drinking baseball relic who cleans swimming pools in Southern California, and who just happens to accept money to coach a group of kids who think they want to play baseball. This film is written with the idea that baseball somehow resembles life. Not only do the kids mature as the season pushes on, but so does the coach, who in the end realizes that winning comes in different colors. "Just get out there and do the best you can," he says after he has screamed at the boys for not having a killer will to win. Beautifully, in the end, they do not get the gold ring, yet, when you see their eyes sparkle because they tried, you will feel the glow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take "The Mighty Ducks" back in time, age their coach a few decades while making him an alcoholic ex-minor leaguer who now cleans pools for a living when he's not busy as a fish-out-of-water "mentor" for a group of fish-out-of-water kids, and you have the all-time classic that is the Bad News Bears.Thanks to a lawsuit that resulted in a court-ordered creation of the Bears, a team of rejects in California's strongest little league, that the rest of the league wishes would go away, except when they are beating up on them on the scoreboard (or off the field). The situation looks hopeless for the team, until Morris Buttermaker (Matthau) recruits his ex-girlfriend's daughter, Amanda Whurlizer (Tatum O'Neal), and Roy Turner, the manager of the hated (of course) Yankees (played by an over-the-top Vic Morrow), manages to anger juvenile delinquent Kelly Leak into joining the Bears by kicking him off his position in the stands as Amanda's main groupie.What stood out then (I was nine) was that the kids in this movie were a lot like the kids I knew at the time, not some "adultified" children who reason and speak like 35 year-olds only to turn into children only for the comedic moments. No one was a hero, and even Kelly wasn't really a villain, and this movie has a definite "Seabiscuit" quality in that it shows that great moments are spawned from ordinary people in ordinary situations.The rag-tag team was not really an underdog when you consider it had a star pitcher (Amanda) and a star hitter (Kelly), but that can be excused because they wound up on the team more as a matter of self-defense once war was declared on the Bears. They were nothing more than equalizers who rebalanced the league rather than making a mockery of it. For all his "delinquency," Kelly was the consummate team player, and for all her griping, Amanda gave her all on the mound.The supporting cast, while strong, was like that of a championship team in that they could have been gutted without anyone noticing. The actors that make this movie work are Matthau and O'Neal, who almost could have done the same script as a two-character dialogue to the same rave reviews. Amanda is obviously troubled by her mother's problems with men (she turns to "Boilermaker" as she calls him, as a father figure), and Kelly is not so much troubled as looking out for himself. He has respect for those who respect him and respect themselves, as his dealings with Amanda and the team show.To think that this was as good as it ever got for Tatum O'Neal is a shame. It's obvious she's a natural, and she should have won a second Oscar for this performance, but she practically vanished from critical acclaim after this movie, a timeless classic that looks even better now than it did through my nine year-old eyes when I first watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A home run, with some fun curve balls thrown in to keep things popping; Matthau and Tatum make great adversaries.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Matthau, one of Hollywood's greatest curmudgeons, is in fine form as the star of "The Bad News Bears," playing the grousing, beer-swilling coach of a misfit little-league team that has sewn up last place since their formation. A former ballplayer reduced to cleaning swimming pools, needless to say he has invested little of himself to make the scrappy team any better...until he recruits a foul-mouthed star pitcher in the form of a young girl (Tatum O'Neal).With that perfectly craggy, blood-hound mug of his, the droopy shoulders and sluggish ?couch potato' demeanor, Matthau is just great ? flipping out sardonic remarks as casually as he flips open a beer tab, and looking like he hardly has the energy even for that. Mixing it up with the tykes here, he evolves into a perfectly reincarnated W.C. Fields.Tatum O'Neal showed that her performance in "Paper Moon" wasn't just a fluke. Displaying the same wise-ass mien that won her an Oscar three years earlier (with more generous outpourings of profanity), she more than holds her own against the veteran Matthau, even teaching his character a lesson or two about team spirit and sportsmanship, while evoking sympathy on her own as she is forced to confront more personal, off-the-field problems.The runt-sized, ethnically disparate team is a fun, motley little crew that could have come right out of a McDonald's commercial. Chief rebel but much more coordinated is one small, hell-raising fireball, Jackie Earl Haley, who shows more grit than his sneakers after the bottom of the ninth. Though his open defiance and teen-cool stance masquerades a need to be liked and wanted, he still provides a mean spark before coming into his own.Vic Morrow shows off his formidable macho as the typically underhanded opposing coach, while Brandon ("The Courtship of Eddie's Father") Cruz, who plays Morrow's star pitcher son, has a nifty, poignant scene as a kid who finally stands up to his father's belittling bully act.Set smack dab in small-town, flag-waving America, director Michael Ritchie, who scored critical points the year before in the little-seen but dead-on satire "Smile," hits a box-office home run this time, always keeping things popping and managing to toss in a few interesting curve balls in the plot to keep it from falling into a typical "root for the underdog" comedy. More importantly, Ritchie never sacrifices the humanity of the characters for sure-fire comedyThis highly, immensely popular film spawned a couple of sequels and a brief TV series. But beware, they are foul balls compared to this winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bad News Bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad News Bears stars Walter Matthau and a young Tatum O'Neal in a film about an aging former baseball player and the team of misfits he is financially coerced into coach little league baseball. Michael Ritchie directs a sports movie that takes a different approach than the all too common paint by numbers avenue sports movies usually travel. Bad News Bears, a 1976 feature, is a fun deviation from the usual sports movie, not even requiring the audience to be sports fans in order to enjoy the film. Considering the cast is largely made up of a collection of minors, Bad News Bears shines as a fun movie able to be enjoyed by all. Former baseball player and current pool cleaner, Walter Matthau (Morris Buttermaker) who spends his time greeting the bottom of every beer can and cigarette butt he can, is roped into coaching a little league team made up of the misfits no other team would take. Roy Turner (Vic Morrow) even agrees to pay Buttermaker for his troubles of coaching the team, a responsibility he takes flippantly when he sees how poorly the team performs. Drinking beer and smoking in the dugout while he lets the kids run the show, Buttermaker is clearly only in the coaching gig for the money. As the story develops, and he secretly begins to care for the children on his team, he begins to take a more active coaching role, still with the beer in hand and wants to make sure the team does well. Buttermaker has a secret weapon up his sleeve when he recruits his ex- girlfriend's daughter, Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neal) a feisty sporty 12-year old. The team also gets a huge bump when the local punk, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley) turns out to have an incredible natural talent for baseball. With more weapons in the dugout, and a confidence in themselves and each other growing with every game, the Bears begin to win games and have fun doing it. Somehow the misfit team makes it all the way to the championship game, proving that all you need is direction and a chance to prove yourself. The Bad News Bears is a brilliant ensemble piece. Typically in such a film, actors will deal with each other for screen time presence. In this film, made up mostly of children, that problem doesn't present itself, and it is to the audience's benefit. The character development in this film is unlike any I've seen in awhile. Not just the character of Morris Buttermaker is expanded, but each of the children's characters as well, to one extent or another, another aspect that is often lacking in ensemble films. I enjoyed learning through this film that Walter Matthau is much more than a grumpy man, as sadly, those are the only film roles I've seen of his. His acting is subtle, yet commanding, a trait that is missing from many modern day actors and was fun to see again. Of the many good features of this film, the best was that it was an unpredictable sports film. After watching a month's worth of sports films and learning that one is almost always the same as the next, The Bad News Bears was a fun departure from such boring predictable sports movies. What's also unique about this film is that it is packed with a message, yet avoids coming off preachy and overly moralistic. A fun movie all around, The Bad News Bears is a sports movie fit for athletic audiences and couch potatoes alike.The best takeaway from this film, for me, is seeing Walter Matthau in a role I have never seen him in before. He always came off a little muted and one-dimensional before; I am happy that misconception was dispelled with The Bad News Bears. It is rare to see such standout acting performances from such a young cast, but The Bad News Bears is a prime example of such a film. If you are going to seek out this great film, I would recommend going with the original (actually, in almost every scenario) and taking in some great Walter Matthau, along with some other big names in early roles and taking in 1976's The Bad News Bears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of a trilogy of films takes an unflinching look at the underbelly of little league baseball in Southern California. Former minor leaguer Morris Buttermaker is a lazy, beer swilling swimming pool cleaner who takes money to coach the Bears, a bunch of disheveled misfits who have virtually no baseball talent. Realizing his dilemma, Coach Buttermaker brings aboard girl pitching ace Amanda Whurlizer, the daughter of a former girlfriend, and Kelly Leak, a motorcycle punk who happens to be the best player around. Brimming with confidence, the Bears look to sweep into the championship game and avenge an earlier loss to their nemesis, the Yankees.Pretty good flick hits the spot with good speech and laughs, but some parts just make no sense.Rated PG for Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Serious Than You Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad News Bears defined Little League baseball in the USA for better or worse. Previous to this movie the only item I can remember about the Little League was a Walt Disney television film that starred Kevin Corcoran.Walter Matthau stars as a former minor league ballplayer who got a major league look/see in spring training in the Fifties who gets picked by town councilman Ben Piazza to take over the worst of the Little League teams in the league in that small Iowa town they're from. It's the Bears and these kids have no motivation no drive and not a whole lot of talent. What Matthau does is scout for some talent which includes a female pitcher in Tatum O'Neal and a young hood in training in Jackie Earle Haley. With two stars and after losing his first three games, the Bears make a race for the Little League pennant.When they get there they have to contend with Vic Morrow who is a real sports dad and who wants to win at any price. That leads to some unforeseen complications with Brandon Cruz who is the star pitcher on Morrow's team and his own son.Matthau in his usual brand of grumpy cynicism with the kids supplies the comedy. The drama and it's serious is supplied by Morrow who gives the best performance in the film. We've seen more current news stories about riots and fatalities at sports events, even kid's sports events. In that sense The Bad News Bears was ahead of its time. And the film is good and more serious than one might think given its reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a sports fan. I remember watching this film growing up. I remember the great Walter Mathau as the grumpy coach and Tatum O'Neal as the female pitcher. I enjoyed the relationship he had with the team especially Amanda. I also loved the theme music in the movie. The movie was well-regarded for many reasons particularly it's smart writing, great acting, and direction. I enjoy classic and this one is certainly a classic to be remembered. It's funny yet realistic and touching as the former major league player becomes the most unlikely coach of a losing baseball team. Mathau was perfect for this role. O'Neal shows how she won an Academy Award and the cast is well memorable as well. The film would come up with a series that didn't last as long because the magic just wasn't there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This exemplifies what is so great about kids in 70's/early 80's cinema. Cussing, fighting, etc. I dunno what it is about movies today, but everything is made to please everyone. Afraid to upset anybody. Bad News Bears and other films in that era are not like that. Thats what's so great about it. This film has a lot of meat to its context. The story is about an alcoholic former minor leaguer who is hired by a city official to coach a group of misfits in little league baseball. It touches on the inner demons of this coach when he reconnects with is would-be step daughter and the pitfalls of the pressure that adults can put on kids. This is not a fairytale movie by any means. A very real depiction of people that have issues in their lives and their means of taking it out on the diamond. Serious matter confronted with a light touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this as a kid and just caught it on Satilite last night. It's still great. As a kid I loved O'Neal because she was hot, but now I dug her acting. She held her own and went toe to toe with Walter. I was reminded of Dakota Fanning. I'm always so impressed with her acting and I can imagine back in '78 people were probably impressed with O'Neal for the same reason.It'll be interesting to see the remake. I don't think a shot for shot would hold up today. The '78 one feels low budget and indish. It's mainly on that field. I don't think that could be pulled off with Billy Bob.You know this must have been pretty cutting edge for it's time. The little blond kid has some great off color remarks. Course this was a time of All in the Falimy, but still to hear those things being delivered by an 8 year old was funny and great.</fullReview>

He portrays the beer dependant coach of a little league baseball team called the Bears that's on a major losing streak. In an effort to boost their sagging record, Matthau bribes an 11 year old girl (Tatum O'Neal) with a great pitching arm to join his team. The mischievious antics of Matthau and the kids on the team make this pleasant film an enjoyable comedy and great family oriented fare (if the occasional profanity can be ignored).

		<shortDescription>Review Of "The Bad News Bears"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Ritchie's "The Bad News Bears" is a classic American comedy film starring Walter Matthau as Morris Buttermaker, a former minor league ball player is recruited to coach a gang of misfit kids into winning the local sandlot baseball tournament. To start off, I had actually seen like the last 10 minutes of the 2000-whatever remake of the film on "TBS" or something. I wasn't really impressed. However, after sitting through all 100-some minutes of the original I can say that it is entertaining and at least worth checking out some time. Walter Matthau is. . .well, he's Walter Matthau. He's great in this and he's a great actor altogether. A young Jackie Earle Haley was in this and it was pretty interesting to see the movie where he first planted his feet into Hollywood. The script is alright from what I've seen - it had quite a few hilarious one-liners in it. The movie in general was fairly funny, but It also featured a lot of really touching moments between its characters that I honestly did not expect to see. Overall I felt the movie was pretty good and worth checking out if you have nothing else to watch on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent little movie with outstanding acting by Walter Mathau. Good observations of the socialization of kids and adults in little leagues, and great time capsule view of the 1970s - what could be said before cultural sensitivity and changes in the expectations of kids and adults changed what was considered acceptable conversation. Excellent movie for what it is. It doesn't use the kids for tear jerking sugar-overload dialog and characterization. I have not seen the remake, although Billy Bob Thorton can probably pull off the grizzled burned out coach pretty easily, but I the original coach had the ability to have sensitivity and depth, while also having a beer in his hand without it seeming excessive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHY I love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely my favorite movie of all time, with Bears II (Breaking Training) second on the list. Tatum O'Neal was the perfect Amanda, pitching- and acting-wise. Great actress, she delivered the lines perfectly. It isn't often that a 9-year-old girl can make me cry at will, but that scene after icing her arm in the dugout makes me cry every time. Kelly Leak, the ultimate stud player. If he hits, they win. His defense makes up for a weak overall team concept, and his hitting would be the best on any team, much less the one that didn't have a hit at all through their first two games. Miguel was best known for his walk just before the final at-bat for Kelly. Come on, a cute little kid that is barely the height of the catcher while kneeling? That bat is twice the size of him...he alternates between looking helpless and trying to look mean during the at-bat. Ahmed was just a stereotypical black kid using lines like sucker and Allah, so I didn't much care for him...But I loved him beating out the bunt. Rudy Stein...Um...Maybe they should NEVER let him pitch. He makes okay contact at the plate I guess...Note that he gets hit by a pitch in both of the first two movies, and his face in the second movie after getting hit is priceless...Looks like he knew it was happening and is melancholic. Reggie Tower...He plays third...Makes a play or two and pumps his fist. Important to the movie though, because his dad puts pressure on him to play. Important aspect to consider. Engleberg is a fat loudmouth, perfect for catcher. Eats throughout movie...Probably dies before Bears II, so they recast another fat kid for the role. I couldn't really tell. Same role really, didn't much matter. Ogilvie...Brain of team...Well, until Bears III where some new kid takes over. Does bad job too. DOn't bother looking up Bears go to Japan, terrible movie that features Tony Curtis and has a team as a side-note. Bears II Breaking Training is good, any kid would like it. Compare it to Meatballs or something, like a camp movie where kids are in control. Tanner Boyle. Best character in movie...Glaring gap in Bears III by his absence. Absolutely MADE the series and story work. Okay, he curses more than everyone else in movie. Thinks PC is Piece of Crap. Fights anyone and everyone. Rebel, says wrong thing, can't play defense for anything. He is heart of team, and the leader. Kelly can hit and play D, but he is the oldest and their role model...Amanda was the core of their success as well, so she was important...But Tanner was a misfit like the rest of them, and he stood up for Timmy. Stood up for the team...Defended Amanda...Come on, took on the seventh grade alone. Buttermaker yanks him in final inning, and he gripes, and then turns around and inspires Rudy to get out there and do his best. Inspires them in Bears II, win 1 for the Looper. Timmy Lupus, shy kid with no friends. Wins over Tanner, but already had won over Toby Whitewood who sort of defended him FROM Tanner until that point. Makes the catch...And that look on his face is priceless. The little speech before he takes the field that inning shows how he is a team player. Ogilvie too, I should add. Wonder if there is some reason that Amanda had to stay in game. The kids he yanked kept saying that they could be put back in, yet Amanda couldn't be switched for one? Seems unfair, but that gave us the line at the end where she asked Buttermaker to teach her to hit next year. Stein trying for 2 bases? Something wrong there...Ogilvie is the brain obviously, if you happened to mix them up. Toby is better in Bears II, as are most of the players. Well, they get more screen time. I wrote a review for the remake in 2005, so check out the review. This movie rocks no matter what, and the remake bites in comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps because the 1970's gave birth to many of the greatest American films of all time, it's easy to overlook such a quiet treasure as Michael Ritchie's 1976 offering, "The Bad News Bears." A perennially underrated and overlooked classic, "The Bad News Bears" nevertheless showcases all that is best in 70's film making: a witty and relevant screenplay (here by Bill Lancaster), a host of fully fleshed-out characters, an honest eye (and a finely-tuned ear) for detail, a judicious use of score (Bizet's "Carmen" is particularly well employed), considered (and considerable) attention to atmosphere (with John Alonzo's cinematography perfect in it's sun-drenched suburban ease), consistently fine performances all around--in short, all of the ingredients that serve to transform competent entertainment into something approaching cinematic art.The "Bad News Bears" is, in fact, the west coast's version of "Rocky," though critics have rarely considered the two films side by side--the result of differences in genre rather than in sentiment, most likely. Still, the two films clearly intersect (call it variations on a theme); and while the lazy afternoon sunshine of California's North Valley here replaces the gritty and bleak Philadelphia streets brought so vividly to life by Stallone/Avildsen (and John Crabe's gorgeous urban cinematography), "The Bad News Bears"--though a "comedy"--is no less serious a film as its east coast contemporary, winner of the 1976 Best Picture Oscar.Layered performances by Walter Matthau, Vic Morrow, Ben Piazza, and Joyce Van Patten--as well as standout work by the kids, most notably Tatum O'Neal, Jackie Earle Haley, Alfred Lutter, Quinn Smith, Brandon Cruz, and Chris Barnes (as the unforgettable Tanner Boyle)--make this a must see At once a brilliant social satire, a tale of redemption, and a lovingly honest ode to the young boys (and girls) of summer, it's unlikely a film like this could be made today...In a decade of remarkable American films, this small gem stands out as one of the best (if most overlooked) of the lot--high praise indeed. If for no other reason than to experience the hush of the crowd that accompanies Joey Turner's departure from the mound, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Matthau was at the peak of his career in the 1970's and "The Bad News Bears" is one of his very best performances. As a drunken loser, he is cajoled (bribed is more like it) into coaching a bunch of kids in little league. These kids are the worst athletes imaginable. But as the season goes on a girl (the terrific Tatum O'Neal) and the local hood join the team and the mayhem turns to some good baseball."The Bad News Bears" is a very funny film and most realistic in its depiction of little league baseball. The kids are fun and the adults are goofs. And I liked that the ending is somewhat unexpected. A nice change of pace for a sports film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny classic, but not as down-to-earth as many people think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bad News Bears" is very entertaining and funny, but it has many characteristics that keep it from having the heart that it tries to have. I played in Little League on 10 teams over a span of nine years and this movie has far too many ridiculously artificial things to even come close to capturing the real feel of Little League. First of all, kids can't be added to the team after the season starts unless someone has left. So for Kelly and Amanda to join, two kids have to leave. But that's nothing compared to the idea of a cigarette-smoking, motorcycle-riding boy, Kelly, playing Little League. In addition, no bench-clearing brawls have ever occurred in a Little League game (like the one shown in the final game), and two good players, Kelly and Amanda, can't carry a whole team to the championships. The sudden improvement of the Bears is just absurd. The movie also fails on a moral level. It encourages bad sportsmanship (the actions of Tanner and Lupus after the final game) and endorses child cigarette smoking (Kelly smokes and is a great ballplayer).That said, the movie is enjoyable and does have one classic scene, where Coach Turner's son (Brandon Cruz) holds on to the ball during the game to exact some sort of revenge on his father. The silence as he walks off the field is great, and his mother (played by the gorgeous Shari Sommers) waiting for him is a nice touch.</fullReview>

Both the kids and Buttermaker struggle against any opposition in the early stages (generally due to both a lack of talent and Buttermaker's questionable coaching methods). However, when Buttermaker recruits two star players - Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neal) and Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley) will these two players be the key to reverse Buttermaker's fortunes? In some ways this is a very difficult film for me to review because the overall tone and message within the film are both excellent. The problem with this film lies with the actual story and many of the characters. Let's begin with the characters;The majority of the characters (particularly the kids) are really annoying and fall into the laziest clichs imaginable - we've got the fat kid who is clumsy and oafish, the kid who's half the size of everyone, but think he's tougher than everyone else. The quiet kid who doesn't say anything and gets picked on. The geeky kid etc. Their shouting and bickering was more annoying than funny most of the time.Another problem I had with the film was the main story; I've got to be honest I'm not a fan of baseball and the only reason I watched this film is because it had Walter Matthau in it and because it had a 4 star rating on Sky Movies. I was expecting a laugh riot, but if I'm honest the only scenes that I found mildly amusing were the scenes between Matthau and O'Neal - you could see chemistry between the pair and could see that they had built a genuine rapport - O'Neal was also the only child actor who wasn't annoying and who I could say was actually acting. Sadly everything else about the film was poor and largely unfunny and again a lot of this wasn't helped by the fact that it had a serious 'baseball' themed wraparound story which again just didn't particularly appeal to me.One thing I did like about this film was that it ranked taking part and being a team player as being equally important as winning. This assertion is impressed upon throughout the film and really hits home at the end. The fact that the writers chose to avoid a clichd ending was excellent and the ending is actually one of the strongest aspects of the film.As I said in my summary this is a film that is great when you look at what it has to say, but the problem for me is that most of the kids are annoying, the film doesn't have enough laughs and I didn't find the story all that interesting or compelling. If you're a fan of baseball fan then you may find this somewhat enjoyable. However, if you're not a fan of baseball and you want to watch a more entertaining film with similar plot mechanics then I'd recommend watching Cool Runnings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not That Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when I was a kid and loved it. I was recently watching Norm Macdonald's interview of Billy Bob Thornton, and Billy Bob mentioned that this is a great movie. I was surprised he used the word "great." So I downloaded it from PirateBay and just watched it to see if he was right. It's very good until Tatum O'Neal is introduced about 40 minutes in, and then it just becomes silly from that point forward. The famous Fielding play on Carmen is not used as often as I would have liked, as that's the best thing about the movie. That the Bears end up doing so well by seasons's end is not impressive, as they couldn't have achieved such a progression without the services of Tatum O'Neal's and Jackie Earle Haley's characters, which feels like a cheat.Joyce Van Patten, who plays the water-stopping dam equipment manager, is strangely enticing (Matthau gets a funny line in at her character's expense when he calls her "Sir" after being awarded the trophy. Vic Morrow's wife looks very alluring in those tight pants.As annoying as these kids are they at least resemble somewhat normal children, complete with awkward physiognomies and facial junk. Not like the nauseating kid actors today who look like models and are told to act like little adults.There are incidental pleasures to watching movies from an earlier era--this is an interesting snapshot of mid-70s Southern California surburbia, which director Ritchie also took a gander at in the prequel-of-sorts Smile (1975).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking part is for LOSERS...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baseball is not a game that has ever (or will ever) interest me in the slightest, but if you avoided all sports films just because you didn't like the subject you'd be missing out on some bona fide classics. This entry doesn't quite reach that lofty standard, but there's enough good characterisation amongst the team members and Walter Matthau's gruff turn as the abrasive yet good-hearted coach for it to JUST make the play-offs (I know, bad reference joke there).I would like to take issue though with the ending, which almost made me spit fire. Let me get this straight... You're ONE game away from winning the championship... and in the final match... you decide to let all the WORST players on your side take to the pitch... just because 'they haven't had a chance all season?' And, when you inevitably are defeated, you celebrate like it was a victory because 'everyone got to take part'? This is stupidity almost beyond the realms of comprehension.If you wanted to give the losers a run-out, how about in one of the EARLIER matches, when you were ahead by a long way and nothing was at stake? By letting them have free reign in such an important game... it's the most terrible kind of self-vandalism. What was the point in working so HARD to reach this point, to throw it all away to make a pathetic moral?Morons, the lot of 'em. And I bet they'd make the England football squad too... 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Little Dozen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most movies about kids and sports are pretty boring but this one, though not flawless, is quite a lot of fun. The director, Michael Ritchie, has this obsession with competitive sports. In his movies, when people want to relax they go water skiing. But he's found the humor in this mostly formulaic story of a Little League team in the San Fernando Valley that rises from outcast status to number two in the league. Number TWO, mind you, not number one, thank God. They didn't win the pennant but everybody, including Walter Matthau as their manager, gave it their best shot. Giving it your best shot was one of the many good features of "Rocky" as well, until it became clear that Rocky only lost the fight in order to make way for sequels.Let me get the unconvincing stuff out of the way first. (There isn't much of it.) In one scene, Tatum O'Neal, the Bears' pitcher, is trying to get Matthau and her mother, estranged, back together and Matthau explodes with rage and tells O'Neal that he doesn't want her company and never did, throws a can of beer at her, and tells her to beat it. She leaves Matthau brooding alone in the dug out and -- get this -- he TEARS UP. Now, one thing Matthau does not do is tear up and cry. He didn't even tear up in "A Face in the Crowd" when he discovered that the woman he loved was at that very moment sharing a bed with a chiseler. And it's not simply that he cries. It's that the scene completely lacks motivation. He's never said a harsh word about O'Neal's mother and has always treated O'Neal herself with masked tenderness, if a manipulativeness that's colorful and flamboyant.There's another worrisome property in the script. The dispirited kids of course at the start want to win a couple of games. The manager couldn't care less but as he suffers insults from other adults, he begins to whip the kids into shape, and as the pennant seems closer he becomes zealous, shouting at the kids and punishing them. The kids become resentful because the game is no longer a team effort and, more important, not so much fun anymore. (See "The Private War of Major Benson," "Major Payne," "Fear Strikes out," inter alia, for examples.) The manager must learn that "winning isn't everything." Although, of course, it IS.Finito. The good parts. There are some scenes that are very funny indeed. At the Bears' first game, Matthau is a careless drunk. His first words to the team's sponsor: "Where's the check?" His second words: "You forgot to sign the check." None of the kids knows what position he's playing and they all run to catch a grounder and one kid picks it up and throws it towards second base, which is empty. The kids fight over who's supposed to be the shortstop. In the dug out, a tiny kid asks Matthau: "That's an error, isn't it?" Matthau, as placid as ever, explains patiently, unflappably, "It's an error on the throw but not on the infield because nobody was there." The kids use obscenities of a sort they wouldn't be able to use today, no matter that in real life those same words are in everyday use among kids that age. I can't even print some in this comment. The use of tunes from Georges Bizet's opera "Carmen" is particularly apt. Masculine competition in pursuit of an uncertain prize. I have to mention just one other thing. Matthau is forced to find a sponsor for the uniforms his outcasts will wear. The end result, at the playoffs, is that the Bears wind up wearing blouses with "Chico's Bail Bonds" on the back, while their opponents wear "Denny's." A hit -- a palpable hit.I admire the kids' ability to play ball, probably because of my own proprioceptive deficit, but what's this movie about, anyway? Character development, okay, but it's character as reflected in the context of competition. Herbert Spencer was surely not the first person to observe that in-group pride requires the hatred of an out-group. We often hear that "every winner implies a loser" but it's untrue. The fact is that every winner implies a vast NUMBER of losers. Not just the guy or the team who came in second, but those who came in third, fourth, and . . . nth. And, human nature being what it is, what's the likely response to the outcome of any competitive display? Of all those losers, many of them will resent the winners as "cheaters" and "bullies". The winners in turn will disdainfully dismiss the losers as "whiners" and "incompetents". All of our vernacular examples seem directed at teaching us how to win. Where do we learn how to lose properly? And, oh, how we need those lessons because there are a lot more of us than there are of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonably OK kids sports movie that is at least free of the heavy schmaltz of modern movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A washed up former baseball player now making his living cleaning swimming pools takes on a coaching job on the side for a group of misfit in a kids' baseball league.I do normally try to write a bit of a plot summary to help me focus my thoughts before writing a review but to be honest there is little beyond this one line description that is necessary. Lessons are learnt, the kids fight, games are won and lost, tough nuts are cracked and so on. What I will say is that, by modern standards, it is mostly free of the heavy schmaltz that one would expect from nowadays. This is not to say that it is free of it of course, because it still is build on sentiment and simple characters and it still is a kids-orientated sports movie. It is preferable to modern movies of the same ilk because it does feel quite rough and unpolished but it is still what it is.The cast is led by a typically scruffy Matthau, playing his usual deadpan, grumpy character. It is effective for what it is but don't expect his character to be interesting or his performance to be worthy of any note. The children are mostly cheeky but at least that is better than that horrid "cute" thing that most child actors seem to be asked to do. O'Neal is fun but the rest of the cast just slot into easy boxes without having a great deal of presence. The sports action is mostly dull but I suppose the simple narrative might be enough to please a family audience of undemanding children and sleepy adults. Not that good then and probably has nostalgia to thank for the way it is viewed by grown-up viewers looking back at it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alcoholic swimming pool cleaner Walter Matthau coaches a rag-tag bunch of little league baseball players in this hilarious and edgy 1970s comedy-drama. His key ballers include female pitching ace Tatum O'Neal (the daughter of Matthau's former girlfriend) and shady juvenile delinquent Jackie Earle Haley. Vic Morrow ends up being the antagonist here as one of Matthau's managerial adversaries. Amazingly none of the kids ever really became household names (O'Neal of course had already won an Oscar back in 1973 for "Paper Moon"), but that does not mean that they do not have great chemistry and timing with one another. Matthau brings believability and competency to the whole production. Highly enjoyable, but maybe a bit too adult-oriented for some youngsters. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

This patience is evinced in the Bears' new winnig ways, which comes slowly and thus gains believablity.

		<shortDescription>A Film About Winning And Losing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one time, Michael Ritchie was a smart director who created a series of pointed films about American attitudes towards winning and losing and this comedy about an inept little league team managed by a drunk was probably his best known (although his best was the under-appreciated `Smile'). Although there are plenty of laughs owing to cynicism and sarcasm (primarily delivered by the inimitable Walter Matthau), most of the humor is derived from the shocking (at the time) sight of kids spewing vulgarities and adopting adult attitudes. This, however, cleverly underscores Ritchie's commentary about the emphasis parents place on success. Ritchie gets decent performances from his child actors but Tatum O'Neal (as the pitcher) is extremely impressive, delivering her snappy comebacks with precision and intelligence. The film is satisfying as a whole but there are moments when Bill Lancaster's script veers into unwelcome sentimentality and the flat, sun-baked California suburban landscape (as filmed by John A. Alonzo) causes the performers to occasionally lose their edge and seem like they're wilting in the heat.</fullReview>

It was well-written, funny and very, very honest. You will never again see a kids movie with this kind of language, rebellion, smoking, alcohol and, like I said, raw honesty. In general, there are no good guys or bad guys, there's no cartoonish "evil" team in black jerseys.The kids act like kids. Like the one trying to get attention while telling his long story to an uninterested Walter Mathau, the "Booger Eating Spaz" or the general potty mouth behavior. They're not super-clean Disney movie kids. It's the movie that inspired a thousand "team of misfits" movies. Yet it's nothing like any of them and better than all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Bad News Bears" is not just about little league baseball and a bunch of delightfully foul-mouthed kids but about the whole American ethic of "number one is everything and second best is nothing."Walter Matthau is the beer-guzzling Morris Buttermaker, a weary has-been who leads the Bears from the humiliation of total defeat (26-0 without finishing the first inning) up the ladder of success. Tatum O'Neal is the tomboy pitcher and Jackie Earle Haley is the amiably punky Harley rider who are both instrumental in the Bears' climb.The scene I liked best showed us the young pitcher for the "Yankees," who gets even with his coarsely-macho father-manager's openly berating him. Refusing to let go of the ball, the boy allows the Bears to steal points and then drops the ball disdainfully at his father's feet as he leaves the field with an approving mama. Revenge is sweet. The film is enjoyable on a couple of levels, although some of the parent-child relationships could have been developed beyond the two-dimensional stage. The kids are all marvelous. The chubby candy-junkie catcher is a real stitch, and director Michael Ritchie has a fine eye throughout for revealing "Americana."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad News Bears, The (1976) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Walter Matthau plays a drunken, former pitcher who takes the job of coaching a little league team that is the new guys in the conference. The players are full of horrible misfits but when Matthau adds a female picture (Tatum O'Neil) their luck starts to turn around. I'm sure when this was originally released it was meant to be a kids film but when viewed today I don't think there's any doubt that this is a movie for adults. There's certainly a good message to be found here for kids but I'd guess that due to some of the racial slurs used, some of the child abuse and other subjects, this film is probably way too dark for kids and at times the film is pretty shocking in how it displays certain things. With all that said, this is still a terrific classic that I've seen numerous times over the years. The movie is certainly funny as hell but it also has a pretty good heart and message. The entire key to this film is the terrific performance by Matthau who really steals every single second in the movie. He's played drunks in a lot of films but in my opinion this is the best performance of any of them and he really delivers one of the most memorable characters of the decade. Vic Morrow is also very good in his role as the opposing coach as is O'Neil in her role. As I've said, this was a childhood favorite of mine but it's rather strange how you see things when you're older because it was clear to me with this viewing that there's more to this movie than just laughs and that's the fact that there's something a lot deeper underneath. The final game between the rivals is rather ugly and brutal to watch at times due to how Matthau and Morrow are acting and it really takes the fun out of the game for the players. This hit me a lot harder on this viewing than previously and I think the real message here is for the adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bad News Bears has to be one of my top ten favorite films. Moreover, I consider it the best movie about baseball ever made. What is so wonderful about the film is how it slyly shows that the game of baseball is just that, a game. The Bears are a bunch of misfits that no other teams wanted. However, these misfits want to play baseball and have fun. So the Bears were created and they are the joke of the league. In fact, they are so bad, that even the parents of the team members want to disband. However, a drunken' Coach Buttermaker has a few ideas on how to make them a better team, mainly by adding a couple of odd ringers. Well, the Bears start winning and pretty soon, they are no longer a joke. Well, that might be where many movies leave off. But this movie explores just how winning effects the Bears. Does it make them happier, yes and no. I have never laughed more at a movie and at the same time, teared up a bit. This wonderful film shows us that the purpose of sport is to have fun and not always about winning.</fullReview>

Having said that, this film is harmless other than pre-teens coming up with four letter words more often than I would have liked. Walter Matthau is good as a beer drinking coach whose team consists of totally untalented players. To try and win, he goes to see Amanda who is blessed with a great fast ball and curve. Amanda is the daughter of coach Buttermaker's past love interest. (adding "ringers" to any team would not be permitted.)There are a few good lessons here including the importance of teamwork and a never quit attitude. This movie is PG for a good reason.

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Baseball Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have often heard that this is the best movie made about Little League Baseball. However, I think this film goes beyond that, it is the greatest film about baseball, ever. This movie was made close to thirty years ago, but remains as timely as ever. The first reason you love the film is because the comedy is so wonderful. Incredible writing delivered by an extremely talented cast. Morrow, Mathau and O'Neal are just incredible, but so are the rest of the kids that play the Bears. When looking at this film you must go beyond the comedic aspects of it. There is real life at work here and in this case, some of that is unfortunate. You see how Little League baseball is really more for the parents than it is for the kids. The kids are trying to have fun, but it is adults that attempt to take that away from them and force them to treat it as a serious business. Even our hero, Coach Buttermaker (Mathau)makes the temporary mistake of taking it all too serious. In fact, when it is all said and done, we see what being Champion does for the relationship of the Bear's rival team's father and son. If you are a parent with kids in Little League, watch this film and learn from it. Heck, everybody should watch this film, it is one of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An alcoholic ,ex-minor leaguer, and all-round sour-puss is hired to coach a losing Little League team because no one else will do it. The team miraculously pulls together to overcome their problems. There is a lot of profanity and bad behavior by both adults and children on the way to the inevitable happy ending. Walter Matthau sleepwalks his way through his standard grouchy/heart of gold role while Tatum O'Neill is wasted. Her character is given little screen time and no development. There's not one word about how the boys feel about a girl teammate, and in 1976, this would have been news.Trashy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too corny for an adult audience and too adult for kids, it's not clear who the audience is for this chestnut. Although not really asked to stretch Mathau, Morrow and Tatum O'Neal deliver capable performances and aside from Tatum the kids themselves vary from stiff to just short of natural. Yet somehow the picture must have struck a chord in audiences, breeding sequels, a TV show and a remake.Mathau repeats the Oscar Madison persona he built his career on, scowling, guzzling beer and puffing on cheap cigars. Morrow plays the stereotypically overly demanding kid's coach, and while the ending is just this side of neat and tidy, it is neat and tidy enough to still have the audience leaving the theater feeling "upbeat." Overall, the film is not quite bad enough to be a real stinker, but eminently forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as much of a classic as I was hoping for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad News Bears is about a little league team and their fighting determination to deal with an alcoholic coach and diverse, not-so-talented teammates. The coach, Mr. Buttermaker (played classically by Walter Matthau), agrees to more than he thinks he signs up for when he agrees to manage the Bears. With a distorted view of how the team should perform and hardly any practice put into the work of the team, he learns how much the meaning of sportsmanship has slipped through his fingers into his alcoholic gaze.I liked the movie, but not enough to call this one a classic, in my opinion. I think there were a lot of slow, detached scenes when you wondered what was supposed to be going on. The little girl (his daughter?) who ends up pitching for the Bears seems like overkill with her "8 going on 30" acting mannerisms. The "bad boy" Kelly character was a nice touch but again very unbelievable with their casting choice for that kid. My guess is that he might've been chosen for actual baseball skill, I think. Matthau doesn't need to do a whole lot in this film; he gets to sit around and order kids to play ball better as he sips beer and loses focus of the team.If the movie is trying to get the audience to feel badly for the players, the sympathy level rises, but not enough to make anything believable. You get to see the products of destroyed ethics in a few kids (like the kid quick to hurl racist terms around). The only significant time when something starting happening was when the rival coach goes on the field and confronts/hits his kid, causing the kid to stop participating in the play right after the incident. I don't know if this movie took place when a lot of alcoholic (or even obsessive) managers/parents would have their kids in little league/pop warner football/whatever. The message was clear from the beginning and seemed to stretch and get tired by the end, though.The remake of the film (with Billy Bob Thorton) was a bit more lively and kept my attention longer possibly for the newness of the scenes in that version. This older one didn't have very active or attention-grabbing moments as much as that one. There was no music to spice up the playing time. But despite the lack of active scenes, Matthau does keep every movie he does a classic by providing his reluctant twist on an otherwise boring character.I gave the film a 5/10. It didn't grab me as much as I was possibly expecting from a movie like this, called a "classic" even. I was hoping for more of a comedy as well, but not very many scenes held their own to be very memorable. Despite the average score, I'd suggest checking it out for the Matthau performance (and classic character of his) and an overall sense of what going out to movie back when this came out is all about (a lot of films were released into this cesspool of films which could've been a lot better).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Language is AWFUL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I was appalled at the language in this movie. For a kids' movie especially, the swearing is excessive. Many of the movies we consider to be "grown-up" movies don't have as much vulgarity in it. While the message of the movie may be positive, the examples set by virtually everyone in this movie are pitiful. I was very disappointed - and have a copy to sell! We will not watch this again. "Greatest kids and sports movie ever"?? I think not! I would much rather my kids watch something like "The Mighty Ducks" - at least no kids were abused in the making of that movie! I really find it hard to believe that the movie only garnered a PG rating. It also surprises me that it was filmed in the 70's when we supposedly had higher standards.</fullReview>
