		<shortDescription>This remake is the one to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having just seen BACK FROM ETERNITY for the first time in about a "hundred" years, I really have to weigh in with my opinion on this. It is one of the few times when the remake is an improvement on the original, exceptionally so.I saw the original (FIVE CAME BACK) some time ago and, from what I can tell, the only thing which could possibly raise it even slightly above the superior remake is the curiosity factor of having Lucille Ball in the cast. Other than that, the acting and the production were very wooden and dated, and the overall cast pales in comparison to that which was assembled for ETERNITY.For anyone not familiar with the story, a plane crashes in the midst of a remote South American jungle. Besides the pilot and co-pilot, there are nine passengers: a so-called "fallen woman", an engaged couple, an elderly professor and his wife, a small boy and his guardian, and a cop with a prisoner in tow. They must stay alive until the plane is repaired, a task complicated by the realization that they are surrounded by a hostile tribe of headhunters.Here you have Robert Ryan instead of Chester Morris, Rod Steiger instead of Joseph Calleia, and Gene Barry instead of Patric Knowles. Ryan and Steiger especially, in the main roles, display more screen presence and acting talent in this one film than their predecessors were able to conjure up in their entire careers.Ryan plays the world-weary pilot, another of his sturdy and dependable performances which are often overlooked and not fully appreciated because he made it seem so effortless. Steiger has the more colorful role as the anarchist, with only imprisonment and execution waiting for him if and when they make it back to civilization. The same talent, which would gain an Oscar for the actor some ten years later, is clearly evident here.The underrated Keith Andes (as the co-pilot, instead of forgettable Kent Taylor) gives a hint of the star he could have become, and the equally underrated Phyllis Kirk is far more effective in her role than whoever played it in the original. Barry, usually cast as a good guy, gives a good account of himself, playing Kirk's fiancée. Whereas most of the other passengers rise to the occasion, his character becomes increasingly desperate, grasping, and unstable.Anita Ekberg, frequently dismissed as an actress, may not have been as talented as Lucille Ball (who played the part in the original), but at least proved that she could indeed act, and is certainly more convincing in this type of role than Lucy was.Of note is a pre-Lassie Jon Provost as the little boy. Jesse White, better known for his work in comedic films, does a fine job as the boy's roughhewn guardian, and Fred Clark is good at giving a distasteful stamp to the rather seedy cop. Above all, Cameron Prudhomme and Beulah Bondi, as the old professor and his mrs., give two very moving, heartfelt performances.The story concerns the characters' survival, how each holds up under the pressure and are changed by the situation. Steiger begins to rediscover some of the values of his youth, but then finally takes it upon himself to decide who will live and who will die, when it is learned that some must stay behind. The conclusion builds to a shattering climax that will stay with you long after the film ends. This is the remake to see and it is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake of Five Came Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were two problems with Back From Eternity which is not the fault of the people who actually made this film. RKO Studios was going out of business as Howard Hughes was busy folding it up. The film was released and then very quickly was on television as the entire RKO film library was. The second is unfortunately the film came out in the wake of The High and the Mighty. Most airplane pictures suffer in comparison to that one.Not mind you that it could have been given better productions values. Color for the jungle scenes and maybe some location shooting instead of dusting off the same sets used for Five Came Back, for that matter for King Kong. Remember RKO was owned by one of aviation's biggest boosters in Howard Hughes. Not that he couldn't have afforded some better productions values. But then again he was getting out of the film business at this time. Then again had he put some money into it, we also would have had more Hughes control and the results might have been interesting. Not necessarily good, but interesting.That being said the cast does a fine job for director John Farrow. Like John Wayne in The High and the Mighty, Robert Ryan is fine as the able veteran airline pilot in charge of getting his passengers and crew back to safety after they've force landed in the South American jungle. Of course with the pulchritudinous Anita Ekberg on board and interested that's enough to give anyone a morale booster. Rod Steiger plays the criminal on the way to his execution, a part done by Joseph Calleia in the original. Both are fine and are an interesting contrast in acting styles.John Farrow added a few things here that were not in the original. One of the dumber things added was a chick fight between Phyllis Kirk and Anita Ekberg while they are stranded in the jungle. I mean was that really necessary John? Added nothing to the plot and kind of stupid when you come to think about it.Still, chick fight and all, Back from Eternity is a good solid piece of entertainment that also asks some important questions about the quality of life collectively and the quality of how one spends his allotted time on earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small b-grade film given status by Rod Steiger's intelligent and moving performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a young boy, when it was first shown here in Australia, and I haven't seen it since, even on television. But it remains vivid in my memory solely because of the performance of Rod Steiger. His "villain with a soul" is a role he played in many subsequent films, and it is what makes him so absorbing and intriguing to watch. Nobody does brooding menace like Rod Steiger. In this film, he outshines every other player, and in fact his character, and what he does at the end, is the core of the plot. Back from Eternity might be classified as a B-Grade film, but for the fact that Rod Steiger is in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT 50'S MELODRAMA IN JUNGLE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Airplane (with passengers) crashed in jungle near tribe of head-hunters. Great ending to this one. The always dependable Robert Ryan is the pilot and Rod Steiger is outstanding as a criminal on his way to prison. Gorgeous Anita Ekberg is on hand with various American types to fill out the slate.A 7 out of 10. Best performance = Mr. Steiger. Tension really builds in this one after the first hour. It's tough to see what's coming, but it's worth the wait. Definitely in the Top 10 of 1956. Jon Provost (from LASSIE) is the little kid. Keith Andes (Skip Homier's brother) is co-pilot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Decent Airplane Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be considered a B movie, but it is in a word very entertaining. The cast of different characters and portrayals of those roles are very well done. The movie sets you up for what is about to happen and then plunges you full throttle into the story. It is every bit as entertaining and full of drama as the later Airport movies of the 1970's. In fact, in many ways this is much better. It is very fun to see Jesse White in a role other than the Maytag repair man. The same can be said for actors Fred Clark, Jon Provost, Gene Barry and the rest who were more famous for other roles. You have to love Rod Steiger's character. He is definitely the most interesting in the movie. It is a nice little movie in character studies and how they deal with a forced landing in a jungle clearing with a cannibal tribe nearby. This movie stacks up to the airport and other flight disaster movies quite well. I first saw this as a teenager and I never forgot it, especially when the decision had to be made to see who stayed behind and especially who made the decision. For this being a B movie it is still very first rate and gets an A in viewing pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director John Farrow re-makes FIVE CAME BACK(1939), which he also directed. The crew and passengers of a crippled plane try to survive in a South American jungle. Pretty bland, but worth watching due to the acting of Rod Steiger. Destined to face a firing squad, Steiger's character is pivotal to the films anxious finale. Other cast members of note are: Robert Ryan, Gene Barry, Phyllis Kirk, Anita Ekberg and a young Jon Provost. If you are like me and enjoy watching the old black &amp; white movies...this really isn't so bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly a great movie; a memorable, powerful B/W "stunt movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I classify "Back From Eternity", John Farrow's remake of "Five Came Back" as a 'stunt' film. This is because it isolates human beings for the purpose of analyzing a range of character types, instead of connecting them to a larger world of potentials. The original filmed version of this interesting story was shorter and more direct; the attempt by John Farrow and his writers in 1956 was to turn a first-rate adventure film into a dramatic one; and they nearly succeeded, by my standards. The problem in the remake I suggest lies in the writers having turned the lead, Bill, played by Robert Ryan, into a man who cannot be trusted not to drink alcohol, even though he is a pilot. This problem with the ethical central character, otherwise a man of great ability and experience, makes the man, played by Ryan, who lacks the charisma of his second, Joe Brooks, played by the immensely-powerful Keith Andes, decidedly inferior to his second in voltage, interest and ethical consistency. Some of the other casting, that of sex-symbol non-actress Anita Ekberg as a saloon girl and Rod Steiger doing a partially-unsuccessful foreign accent, makes the actors and their parts less acceptable than they deserve to be. Many actors in this film do admirable work; and it is a filmed narrative filled I believe with wonderful scenes both before and after the crash of the aircraft aboard which most of the cast flies. Andes and Phyllis Kirk are I suggest unforgettable lovers, played off the obnoxious character impersonated capably by Gene Barry. The elder actors from Fred Clark to Beulah Bondi are all excellent, and the plot line--involving an attempt to repair one of the downed plane's engines to escape a jungle inhabited by headhunters--is particularly exciting. Especially this is so I argue because with one engine and a short runway, everyone in the downed party cannot be flown to safety. Who will decide who lives and who dies--and on what basis-forms a strong counterpoint to the film's basic examination of how ethical considerations affect the way people live in normal situations. This is a well-directed and very well-remembered film; one that is extremely underrated and I suggest worth watching many times over. But its greatest asset is Keith Andes who made a near miracle as usual, out of slim opportunities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seldom rises above B-grade melodrama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why John Farrow decided there had to be a remake of FIVE CAME BACK (which he directed earlier) remains a mystery to me. The script here is pretty much the same thing--standard plane crash with survivors lost in the jungle--and all on a studio set that looks like no more than a studio set. So much for reality.But the performances he draws from his cast are almost enough to make the film as engrossing as it strives to be. The passengers are a mixed lot--among them a beauteous Anita Ekberg who poses prettily but makes no real effort to act. On the other hand, Robert Ryan and Keith Andes, as co-pilots, Beulah Bondi and Cameron Prud'Homme as an elderly couple, Phyllis Kirk and Gene Barry as a mismatched young couple, and Jon Provost (before his Lassie fame) do excellent jobs considering the fact that their roles are stereotypes. There are also less fortunate roles played by Adele Mara, Jesse White and Fred Clark. Mara's sudden exit from the plane at the height of the storm at least spares her the difficulty of facing the rest of the film as a stranded stewardess.Top-lined in the cast is Rod Steiger as a criminal facing execution once he is returned to authorities. In an ironic twist of fate, he's the one who eventually chooses who shall leave the jungle crash scene and who shall not.Interesting, but no real improvement over the original except for a few of the performances. All in all, good B-picture entertainment.The most convincing moments are the plane's anxious moments during a wild thunderstorm. This is by and far the most visually compelling part of the film in which Farrow's direction (and some good special effects) shows his capabilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danger in the jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came on rencently on BBC2 one afternoon and I was glad I taped it.An aeroplane crash lands during a storm into a remote jungle. It has a motley collection of passengers including a murderer, an elderly couple, two young women and a small boy. What they don't know is that headhunters are watching them while the plane is being repaired. When it is eventually repaired, only so many of the party can go back and the murderer decides on who will do this. After the headhunters kill two of the party and another one is shot, the plane takes off with the murderer and the elderly couple left behind (they had decided to do this themselves).The movie stars Robert Ryan as the plane's main pilot, an excellent performance from Rod Steiger as the murderer, Gene Barrie (War of the Worlds), Phyllis Kirk (House of Wax) and Anita Ekberg.This movie is rather creepy in parts and I found it very enjoyable.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good survival melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tale was previously filmed in 1939 ,by the same director ,John Farrow and in that version it was a lean,mean and exciting B-movie.Here it lasts 20 minutes or so longer and this additional running time consists mainly of padding ,which serves to dilute the impact of the movie.It means that the minor classic of an earlier era has become a solid and enjoyable movie from the era in which it was made . The story revolves around a plane crash in the remote jungles of South America. The pilot declares he is able to repair the plane and it will fly some of them back to safety ,the problem being there is only room for 5 people on board the repaired vessel ,which means some will have to stay behind and take their chances with the inhospitable terrain and the hostile natives who are unhappy about this incursion into their domain . The survivors are a disparate group-there is the hard drinking pilot (Robert Ryan) ,a Vegas performer (Anita Ekberg),a criminal en route to execution (Rod Steiger) and the sadistic cop accompanying him (Fred Clark),a socialite and her milquetoast fiancé (Phyllis Kirk and Gene Barry),the co-pilot (Keith Andes),a distinguished elderly academic and his wife of many years (Cameron Proudhomme and Beulah Bondi).The party is rounded out by a 4 year old boy(Jon Provost) The movie sees the party disintegrate under the strain as tensions erupt and violence breaks out before the final decision is a made The movie is well acted -,especially by Steiger ,Barry and Ryan ,has a crisp Franz Waxman score and delivers solid entertainment all round .It would ,in my view have benefited from being a tad leaner and more economical but there is still a good time to be had from watching it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine what attracted John Farrow into remaking his own "Five Came Back", which was good. By updating the story to 1956, nothing really was improved, although the film is good to watch because of the performances Mr. Farrow was able to get from this cast.The first part of the film brings together all the characters into a small airport where they are preparing to embark for another point in South America. The flight is commandeered by Bill Lonagan, who is a strange man that seems to be going through a rough patch in his life. The co-pilot is Joe Brooks, a young man who doesn't trust the older captain.The passengers are an assortment of characters that have been put together by fate, or so it seems. There is the beautiful Rena, who is going to work in a casino. The Spanglers, a professor and his wife who are on a studying trip. Then there is Jud Ellis and Louise, who are going to Brazil, but have missed their flight and are forced to go on the PAL flight. We also find Pete who is taking a young boy, Tommy, the son of a mobster, to his mother and a prisoner, Vasquel, being taken by his guard.When the flight develops problems, the captain makes the decision to land the plane in a valley in the middle of a jungle. While on the ground, they realize the plane has been greatly damaged and all try to put it back in service. Unfortunately, they are surrounded by an Indian tribe that is not kind to their invasion.The film is interesting to watch because of Robert Ryan and Rod Steiger, who as Lonegan and Vasquel do excellent work for Mr. Farrow. There is an ensemble kind of playing in general by the supporting players making the film better than what it could have been and it holds the viewer's attention.A film to be seen as a curiosity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The long list of great movies attributed to Robert Ryan span from here to eternity and beyond. This film which is among his best is entitled " Back From Eternity. " It tells the story of a group of nine passengers traveling aboard a plane destined for remote locations. Unfortunately, the plane is forced to crash in the uncivilized, headhunter jungles of South America and the audience becomes more acquainted with the passenger list as they are exposed to indigenous danger. Robert Ryan is Bill Lonagan, the tired, world weary veteran pilot, who dreams of a place in the sun. Rod Steiger plays Vasquel, a condemned man facing the gallows. Keith Andes is Joe Brooks, the ever stalwart Co-Pilot. Gene Barry, Fred Clark, Jesse White and Jon Provost add definite color to the cast as does Anita Ekberg, Phyllis Kirk, Louise Melhorn, Beulah Bondi, Martha Spangler as the Stewardess. Each have reasons to live and a couple the courage to die. In between we learn just how deep convictions are and what we believe is not what we expect from appearances. Rod Steiger gives a sterling performance which should have earned him an Academy Award. The film has a certain panache worthy of a Classic and we who view it should be fortunate to have seen it. Recommended to any looking for a great movie.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really solid, well made, and dramatic, including the wild ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back from Eternity (1956)A surprisingly well made movie. The plot is a big contrivance in a way, a calculated drama of conflicting character types in a survival situation. But the acting is excellent, the script tight, and the direction and pacing really strong. Robert Ryan leads the group, literally as the pilot of the doomed plane, and he's in great, restrained form. Eventually he is matched, as an actor, but the nuanced, quirky Rod Steiger, who plays a criminal of sorts. The two leading women are Anita Ekberg, who is here as an ornament as usual, but ends up being a decent character after all, and Phyllis Kirk, and dependable secondary actress.It's probably coincidence, but here is a movie about an airplane by the studio (RKO) run by Howard Hughes, and aircraft industrialist. And it was one of RKO's last films, being ruined (along with all the studios) by the collapse of Old Hollywood. While not a big budget movie, the sets are contrived to work within their limitations, being stuck, as it were, in the jungle. The weirdest thing here might be that the director (and producer), John Farrow, made the same movie in 1939. The first one is supposed to be better, but I haven't seen it, and this one holds its own. Partly it's just the searing acting of Steiger, and of Ryan. If the plot were not quite so improbable, and the inevitable weeding out of the survivors from the victims, the movie might be considered really excellent. It never wavers (except maybe the girl fight in the pool, which is stupidity), and it has lots of nuances and romantic touches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite "little" movies. It is better than the original "Five Came Back" and is a curiosity because of John Farrow's having directed both versions. The fact that it IS all done on a sound stage fits it perfectly, as well as the black and white. It reminds me of another of my favorites: "The Thing (From Another World)" with Kenneth Tobey. Great ensemble acting and not a word of dialog wasted. I think Robert Ryan's height helps him here; Chester Morris is on the short side. The story? Plane goes up, plane comes down. In jungle. People must get out of jungle to safety. However, there are problems with the plane and with the very unfriendly folds who live in the jungle. Kind of like an early version of "Lost."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining B Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting for years for "Back from Eternity" to come out on DVD. It, along with many other older movies, is on my Website King Spud's Movie &amp; TV Pages on my Up to the Minute Page. For a time many films on my List were coming out on DVD, but of late nothing, save The African Queen has been released. Back from Eternity is an absolutely terrific little film, albeit a B movie. It has an excellent cast led by Robert Ryan and Rod Steiger in an early role. The rest of the cast are doing some of their best work, Beulah Bondi, Cameron PrudHomme, Jesse White, Phyllis Kirk, Gene Barry, Fred Clark, little Jon Provost and especially Keith Andes, who makes one wonder why he wasn't a bigger star. This is an edge of your seat film, a real nail-biter. The tension builds as the pilots and passengers scuttle to repair the downed plane's engine while the danger of an attack by Jivaro headhunters increases. A fine score by the great Franz Waxman also helps elevate this film to almost classic stature. I saw it as a kid and never forgot it. After all these years it was great to see it has held up to all my expectations of its thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It takes a brave man to decide life or death for nine people."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I saw the 1939 original "Five Came Back", but in trying to make a quick mental comparison I don't find much difference between the two pictures. Most of the characters retain the same names, the addition of youngster Tommy Malone (Jon Provost) might be one of the more significant differences. Anita Ekberg as a prostitute heading to Boca Grande comes across a bit more believable than Lucille Ball in the earlier movie. As I mentioned in my review of that one, I thought she was more of a hard luck gal than a hooker but you didn't have to read between any lines regarding Ekberg's Rena character here.Funny, but when I saw Jesse White's name in the cast list, that became one of the draws to catching this one. I didn't think I ever actually saw the long time Maytag repair man in a movie before, but there WAS that Twilight Zone episode (Once Upon a Time) in which he previewed that role. His character here is sort of a guardian for the kid Tommy, who's father made headlines as a gangster who was shot early in the film. I don't know how that scenario had anything to do with anything, other than to make Tommy an orphan and a prime candidate to make it out of the jungle when the plane got fixed.Most of the other characters play out the way they did in "Five Came Back" with the notable inclusion of a cat fight between Ekberg's character and Phyllis Kirk's Louise. As they tumble into a jungle pond, both players emerge laughing it up when co-pilot Joe Brooks (Keith Andes) comes on the scene. Considering how the fight started over Louise's budding romance with Joe, it didn't end up very realistic, but they must have figured the result was so outlandish they couldn't help themselves and it was just left in the story that way.With both pictures, the struggle over who makes it out of the jungle merits kudos for dramatic writing and a thoughtful exploration of character motives. The elder Spangler couple makes a brave decision, as Rod Steiger's Vasquel decides to face the consequences of staying behind in hostile territory. One can conjure up an alternative fate for Vasquel if one so desires, but it's almost certainly his personal sacrifice that inspires the closing moments of the picture.</fullReview>

Rod Steiger definitely was the highlight of this film, his performance was stellar. One comment about Robert Ryan, knowing that he was a WW2 Marine Drill instructor. The way he handled the revolver was hilarious, in one scene when he requests a fellow cast member to follow him he actually pokes him in the belly with it. If I was a former Marine I would have railed against that kind of direction. Oh well, just a B movie, but I would have thought he would handle his weapon better than that of a fellow actor in "Plan 9 From Outer Space". ROFL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent bookend to Five Came Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both of these exotic thrillers from John Farrow (father of Mia, husband of Maureen O'Sullivan) fascinated and intrigued me as a youngster. For the young people of today who might find these old movies not face paced enough, or unrealistic; something to remember - we did not have a laptop that we could open up and learn anything about anywhere in the world at any time. Our only exposure to places outside of our own hometown, USA were the Funk and Wagnal's encyclopedia- if you were fortunate enough to be able to afford it or the local library. The thought of travel to South America was exotic and unknown. Throw in the possibility of jungle cannibals, a murderer, the rugged adventurous pilots who brought people to those far away places in a still unknown to most mode of travel - the airplane - and you've got a great mix for a movie, especially if the story is good, which these are. These movies are unusual and intriguing because they are directed by the same man nearly 20 years apart and have exactly the same script, simply different actors. It's basically impossible to tell them apart. The only difference is the latter being 25 minutes longer and it has Rod Steiger, who always brings in a great performance. Even in my golden years both of these movies still stick with me after I've seen them and I've never grown weary of seeing either one. They do the one thing so many movies of today fail at their core to pull off - TELL A GOOD STORY. Generally shown a couple of times a year on TCM, both are well worth watching and have stood the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More 1950's detail was put into this expanded version of the 1939 programmer "Five Came Back" which director John Farrow helped make a cult classic due to its interesting cast, a better than average screenplay and atmospheric photography. Now, towards the end of RKO's years as a movie making studio, Farrow was back with basically the same story where really nothing changed but the year.That being said, a 1950's sexuality with the "almost spilling out of her dress" presence of Anita Ekberg, playing the mistress of a powerful businessman who suddenly kicks her to the curb. She is traveling to South America with an assorted group of troubled passengers which include an aging couple (Cameron Prud'Homme and Beaulah Bondi), a mobster's son (Jon Provost) with his reluctant caretaker ("Maytag" repairman commercial vet Jesse White), a long-separated couple desperate to marry (Keith Andes and Phyllis Kirk), and eventually the political prisoner (Rod Steiger) and the bounty man (Fred Clark at his snarkiest) on their way to Steiger's execution. Add into the fix a boozy pilot (Robert Ryan) and his co-pilot (Gene Barry) who has admired him from afar for years.The first half introduces the story of all these people and is simply a retread of what audiences had seen the year earlier in the much better "The High and the Mighty". However, once the plane crashes in the jungle (with only Bondi passing out, presumably out of shock), the film takes off as fast as the plane crashed, and the conflicts of these people stuck together in the Amazon (with a head-shrinking tribe rumored to be in the area) explodes into tensions civilization couldn't fix. Steiger's prisoner is actually the wisest man among the plane-wrecked crew, spouting wisdoms to try and keep them from killing each other. Once the plane is fixed, only some of them can return, the rest doomed to stay to take their chances with the natives who's drums are already beating.Steiger's character reminded me of Walter Slezak's Nazi villain in the 1944 Hitchcock classic "Lifeboat", the prisoner who is actually smarter than the people holding him hostage. Steiger, however, isn't using his smarts to turn everyone against each other; He's actually better in many ways than the ones living inside the law, and it is touching to see him bonding with the elderly couple who are at first shocked by his crime of being a political assassin.This film might have been a bit better had it been in color, especially since the original was in black and white. However, that doesn't keep this from being a good film, giving us a good cat-fight between Ekberg and Kirk, a seemingly hard as nails mobster with White hiding a big heart for the kid he's protecting, and an amusing villain in Clark who shows that not everybody who is on the side of the law is actually on the side of justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five Came Back from Eternity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bound for South America, buxom blonde Anita Ekberg (as Rena) ends her tenure as apparent sex play-mate for a Las Vegas bigwig; not to worry, he has two beautiful women standing sexily by, ready to assume her positions. Also headed down south are retiring professor Cameron Prud'Homme and his exacting wife Beulah Bondi (as Henry and Martha Spangler), gangster affiliated Jesse White (as Pete Boswick) and his quickly orphaned nephew Jon Provost (as Tommy Malone), plus slightly smarmy businessman Gene Barry (as Jud Ellis) and his pretty fiancée Phyllis Kirk (as Louise Melhorn). The co-pilots on our flight are possibly alcoholic Robert Ryan (as Bill Lonagan) and handsome hero-type Keith Andes (as Joe Brooks); the stewardess is Adele Mara (as Maria Alvarez)...Before the long flight, they pick up German-accented Rod Steiger (as Vasquez), on his way to execution, and armed guard Fred Clark (as Crimp). It should be no surprise the plane encounters turbulence, then the passengers are informed only four people, plus young Provost (who has "Lassie" in his future), will be able to make the trip out of an Amazon jungle, which is possibly inhabited with cannibals looking for human heads to shrink. Nasty business. Writer Richard Carroll and adapters do well in foreshadowing the shrunken head threat, as Provost is presented with one early; and later, Mr. Steiger describes the grisly process. This film is director John Farrow's re-make of his own "Five Came Back" (1939); the original film seems to be the most favored, but this one works, too.******* Back from Eternity (9/7/56) John Farrow ~ Robert Ryan, Rod Steiger, Anita Ekberg, Keith Andes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to comment on BACK FROM ETERNITY. I don't think the remake, as fine as it is, was really justified. Unless I am missing something, it does not seem an improvement over FIVE CAME BACK in any way and is virtually a shot-for-shot reproduction. Usually, a studio (in this case, RKO) will remake a property to take advantage of newer technologies-- here they could have filmed it in Technicolor but did not. Or something is re-filmed, because there might be a way to get around the production code and push the story in a slightly new direction. But Farrow, who directed both films, plays it safe. He is no Otto Preminger, and he keeps his actors rather restrained. I think the remake could have included more horror in the second half, when they are stranded in the jungle. And even a bit of science fiction might have been added, giving us a slightly different reason why their plane was forced down and who put them on that island. RKO could have ensured the remake turned out to be something a bit different, something a lot more daring, and something that was even more of a masterpiece than the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Farrow had converted to catholicism and it shows in his later works,particularly in this remake of "five came back" and even more in the follow-up "the unholy wife" (check the title) .He obviously believes in Providence , a Christian one,not that pagan one he once used in his overlooked "the night has a thousand eyes" .One of the characters plays the part of God Allmighty,deciding who's to live and who's to die.And this character is the less morally irreproachable of the lot,at least on the surface.The Thief on the Calvary."Back from Eternity" is built on the pattern which will be used ad nausea in the disaster movies of the seventies and even today: first we meet the characters (Robert Ryan is a long time coming),then the disaster(here a plane wreck) ,then the attitude of the heroes :as far Anita Ekberg is concerned,it's predictable.Farrow's main quality had always been his sense of mystery:here he excels in NOT showing the menace,headhunters Indians ,just in making us feel it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film completely surprised me the way it started out with various people all planning to take a trip on a plane, there is an old couple, a prisoner, Vasquel, (Rod Steiger) and a fallen lady Rena, (Anita Ekberg). There is even a little boy who is being cared for by a mobster who decides the last minute to catch this same plane. The pilot of this plane is Bill Lonagan, (Robert Ryan) who is a veteran pilot but is also a heavy drinker. This plane crashes into a very thick jungle where head hunters occupy this territory which most of the people have not been told about this fact. All of a sudden, the little boy asks everyone to say the "Lord's Prayer" and after this, Vasquel turns religious and many people seem to change their thinking and the way they treat each other. Of course, there is evil vs. good among some of these people and this story goes into a completely different direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad B movie, but why did they remake it? I suppose because it's cheaper to recycle stories that the studio already owns than to buy new ones. Even the title seems designed by a bricoleur. ("From Here to Eternity" (1953) to "Back From Eternity" (1956).)The director is the same and so is the story but, alas, the pace is slower and heavier. In the original, no time was wasted on padding. The actors spoke their lines quickly, as if rushing through them to save a few frames of expensive film stock. This one carries with it a kind of languid lack of energy, as if everyone involved in the production had caught yellow fever. More time is spent on romance and less on practical matters.Further, we get more emphasis on a few of the characters who must explain their current state of disillusion or develop their growing love for one another. It's less of an ensemble movie than the 1939 version. Just two examples. Robert Ryan gets far more screen time than Chester Morris did in the same role. And Gene Barry's role as the spoiled, cowardly, rich drunk is reduced to a few nasty lines.And the evolution of the group's self consciousness is weakened by the absence of a montage in the original, in which we see everyone working happily away at their tasks, laughing and getting to know each other. There is no such animation here, only fatigue.Robert Ryan's part, the pilot, is given greater emphasis but his specialty is doing an impression of a boiler whose valves are closed and which is just about to explode at the seams. And here he more or less walks through the part, unusual for him because of his inherent dynamism. Rod Steiger is more important than Joseph Callaeia in the original too. The old professor is no longer the expert on Jivaro headhunting. Steiger is now the authority. That's fine for Steiger, but it leaves the elderly professor twisting in the wind. Just exactly what the hell does he TEACH anyway? Nobody seems to care.In some ways this film makes more of an impression than the earlier one. The airplane is bigger, for instance, as are Anita Ekberg's bosoms. And it has one or two unforgettable scenes. The beautiful, wooden Phyllis Kirk helping the guys heave the airplane off the ground, tottering in the middle of the Amazon jungle in her chic outfit and high heels. Kirk and Ekberg having a heck of a good time fighting in a studio-bound pool of jungle water, unable to stop from laughing as they wrestle and bat at each other. Come to think of it, any normal man wouldn't mind joining the fight. How about some mud and bikinis in the NEXT remake?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise has inbuilt suspense?a passenger plane crash lands in a head-hunter infested jungle, leading to who will survive and how. This version, however, fails to generate the suspense of the 1939 original. For one, the 100-minute screenplay here is not as tight as the 75-minute Five Came Back (1939). The extra 25-minutes flattens out in too many places. Plus, the many relationship threads do not coordinate well. At the same time, the jungle photography is muddy in the extreme, probably to disguise the sets. Then there's a significant lapse in the narrative when the boy wanders off into the jungle and we're shown a headhunter observing him. Yet the boy returns to camp unharmed, without explanation. That's not to say this version is without merits. The lightning storm, for one, including Adele Mara's quick exit without a ladder, for another. It's also thought provoking to see how conditions affect character. Specifically, the outcasts from larger society (Ekberg &amp; Steiger) redeem themselves in crisis, while establishment types (Clark &amp; Barry) diminish without their usual supporting conditions. There seems to be a societal allegory here of some significance, (check my review of Five Came Back for an extended discussion).Anyway, thanks reviewer bkoganbing for the background info. Too bad this remake doesn't improve on the original. But then the original didn't have to compete with TV by offering a longer run time, two girls mud wrestling, and a top-heavy non-actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Remake of the 1939 classic "Five Came Home" by the same director John Farrow with Rod Steiger stealing the acting honors as convicted criminal Vasquez being sent back to Boca Grande, in Pararico, to face the firing squad for the attempted murder of the country's dictator General Gomaz.Getting caught in a violent lightning storm over the unexplored jungles of South America the PLA passenger plane, minus it's stewardess who fell overboard, crash lands with it's engines in operation but in the middle of headhunter country. Trying to get the plane fixed before the local headhunters get a beat on the planes passengers and crew tempers start to flair between bounty hunter Crimp, Fread Clark, and his prisoner Vasquez. Crimp is a bit taken by the change of events with Vasquez now the man who's in charge, since Vasquez is an expert on the habits of the South American headhunters, not him starts to panic. Crimp ends up running off in the unfriendly jungle with the only gun among the people on the plane and ends up losing his head over it. As the days go by it becomes evident that there's no rescue party on the way to save them and both the pilot and co-pilot Bill Lonagan &amp; Joe Brooks, Robert Ryan &amp; Kieth Andes, work around the clock fixing the planes engines. Everything possibly is done to get the plane airborne before the drums start to beat meaning that the headhunters are on their way to finish off the planes survivors.Tense drama in the South American Amazon basin with a stellar cast knowing that the end is near but not exactly who among them will end up being killed by the headhunters. It's decided that only five will come back since the planes engines can't carry any more weight. The disabled airplane has to have as light as possible a payload in order to take off and fly over the dense jungle mountain range to become fully airborne. Gut-wrenching final where it's decided who will live and who will die, by being left behind, at the hands of the headhunters and for the most part Vasquez and the elderly couple Henry &amp; Martha Spangler, Cameron Prud'Homm &amp; Beula Bondi voluntarily stay behind to meet their fate. The Spanglers, in their 70's, knowing that they don't have long to live anyway and Vasquez facing execution. The movie "Back from Eternity" also has a love triangle between Jud Ellis, Gene Barry, and his fiancé Louise Melhorn, Phillis Kirk, and co-pilot Joe Brooks. The poor and terrified Jud ends up coming out on the losing end. Jud gets gunned down, trying to get on the plane, at the end of the movie by Vasquez with his bride-to-be Louise not bothering to come to his aid but not even giving Jud as much a second glance as he lay dying! There's also the gorgeous and voluptuous Anita Ekberg, the former Miss Sweden, as singer and bar girl Rena who's trying to get her papers straighten out in order to become a legal American citizen. There's also little six year old Jon Provost, of Lassie fame, as Tommy Malone the son of a Las Vegas mobster who just got knocked off. Tommy is being looked after and protected by his late dad's best friend and right hand man Jesse white, Pete Boswick. It turns out that Rena, not Jesse, ends up on the departing plane with little Tommy as the movie "Back From Eternity" comes to an end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farrow Remakes His Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back from Eternity (1956) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Director Farrow joins a small group of filmmakers who were able to remake one of their earlier pictures and this here is pretty much the same story he told in FIVE CAME BACK. The story is pretty simple as a group of people have their plane crash in a South American jungle where they try to survive not only the elements but the possible threat of attack by some natives. They finally catch a couple breaks to where they might be able to get the plane in working order but then they're confronted with a bigger choice on who will get to leave. I can understand why Farrow decided to remake his earlier picture as he made it clear that he thought the special effects could improve the film. I watched FIVE CAME BACK a few years earlier and thought it was a decent little film but I remember thinking that at just 75-minutes there wasn't enough time devoted to the characters to make us really care about them. That is something changed here because the first forty-five minutes is completely devoted to the characters but I think they go a bit overboard. While the remake gives us a lot of character development the majority of it is just boring melodrama stuff that we've seen in countless other disaster pictures. You have the bad guy (Rod Steiger) on his way to a firing squad. You have the pilot (Robert Ryan) who is hiding a dark secret. You got the sexy blonde (Anita Ekberg) who is running towards a questionable job. You have an elderly couple (Beulah Bondi, Cameron Homme) trying to enjoy their final years. You have a young couple (Phyllis Kirk, Gene Berry) who find themselves constantly fighting. We've seen these characters so many times in so many movies that you really don't feel that connected to them. Another problem is that pretty much nothing happens in terms of suspense until the final ten-minutes. At 100-minutes this film takes a long time getting to the conclusion and when it finally does come there's some nice drama but why they didn't try to have a few threats earlier in the picture is beyond me. Performances are good for the most part as all the actors fit their parts nicely and that includes Steiger and that Spanish accent. Farrow mixes in a few new scenes including two of the women fighting in a lake, which really seems out of place and another silly scene involving a crime boss. This RKO picture was hampered with a low-budget, which prevented the crash from being that good but then again I've seen worse. Both FIVE CAME BACK and BACK TO ETERNITY are interesting films but neither one really rises to a level to where I'd call them good. If I had to pick I'd probably go with the original as being the better movie but I think film buffs will enjoy watching both and seeing what Farrow tried to change and improve nearly twenty-years after his first attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faintly disappointing remake of "Five Came Back".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film director to remake one of his own movies is a fairly rare occurrence, but that's not to say it hasn't happened down the years. Cecil B DeMille made two versions of The Ten Commandments (1923 and 1956); Alfred Hitchcock made two versions of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 and 1956); The Vanishing was also done twice by George Sluizer (1988 and 1993).Back From Eternity marks the turn of John Farrow to join this select band of movie makers who have remade one of their own pictures. In this case, Farrow resurrects his 1939 philosophical jungle adventure Five Came Back, but his purpose in doing so is never particularly clear. Indeed, in most aspects this film is actually INFERIOR to its predecessor. Yes, there are occasional moving and exciting moments?. but on the whole it should have been a lot better.A plane flying across South America runs into difficulties during a freak storm and crash lands in the jungle. The pilot Bill Lonagan (Robert Ryan) and his co-pilot Joe Brooks (Keith Andes) reckon they can fix the damaged aircraft, at least partially, but unfortunately for the passengers it's not just a simple case of sitting around waiting for the plane to be repaired. Gradually they come to realise that they're in cannibal country, with a tribe of headhunters preparing to close in for the kill. Things get even worse when the pilots announce they'll only be able to take five passengers aboard the plane ? any more will make it impossible to take off due to the weakened engines. Tensions boil as the group debate and argue over who should go and who should stay to face horrible and certain death?..Back From Eternity definitely has a strong cast, with Ryan doing solid work as the pilot with a booze addiction and Rod Steiger in splendid form as a Death Row criminal among their number. Keith Andes makes a surprisingly big impression too as the co-pilot who gets involved in a love triangle. The plot automatically throws up fascinating philosophical questions about the value of life. How can you say one life is more precious than another? How would YOU persuade your way aboard the makeshift plane if you were in those circumstances? Is there a purely methodical way of choosing five worthy survivors? and would there be any way of avoiding the inevitable emotional implications when making such a choice? Unfortunately, though, these inherent philosophical ideas don't make for as engrossing a picture as you might expect. Maybe it's the wordy and over-extended script, or maybe it's the silly extraneous details (e.g a needless love triangle, an exploitative female swamp-wrestling scene, etc.), but Back From Eternity just never quite fulfils its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not particularly inspired remake of another Farrow film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am fortunate enough to have seen both this movie and the original version (FIVE CAME BACK)--both of which were directed by John Farrow. So it was in light of this that I felt pretty disappointed in this film--even though it stars Robert Ryan (one of my favorite actors). Most of it is because there just didn't seem to be a reason for the remake--in no way did it really seem like an improvement over the old material. Instead, it was actually worse and by the mid-1950s, it hardly seemed very original (coming just after John Wayne's THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY). I think that a lot of the problem is that the ensemble cast just didn't seem all that good and there was no gimmick to hook the viewer (other than Anita Ekberg's breasts--which feature quite prominently in this film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Five Came Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recorded both "Five Came Back" and "Back From Eternity" with not a clue what they were about when they came on one day.Imagine my surprise to see "Back From Eternity" was a remake of "Five Came Back".Note the second title "Back From Eternity" and how similar it is to "From Here To Eternity".Virtually identical to the original in plot, twelve people on a plane that crashes in cannibal territory, only five can return, but who will it be?Granted, the outcome is predictably unique. In this remake, we get Rod Steiger "delivering a performance" especially at the end.The one standout moment was during the crash.Two air tanks would break lose and were thrown against the door, bursting it open. The flight attendant was pulled out after them. How tragic!In the original, the flight attendant was a woman. In the remake, it is a man.We couldn't figure that one out.</fullReview>
