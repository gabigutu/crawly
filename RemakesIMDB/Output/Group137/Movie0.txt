		<fullReview>Five Came Back may not be the best B picture ever made, but it is a superior example of one, almost in a way the ideal B in terms of what's done with the subject matter. It's a standard enough story of several people stuck in an isolated setting,--in this case the jungles of South America--and how they cope with their predicament. The story is similar to the one in The Lost Patrol, and is similar to many war movies such as Bataan and Sahara; it was even remade (badly) by the same director, John Farrow, many years later under a different title. A plane carrying twelve people crashes in the jungle. After looking over the damage it is determined that the plane can be made to fly again, but it can carry no more than five people. The problem is that not too far off is a tribe of head-hunting Indians; whoever is left behind will almost certainly face a horrible death. Eventually the passengers' numbers are whittled down by various factors, and the character who seemed early on the most sinister undergoes a remarkable transformation. This is not a deep movie, nor, as a study in character is it remarkable, though the characters are far better realized than in most films, let alone second features like this one. I can't help but think that Five Came Back was designed as a sort of small or experimental A picture. It was a surprise hit when it came out and put director Farrow on the map in Hollywood. But he was an up and comer anyway, a screenwriter and husband to actress Maureen O'Sullivan. Although leading man Chester Morris had pretty much become a B actor by this time, he is fine as usual (one can easily imagine Clark Gable playing the role in a Metro A version). Lucille Ball has a good part, and so does Allen Jenkins, much softer than usual here. C. Aubrey Smith is prominently featured, which again makes me wonder just how B this picture really is. The jungle setting, like the story, is quite obviously artificial, which is no way detracts from the film, since we expect fake jungles in thirties movies anyway. Overall, the technical side of the movie is more than good enough, and since RKO produced it, there is a special quality here hard to pin down; for want of a better term I'll call it artistic, as opposed to slick, which is what most studio movies were. This artistic aspect of the film gives it a gravitas that it almost certainly wouldn't have had had it been made elsewhere. It's a good show, thoughtful and moving at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in 1939 when I was eight years old... and had never forgotten it! I viewed it again a few years back and enjoyed it as much if not more than the first time.I was very much surprised when seeing it again I realized that the tough talking "shady lady" that I remembered so well turned out to be Lucille Ball. I was totally unaware (knowing her only as a comedienne) that she had the range to play this type of character... and play it well at that!Growing up as a "Boston Blackie" fan, I have always loved Chester Morris in any role, and he was certainly fine here as the planes Captain. I also admired Allen Jenkins role as the tough gangster who looked after his boss' son with unswerving loyalty and kindness. It was a departure from his usual gangster roles.In short, if you're looking for an Academy Award movie... you won't find it here. Sure as one reviewer stated, its' somewhat predictable... sure its' not a big budget production... but it's very well done none the less.Bottom line? If you just want a very watchable movie with a little drama, a little action and a lot of emotion, do yourself a favor and rent it or catch it on TV if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rated this film as a very good B picture when I first saw it 50 years ago - but having seen the remake "Flight to Eternity" (which was not too bad!), the original has gone higher in my estimation. The cast was much better and the effects were just as good as the remake, which is saying a lot when one considers the years in between. The good old stand -by actors like John Carradine, C. Aubrey Smith and Elizabeth Risdon gave it a bit of class, while Chester Morris had his best role, Lucille Ball and Wendy Barrie were surprisingly good, and Joseph Calleia made a good bad guy. This is one of the very few B pictures made so many years ago that has really stood up well, and if you get the chance to see it on Video or on TV, do not miss it - it is most entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small plane, flying over the untracked reaches of the Amazon, crash lands into the jungle. Twelve people are on board - eleven survive. Even if the plane can take-off again, which is far from certain, there is only fuel enough to carry five to safety. Who will leave and who will stay to face certain death from the watching headhunters? Who would you choose?Thus the premise of this fine little adventure thriller, in which we get to know the eleven very well. Some will rise to nobility &amp; self-sacrifice, others will sink to cruel cowardice.In the cast: Lucille Ball, Chester Morris, Wendy Barrie, Patric Knowles, John Carradine, Allen Jenkins, Joseph Calleia &amp; Sir C. Aubrey Smith.Time grows short. The tension mounts. Who will survive?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers - Like the other critics, I have to say that this is not a great movie. After all, it is a 'B' film. But like Bob Griese, it gets maximum mileage out of an average arm. I love this movie. Joseph Calleia is superb as the revolutionary. Does he go through a transformation? No. The Spenglers simply bring out the best in him. Being educated and experienced in life, the elderly couple is able to understand and appreciate Mr. Vasquez. This is a highly-principled man who acts on his convictions and the Spenglers are attracted to that. While the young heir (played very well by Patric Knowles) is closer to them socially, the prevailing circumstances cause the decency of the Spenglers to repel him. The heir is so selfish he cannot even see their revulsion for him. The Spenglers give Mr. Vasquez a good world and justify his existence. "If there were more men like you, Mister Spengler", says Vasquez, "there would be less men like me." Over the years, the Vasquez character has remained a role model for me. The height of decency is reached when Mr. Vasquez announces the bullet count, thus sparing the Spenglers of any unnecessary grief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Closer Look at the Political Subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot. Despite the recognizably stock characters (resourceful pilots, fallen woman, respectable woman, et al.), there's something nightmarish about the movie as a whole. Maybe it's the succession of calamities filmed in nourish shadow that's so unsettling. Certainly the jungle creates an exotic air, which could only have been done on a sound stage and in "artistic" fashion as one reviewer sagely observes. Then too, such compelling values only emerge in b&amp;w, with its angular shadows and shades of gray?the stuff of nightmares. Actually, the plot with its character types undergoing the rigors of survival rather resembles the John Ford classic of the same year, Stagecoach (1939).One interesting angle is what the movie reveals about the politics and changing perceptions of the rebellious Depression Era. The passengers and crew divide basically into two camps following the crash?those who join the collective effort to survive and those who don't. Tellingly, three types of traditional rejects?the fallen woman (Ball), the underworld character (Jenkins), and the political radical (Calleia)-- join in and help the collective effort. In fact, the radical sees this cooperative group as a small-scale embodiment of his (socialist?) aims and has no desire to return to "civilization". At the same time, two category types don't join in or help. Also tellingly, both types represent what can be called the "establishment" of the day? the rich man's son (Knowles) and the cruel cop (Carradine). Each stays aloof from the others. Naturally we're led to sympathize with the other group, the collective, since it includes the obviously "good" people?the pilots, the professor and wife, and the boy, (Barries' respectable woman is more ambiguous since she's initially allied with Knowles).The fact that the "rejects" join into what might be called the new "cooperative society" implies that they only became rejects because of problems in the old society that Knowles and Carradine represent. As part of a new social fabric, their "truer" characters can be understood to emerge and in positive fashion. Ironically, each is given a new lease on life because of the crash and the new social relations that emerge. In contrast are those who don't join in. As a privileged offspring of the wealthy class, Knowles persists in the selfishly indulgent habits (boozing) he's used to, while Carradine's abusive cop can't adjust to his loss of authority in the new societal set-up. On his own, neither of the two can survive the new circumstances, which is Carradine's fate, alone in the jungle, while the helpless Knowles again becomes a parasite on the work of others.Now, I don't think the movie stands as a full-blown allegory of the time; however, there's enough resemblance between the character types and national political trends to draw certain parallels. Clearly, Knowles and Carradine parallel the pre-New Deal establishment of entrenched wealth, seen here as parasitical, cruel and resistant to the more cooperative New Deal society ( e.g. creation of social safety net; rise of worker rights). The plane crash mirrors the stock market crash (1929) in removing the power base of the old regime and casting its two survivors adrift, but at the same time, creating fresh opportunities for change. Of course, radical political thought (socialist, communist, anarchist) was more prominent than usual during the unstable Depression and is treated sympathetically in the character of Calleia. He not only commits an act of noble self-sacrifice, but also shapes the future by deciding who stays and who goes. It's also revealing that he and the professor who "understands" him form a bond, paralleling the New Deal's alliance with the academically based Brain Trust that guided administration policy. Both men are seen in the movie as sacrificing themselves for a better future for others.We can't be sure what the future for the Five who come back will be, and I agree that the movie ends too abruptly. The parallels also trail off at this point, though Jenkins' softened underworld character could stand-in for the public's general deference toward bank robbers in particular (Dillinger, Bonnie &amp; Clyde). To me, Ball's shady lady has no particular 30's parallel, though I may have missed something. Where the allegory really breaks down is with the conspicuous absence in the movie of a working class counterpart. Of course, worker demands are what drove societal change during the Depression period. In the movie, the pilots might qualify, but they're really more non-partisan technicians than driving agents of change. In a sense, the counterpart doesn't emerge until after the plane crash when the good people go to work.I suppose it's not surprising that the movie slants in an anti-establishment direction given Dalton Trumbo's participation as a writer. Later blacklisted as one of the vilified Hollywood Ten, Trumbo made no secret of his radical alignment, and I suspect the parallels in the film reflect many of his leftish sympathies. However that may be, the movie provides both a suspenseful drama and a telling glimpse of changing politics and perceptions, and is well worth catching up with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well crafted, thoughtful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never tire of seeing this film. "Five Came Back" has a reasonably simple premise: twelve passengers and crew on an airliner flying from the United States to Panama are stranded in a remote South American rain forest after a storm drives their aircraft off course. They must struggle to survive in this harsh wilderness and repair their crippled aircraft before the local headhunters get them.The film follows the profound impact the crash and its aftermath has on each of the characters. Performances are solid and motivations, though obvious, are logical and well presented. This film has a lot working for it, not the least of which is an excellent cast and fine director and screenplay. For those interested in a classic drama with a touch of suspense and adventure, "Five Came Back" is a wonderful choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice and Suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago in New York City I saw the re-make of this film Back from Eternity which was broadcast on WOR TV's Million Dollar movie program. For most of you too young to remember WOR was an RKO station and had access at the time to the entire RKO film library. Films would be run as much as five times a day for a week, like a movie theater.Back from Eternity was fine, but Five Came Back was really something special. Fortunately RKO had those old King Kong jungle sets and used them for this film. Cut down the cost considerably.No big names in the cast either. Lucille Ball was not a big name at the time she made it and she's light years from Lucy Ricardo in this. She's a cynical good time gal who's been hurt by one man too many. Chester Morris started the sound era in some A product at MGM, but now was at the B picture level. But they and the rest of the cast nicely fill their roles.The plot is simple. Morris and co-pilot Kent Taylor are flying a small passenger airline over South America and are forced down in the middle of a rain forest. Some patch work repairs are done. But the plane won't get off the ground with a full load. Some choices have to be made. But because Joseph Calleia gets a hold of a gun he winds up making the choices. He's a political prisoner being taken to his execution, escorted by policeman John Carradine. With native headhunters all around and them having killed a couple of the passengers already, time is critical.It's a good film, but if you see either this one or the remake it will be spoiled should you have an opportunity to see the other later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The last time I saw this movie was over 40 years ago when it was aired on the Million Dollar Movie on channel 9 in NYC. Some of you may remember the Million Dollar Movie - on Saturday and Sunday they would play the same movie continually all afternoon. We kids would watch any number of movies over and over.The one I remember the most is Five Came Back. What a great movie. Even though it has been more than 40 years since I've seen it, I can still remember the great ending: the tough guy (who was not really the bad guy he let on to be) being asked by the elderly husband to shoot him and his wife rather than face the terror of the head-hunters waiting in the shadows. And the tough guy agreeing and telling the old man he had 3 bullets left in his revolver to take care of them all (when the audience sees there are only two). He shoots the couple as they clasp in their final embrace and bravely awaits his fate as the scene fades out. Wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve passengers in a twin-engine plane crash-land in a rain forest just east of the Andes. While the two pilots attempt to fix the aircraft, the travelers get to know each other. Fast-paced drama rolls right along, with the usual cast introductions handled this time with flair and flip sarcasm (Lucille Ball, apparently playing a tart, keeps getting put down by the others but takes all the criticism in stride!). Film is extremely compact, but this hinders it in the end as the final sequence doesn't feel fully played-out and the last shots are disappointing. Otherwise, well-scripted (Dalton Trumbo and Nathanael West are just two of the writers credited), acted with high style and briskly directed by John Farrow, who later remade this story as "Back From Eternity". *** from ****</fullReview>

It was a black and white movie made 62 years ago and I found it better than lots of new movies. My wife hates old b/w movies but when I read her the storyline she agreed to watch it with me and surprisingly she liked it.

		<shortDescription>Another winner from Hollywood's golden year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite wonderful little B picture that shows the strengths of the studio system. Being shot on a low budget with a director, writers and actors under contract this and many, many others could be churned out economically and at low cost. Because of those facts studios would turn out many small pictures, some real stinkers but occasionally a gem like this.The story of a set of disparate people trapped in a confined situation isn't a new one, nor was it in 1939 but though quick pacing, a solid screenplay and a talented cast this manages to stand above the usual second string fodder fed to theatres to complete a double bill.All the performers, some falling stars like Chester Morris some rising like Lucy and some reliable standbys such as Allen Jenkins, are terrific but of course some stronger then others. C. Aubrey Smith and Elisabeth Risdon as a couple grown apart through their years together but who reconnect during their trials have the most beautiful chemistry, they truly feel like long time marrieds. The other outstanding performer is Joseph Calleia as the condemned Vasquez. Most well known as a vicious bad guy he is cast similarly in this but with a twist. He's a killer but humane with an intellectual bent, his is probably the film's best performance. The most famous person in the film now but just another starlet at the time is of course Lucille Ball. If you only know her as that wacky redhead from TV this is a good place to start to acquaint yourself with her filmography. Having worked her way up from bits and extra work to a showcase role in Stage Door and then B-level leading lady roles she displays some of her signature sass but also gives a fine non-jokey performance as a woman of questionable repute.The picture's quality was recognized at the time of its release turning the modest film into a huge money earner in respect to its budget. Farrow returned to the material about fifteen years later and reworked it slightly into the remake Back from Eternity. That is a decent film also but missing a certain something that makes the original stand out. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five Came Back from Eternity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Passengers get ready for the ill-fated flight foreshadowed in the film's title "Five Came Back". Handsome businessman Patric Knowles (as Judson Ellis) and pretty blonde secretary Wendy Barrie (as Alice Melbourne) are going to elope. Looking like either a movie star or a classy call girl, beautiful Lucille Ball (as Peggy Nolan) wants to straighten up and fly right. Elderly botany professor C. Aubrey Smith and his wife Elisabeth Risdon (as Henry and Martha Spengler) want to enjoy their twilight years. As his gangster father is threatened with extinction, cute little Casey Johnson (as Tommy Mulvaney) is shuttled to safety with henchman uncle Allen Jenkins (as Pete)...Veteran airman Chester Morris (and Bill Brooks) and co-pilot Kent Taylor (as Joe) announce a slight delay when they are asked to take on detective John Carradine (as Crimp) and his prisoner Joseph Calleia (as Vasquez)...When the plane crashes in an Amazon jungle thought to be inhabited by hungry head-hunters, the crew must chose only five passengers to return home on their rickety, repaired plane. The director, John Farrow, re-made this as "Back from Eternity" in 1956. The later film has a stronger script, but with performances becoming overly obvious. Here, the swiftness highlights subtlety; for example, note the impassionate love between Mr. Knowles and Ms. Barrie, then how Mr. Taylor telegraphs his interest. The more toned-down tart played by Ms. Ball is superior, but lacks detail. You're well off seeing both versions as they make up for things lacking in each other.******* Five Came Back (6/23/39) John Farrow ~ Chester Morris, Lucille Ball, Joseph Calleia, Patric Knowles</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see prototype for "stranded" ensemble movies. Excellent script and crisp direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very enjoyable thriller, with a strong ensemble cast. Distinguished by great actors who make the most of their small roles. I was specially impressed by Lucille Ball, surprisingly serious in the role of the "bad woman", and very attractive. John Carradine also shines as the contemptible bounty hunter and Joseph Calleia as his insightful and wise death row prisoner. The budget was very low and the sets show, but John Farrow's direction is very brisk and keeps the suspense and interest up through the short running time. Great dialogue, very well written exchanges between the characters, unsurprising given the three great talents on the script. The rhythm of the film benefits from the crisp timing: if they remade the movie today, it would probably be twice as long, and less interesting.An example for disaster and stranded dramas to come. One of the most memorable classics of the thirties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early example of all-star suspense/disaster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five Came Back is probably the first major example of a suspense disaster film about a plane crash with an all-star cast, filmed 30 years before Airport, and still gripping. It also features one of Lucille Ball's first major roles, and is one of the few movies you can find starring Chester Morris, who was a popular star in those days (he played Boston Blackie in a series of B-movies in the '40s). Morris and Kent Taylor are pilots of an airliner flying assorted passengers to South America. Included on board are an anarchist (Joseph Calleia) being extradited by a mercenary (John Carradine); a wealthy society playboy (Patrick Knowles) and his secret fiancée (Wendy Barrie); a retiring botanist (C. Aubrey Smith) and his wife (Elizabeth Risdon); a small boy in the care of a gangster (Allen Jenkins); and of course Lucille Ball in a serious role. In a violent storm the plane is forced to crash-land in the Amazon jungle, and they all ten survive the landing, but as the title hints, a suspenseful situation arises as they attempt to repair the plane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five didn't come back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interestingly, the film ends on the non-survivors. The average viewer knows that the women and children had to be saved, and the screenwriters have made sure the much-less valuable characters die off-- the boy's uncle, the playboy, the man facing prosecution, and the elderly couple. So in that regard, it is all morally correct. Plus, don't overlook the fact the writers manage to stay clear of cannibalism. Still, I think there are ways the story could have been improved. We should have seen more with the pilots trying to fix the plane and the frustration of it taking so long to salvage the wrecked aircraft. We should have seen the rescue team attempt to find them. And we should have seen the natives-- after all, wasn't it a bit too convenient that the natives did not become a problem until after the eighteenth day? And why wasn't there any discussion that once the first five returned safely that they might help the rescue team go back to get the other five?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I've been in trouble before, but nothing like this."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm happy to say it was worth the effort to get up early this morning to catch this nifty programmer on Turner Classics. I was drawn to the title when I scanned the cable listings and saw Lucille Ball's name in the cast. Her character was described as an ex-prostitute in the brief description of the film, but if I hadn't read that, I don't know if I would have drawn that conclusion from watching the story. She portrays hard luck gal Peggy Nolan who happens to mention that she's had trouble with men in the past, but that could mean anything. Anyway, I've always thought she was a gorgeous actress prior to her Lucy days, and so you've got another picture here that bears that out, particularly in her first appearance on screen looking like a well to do society woman.The story utilizes an often used plot in which an airplane goes down in bad weather and crash lands in a remote jungle setting. The passengers on board come from various walks of life, including an 'anarchist' (Joseph Calleia) being escorted to his home country to face execution by hanging. As the story progresses, I got the impression that the writers were expressing a social and political statement with the motivations of their characters, and to get an excellent overview of those dimensions I would direct you to the review on this board by 'dougdoepke'; it's very well reasoned and articulated.For those of you just looking for a good picture, there's that too. There are some confusing elements though that distracted from the story a little for me. For example, it was mentioned that the crash took place in the Amazon, but if the flight's original destination was Panama City, the plane would never have gotten near South America. Then there's that business about jungle headhunters, and I'm not up on my headhunter lore, but that just didn't strike me as credible. I'll look it up though.Some of the character turns in the picture are predictable enough. Pilot Bill Brooks (Chester Morris) assumes leadership of the stranded group with an able assist from co-pilot Kent Taylor. Under pressure, affluent businessman Ellis (Patric Knowles) takes to the bottle and has a falling out with fiancée Alice Melbourne (Wendy Barrie). Perhaps the most interesting couple in the mix are the Spenglers (C. Aubrey Smith and Elisabeth Risdon), adjusting to their situation with an admirable grace and equanimity knowing that they may never make it back to civilization. If there's a twist to the story, it's the way villain Vasquez (Calleia) emerges to shape the outcome when it becomes clear that the repaired plane can only depart with a total of five on board. He argues for a logical decision to choose who'll survive, reasoning that otherwise, the 'wrong people might win'. Interestingly, I would have picked the same players to make it back home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low budget film that tells a great story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems when reviewing film made prior to 1980 the most common thread between them is that they knew how to tell a good story. Five Came Back, a RKO low-budget film, does that brilliantly - tells a great story. At the time of it's release in the 30's, the Amazon seemed a dream-like far away place. All one knew of foreign lands was what was printed in the Funk and Wagnalls, if you were fortunate enough to own one. So this group of travelers take off for a far off land and the plane crashes in the Amazon. What evolves is an excellent telling of human character. How each person's true personality comes forth as the rigors of being isolated in a jungle takes it's toll. I loved both this film - the original and the later remake, which didn't really change the story at all. This is one of the really good films from the 30's I wished I owned on DVD. I think it's a fine film to share with your children. Well acted, well made, and has a great message as well. Don't miss this one if you can catch it on TCM.</fullReview>

Among those on the plane are wanted criminal Joseph Calleia, tired party girl Lucille Ball, socialite Wendy Barrie and elderly couple C. Aubrey Smith and Elisabeth Risdon. They are lead by pilot Chester Morris who tries to keep it all together.Tense and often nail biting, this ranks as one of RKO's best B movies. It shows future funny girl Lucille Ball off to be quite a fine dramatic actress which makes me wonder what her career might have been like had she not moved into radio then T.V. to gain a reputation as a comic. Smith and Risfon are touching as a devoted, long married couple with issues of their own, reminding me of Ida and Isador Strauss from the "Titanic" legend. A pretty decent remake, "Back From Eternity" came out during the last days of RKO and is well worth seeing too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising Gem and Familiar Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pleasant surprise of a film! It has a common theme of surviving a disaster (in this case, a plane crash but other themes might be shipwreck or being stranded in the desert) and trying to survive against all odds. Not everyone can make it out so it's a study in character and sacrifice. The jungles are lush and the natives are a bit stereotyped, however back then I think not due to the producers and directors but to captivate a less sophisticated audience. With Lucille Ball, John Carradine in early roles, it's a curiosity and well-acted. The budget was small and it's called a B movie, but in many ways, it's not. 8 for acting and plot/influence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't crash in the jungle!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twelve people set off on a plane for South America. Unfortunately, the plane crashes and eleven of them are now stranded in the middle of a jungle inhabited by a tribe of head-shrinkers. The only hope of survival is to repair the plane and fly out. However, the plane can only take five..........who goes and who stays behind..?...This story integrates all the characters so that we have a clear idea of who they are and allows us to make our choices of who we want to survive. The cast are all good, whether portraying cowards or villains, and you can spot "Officer Dibble" from "Top Cat" in there. The story centres around the efforts of the group as they form relationships and pull together in order to save themselves while native bad guys move closer and closer. My favourite characters were Professor Spengler and his wife (played by C Aubrey Smith and Elisabeth Risdon) and the revolutionary anarchist who is facing the death penalty, Vasquez (Joseph Calleia), who ultimately has an important role to play in deciding who goes and who stays. The film has a memorable and touching ending......."..when she's not looking..."...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid "B" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often the smaller "B" pictures were better than the expensive "A" pictures that they frequently were shown with. "Five Came Back" is a perfect example of that. This film has excellent pacing, fine performances from everyone, especially C. Aubrey Smith and Lucille Ball. It is one of her best film performances. The story is solid and always interesting, it's well photographed and the character development is outstanding. Finely written with crisp dialog. The film is very memorable as well, with an ending you won't easily forget. John Farrow's direction is definitely a plus, and it is a good example of his flair for direction toward the beginning of his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilligan's Island in the Amazon, with an airplane.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping for even better, given that the screenplay was written by (forgetting Jerome Cady) the formidable Dalton Trumbo (Lonely are The Brave, Papillon, etc.) and truly great Nathanael West. In fact, this movie came out the same year, 1939, as West's masterpiece, "The Day of the Locust," so he must have worked on them simultaneously to some extent.No wonder it's a good screenplay, especially for a B movie. Although the plot is formulaic, there's no shortage of surprises, or terse observations, and director John Farrow keeps it clipping along, at least until the rather abrupt ending. We're short-changed on John Carradine, who's hardly in it, but that's compensated for by plenty of C. Aubrey Smith (as the Professor), Wendy Barrie (Mary Ann), Patrick Knowles (young Thurston Howell), Lucille Ball (Ginger), and particularly by a key character named Vasquez, played by a Maltese actor named Joseph Calleia, whom I'd never heard of though he was in almost 60 films.It's a must for any fan of Nathanael West, who ultimately contributed to only about a dozen movies before his death in 1940.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crash survivors battle Ur-shrinks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a kind of likable, fast, black-and-white, Grand Hotel, airplane-in-peril movie. You see, there are eleven people of varied background who board a passenger airplane, which crashes in the Amazon jungle, and only five people can be flown out when the plane is repaired and takes off again. Of the passengers, the two pilots are robust no-nonsense types, there is a little kid, an elderly couple, a mobster, a murderer being flown back to be hanged, a drunken nasty detective, and a rich young couple made up of a nice young lady and a spoiled guy who turns into a cowardly lout. Oh -- and there's a whore with a heart of gold. Just an average group of a dozen or so people you might pick out at random from the streets of Los Angeles.I suppose you think you know the trajectory of the plot. Well, in this case it so happens that all the bad guys survive and fly to safety, while all the moral self-sacrificing embodiments of noble middle-class values are left to be tortured and have their heads shrunk by the Jivaro natives. Just kidding.Actually it turns out pretty much as you'd expect but there are interesting twists and turns along the way. There's nothing much to be said about the performances. The characters are cardboard. The picture is studio bound, meaning that no jungle ever looked quite so well laid out. The end is predictable. The intelligent design behind it looks suspiciously like Darwinism.But it's an unpretentious and enjoyable old movie. Considering the budget, it's nicely done. The scenes in the passenger cabin during the storm are particularly neat -- junk falling all over the place, tanks of gas breaking loose and rolling about, a steward sucked out the open door while saving the kid. The old professor gets the details of Jivaro head shrinking accurately. They were mean folks. Not the meanest though -- that accolade generally goes to the Aymara of Chile -- but mean enough. It all flows along smoothly to its sad but inevitable end. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Law of the Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Early disaster-like movie that has some dozen or so people stranded in the dangerous head-hunter infested and uncharted South American jungle after their plane crash landed in a violent tropical storm.With only enough food and drinking water to last for about a month the plane passengers try to fix the disabled plane so that they can fly out of the valley that their stuck in before the head-hunters get a lock on them and move in for the kill.The movie "Five came Back" has an unlikely hero in the person of convicted assassin and anarchist Vasques, Joesph Calleia. Vasques is was to be brought back to Panama by bounty hunter Mr. Chimp, John Carradine,to be hung for his crimes against that country's leadership. We get to see Vasquez lose his hostility to humanity and the world at large when he's confronted with the kindness shown to him by the elderly Professor Henry, and his wife Martha, Spengler, C. Aubrey Smith &amp; Elisabeth Risdon. If there were more like you, Vasquez heart-fully tells Prof. Spengler, in the world there would be less like me.Mr. Chimp who's interest in the $5,000.00 reward for turning in Vasquez is superseded by his wanting to save his life from being captured and beheaded by the head-hunters. This fear on Chimp's part has him make a blind and drunken run for it in the dark and unfriendly jungle, only to be killed by a native's poison dart blow gun. The rich and arrogant playboy Judson Ellis, Patrick Knowles,who's eloping with his sweetheart Alice Melbourne, Wendy Barrie,becomes panic-stricken when he realizes that his money can't buy him everything; as Vasquez tells him that he's, together with himself and the Spengler's who volunteered to stay, to be one of those left behind. the rest of the stranded passengers and crew which includes Alice and the planes pilot Bill Brooks, Chester Morris, and co-pilot Joe (Kent Taylor), whom Alice fell in love with. Together with young five-year-old Tommy Mulvaney, Casey Johson, who's dad, Pat O'Malley, was just the victim of a mob rub-out in San Francisco together. There's also a 28 year-old pre-"I Love Lucy" Lucille Ball as the tough-talking dame with the heart of gold Peggy Noland. The now ready to fly plane is to take take off as soon the jungle drums stop beating and the head-hunters slowly move in to finish the survivor's off one by one. Tommy's guardian and his dad's best friend Pete, Allen Jenkins, was also one of those passengers who didn't make it back when he was shot and killed by a poison dart from a head-hunter's blow gun.Vasquez telling Professor Spengler that he has three bullets left in his revolver, to do them and himself in before the head-hunters get a hold of them, really has only two and uses them on the elderly couple. We then see the plane, with the five who came back, fly off over the jungle sky and into the safety of modern 20th century civilization.With Vasquez himself feeling in some strange sort of way a sense of freedom and redemption due to the unique turn of events that he finds himself in. By outliving his captor Mr. Chimp and denying his life to his Panamanian executioners, Vasquez now faces death at the hands of the jungle head-hunters. Whom to them the only crime that he committed was not being a member of their tribe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Survival in the jungle...all the usual passengers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FIVE CAME BACK is a standard RKO B-film, capably directed by John Farrow with a cast headed by a bunch of veterans who were now entering the B-film phase of their careers--CHESTER MORRIS, KENT SMITH, PATRIC KNOWLES, WENDY BARRIE--and some very good character actors like Joseph CALLEIA, SIR C. AUBREY SMITH and JOHN CARRADINE. At that time, even LUCILLE BALL could be called a veteran actress, having adorned many a B-film in less than impressive ingenue roles, usually as a brassy type with a heart of gold--but this is certainly one of her lesser early assignments. It's easy to get the feeling that you've seen this sort of plot before, perhaps in a different setting.She's rather wasted here since most of the footage concentrates on the men who have more to do in this tale of a plane crash in the Amazon jungle that leaves them stranded near some dangerous natives until they can get the plane fixed. The pilots (CHESTER MORRIS, KENT SMITH) then have to give the others the bad news--the plane can only take off if there are five passengers aboard it. As it turns out, it's up to reformed revolutionary Joseph CALLEIA to choose who stays and who goes. PATRIC KNOWLES is the cowardly suitor of WENDY BARRIE who gets his comeuppance at the hands of the reformed man when he attempts to bribe his way to escape.If this sounds familiar, it's because Farrow directed the same story again years later, called BACK FROM ETERNITY.It's absorbing but obviously a low-budget film, rather murkily photographed using some of the old KING KONG jungle sets (unless that's the fault of the print I viewed on TCM), and the script is better than average for this type of story. But if you have the feeling that you've seen this all before, you probably have. The stock characters facing peril will remind you of those STAGECOACH characters, most of whom had to worry about their fate, some brave and heroic, others more like cowards. Still, it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been intrigued by RKO (RKO Radio) Pictures. Since darkness and shadows always held a steady platform for the old studio, I preferred my RKOs in living black-and-white! I have no favorite RKO films in color."FIVE CAME BACK" is a typical RKO Radio Pictures release. Never mind the sometimes "overdone" acting! The story of a plane that has crashed in a South American jungle, with very limited hope of survival for those on board, requires the likes of Chester Morris, Lucille Ball, Sir C. Aubrey Smith and others! Remember --- this is 1939. A new version starring Robert Ryan was released by RKO in 1956. This flick was titled "BACK FROM ETERNITIY". It had a bigger budget, and the acting was very good, but the original still stands as my personal favorite. Perhaps it was the simplicity ... check the guide wire on top of the plane as it crashes into the trees! The wire wasn't attached when the double-engine job was in the air! The most obvious "dummy" plane just adds to that touch of movie innocence preceding World War II."FIVE CAME BACK" is a movie-collector's delight. Nothing fancy, just simple fun. It's worth the short viewing time (75-minutes) to see a beautiful, 27-year-old Lucille Ball! Add to that the obvious low-budget (approximately $250,000) and you're set for a very good time "at the movies".As a tag: One wonders why it took Sir C. Aubrey Smith half the film time to remove his coat in the overheated jungle! As I recall, he never removed his tie during the miserably hot weeks at the crash site!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five Came Back (1939) ** 1/2 (out of 4) John Farrow directed this disaster film about a plane with twelve members who crash near the Amazon and must try and fix the plane. I was really, really disappointed in this film after hearing some good things about it. One problem is that the film runs just 75-minutes so you've got twelve characters and none of them get enough screen time to really care about any of them. Another problem is what we do get to know about the characters is nothing special as all are nothing more than predictable stereotypes. The cast, which includes Chester Morris, Lucille Ball, John Carradine, Joseph Calleia, Kent Taylor and Patric Knowles keep things moving but the typical screenplay lets them down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this one with its remake "Back To Eternity" (1956) with Rod Steiger.One was as good as the other, but my brother and I did have a laugh seeing Lucille Ball as 'the fallen woman'.We said she was 'the wicked city woman' in reference to her getup when Tennessee Ernie Ford guested on I Love Lucy.Fascinating in that in this one, when the flight attendant would fall out the door during the storm, it was a woman in this version but was a man in the remake.Descent, intelligent story, not outstanding, but a good watch.Especially if you watch it and the remake together. Too much fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not for big lucy fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a big Lucille Ball fan, this movie might not work for you. Although Lucille Ball has a role, it is definitely not one of her biggest compared to her other movie roles like in "The Big Street." She has about the same character roles as other actors do, and she really doesn't have an important part in the movie. This movie is quite interesting at first, but the ending doesn't really end like it should. The movie starts out very mysterious, not knowing what's going to happen. Later on in the film, the ending turns out not to be as dramatic as it should. If it was, the movie would have been better and would definitely be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bow Wow Wow , Dog Alert Dog Alert.... Chcik Flick Fluff From the 30's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Tivo'd this because I was told this was a "minor classic". Watched it with my wife and she seemed to stay into it, I was thinking this was a serious "dog". The running line between us was, "which 5?" well we ruled the kid from the start, so I'm thinking OK do the pilots count? The crash (which happens a long almost half way point) yields no new deaths, just a bruised shoulder from the old lovable professor (of Shirley Temple and 4 Feathers fame among many other roles). Anyway a total waste of John Caradine, I was hoping he would be good here, but no luck, he's dead in the jungle after a very bad start. I mean c'mon, is this a chick action flick or what? Hey, its Hollywood, its couples going out, its not about grim realities, its a kind of boy that was cool action flick (if your a woman), its lame (if your a dude). 5 of 10. I don't know why I rate it that high, but the wife didn't fall asleep which is saying something for a old black and white film. I'm into them, and old planes; but this one was barking loud like a dog in heat. I predicted the head hunters also long before they showed up. yawn. Was waiting for some savagery among the survivors (all of them survived, sheesh) but we got nothing like that. Boring B flick worth forgetting about. Also, Lucy isn't in much here if thats why you are are curious.</fullReview>
