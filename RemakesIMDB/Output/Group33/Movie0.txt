		<shortDescription>Lame, boring and obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care how interesting the scenery is if you know the entire story arc in the first 45 seconds - and you haven't even watched the trailer. Nic Cage looks like a corpse and his acting isn't much better. The relationship that the film puts forward is as believable as a love affair between a squirrel and a stuffed alligator. Plus of course the story has Cage break every rule he says is important - but never offer a plausible motivation. Maybe the original was really something, but this version is dead on arrival and should be saved for the second DVD in a video night, when you want everyone to leave your house and let you get some sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's The Deal With Nicholas Cage?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it my imagination or has Nicholas Cage been involved in a lot of B-type films the past decade? I pretty much enjoyed this movie, don't get me wrong - but it's still not what you'd call a classy movie, not the kind of film he'd be involved with years ago. Now, he seems to prefer playing total wackos in stories that don't have a lot of credibility. Here, he's a Joe The Hit-man in Thailand, who falls for Miss Wholesome, and then turns "Rambo" by killing 50 people while en route to saving his protégé. The only thing not a cliché was the ending; that was a bit of a shocker.Shahkrit Yamnarm costars as "Kong," a man who becomes "Joe's" student. He's the one Joe saves. Charlie Yeung, a winsome Hong Kong actress who is almost 35 years of age but could pass for 21, plays Joe's love interest. Get this: she's a pharmacist, beautiful and wholesome as they come, and a deaf-mute! Yet, sleazy Joe sweeps her off her feet in no time! Man, you have to really enjoy the stylish visuals and sound (which ARE very good), the pretty good.....and leave it at that, to enjoy this movie. It's better to just watch it with your brain on hold and enjoy it, because if you start thinking about it, the film gets dumb and dumber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is about an assassin called Joe who decides to end his career after his next trip abroad. The next trip is to (you'll never guess) Bangkok, where he has 4 people to kill, and he hires a young crook to work for him. However, Joe begins to break his own rules as he begins to see something of himself in the crook and falls in love with a deaf chemist.I feel sorry for Nicolas Cage. He is possibly the biggest victim of typecasting in Hollywood, and he does his best with the roles he is given but the odd film slips through the net, and sadly Bangkok Dangerous is one of them. Nic is distinctly average in this and the performances of the supporting cast aren't much better with the notable exception of Charlie Yeung, who delivers a fine performance as the love interest.This film isn't awful, it just suffers from an average and completely unoriginal script. This is Action Movie 101, and unlike some movies it doesn't get away with it by glossing over the cracks with special effects, like Wanted. Like Wanted, I successfully predicted the entire plot straight after Nic's opening monologue. Some scenes were very good, some very bad, the scale is balanced. The movie is like Marmite, you'll either love it or hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shockingly mundane &amp; ordinary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bangkok Dangerous" isn't a bad film ? or at least not as bad as most of the reviews around here claim ? but it is an astonishingly ordinary film that features literally every cliché of "hired assassin" concept you can possibly think of. There's the lonely and super-skilled hit man who intents to pull of one last job before quitting the business for good, he teaches his errand boy to become his successor, finds love and happiness with a girl for the first time and ? last but not least ? refuses to make the final hit because his target is a noble individual. We know this is the prototypic pitch of every thriller in its type, yet we still pay the full price of a cinema ticket because the film stars Nicolas Cage and we'll probably see a lot of spectacular action and virulent gunfire. "Bangkok Dangerous" is a big-budgeted remake of a Thai thriller released in 1999, which was also directed by the Pang brothers. In the original, the hit man was a deaf-mute but since Nicolas Cage is far too expensive to have him shut up the whole time, they made his love interest a deaf-mute instead. Unfortunately, this takes away the one truly ingenious aspect about the original. What remains is a painfully predictable and bland thriller that can't even be saved by the handful of impressively staged action sequences. Still I wouldn't call "Bangkok Dangerous" a complete waste of time, though, as there are a couple of stylish and worthwhile ? albeit less obvious ? elements working in its favor. Nic Cage gives a good performance as the unworldly killer and particularly the Pang Bros' depiction of the city of Bangkok is deeply enchanting. Especially at night it looks like a melancholic and depressing place infested with prostitution, petty crimes and perverted tourists. The moody soundtrack emphasizes the atmosphere of melancholy even more. This is definitely not a film that'll increase the tourist business there. Otherwise there's very little to say about "Bangkok Dangerous". If you're a fan of Nicolas Cage and rough action, you won't regret giving this one a look. Just realize you'll have completely forgotten about it the next day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not incredibly bad as the critics or the public would like you to think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious professional assassin, who called himself Joe (Oscar-Winner:Nicolas Cage) goes to Bangkok to do his last job. His mission is to kill four strangers by killing one at the time. Joe becomes tired of his so-called profession, he teaches a curious young man (Shankrit Yamhnam) to trained as a killer. Meanwhile, Joe falls in love with a lovely young woman (Charlie Yeung), who's deaf-mute. But the people, who hired Joe tries to double-cross him by trying to find his identity and kill him, once Joe's last hit is too risky to handle. Joe takes his skills and decide to use it by the people, who hired him for the work.Directed by the Pang Brothers (The Messengers) made an lively action-thriller with some good scenes and excellent locations. Cage is fine in this movie but Yamhnam and Yeung have the better moments in the film. Actually the Pang Brothers remade their own film with a bigger budget, American lead actor and changing a few plot points from the original 1999 version. Plenty of film critics hated this remake but isn't as bad as what they say about it.The DVD Special Edition is from the two-disc set. Disc one has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD includes two featurettes, an interesting alternative ending and the original theatrical trailer. Disc two is the digital copy of the movie. "Bangkok Dangerous" isn't a great flick but it's fairly fast paced with some stylishly photography action sequences and a few good moments. Fans of the filmmakers work and fans of action movies will enjoy it. (*** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonably good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, for those of you seeking an incredibly deep and intriguing story line, this movie is not for you! This is a movie for people who just want to see some good solid action and good entertainment.When i first saw the grade on IMDb i was a bit skeptical, but after seeing the movie i was quite satisfied with it.Sure, it is quite predictable and the acting is not ground breaking. But the lasting action was quite entertaining for me.The biggest flaw of this movie is probably the story line. Some parts of the story are rather rushed without telling background information. Sometimes the story feels a bit rushed with more focus on the action than the actual reason for an event to happen. Some parts of the movie feel a bit overdone and unnecessary making the main character look quite dumb...I find this movie worth a 6,4 (i did not want to give it a 6 because i do find it deserves higher than a 6, this explains the 7 star rating)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average remake plenty of action , suspense and thrills from Nicolas Cage and Pang brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story deals with an American hit-man (Nicolas Cage, also producer) in Thailand , he kills his victims with no remorse . The drug addict murderer forms a relationship with a young man (pleasant Shahkrit Yamnarm) , as he teaches his craft to Thai hustler . Meanwhile , the killer falls in love with a deaf-mute (in the first version this handicap is borne by the murderous) pharmacist (enjoyable Charlie Young) and he shares brief moments of happiness .This detailed study about an assassin and a youth he trains is an exciting movie with a great visual style . It concerns about murders , vengeance , a love story and this one delivers it well . The picture reworks many familiar issues , as a double-crossed hit-man falling in love . The rate of events blending drama and action are enhanced by extended length of the hunting scenes and occasional flashes of brilliance . There takes place a great deal of killing with some creative moments wrought from heavy stylistics and in a John Woo style . It succeeds in building intrigue , tension and nice performances , thanks to the affecting acting of the girl who plays the deaf and mute , she's frankly marvelous . The characters are well portrayed and they are persons for who the viewer has feeling and compassion . Worth it for the terse script and twists ending .Furthermore , colorful and granulated cinematography by Decha Srimantra , Pang brothers' usual . Atmospheric musical score fitting well to action by Brian Tyler (author of notorious soundtracks from Rambo 4, Constantine , War , among others). The motion picture is professionally directed by Pang brothers (Messengers , Re-cycle , The eye), shooting during Thailand coup d'etat . Directors , Danny and Oxide Chun Pang did a cool but uneven work in making this violent story .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you understand a bit of Asian philosophy, but in the same time like brain numbing action movies, this is for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't bad. Nicholas Cage looked really fat and tired, not his usually fit and tired self, and he played the cold assassin part with ease. But when it went into the 'shy in love assassination teacher that cares about his student and doesn't kill the good guys' part, it kind of felt rushed. I am sure you can see the problem here.Basically it is a film about a man that rediscovers his soul... then dies from it. Not a fresh thing in Asian movies, but something that the (re)makers of this film bet the Americans will find cool. I, myself, understood the idea, but saw no reason in remaking the Thai movie that had the same idea and add almost nothing to it other than production costs.Bottom line: sad-good-assassin story, with no twist. If you like stuff like that, watch it. Better than Hell Rider, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it predictable ? - YES. But it is also very entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what if I can predict what is going to happens, I can do it with most films nowadays - its not about that. Its about making a movie that entertains, and IMHO they have achieved that.OK, some of the shooting sequences were a bit dodgy and the narration descended into the cliché on occasions but overall I rate this film better then most action films I have seen in recent months.Cage is solid in his role and so is his side kick. The elephant did a good job too but his role was only in 2 scenes :) So all in all 7 is my vote and it could have been better if not for a few lines of monologue and a couple of silly shootouts across water canisters. Watch it and make your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely not as bad as its reputation... and yet still not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous comes to viewers who approach it on DVD with a stigma. Matter of fact, it just kind of came and went when it played in theaters for a few weeks in September of 2008, around that time (i.e. Labor Day weekend) when few movies really do well with audiences or critics. It looks like it will be garbage just from the video cover: a half interested Nicolas Cage in damn-ridiculous hair (basically a Muppet called and wants its body back), and with a premise that sounds just like it is, a remake of an action movie from years back. But going into the movie my expectations were altered within some minutes. The initial thought was 'well, this will just be another hackneyed, predictable action movie in the Asian setting of Bangkok and stuck with what I call 'genericitis, which means a movie suffers from its perpetual sense of the usual... and in ways the movie is that.It also surprised me with a few things, and it actually made me take the movie seriously as an actual piece of work as opposed to something to deride with teeth gnashed like Ghost Rider. Nicolas Cage is trying for something a little different here. At first, yes, it may look like he's bored, or wooden, or both in the character of "Joe" the hit-man who has his four rules and, naturally, breaks at least a few of them during the run time of the movie in Bangkok (i.e. be anonymous, don't make connections with people you don't know, and know when to quit), but this gives way to something else. He's trying for nuance and observation, of being subtle in a role that should call for it (albeit Joe isn't a terribly interesting person save for his detachment). While he's definitely no Alain Delon when it comes to playing cold killer who may have a couple of portions of humanity in him, I actually did find myself being drawn into the character just based on Cage's projection of this detachment as a means to hide himself away from people. And for good reason, since he's not a "people person" really.That is until Joe meets 'Kong', who is a guy he hires for work but then takes on as his pupil (as the narration dutifully and unnecessarily tells us, because he sees something in Kong), and then also a romantic interest in a deaf-mute girl who works at a pharmacy. The latter scenes especially were touching because of it becoming a kind of silent movie, perhaps by default, when the two of them were together, and there's a rather sad, painful scene later on in the film between the two that is shockingly good and believable. I even liked the actors who played Kong and the girl, and how their characters unfolded in the story, limited as they might be... and yet, that old bastard cliché and convention kept coming back, more-so into the action scenes and set-pieces; whenever a chase happens in the film (save for one moment involving an arm dismemberment) you can zone out and not miss much. The editing is that kind of fast- kinetic style where you can barely take in a shot before it goes whizzing by. There's also some scenes that are ludicrous that are taken dead-serious, such as when Cage's Joe practically has gills and drowns a man underwater without any trouble.It's really a matter of the plot just not giving anything much for the characters or actors to do. And yet there is a misconception that becomes apparent; this is much more about the characters than the plot, at least for a while, and when it sticks to that the Pang brothers sense of cinematic style, of the love of dirty Bangkok and elephants, works and is enjoyable. When the story comes back though, particularly in the last twenty minutes when Joe makes a fatal choice, it turns into something else - something frustratingly forgettable. For a short while there is hope, which is nice, until it reverts to what the expectation foretold. It's truly a mixed-bag, but far from the failure that was projected by the reviews and audience reaction... Oh, and of course, try not to look at Cage's hair. The bad jokes would never end. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read many of the reviews here about this movie and I must disagree with most of them.While the original was definitely grittier and more native, due in part to the lower budget I'd guess, this production was more polished and even a bit "Hollywood like". Cage's acting was exactly what I expected and the location filming lent a very accurate air of realism.There is a story being told here so the movie does move between intense action and quieter moments.If you dislike remakes of films in general then I suppose this may not appeal to you. But if you are a fan of Nicholas Cage, or have ever visited Thailand for that matter, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this film to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bangkok Dangerous: 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in with low expectations. Virtually everything I heard from the critics was bad, and the "buzz" was pretty much just people saying how bad it looked. But being the rebel I am, I went anyway. I liked it.We're introduced to Cage's character on assignment in Europe. Cage's character Joe lives by the clock like Tom Hanks does in Cast Away. He's cold and methodical. I realize that sounds clichéd for a hit-man, but the Pang brothers get it across a lot better than other movies with the same subject matter. Joe goes to Bangkok to carry out a series of hits for a Thai mobster. He quickly hires a street smart pickpocket by the name of Kong to be a messenger and translator. Cage has several rules, one of them being not to get close to people, but slowly he and Kong begin to bond. After a hit or two, Joe takes Kong under his wing and teaches him the tricks of the trade (think Leon and Mathilda). Cage also meets a deaf/mute pharmacist he takes a liking to. She's about as innocent and sweet as somebody can get, providing some good contrast to Joe's work and the seedy, dark streets of Bangkok the Pang brothers have a knack for depicting. As they get close, we see Joe go through what I thought to be some convincing character development. It's not that we relate to Joe, we just understand and sympathize with him, both before and after the transformation takes place. So, the Pang brothers went through a lot of effort to get us invested in these characters, and that's what makes the action sequences so much better. On their own, they'd be just alright. But since we actually give a damn if Cage or Kong or whoever gets shot, they carry with them a certain emotional weight. In the reviews I read before going, a few mentioned Bangkok's photography as one of the positive aspects of the film, but many criticized it. I thought it perfectly matched the atmosphere of the movie. It's dark, gritty, forlorn, desolate... No other style would have matched the story as well. And that's one of the things the Pangs show they're great at; they really set the mood of the movie well. It's a dark and dreary world full of immoral, unsavory people. Joe acknowledges this and lives his life accordingly, but as he's introduced to humanity in one of the most unlikely places of the world, he discovers a completely different outlook on life, one that's worth fighting for, one that's worth dying for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage, who is in the process of committing career suicide, plays a tired old lump who kills for a living and spouts half a dozen rules he doesn't live by in "Bangkok Dangerous", a pointless remake of a film that wasn't great in the first place. One cliché-ridden scene follows another in this Pang Brothers pile-up of movie references. Even a generous budget can not inject an ounce of life into this sorry mess. The action scenes are slow and confusing. The performances are all retarded and misdirected. The words "stylish" and "cool" have been bandied around in reviews of this abortion. The film is neither. Cage's hit-man is a massively unengaging character with the year's worst haircut; he looks like an extra from "Combat Shock", a film that is one hundred times better than this (made for 10,000 times less). Ultimately, a depressing viewing experience and a cinematic eyesore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hit man Joe (Nicolas Cage) is a professional killer with a peculiar code of honor and modus-operandi. He travels to Bangkok to kill four persons and he hires the smalltime hoodlum Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) to help him in his job. When he meets the deaf and dumb Fon (Charlie Young) in a pharmacy, he falls in love with her and breaks his code. Further, he teaches Kong how to become a hit man. But when Kong is abducted by Surat (Nirattisai Kaljaruek), who had hired Joe for the assignment in Bangkok, he is forced to betray Joe. But the hit man decides to rescue Kong in his last job."Bangkok Dangerous" is an action movie by Oxide Pang Chun and Danny Pang with the nihilist story of a professional killer. I bought this DVD a couple of years ago and only yesterday I decided to watch it.The cinematography and the camera work in the chaotic and exotic Bangkok is a chance for those like me that have not had the chance to visit Thailand yet to see the beauties of this city. Charlie Young is perfect in the role of a sweet woman capable to bring love to the heart of a cold blood killer. However, the conclusion is disappointing and inconsistent with the behavior of Joe. Nevertheless I recommend this movie to viewers that wish to see an average story in an environment unusual for Westerns. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Perigo em Bangkok" ("Danger in Bangkok")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly rich meditation on rediscovering who you are.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review may have mild spoilers but they come through implication and aren't explicit, in short, your viewing of the film shouldn't be ruined by anything written here. This was, surprisingly, a very interesting action and character piece from Nicholas Cage. I generally find his work either very good or cheesily over the top. In 'Bangkok Dangerous' he delivers an under-stated and nuanced performance as a hit-man who has withdrawn from humanity for so long that when he steps back in, the personal and professional consequences are tremendous. To survive as a hit-man he's lived by a set of rules. Finding a major contract for four jobs in Bangkok leads to deep, personal revelations when his strict adherence to those rules starts to peel away. Cage's character Joe says at one point that the only way for him to do the job is to withdraw from humanity. He leaves no trace that he's ever existed, finds no acknowledgment from other human beings and exists only as the wind. Humanity "... starts to look like a different species" and he only comes out to study people for brief moments before withdrawing again to remind himself that they aren't. So what happens when he goes to Bangkok and the culture is so alien to him that he can't help be drawn into it?There were a number of things I really liked about the movie. The exotic location is matched with beautiful cinematography and luxuriant sets. The colours, the atmosphere and dark vibrance of the city at night is in stunning contrast to Joe's spartan and non-descript apartment: white walls and brown tables. The Pangs did an excellent job of drawing the audience into the same intoxicating world that Joe is drawn into. The sights in the markets, the sounds in the clubs and in the streets (and the wonderfully engaging score), the taste of the food and the smell of the city -- these all leapt out. The Pangs direction here is, in my opinion, some of their best work. Joe's hits are tense and well set up. In one particularly horrific action scene, the camera looks up at Joe who has just dispatched his target, Joe who stands even in shock at himself for the brutal killing, Joe who realizes that killing has moral complexity since his humanity has reawakened. The camera lingers on Joe for an eternity, shock and awe in the audience; shock and awe as he realizes what he is.So how does it happen? Is it the city that draws in him? Partially, but he's been in other exotic cities. Is it the sidekick and messenger he's hired on to be an errand boy? Partially. Joe reveals a soft spot when he sees that the sidekick goes above and beyond what he has been asked to do in order to protect Joe during an attempted robbery. Is it when he is first troubled in the film by his rule to leave no traces of himself? Is it when he makes a connection with a beautiful deaf pharmacist? Joe's survival in his career has been from dehumanizing himself from the rest of the species. Bangkok is dangerous to him because of the jobs he has taken and the people who have contracted him but Bangkok is also dangerous because he recovers part of himself. People who genuinely care about Joe crack the armour, at once strengthening and destroying.Is it a nihilistic film? On a superficial and literal level, yes, 'Bangkok Dangerous' is a nihilistic film about a guy who kills for a living. Much deeper is the understanding of how we are all shaped by our choices but how redemption and rebirth are possible -- even in the most unlikely of anti-heroes.</fullReview>

I was reminded of that great movie Lord Of War, where he started off as a nasty piece of work and stayed that way till the closing credits. In this one when he turns over a new leaf and starts going out on dates and chatting with the Thailand locals, he becomes a very dull character. And as for his 'final act of sacrifice' well, I was so moved I almost threw up. PUR-LEASE.They are some well directed action sequences on a canal with speedboats and a warehouse lit with red light, but so what? We've seen it all before. They would only be interesting in conjunction with an interesting narrative, and this one is as predictable and clichéd as it gets. In fact a more accurate title would be BANGKOK TEDIOUS. I thought that one all up by myself. Tee-hee. Anyway, the film pretty much sucks, and Nicolas Cage's career tailspin continues.

		<fullReview>Funny, isn't it, how many of us are quite willing to allow for shortcomings in Asian films that we won't entertain in their Hollywood remakes? We all know to expect any emotional manoeuvrings on the part of the Asian filmmakers to be a little too overwrought and/or sentimental, and we let it go because it's a small price to pay for all those ultra-cool, blisteringly-paced action scenes. But when an American film is guilty of the same practice it really doesn't sit right and spoils the entire picture.Well, that and the fact that someone gave Nic Cage the lead role (Nic Cage, probably, seeing as how he co-produced).Cage is a slightly off-centre, slightly dishevelled hit-man, in Bangkok for an assignment, who forsakes his usual practice of using some street punk to do his running around for him then killing them when the job's done when he realises that young hustler Kong possesses both the speed of mind and body and street-smarts to be a worthy apprentice. At the same time, Cage falls for a young deaf-mute girl who works at the local chemist. Of course, allowing himself to become emotionally attached to others spells inevitable trouble.Nicolas Cage is probably quite a decent bloke (unless you're Kathleen Turner), but there's something about that hangdog expression and puppy-dog eyes that really gets up my nose. The film still wouldn't be great whoever was in the lead, but for me Cage will always reduce the rating by a point or two. Couple him with a heavy dose of sentimentality ? which gives him the chance to adopt the 'deep' mournful expression he wore throughout that dire remake of a German flick whose title escapes me ? You know the one: he's an angel in black who doesn't say much, she's a numpty who rides her bike with eyes closed and arms stretched wide apart and looks surprised when she's splattered by a bus ? and the film doesn't stand a chance.</fullReview>

The Pang Brothers have done a good movie to their credit, but it's not this one.The only thing that this movie will amount to is the fact that Cage can make ANY movie a financial success (This film was a mild success but one none the less. Cage also has a knack for showing up in films that are box-office successes.). In the end, this is just the kind of film that the movie Hot Fuzz went to make fun of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous is an oft frustrating and disappointing experience, not because it is inherently bad per se, but rather because it shows promise yet consistently squanders it. At its core, the movie exists as a compelling and ?at times- engaging feature that caters to high octane thrills and adequate drama. Yet burdened with an overwhelming sense of kitschy design put in place to satisfy those looking for no-fuss action, the feature inevitably comes to a close in a manner that reflects the experience as a whole. This unconvincing back-and-forth structure inevitably hinders the movie's ability to fully envelop in the manner that it hopes to; the action can be potent, but all too contrived; characterisation welcome but treated as plot devices; drama which is emotive and interesting but underplayed all the same. A jarring, neurotic affair with underdeveloped promise and too many flaws to capitalise on such greater features, Bangkok Dangerous is a two headed monster, one of which is far easier on the eyes than the other.Following impeccable and high-end contract hit-man Joe (Nicolas Cage), the focus of Bangkok Dangerous is simple; a man who lives by 4 rules which dictate how to do his job with precision and success, Joe is also one ridden with loneliness, unable to create relationships with anyone for fear of breaching his security. At its heart, this is the story that Jason Richman wants to bring out, and for the most part, it's what gives the feature its most engaging form of narrative. Going from here it's only natural that Joe should find a woman within his new location of Bangkok, who comes in the form of a deaf pharmaceutist. This subplot plays out well in the context of Joe's story; through her we see his softer, more human side, and Cage does well in getting across such sides of his character naturally. The romance isn't as potent as one might hope, but given that Bangkok Dangerous isn't exactly a movie likely to pander to the whims of romantics, such casual development is forgivable.What isn't quite as forgivable however lies in two other subplots which too often distract and take up too much time from the two characters in the story that we care for. The first of these unwanted aspects comes in the form of Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) who essentially plays the part of Joe's apprentice of sorts, because, well, Joe sees a little of himself in Kong. Granted there are some strong moments that play out in this dynamic, but again hindered by a sense of trying too much in too little time, such moments are lost within a cloud of underdeveloped ideas. Branching off of this subplot is another which goes even further and tries to develop some sort of romance between Kong and a distant associate that supplies Joe with his contracts. Not only is it a superfluous and unnecessary inclusion, but it doesn't even provide any substance when it does show up. Every time I had to sit through such moments I couldn't help but think of what could have be shown on screen between Joe and his love interest, instead of the perplexing and inane "romance" that was in front of me.Reinforcing the central motif of the film's sporadic and mixed bag nature though is its aesthetic design which often complements the movie's biggest and most poignant moments- action and character orientated. Perhaps the most significant and consistent of these elements is the enveloping score penned by Brain Tyler who has made a habit out of writing for creatively jarring movies such as this. Remaining as the only real constant of the film outside of Cage's natural performance, Tyler reinforces the moods of the film throughout, echoing themes of loneliness, confliction and unbendable duty through his similarly structured compositions. Although not quite as complementary or remarkable as the score, the photography by Decha Srimantra has some interesting moments in itself which help to draw the attention past the numerous instances of dry, uninspired action.In the end however, Bangkok Dangerous essentially comes down to a battle between opposite forces, literally speaking. Like their central character, directors Oxide Pang Chun and Danny Pang are too often found conflicted by a willingness to stick to the genre's action-orientated blueprints and a more natural but fleeting sense of romantic characterisation. It's a statement in itself that Bangkok Dangerous, a film that will most likely attract those looking for explosions and gun fights, will no doubt leave such audiences underwhelmed by the mediocre action, and unfulfilled by a distinct lack of focus on such. Indeed, it's an interesting and ironic twist that the real substance and entertainment value to be had here lies in the character of Joe himself, and his conflicting state of mind rather than his weapons. That's not to say that Bangkok Dangerous is neutered, because it certainly has its thrilling moments, but such instances are best when left to pander to character rather than run off on their own. So while the movie certainly doesn't ever take off, it at least stays close to the ground with a fine and fitting performance from Cage, and tells a decent character story all the same; a throwaway action movie for those only interested in seeing action as consequence of drama and character.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pang Brothers remake their 2000 Asian film for the American audience with mixed results. Starring Nic Cage, film follows Cage's hit-man to Bangkok where he is to complete a number of hits. He tells us via narration that he has a set of rules that he follows so as to survive in the "business". He then promptly breaks his own codes and his life comes under threat.That's pretty much it as regards plotting. The Pang's bring much visual style to the picture, and show themselves to be adept at action sequences, but it all feels so familiar. Action movies are rarely going to bring new stuff to the table, they often, as is the case here, are kinetic popcorn pictures missing some emotional depth to marry up with the carnage. Thus this is not a film to be sought out by any action junkies looking for something new to add to their collections. As it happens Cage is fine and broody, managing to blend hard ass machismo with vulnerable traits. He, and the filmic style make it above average, even if ultimately it's instantly forgettable afterwards. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this knowing full well I was getting a dumb action movie. I'll pretty much give anything with Nic Cage in it a try because he either acts decently or is so bad that it becomes a comedy. In this movie he just seemed tired and bored which is exactly how I felt. Jumbled action scenes, stupid plot and characters. I never even finished it because I was so disinterested. I haven't seen the original and can already tell you it's much better. Not fast-paced enough to keep my attention and not horrible enough to make fun of, this is one of those crap movies that falls right in between. This movie should have been called Bangkok Retarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous, a remake with alterations of the first Pang Bros' flick, makes adequate use of the exoticism of the city, while the line of action is not in disagreement with the mainstream tendency characteristic of this kind of action film. I must concede that Nicholas Cage' performance cannot measure up to the caliber of the hard-boiled, stone-faced, cold-blooded assassin he desperately tries to depict. It was reminiscent of two extraordinary characterizations of the type, one by Alain Delon in Melville's masterpiece Le samourai (1967, and Edward Fox in the original version of The Day of the Jackal (1973). Nevertheless, to dismiss the movie as poor entertaining or highly confusing is more a matter of expectations than of analysis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because a movie has a a big name attached to it does not always mean that it will be a class hit. Although I am against Hollywood stealing other movies for their own useless gain. Bangkok Dangerous is further proof that Hollywood still can't master the brilliance of an original masterpiece and this is just an inferior time piece although from the out set it seems that it has lots of potential it however just falls flat and fails in a lot of places. First of Nicholas Cage , provides interesting insight into the character but however he just never seems to have his heart in it and thusly he seems disconnected rather than engaged giving us a performance that we know he is capable of. Although the location is great , and there seems to be action it is just hampered by issues with the script and not to mention thin plot and mellow acting. I would say stick to the original unless your a fan or Cage.BANGKOK DANGEROUS : 6.1 OUT OF 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...it's best if you don't see the film as a remake of the, admittedly better, 2000 original.The plot of the film, other than being set in Bangkok and the world of gangsters and hit men, is really nothing like the other film of the same name. It could even be seen as a prequel, if it weren't for the fact that (Spoiler) Joe (Cage's) protegé isn't deaf, that disability being instead suffered by Joe's love interest (a wonderfully moving performance from Charlie Young) in this film (End Spoiler). There is one scene directly lifted from the original, that I won't ruin, other than say it sadly wasn't the scene I was hoping for......All that being said, once again, the film isn't bad. Cage sadly mumbles and sleepwalks his way through somewhat, seemingly having exhausted himself 10 years ago with the histrionics of "Face/Off", but overlook that, and you're left with a pretty decent, if cliché ridden and predictable, little actioner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could try to see this movie through another piece of glasses and be completely without expectations and allow yourself to be milder than the "critics". Overall it doesn't change the fact that this is over glamorised (and just fancy shot) and does not have anything to say. Nicolas Cage is like a box of chocolate ... or just a mixed bag of beans (mixture being assembled with the ones you like and the ones you absolutely loathe).This movie has a few nice action set pieces, they alone might warrant a 5/10, but I won't do that in this case, because the "story" holding this together and especially the "performance" by Cage do not warrant that. The directors have done some good work and better movies, as is true with Cage. This I wouldn't recommend even if Cage might have used this to "train" for "Ghost Rider" ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BANGKOK DANGEROUS tells a way-too-familiar storyline that'll have you reaching for your DVD of LEON before you're even halfway through. In essence, it's LEON transplanted to Thailand, with Nicolas Cage (and his exceptionally dodgy hair) retiring to the Thai capital to take on one last job before he finds himself stricken by his conscience. What goes from there will surprise absolutely nobody watching.This film should have been a lot better than it was; after all, the Pang Brothers are known for their innovative style, so you'd expect at least decent action sequences. The ones we're given are half-decent, if that; there are some good stunts here and there, and some nicely vicious touches (the bit on the boat, for example), but for the majority of the running time it's strictly par for the course. The film as a whole seems to be content to go through the motions and it does feel like it's missing its soul.Cage (who sleepwalks through the part, incidentally) takes time out from his hit-man duties to romance a shop assistant, and boy, did they go wrong with this particular sub-plot. Cage's intentions seem akin to those of a stalker, and instead of being romantic, the whole part of this story feels desperately sad on Cage's part, like he's a middle-aged lech grabbing out for one last thing. The whole film closes with an out-of-left-field ending which seems a little too far-fetched, and as a whole it's completely forgettable, like one of Seagal's straight-to-DVD efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing action thriller, nothing special at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous starts as professional hit-man Joe (Nicolas Cage) arrives in thriving Bangkok to carry out four jobs, four jobs that he fully intends to be his last before he retires from the assassination business for good. First thing that Joe does is hire a local petty criminal named Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) who will act as his go between &amp; translator when needed. Joe swears by several codes that dictate how he carries out his work, however these rules begin to blur as Joe falls in love with a deaf &amp; mute pharmacist &amp; starts to doubt what he is doing, after sparing the life of Kong he decides to become his teacher &amp; train him to become an assassin. After completing his first three hits Joe is hired to assassinate a politician &amp; has second thoughts, after not carrying out this job Joe becomes the target as the people hiring him cannot afford him to talk &amp; implicate them &amp; as such kidnap Kong in an attempt to get to Joe but Joe is one step ahead &amp; sets out to rescue his friend &amp; kill the bad guy's...Directed by Oxide Pang Chun &amp; Danny Pang who are collectively know as The Pang Brothers this is a remake of the Thai produced film Bangkok Dangerous (1999) that they wrote &amp; also directed, I have to admit right now that I have not seen the original Bangkok Dangerous so I cannot compare the two at all so I was able to judge this remake on it's own merits without being clouded by opinions (whether they would be good or bad) of the original. Bangkok Dangerous feels like a routine mid budget US action thriller, the story about a hit-man who grow's a conscience &amp; his subsequent fight against the bad guy's is standard fare &amp; pretty bland to be honest. One big problem I had with Bangkok Dangerous was that the script introduces huge character changes at the drop of a hat with no explanation, why does Joe decide to train Kong to be an assassin? His so-called rules prevent this. Why does Joe fall for that pharmacist? Since she can't talk the slushy date scenes are rather one sided &amp; quite awkward. Why change his mind about his last hit? Because Kong called the guy good? It's never revealed why the fat bad guy wants these people dead anyway, the character's are poor &amp; the dialogue little better. To be fair huge leaps of logic in action films is not unheard of but any decent action film worth it's salt will cover the glaring script deficiencies up with some great action scenes that take your mind off the real life narrative, unfortunately that is not the case here as Bangkok Dangerous has a real lack of action &amp; the one or two moments when it does threaten to break out it's unimaginative &amp; bland in the extreme. At almost 100 minutes it drags in places, it has no soul &amp; is pretty forgettable overall.As I already mentioned the biggest disappointment here are the lacklustre action scenes, there's a couple of fights, a rather limp boat chase, one or two shoot-outs including the usual nonsense where the bad guy's can't hit a barn door yet Joe can take them out without even thinking about it. Boring. The action scenes are very flat, the stunt work is average &amp; Bangkok Dangerous fails to excite or thrill. There's a bit of nudity but not much &amp; the Bangkok locations are mostly wasted. There's the odd colourful street life scene but the majority of Bangkok Dangerous is pretty drab &amp; lifeless.The IMDb says that Bangkok Dangerous had a budget of about $40,000,000 which seems like a lot considering what ended up on screen, actually filmed in Bangkok in Thailand. The acting isn't great, Nicolas Cage can be great entertainment value but here he looks lost &amp; has a really bad hair cut. In fact considering he is meant to be an invisible assassin he sure stands out while walking around Bangkok with his clothes &amp; hair. I don't remember much about anyone else but some of the Thai girls in that strip club scene look very nice.Bangkok Dangerous is an action thriller that doesn't really deliver on either count, the action is dull &amp; the story is impossible to take seriously. I can't say watch the original instead as I've never seen it but surely it can't be much worse than this? Even Nicolas Cage appears off form here, difficult to recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that has 3 or 4 interwoven story lines. All of them focus around "Joe" (Nicholas Cage) who is a professional assassin. The first scenario centers on his assignment to kill four different people in Bangkok. The second involves a romantic relationship with a young Thai woman named "Fon" (Charlie Yeung), who happens to be deaf. The third feature has him training a Thai man named "Kong" (Shahkrit Yamnarm), on how to kill. There is also another subplot in which Kong gets involved with a pretty nightclub girl named "Aom" (Panward Hemmanee). So basically what we have are several different subplots being acted out around the same time which requires the audience to shift focus from one to another. Normally, this would be okay if the directors (Oxide Pang Chun and Danny Pang) devoted more time to bolstering each segment with meaning or character development. Instead, it appears that the film just rushes into one story and then switches to another without fully exploring the potential of any of them. For example, I'm not really convinced that the romantic interaction between Joe and Fon benefited from her being deaf. Yes, it helped one specific scene in which Joe shoots two armed thieves while Fon's back is turned. But it also takes away huge possibilities due to their essential lack of dialogue. Another example involves the relationship between Kong and Aom. Except for a few brief moments (coming and going) there is no real connection being established between the two. Not only that, but the directors don't really use Aom to her full potential. Be that as it may, because of these various diversions, the movie doesn't really get into a good rhythm until after the first 45 minutes or so. After that, however, it begins to get pretty interesting--until the shootout near the end--which was as predictable as it was absurd. I also didn't care for the way the movie ended. It almost seemed like the directors were too interested in being "unique" or "artistic" rather than caring whether this picture satisfied the audience. In short, they had good acting and a very exotic location. All this film needed was a little imagination or some good direction to rise from an average movie to one that could have been much better. It didn't get either.</fullReview>

It was more a romance mixed with a action, though not much action...it was all killing, a few kills here and there..not like the hit-man movie.... totally not worth watching..enough said..Nicholas Cage's worst movie I've seen. It said he produced part of it, however. I am going to go back and watch the other one, the original movie, and compare it to this. I guarantee the older one is better. I love action movies, and during this one, I was bored in parts. The only part that snagged me was when he fell in love with that girl. I for one did not think the plot tied together well. I see why they didn't receive the cashflow coming back that they put into the movie. So sad wasting money to make this movie. They could've used the money to charity or something like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems more often than not, when Hong Kong filmmakers are hired by American producers to make American movies, these movies are extremely inferior to what the filmmakers made in Hong Kong. I suspect this is due to interference from the American producers. Since Nicolas Cage acted as a producer on this remake of a Hong Kong movie (directed by the same filmmakers) as well as acted, I think he has to take a lot of the blame for this movie's failure. For starters, this is one ugly-looking movie. Much of the movie is shot at night, when it's often hard to make out what's going on. And the parts of the movie shot during the daytime have surprisingly murky colors and don't look sharp. The action sequences (which aren't frequent, by the way) are directed in a lazy way that suggests little time was spent figuring out how to frame the shots. Cage's character is real bland, so much so that you have to wonder how he gets the mojo to kill people or romance the movie's deaf mute character. In fact, the rest of the movie is equally boring, with the characters barely advancing the plot scene after scene.What happened to Cage's career? Most of his movie's choices for the past few years have been as lame as this particular movie. I predict that in a few years, if he isn't thrown in jail for not paying his hefty tax bill, that he'll join Cuba Gooding Jr., Val Kilmer, and Christian Slater in appearing in direct-to-DVD sludge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a B-movie action flick with Nic Cage as a hired assassin looking to retire before he gets in too deep. He goes through the "rules" which he breaks during the course of the film. He gets into a teacher/student relationship with Kong. He goes on a couple dates with a deaf mute pharmacist. Along the way he's trying to finish off his last four contract killings without getting caught. Of course, you know that breaking all his self-imposed rules will only lead to doom.The acting by Cage is pretty wooden - but I suppose the character he's playing is a cold blooded hired gun who's been trying hard to distance himself from society. His student Kong actually has a lot more to do acting-wise and he does a convincing job.the rest of the film looks like a B-movie action film. Lots of stunts lots of running and lots of throwing physics/reality/belief out the window. Yes, a bathtub can serve as a shield against 3 bombs. Gun sequences are filled with running, shooting, and our hero never getting hit (almost). It's like when kids play cowboys and indians. Bang! "You're Dead!" "No I'm not!" The most distracting thing about this movie? It's been said before and I have to say it again. WTF is up with Cage's hair? It looks like a a chinchilla crawled up on his skull and died there. Every scene it just looks so conspicuously bad. How could a hit-man looking like that in Thailand try to 'blend in' ? The 'romance'scene lacked any real passion. It's main purpose is in showing that Cage's character is long overdue for retirement from his horrible career choice as an assassin. Cage the actor seems to be starting to take on roles to pay his many bills. Good luck buddy. Another "National Treasure" sequel coming up next? How about Con Air 2? 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not really a good movie at all, "Bangkok Dangerous" lacks intelligence, sophistication, or humor. It stars Cage as a deadly assassin with the worst posture you've ever seen. The story has clichés coming out of it's ears, left and right. The directors throw in some fairly gratuitous and graphic violent scenes. Run of the mill romances and side-kick are ever present in the story-line. A final cut scene makes little sense. Cage has not picked strong movies to work on lately, and although this movie is not a complete dud, it has little to offer story-wise. However, the locales seem pretty interesting for the most part. And the director's actually do a good job to stamp out English used by locals as much as possible. Not really recommended unless you like mindless violence movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage is back and without any real vengeance. Just intent on killing left and right. But only if the price is right. That said a hit-man goes by rules... Four to be exact, the last being knowing when to get out. Rules are to be broken and although Joe the hit-man has yet to break a rule it seems his month long killing spree in Bangkok offers sufficient motivation. First of all he befriends his associate, whilst normally he would 'clear all traces he existed'. Secondly he romances with a local deaf girl putting into doubt his life and goals. Add to that the fact his employers are sleezeballs and you have a show-down on your hands.Nicholas Cage surprisingly moves away from his traditional type-cast role, albeit not be much. He is more reserved and drawn inwards than usual. You always have to say he is keeping in form and sells himself as a professional hit-man quite well. His supporting cast is mostly fine, even though nobody is really fleshed out for us to really feel for the characters, although the hapless helper Kong (Shahkrit Yamnam) should be more defined in order for the story to really work. In the end the storytelling falls flat with a resounding yawn and while you see the film go from point A to point B you can't say it was properly presented. It just happened, because the script said it was so.You have to congratulate the Pang brothers on the action sequences, which are on par with the best of John Woo and really keeps the movie involving. There is unfortunately a bit of fast editing, but thankfully nothing on the level of Anderson or Bay, so the movie is watchable throughout.A notch down from the original, but in all truth there really isn't that much in common between the two. It felt more like a homage, than a remake.All in all a decent action flick almost balancing out into the above average zone. But not quite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely forgettable stale action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous stars Nicolas Cage as Joe, a typical movie hit-man in a typical "one last job" story. Joe can feel himself starting to get soft and knows that it's time to get out of the game. But he goes to Bangkok for one last client, a powerful gangster who wants Joe to commit four murders. Part of Joe's routine is to get a local on his side to help with hit-man-related errands. Enter the pickpocket Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm), who becomes more than just an employee for Joe. As anyone who has ever seen a movie like this before knows immediately, Joe will eventually trust Kong enough to teach him his techniques with ridiculously clichéd lessons like "You don't pull the trigger, you squeeze it." And by breaking the well-established rule that hit men aren't allowed to have friends, Joe will put them all in jeopardy. Along the way, Kong and Joe both fall in love with women along the way, the former with a dancer and the latter with a deaf-mute pharmacist who seems to be there simply to prove that she can develop more of an interesting character with no lines than Cage can with an entire script nowadays. Fast-forward to a dinner scene between the mumbling Joe and the mute object of his affection is one of the most painful scenes I've seen. The whole relationship sub-plot felt incredibly forced and showed a lack of chemistry between the two of them.Joe is not only the kind of part that the Cage of the 1990s could knock out in his sleep; it actually looks like that might be his acting technique for this particular role. And that's the big problem. I think he was miscast and I couldn't quite get his motive on this role. Bangkok Dangerous is so deadly dull that it's really not even worth writing or reading about, much less taking the time to see. The main plot of the film, the fourth hit gone wrong, doesn't really kick in until the final reel. The set-up is so slowly paced that even the critical part of my brain that could sort of recognize that the final sequence had some well-staged action was too tired to care. Cage has gone from fascinating actor to action star to cinematic valium. This film reminded me of straight-to-DVD actions films we see nowadays starring Steven Seagal, Wesley Snipes or Cuba Gooding Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lackluster outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the original Thai version of Bangkok Dangerous at the Stockholm Film Festival when it came out a few years ago. And I really liked it, i think that the Pang brothers have talent. I was actually surprised to see that they had also directed this remake, because this is one of the worst action movies i have seen this year. And that's saying quite a lot...The whole premise and storyline follow form 1A, there are no surprises and no inventiveness whatsoever. The story arc can be seen a mile away, which might not be a disaster if the whole thing is well executed. Unfortunately it is not. There are so many problems with this movie that I hardly know where to start. Action scenes are poorly shot and executed, the acting is substandard, the characters are all caricatures and there isn't a single moment of true suspense in the whole movie. And then I haven't even mentioned Nicholas Cage yet.It seems that Nicholas Cage is stuck somewhere in the late 90's when he had his heyday as a solid action star. Con Air, Face/Off and a couple of other movies made him established in the genre. And I actually liked both the movies and him quite a lot. But it seems that he can't let go of that. In this movie it's painfully obvious how much he has aged in the 10-15 years since. Several times I wanted to scream "act your age!" at him when he tried to perform action moves that would have been appropriate for someone twenty years his junior. This wouldn't have been a great movie even with a more suiting actor, but Cage's lackluster performance and haggard look didn't do Bangkok Dangerous any favors.Mostly this movie felt to me like one of those films where nobody was really trying. Cage came and went, doing his job without enthusiasm. The other actors feel like a collection of local talent far from able to carry this movie, especially not since Cage failed them. I would definitely recommend anyone to skip this movie and watch the original instead. It might not have been a masterpiece but it was definitely a lot better than this mess. This is just another one of those remakes that doesn't make anyone happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than the mediocre original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is bad as Nicolas Cage's hairstyle in this, in another words it's worse than the mediocre original. Even if it's not a super bad film like some claim it to be, it's still a pretty bad film. This is basically a bigger budget film leaning more to the western audiences compared to the original and the hit-man played by Nicolas Cage isn't deaf this time around. Just about everything about this movie is very predictable, even if you haven't seen the original, the original was pretty predictable and generic but this is more generic and predictable. On a positive note there is some stylish scenes and the depiction of the city of Bangkok is well done, but in most movies style can't overcome substance and let me tell you this movie is Bland with a capital B. If your a fan of Nicolas Cage, and especially him being in a action movie with a bit of drama, I guess this is worth a look.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of Nicholas Cage at the best of times, but he is truly awful here in this pointless US (that's United States, not useless..although come to think of it...)remake of a much better Hong Kong movie.Here he plays a weary, jaded hit-man who falls in love with a young oriental girl who apparently has a false hair fetish. Cage rapidly descends from unconvincing unlikable contract killer to unconvincing lovestruck unlikable sap.There is a great deal of schmaltz in the movie and the ending is so sickly sweet and saccharine-y it could induce diabetes.

		<fullReview>I think this movie is excellent. the story is solid. Joe is a precise mechanism. A perfect machine drift by 4 specific rules. But he is human. And we all know how bad we could fail. He felt himself attracted for the girl and this is one of his black holes' because he is a solitary man , living alone and eating alone with no friends and no bonds with the exterior world. The nature of his work ask from him that. But that doesn't means that in certain point in life he experienced the need for share things and time with someone. For me, how he fail with the girl and why is clear. The only point negative is why he develop a bond with Kong. Why? there no reason for that. According Kong behavior,he should be dead in their second encounter. But No, Joe keep him alive, even if he did a terrible mistake when pull out the red light bring upon him the police attention. It is no explainable why Joe doesn't kill him. In other sides,the photography is excellent and the movie global atmosphere, including the music, drive me to Michael Mann ( Heat, Miami Vice, Collateral etc). The end is simply perfect. No doubt that this is one of the best Cage movies in 2008.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oxide Pang Chun &amp; his brother Danny Pang wrote &amp; directed this tale in 1999,Now they &amp; the powers that be decided to remake it.The brothers &amp; Jason Richman revised the screenplay (see next paragraphs) and the 2 brothers directed it.The 1999 screenplay was about a deaf-mute assassin (name is KONG)_ who falls in love with a lady pharmacist. Nicolas Cage is the assassin in this film, He is is not a deaf-mute, He does however fall in love with a deaf-mute lady pharmacist.In all American action films it is required that our hero have a side-kick. In this revised mess, said side-kick is still named Kong, but as all true side-kicks is far from deaf or mute &amp; he becomes the apprentice to our hero.This is where the film fails. Nicolas cage who is usually a very accomplished actor walks through the role in a glaze,He forget to build a character &amp; just reads his lines.The actor who plays Kong; Shahrit Yamnarm is excellent,his role is the best in the entire movie. He like most Thai's speak Englis quite well. If they made him the Assassin,as the role was in the original,but let him speak, I feel this could have been a much better movie.The entire cast besides Cage is all Thai. The film was made (except for the first scenes) in Bangkok. We do see the crowded streets &amp; clubs &amp; can feel the excitement of this beautiful city. The opening scenes were made in Prague, also very well done.There is a good music score with some numbers done as background in a nightclub, one of the dancers is pertinent to the story.The movie is violent but not overly so, there is little foul languageIf it were not for Nicolas Cage poorly done role, this film could have been a first rate action movie. Sorry to say it is not.Ratings: **1/2 (out of 4) 72 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bangkok Dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professional hit-man Cage(My name's Joe, and this is what I do)yearns for a sense of normalcy, as he enters Bangkok. Once in Bangkok, we see how he works, the preparation and planning, but his client at this stop orchestrates a betrayal after two hits are performed successfully. A series of changes in his routine(..taking a young Thai man under his wing to teach him tricks of the trade, a sudden interest in a lovely, vibrant deaf pharmacist)threaten to expose him to possible harm. His emotional investment in Kong(Shahkrit Yamnarm), his protégé and Fon(Charlie Yeung), his love interest, deters Joe from completing his tasks without interference, depriving him of the success that typically comes easy when he doesn't dwell on, or question, the motives of those that hire him to kill targets. When Kong takes interest in Aom(Panward Hemmanee), a young woman, gangster Surat(Nirattisai Kaljaruek)sees a way to perhaps rub out Joe, instead initiating a war he'll soon regret.The Pang Brothers didn't really need to remake their first film, and I'm not sure why Nicholas Cage agreed to star in this except that both parties sought after a paycheck because this action sniper drama goes through the motions and lacks thrills. There's the hyperkinetic camera work and rapid-fire editing we are accustomed to when watching their films, but everything's so uninspired and unimaginative. There's nothing present here we haven't seen dozens of times before regarding a hit-man attempting to make human contact with others, hoping to impact lives in a positive way instead of always moving from one place to another for the sole purpose of arranging and carrying out a murder. Cage remains uninvolving throughout, solemn and cold, therefore we care little about him. The setting provides an interesting locale for the plot to transpire and there's some eye candy(lots of pretty Thai girls), but, overall, this doesn't improve the least little bit upon the film that preceded it. Most unsatisfying is the finale as Joe infiltrates Surat's factory, as the Brothers Pang decided to shoot most of the gunfire in barely lit areas removing even the possible excitement of a battle between enemies as he attempts to find Kong, kidnapped along with Aom someplace. Even the mentor-pupil apprenticeship between Joe and Kong never ignites any sort of spark. Just another Hollywood misfire from the talented brothers who simply make better films for their own country.</fullReview>

Cage, plays Joe, a hired killer whom has 4 targets in Bangkok. At the beginning, we get to hear his 4 rules that he always lives by and of course, breaks them all through out the film. First of all, why would a hired killer decide to break all his rules at once, simple, he wouldn't. It was silly.But what was sillier was his romance in this with a deaf pharmacy girl. He goes there to buy something for his wound and meets her and he suddenly is like I got to get with this hot deaf chick, breaking one of his rules.Then there is the sidekick, Kong. Joe all of a sudden wants a student to teach. Get real. And this student can't seem to keep out of trouble, getting jumped and all.But what was worse was the ending. I didn't get why Joe would do what he did.FINAL VERDICT: Avoid this stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this for just ?5.99 (it's ?17 in my local hmv). I wanted to this see this when it first came to cinemas as i'm an action fan and Nicolas cage is the man! First off it's no really a great movie. It's "good" though.Nic plays his character extremely well in my opinion and definitely looks the part. There aren't really any other roles to comment on in the film to be honest Kong is a typical idiot who fails to bring any sort of comedy into the film and that's about it! I can't really work out what the directors of the film were thinking it's an action film yet were given very little action which is OK when a film is backed up by great acting but the acting was "OK" at best.One thing that was good about the film is the idea the story! it's a very good story and to be honest you could kick the directors because there's so much potential for this film to have been amazing.It had a lot of things it needed and just didn't use them.For example the relationship between Joe and the mute girl had some potential and considering some of the other scenes handling didn't come off too bad.But past all of it' flaws its still a fun and enjoyable action movie with some decent action scenes at times and some watchable story development. Take it for what it is a really fun kick ass little action movie! OK it's not great but it's not anywhere near terrible.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After you've seen a thousand films in a life time, you kind of suspect when movie studios are getting lazy. While you are watching what you considered a 'New' film, like " Bangkok Dangerous" you get interested and half way through, you get the feeling 'you've seen this movie' before. Chances are you have not see the film before, but the plot may be a photo copy of a similar film. Here you are watching Nicolas Cage as an experienced and well seasoned hit man and he is teaching a young man (Shahkrit Yamnarm) how to be an assassin when your memory informs you, the last time you saw someone doing the same thing, it was called " The mechanic." Well in this film, Cage reveals specific new rules to his trade and adds a touching romance when he falls for a beautiful deaf mute girl (Panward Hemmanee). The heavy, a man called Surat, (Nirattisai Kaljaruek) is threateningly surreal when he hires Cage to do his bidding and then tries to dispose of him. The film has many good qualities such as the exciting shoot-outs, fight-scenes and dramatic explosions within the feature. So despite the duplications, the movie is a good story and worth a viewing. ****</fullReview>

It was filmed well with the action scenes good. The movie was well acted by those in it. Nicolas Cage looked worn out but his character was a hit-man who explains in the beginning narrative, "If you even think it may be time to get out, then it's time to get out. I became involved with the characters and wanted to see what would happen to them. As for saying it was predictable, it was a realistic film not an over the top comic book or James Bond character so you watched and waited to see what choices he made. I didn't care for the ending so I am glad I watched the alternate ending which was the way it should have ended, in my opinion.</fullReview>

It is necessary to the story, however, it went on a little long... the film overall could have been about 15 minutes shorter and it would have garnered a few more stars from me. And why, why is his love interested deaf. I understand the symbolism, but it made for some pretty boring and uncomfortable scenes.There is plenty of gunfire, explosions, and killing. Some car chases.... .kinda. They tend to throw something like this in right when I'm about to pass out and start drooling on my seatmate. I kinda enjoyed this film.... some. Don't feel like I 'wasted' my money on it, but there are a lot better out at the theatres right now. On DVD it would be more worth your money... then you could FF through the bedtime stories...Gargamel Scale = 1 for gunfire/explosions, 0.5 for car chase scenes, 0 for acting, 0.5 for story, and 0.5 for nudity... very brief, but nice.

		<fullReview>I am a fan of the original Bangkok Dangerous and was not too thrilled to hear it would get remade, with Nicholas Cage no less. When I heard about the story adaptations, I feared it would be even worse. All in all, it was not as bad as I expected. I was entertained through out most of the film, and that was more than I anticipated.The original movie showed character development, why the killer had become who he was, and why he formed the friendships he had. In comparison, the remake offers none, besides some lame voice over comments. The bad guys weren't as menacing, the bar girl didn't have any personality, and Nicholas Cage's acting was even more wooden than usual. Granted, the script didn't give him much to work with! Also, the flashy scenes that made the original a stand-out (the subway assassination and Kong's revenge on the murder of his best friend were unforgettable) are painfully absent here. What remains is a substandard action flick in an exotic setting. The backdrop of Bangkok was what kept me entertained, I guess.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While it's not a total waste, it certainly won't blow anyones mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics of course savaged the latest top movie at the box office however poor a turn out it was. I never believe them and I am always determined to see it for myself and make my own review. Once again I don't agree with them. The movie is not nearly as disastrous as they make it out to be. Is it good...ahhh I don't know, it's not great and it's not a complete waste of time but it somehow finds a spot in mediocrity. To call this an action movie or to say that it was a stereotypical action movie is kind of the wrong statement. I'm not even sure I would put this film in the same genre as action. Dark thriller maybe I don't know. There isn't enough actual action scenes to make it an action flick and the romance and drama is so heavy in the middle you forget what you're watching and start to drift. They really try to give the main character some depth and some definitive emotion and turmoil about the decision he's making about ending his life as a hit-man (which is where many come in with the unoriginal stereotypical comments) and the action scenes are well done for the most part but there are only a few and the rest of the meat and potatoes of the film which I think is overcooked.Nicholas Cage straps on his helmet for another action flick but tries to get some dramatic time in there too. I must say I thought his performance as troubled, sadistic, professional killer Joe was better than usual for him. Cage's ego always seems to come out on screen and over shadow his performance but he was very tolerable in the role and believable. But why does he have to look so greasy as of late. Thailand actor Shahkrit Yamnarm also does a decent job as Joe's sidekick and student Kong. He doesn't get a lot of good lines or big scenes but he does well opposite Cage. Charlie Yeung is Cage's love interest and she's lovely and very quirky but doesn't really get to shine in her role.Other than Cage's character, no one gets any depth and although the plot is simple enough it just kind of never really takes off. You don't get into the story and you don't really care about any of the characters except for maybe Joe. The action scenes are well filmed but are too far apart amidst a misplaced romance and training a student and the likes. A particular action scene which was a cool boat chase through an open market kind of irked me in the wrong way. I know that when you're watching an action movie that you have to let go of reality but the action has to be good, and the movie has to riveting in order for it to be believable. I really had to swallow some big lumps of reality in order to believe that Cage's character (someone who had been hyped as being the best killer for hire, a dead shot) couldn't even come close to hitting the guy on the boat. And vice versa the bad guy on the boat couldn't hit Cage but had no problem hitting a propane tank while moving in one shot. You have to give me something better than that. I think the Pang Brothers have a preconceived notion of what an American action flick should be and maybe the Hong Kong version of the film didn't translate quite as well. I do understand the ending, I even think it's not a bad ending to Cage's character but what was Kong standing on the dock all about...very confusing. When all is said and done it does have some redemption in it's gritty style and decent performances but definitely fails in other areas that would have made it captivating. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I found Bangkok Dangerous well directed, acted, and executed. The pace and flow of the movie keeps the viewer enthralled with the characters and story. Cage's character has highs and lows where the character, Joe, deals with fast paced action, melded with slow paced personal character development created by his interaction with other characters. The movie gives the viewer a breather between the intenseness of the movie's action. The supporting actors with Cage create a realism of the dangers of Bangkok. I found the movie pays homage to the 1973 classic 'The Mechanic'. The other homage the movie pays is to the 1973 Bond film 'Man with the Golden Gun' A great movie to watch. I have notice the trend of cross social interchange in movies lately. Where one sees the mix of North American and Asian language and culture in movies like "The Ring" etc. I find the change refreshing where one sees something new in films. Other than the same old same old. 8 gunfights out of 10 for Bangkok Dangerous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sigmund Freud - "The very emphasis of the commandment: Thou shalt not kill, makes it certain that we are descended from an endlessly long chain of generations of murderers, whose love of murder was in their blood as it is perhaps also in ours."I remember a time when Nicholas Cage was like Will Smith, every movie that he released was an instant blockbuster. Nowadays Nicholas Cage has been slightly lacking in this area, is it because of his age, I am not sure. The last movie that he did that I really enjoyed was 2004's "National Treasure" everything after that was really below par. I also find myself just not really liking him anymore, and I have come to the conclusion that it is because as an actor the only emotion he can really portray is the calm dude with the voice that never changes whether he is having dinner or in a car chase, in essence it his because he is devoid of any emotion.Now what might be the perfect character for that type of actor, why an Assassin who is completely devoid of emotion.So we get "Bangkok Dangerous" the story of a Hit-man who is on his last hit. This movie was exactly like "Hitman" from last year, only better because I hadn't played a video game based on it.The story starts with Joe, who arrives in Bangkok to kill four targets. And he enlists the help of a local, as he apparently does every time he has a new job, whom he plans to kill once his target is dead. But alas instead of killing him he decides to train him to be another assassin. Also in the same time frame this cold blooded killer asks the local pharmacy girl on a date. I am just a little confused as to how this seasoned hit-man can abandon the "alone" rule of contract killing twice in the same month. That aside it is a good action flick with plenty of explosions and a lot of killing and shooting. The only thing that I found really disappointing was the ending, no it was beyond disappointing, it was just plain awful. So, all in all it was surprisingly entertaining, until the end of course, which I cannot stress enough how stupid, pointless, and awful it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know what happened. I refused to see this movie because I red reviews of it on websites and IMDb and may be was attracted toward bad comments. It's sad because the movie is good and I waited for nothing. This movie was not properly rated (And I watch a lot of movies of the same kind.) In my sense this movie very good. there is action and good balance, rhythm, tension, simplicity in it. every one plays well.I agree with this cut comment you know, i've been watching a lot of fresh movies lately, especially action ones because i really love the genre (i just never grow up i guess). and more then often i feel disappointed, because mostly directing an action film means flashy special effects stacked on top of loud sound effects with some taken from comics storyline (which will sell for sure, and thats what is important, i guess) - but without any soul put into the movie. this one is completely different. Many people say it's predictive but I bet what you want if you can describe me the action in detail. Yes, it's easy to say the bad guy will be killed, but tell me how? aha ah! Some say it's not logical? where tell me? it's a story of a hit-man and a man, don't forget it. A life full of murder and suddenly the man has a soul, (I think it's when the little child cries (therapeutic and new age concept) at the airport. Then in Bangkok when he meets his helper and student. something change and it is called life (and to gain life you loose life) and love with its feelings when he meet the girl. I don't see him very affected by the city and Thai people as other commentators have said. It is not a documentary on Thai life. It's a great movie also due to the good photo in it. A good colour palette, great camera, good acting, nice music, punchy ending - i absolutely loved it. i am rather surprised with low rating people give it, so i uprate it to 9 because I heard IMDb is doing things (I don't know what with 0 and 10). really a good good movie. Nicolas cage is also one of my favourite actor and i missed him by postponing watching this movie. Everyone plays well in this movie, really good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand who this movie is made for. It seems to be tailored to insular folk who think in stereotypes and believe that watching a movie set in a foreign country is exactly the same as having visited the place themselves. The fact that such laziness is peddled by directors actually from that part of the world only because they want to earn some coin, is pretty mercenary.It feels like the perfect example of how artists can strip their original work of anything that may have made it personal or innovative, stick a big-name star in the middle of the resultant mess and gain some quick and undeserved attention from a wider market.Hit-man Nicolas Cage is slick and dangerous. So is his hair. Instead of spending time getting to know his character as a person, the shorthand method of developing sympathy for him is to watch him try to pet an elephant and mumble his way through an excruciatingly slow date with a pretty local girl. Cage has always relied too heavily on movies he can just glide through whilst saying one or two words, so he must've thought he'd hit the jackpot with this one. As a way to make international audiences feel comforted by somewhat familiar trappings, we can always watch the two main male stars engage in a mentor/student relationship, the meatier parts of which are cribbed from better and more successful films such as "Leon". Excited yet? No? Nor was I really, and from the looks of things neither were any of the cast either.The whole thing is a routine exercise from everyone involved, as evidenced by the fact that they managed to persuade Nic 'no premise is too ridiculous these days, so long as I get paid!' Cage to star. He seems to want to be the centre of attention by doing minimal work lately, instead of sharing the limelight with those of equal skill and pitting his acting wits against them.If you decide you might like to watch it, then you'll only be encouraging them - and we can't be having that. It's so sloppy that it's funny enough to have you laughing, but don't tell the makers that, or they'll use it as an excuse and claim that it was intended to be this way. It wasn't. They just quite obviously didn't care, and so there's no reason why you should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Just Falls Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Cage has shown to be a flexible actor with a wide range of movies showing his talents to adapt to a character in any given film. In this his portrayal works some of the time and fails badly others. The love interest is mainly the biggest problem. Not believable is all I can say. There was a kind of generic cookie cutter flow to this film that bothered me also. The shoot-em-up scenes were like so many others. After seeing the film I felt short-changed expecting more from it. I guess I just expect more for my money and time. One other thing worth mentioning. I never once found redeeming concern for any of the other characters in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those rare movies where the dullness surpasses the badness. Nicolas cage, for those who didn't notice it already, is willingly in the process of committing cinematic suicide and with his latest entry has tightened the knot to choking level.I was never a big fan of his films, but surely they weren't all as bad as Bankok Dangerous. A tedious, completely unbelievable film in which he plays a top notch assassin who, for no reason to be fathomed, drops all his principles that made him one of the best in the field. of course it's all downhill from there and that would include the script, sequencing and ending.If I had been the executive responsible for green lighting this film, I would have buried the finished product in a deep hole or sent it directly to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the worst movie to come out in years. Production values of a junior high school 8 mm hand held. Cage races through this with the look of a man trying to get off this set asap. It is an exaggeration to use the word plot, the screenplay has less suspense than watching somebody paint a fence. The so called plot turns were painful to watch, and the "arty" grainy washed out look of this film was probably an attempt to save a few bucks by producers who belatedly realized they had been steering this overloaded barge onto the rocks. For the first time ever, I actually asked for my money back after seeing this dreadful film. I got it. Why did I see it in the first place? I heard Mr. Cage on the Adam Corolla show. Nick and Adam, you owe all of us a huge apology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous (2008): Dir: The Pang Brothers / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Shahkrit Yamnarm, Nirattisai Kaljaruek, Panward Hemmanee, Charlie Yeung: Action thriller about placement. Nicolas Cage plays an assassin in Bangkok who wishes to get out of the business. Problem is he gets involved with outsiders. He becomes romantically interested in an Asian girl who works at a pharmacy. Directed by the Pang Brothers with a lot of repetition and a surprise ending that doesn't justify a whole lot. The film exists mainly as a parade of bullets and mindless violence all done as stylistically as possible. Cage does well as someone wishing to return to normality. He is eventually placed at a crossroad where he can either gain freedom or grant another their freedom. The conclusion is a downer and pretty much wrecks the film. Shahkrit Yamnam is interesting as Cage's chosen errand boy. Cage will train him but the results land them both in hot water when they are targeted. The villains exist to be shot dead. The leader is played by Nirattisai Kaljaruek and he is as lifeless as the bodies he leaves behind. Finally there is a cardboard role by Panward Hemmanee as a dancer. The production is on par and one of the few good points of this deadbeat film. Pointless onslaught of carnage presents nothing more than the umpteenth action snooze fest that is only dangerous to common sense. Score: 5 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cold prodding assassin movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe (Nicolas Cage) is a professional hit man looking for a final job. He arrives in Bangkok to do four hits in one location for crime boss Surat. He hires local disposable hustler thief Kong. He falls for deaf pharmacist Fon. He gets each target in a briefcase. The second briefcase gets opened. Kong realizes that Joe is an assassin and asks to be trained by him.The pervasive dark blue photography gets a bit tiresome. I do like the exotic location of Bangkok and its foreign modernity. It doesn't really have the style or action to elevate this. Most of these foreign action movies have more exciting action and people expect it now. The movie is left with a cold performance from Cage and a simple assassin story. The love story doesn't take off either with such a detached character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BANGKOK DANGEROUS is a remake of a Thai film which, despite having the same directors, is nonetheless much worse. The plot sees Nic Cage travelling with his wig to Thailand to do four hits. As is always the case with movie hit men he's a lone gunman with a series of pseudo- moral rules, one of which is never to get close to people. With tiresome inevitability he breaks that rule as he falls in love with a deaf-mute Thai woman, in what must be the creepiest romance of recent years, and starts to train his local guide as a hit-man. Needless to say, this doesn't turn out well, especially once he realises who his final target is. Thankfully the liberal application of firepower saves the day, albeit that there's no happy ending. Sadly this is a thriller that is totally without thrills, which doesn't even make good use of its interesting location.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired Hit Man, Tired Story, Fresh Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Bangkok Dangerous," Hong Kong's Pang Brothers breathed new life into an old story with a remake of their own 2000 film of the same title. While the earlier film was entirely Asian, the brothers hired American film star Nicholas Cage and reworked the original characters and story for the remake. The result is a gritty, fast moving action flick that breaks no new ground, but will hold viewers' attention with an Asian take on a familiar gangster tale.Cage is Joe, an aging professional hit man, who heads for Thailand to take on his last four assignments before retirement. A laconic loner, Cage lives by rules that dictate no personal involvement, and he routinely cleans up after a job by eliminating any co-workers. Inexplicably, Joe violates his rules in Bangkok, not only becoming friend and mentor to his assistant, Kong, played by handsome Thai actor Shahkrit Yamnarm, but also becoming romantically involved with a deaf-mute pharmacist, sensitively portrayed by Hong Kong actress Charlie Yeung. While softening his posture with Kong could be understood as a passing of the torch before his retirement, the romance with Yeung is entirely out of character, and even Cage seems uncomfortable in his scenes with the much younger actress. The pair are an odd couple, and the romance completely implausible. With Joe's lack of either Thai or sign language skills and her inability to speak or hear or understand English, viewers will wonder how they communicate at all. Needless to say, after Joe violates his own professional rules by befriending his assistant and romancing a deaf-mute pharmacist, the game changes drastically.Although some scenes were shot in the famous floating market, the seedy side of Bangkok is emphasized and figures prominently throughout the film; this is not the Bangkok of temples and palaces, and the Thai tourist board was undoubtedly displeased. The dark grainy cinematography by Decha Srimantra further emphasizes the shady side of the Thai capital. In one interesting sequence, the Pangs mimic the Zapruder footage of the Kennedy assassination to good effect. Cage gives a solid, if unexciting, performance and looks appropriately tired and pasty. Cage again proves himself an able action star and holds the film's focus; his Asian support is largely unexceptional, although both Shahkrit and Charlie are attractive performers. The Pangs have brought an Asian eye to a tired American story and gave it a fresh look. A relatively short film, "Bangkok Dangerous" should satisfy Cage fans and those seeking a fast-paced action movie, who can overlook flaws in the script and character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bangkok Dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film during the time of its release, and I predicted because of the leading actor that it was going to be rated terribly by the critics, but I had no idea it was a remake of a Thai film, so I was going to chance it. Basically Joe (Nicolas Cage) is a professional American hit-man who has travelled to Bangkok for his latest assignments, he has been paid to assassinate four people during the month that he is staying, all of them he is killing for Bangkok gang lord Surat (Nirattisai Kaljaruek). To help him with his jobs he hires pickpocket Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) to do his errands, the hit-man gets his four target details from nightclub dancer Aom (Panward Hemmanee) with whom Kong becomes romantically involved with, and the young thief learns to follow his given instructions. To make sure he cannot be found Joe sticks to a set of rules for a hit-man to follow, and he kills his targets in crowded or lesser known places to avoid detection, including his first in a traffic jam and his second being drowned in a penthouse swimming pool. Away from his work he visits a pharmacy and becomes fascinated with the deaf pharmacist assistant Fon (Charlie Yeung), which name means "rain", and over the weeks he takes her out for dinner and other dates, he falls madly in love with her, but she has no idea of his name, nationality or profession. The relationship is cut short when she witnesses him kill two assailants in cold blood, but Joe must continue to his third kill, and Kong joins him, but it does not go to plan when it turns into a chase, but he catches up to the target and kills him in front of witnesses. Joe's fourth and final target is a good man, the Prime Minister of Thailand, so he has decide between his morals and following orders to avoid being killed, he eventually goes against instructions and becomes the target of the gang members, but they are taken out with explosives. Joe must save Kong and Aom from the headquarters of the gang, he kills most of the members, and he knows the only way to stop the brutality is to kill the man who hired him, so he briefly returns to Fon to show his affection from a distance, then with one bullet left he takes Surat and fires through both his and the gang lord's head. Also starring Dom Hetrakul as Aran and James With as Chicago. Cage is a suitable choice playing the moody and skilled assassin, admittedly with an odd Ken Dodd hairstyle, and Yamnarm is funny as the inquisitive but loyal errand boy, the target killing is good, the love story between the killer and the deaf girl is just about interesting, and the sights oh Thailand are nice, it is a bit slow occasionally, lacks some originality and overdoes things a little, but it is slick and cool enough to keep you watching, an alright action thriller. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically an extended advertisement for Bangkok</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing that I can say about this movie it is that it is an advertisement for Bangkok. Okay, one might wonder if a film about a hit man strutting his stuff and killing people can really be an advertisement, but since the movie seems to take you to a number of place (not the Tiger Temple though) that are touristy in Bangkok then it simply came across as pretty much an advertisement. Mind you, through in a big name actor like Nicholas Cage and you are guaranteed an audience.A lot of people did not like this movie and I can tell why. It is little more than your standard, run of the mill, movie about a hit man. The movie opens with our protagonist telling us that he has four rules that he follows, and then proceeds to break all of them. However what people don't seem to realise is that right at the beginning we learn that he has a desire to settle down because he is always on the move and he is never able to form relationships with anybody, namely because of his job. I guess it is a part of all of us, especially if we are disconnected from society the way he is. To say that everybody desires relationships though is a broad statement that does not hold up to reality. There are a lot of people out there that pretty much shun any form of connections with other human beings, usually because they have been hurt so much by people's selfishness that they simply do not want to connect.We don't know much about this guy though, but then that is probably because the character, and the movie itself, is so shallow. He does mention that he sees something of himself in the guy that he takes on as a student, but that is pretty much about it. The ending of the film is supposed to be sad, but then since this movie is a rather shallow movie that comes across as an extended advertisement then any emotional aspects are simply not going to work. This is an okay movie to watch, once, and probably that is it. I do not see people wanting to pull it out at a video night, unless they want to see an extended advertisement of Bangkok wrapped around the story of a hit-man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"My name is Joe. This is what I do."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't comment on this movie without first recalling the fine 1994 assassin movie, "Leon The Professional." Whether the idea for this movie, originally made in 1999 with a Thai cast, was influenced by "Leon" I don't know, but there clearly is a parallel. In both we have contract assassins who are highly trained and highly effective, and who lead a lonely life because it is dangerous if people know who you are.Here Nicolas Cage is simply Joe, and his personal guideline is "don't take an interest in people outside work". After an opening scene to establish his character, he travels to Bangkok to do one final set of jobs, 4 of them, and it seems he plans to just fade away and enjoy his fortune that had been deposited for him in foreign banks.While there is ample action in this movie, and we see Joe's method for getting instructions for the next job, the story is really about the character Joe, how he really longs for some real human contact and, as in "Leon" this human caring gets him into a bind that he cannot easily get out of. It appears he violates his own Rule 4, "Quit before you lose your edge and become the hunted."I like Nic Cage, he is one of my favorites for almost any role from strict comedy to strict drama. He is good here as the conflicted assassin. His temporary assistant in Bangkok is Shahkrit Yamnarm as Kong who is hired as the go-between to get instructions for the next contract. Like Portman's character in "Leon", Kong wants to learn the craft and Joe begins to teach him.As the story unfolds Joe is slightly injured during one job and goes to a Bangkok pharmacy to get something to treat his wound. There he is helped by a pretty deaf/mute young lady and he takes a non-professional interest in her, violating his own guideline.MAJOR SPOILERS: The Bangkok boss who has been giving Joe his contracts decides to hunt Joe down. Joe, being highly trained gets the upper hand and at the boss's hideout manages to wipe out all his men. But in a final scene, Joe and the boss are in a car together, and find themselves cornered by the police. Joe puts his head next to the boss's head, and with one pistol shot through his own temple kills himself and the other man a the same time. He had no place to go. Like Leon, sacrificing himself to get the bad guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whether you live in Bangkok or not, well, this won't make sense to you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To date, this may be the first 5/10 I gave to a movie in some time. Is Bangkok Dangerous really that bad? No. Is there anything good? Yes, but everything good about this movie is falling apart, sadly.I like both Nicolas Cage and Charlie Young, I live in Bangkok and I loved all the old school actions especially John Woo stuff.So in some sense I should love this movie. But the movie seems so pretending when it tries to tell a not-convincing-at-all story. Basically it's about a hire-for-kill guy Joe played painfully by Cage, who travels to Bangkok for a high-profit job. In the process he can't help falling in love with a pharmacy girl(Charlie Young) and builds a friendship with his helper/apprentice. When the job went sour, he had to choose between escaping or, well, you already know what's going to happen.About the story, my summary could be like this: A foreign killer tried to derive the purest love in the world from a corrupted metropolitan. After he failed, he was so angry that he had to abandon all his principles as a killer and risk his life killing an irrelevant mobster.Absurd isn't it? That's maybe the underlying logic of this story. Maybe you don't have to live in Bangkok to know the truth, that this city doesn't produce innocence. No,foreigners come here for horny, jumpy and sexy Thai girls, not for someone innocent like Charlie Young.Moreover, Bangkok doesn't re-habit cold-blooded foreigners into righteous, emotional people. What you will learn in Bangkok is everything can be compromised, when the price is right. There are still far too many false messages in the movie, making Bangkok Dangerous a below-the-average one in its genre.About the performance,Nicolas Cage should never have played any roles like this in my opinion. He looks too nice to play a cold-blooded killer. His manner is what ultimately hinders him from delivering convincing performance. Throughout the movie he never felt comfortable with the set, the actions and other actors. He is probably more confused with the whole thing than the audiences, experiencing all the "culture shock" in Bangkok. Charlie young definitely is gorgeous, but she doesn't make common sense in Bangkok, either. You can obviously tell the difference between her and Thai girls in the movie, despite she can do much better than just pretending to be a deaf girl.I didn't see the original, but have read the synopsis provided by other users and I can already tell the original is way better. So, go for the original instead of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors. But every once in a while, he can't help but disappoint some of his fans and the disappointment comes in this remake of a Thai film of the same name, "Bangkok Dangerous". For every Leaving Las Vegas and Adaptation. there's Next and Bangkok Dangerous. That's just science. I have never seen Nic Cage in his worst form ever. The enthusiasm just wasn't there. There's no life in him when you see him on screen, it seemed like his life force was sucked dry and there's no inspiration in his performance.The supporting cast didn't help at all. From the totally misplaced love angle to the "student-teacher" bond he has with the street punk character, there was no connection. The storyline suffers from the ill-conceived action scenes and it just became one of those generic action flicks that comes and goes. I believe the highest point of the movie has got to be the ending, I'm afraid that was the only way to end it. Its not grand, shocking or memorable in any way but it felt like a nice conclusion to this tiresome of an action flick. Go see the original version instead, I hear its much better.</fullReview>

The linoleum covering the floor there is particularly mystical. Hugely corrupt, the laws in Thailand depend entirely on how much money you have, the more money, the less laws.

He was a producer on this film, you'd think he would say 'no. people have heard this enough'. If you like that kind of thing it fits a lot better into 'Lord of War'.Since I watched this on video, I may have failed to enjoy the scenery of Bangkok as much as I might at the cinema and the final (ridiculously improbable) action scenes may have been diminished.I did however, find the conclusion more satisfying than most films of this genre and the elephant is very good.If you like 'lone assassin falls for the girl', watch 'hitman' instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing they could get Nicholas Cage out of his trailer for this one. He looked such a fright it's surprising he would emerge at all and the action was so corny and half-baked there was little enough to motivate him. Like Liam Neeson in Taken, Cage plays the one-man special-ops brigade who slaughters untold numbers of men in a one-way journey, except Cage's professional hit-man finds his way to a self-inflicted bullet in the brain --- which is rather like the film's final effect on the viewer. It's hard to know what audience the film-makers had in mind: males, presumably, and young enough to have a computer-game attitude to violent death. But if it was aimed at males, you can't help wondering why the soppy love-interest in a city overflowing with sex for sale. If this was for the female dates on the arms of the target males, I don't think it worked, because she did not like him and rejected him decisively half-way through the action. So much for the love story. This was a peculiarly inane movie in a fairly inane genre, and if you've seen one US hyper-man taking on a foreign country and murdering half the population, you've seen 'em all. Forget this one.</fullReview>

I think, critics are too generous. Some reviews that correctly state that this is a bad-bad-bad movie still score it 5 stars. Why? I am giving it two stars because I do not want it to be #1 from either end, as in "it is so bad that even in a Worst Movie competition it would take the second place".There are several reviews explaining in detail why it is bad - too dark, slow, stupid "love" scenes, no dialog for extensive periods of time, supposedly skilled hit-man unable to hit target. In the boat chase scene the bad guy has better luck shooting even though he is steering the boat AND shooting while Joe The Bad Ass Assassin is just shooting.In any case, for me it set the low benchmark. Now I can say "Well, it's bad, but at least it is not as bad as Bangkok Dangerous."</fullReview>

He leaves traces all over the place, he falls in love and he begins teaching a student while on an assignment. How stupid can you get?I understand they probably wanted to have some sort of drama here with the love story and the student, but that just falls flat on the face when your character isn't believable in the slightest.Other than the ridiculous main character crippling the story, the action isn't stellar, either.Overall, very forgettable.

Mind you, "Kiss of Death" and "Guarding Tess" run close seconds as Cage's all-time worst, with "8MM" and "Amos &amp; Andy" trailing not far behind. Typically, Cage plays likable, sympathetic losers, even when they thrive on the wrong side of the law like "Matchstick Men." Sometimes, he accepts serious roles like "Leaving Las Vegas" where he won a Best Actor Oscar for playing an alcoholic. Occasionally, he handles either firearms as in "The Rock," "Face/Off," and "Windtalkers," or he sells them as in "Lord of War." Usually, Cage is a nice guy.Nothing is remotely nice about the globe-trotting, amoral, cold-blooded, angst-ridden contract assassin that Cage portrays in the Pang Brothers' movie "Bangkok Dangerous" with its predictable, potboiler plot and its depressing turn of events. The ending ranks as really rotten, especially if happy endings are a must. Furthermore, "Bangkok Dangerous" with its tarnished view of crime and corruption in Thailand isn't about to encourage tourism. For the record, the Hong Kong born twins Oxide and Danny Pang have taken their stunning original "Bangkok Dangerous" and made changes to it that do not pass muster. When you consider that the hero in the brilliant 1999 masterpiece was a mute, hearing impaired Thai native, you can see the damaging changes that occurred to accommodate a Hollywood icon like Cage."Bangkok Dangerous" begins in Prague with Cage's character Joe describing his life as an assassin: "My job has me traveling a lot. I live out of a suitcase. The work is steady and the money is good and I do what I'm told, but it's not for everybody. I eat alone. I sleep alone." According to Joe, he has four rules. First, obey the rules. Second, shun friendship. Third, leave no incriminating evidence. Fourth, quit while you are ahead." Joe keeps up this conspicuous voice-over narration throughout "Bangkok Dangerous." After all, he has nobody else to confide in except the audience. His leading lady turns out to be a deaf mute. Anybody who saw the Jason Statham thriller "The Transporter" knows from the start that our "Bangkok Dangerous" protagonist is going to violate his own rules.Joe climbs a bell tower, plugs his ears, and loads a telescopic, high-powered rifle to execute a prisoner at Prague's police headquarters. Not only did Joe choose the bell tower because it overlooks the police station, but Joe also times his shots to coincide with the tolling bell. Afterward, at his motel room, Joe pays off his drug-addled gofer and then zaps the guy with a tazer. Joe pumps the gofer full of heroin, abandons him on the carpet of his suite to die, framing him for the crime. Joe flies off to Bangkok to perform four hits. He plans for these to be the final four.Joe settles in at a residence off the beaten path. Later, he tours Bangkok's mean streets in search of a gofer. He spots a harmless looking Thai guy chatting with American tourists. Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm of "Belly of the Beast") secretly slices through their travel pouches with a razor while he chit-chats with them and steals their wallets. Joe hires Kong to run errands and serve as a translator. Joe and Kong get off to a rough start. Kong runs a red light while carrying a suitcase from Joe's employer, crime boss Surat (newcomer Nirattisai Kaljaruek), who is already suspicious about Joe. Surat's second-in-command assures him that the Russians swear by Joe. Meanwhile, a gang mugs Kong on his way back from a Bangkok bar rendezvous and pick-up and he narrowly escapes capture.Joe and Kong strike up a friendship. Kong asks Joe to teach him how to kill. Violating his own rules, Joe tutors Kong. Later, Joe arms himself with a Mac-10 submachine gun, straddles a motorcycle, and hurtles through congested Bangkok traffic to an intersection where his targets await him in an idling car. Joe swerves in front of the car and riddles the occupants with his machine gun. Everybody dies. Speeding away from the shooting, he grazes his arm on a roadside obstruction. Joe visits a local pharmacy. A deaf mute pharmacist, Fon (Charlie Yeung of Jet Li's "Meltdown"), tries to help him. He shows her his abraded arm. She recommends the proper medicine, and Joe becomes infatuated with her.Joe carries out his second job. He takes care of an odious gangster who buys and sells teenage girls into prostitution. Joe revisits the pharmacy and invites Fon to dinner. Later, he meets Fon's mom and lies to them that he is a banker. While Fon and he stroll through a garden one evening, two thugs rob Joe, but he guns them down. Naturally, Fon hears nothing, but she discovers the blood of one of the dead men on her blouse and flees in horror. Meanwhile, Surat believes that he will be safer if he has Joe killed after the American performs the last two hits."Swing Vote" scenarist Jason Richman reverses the leads from the original. Joe can hear and speak, but Fon is the deaf mute. Actually, this Nicolas Cage remake of "Bangkok Dangerous" bears considerable resemblance to the vintage Charles Bronson hit-man classic "The Mechanic" (1972) where a lone assassin trained a protégé and paid for his mistake with his life. "The Mechanic" contained ten times more excitement than "Bangkok Dangerous." Ironically, the Pang Brothers made the original "Bangkok Dangerous" with its poetic visuals, savagely raw violence, and far more credible plot. Sadly, they've bungled their own material. The original "Bangkok Dangerous" remains a thousand times better than this unconvincing, half-cocked, fish-out-of-water remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who kidnapped the real Nick Cage and replaced him with this talentless hairpiece wearing yahoo!? The old talent from flicks such as Raising Arizona and Moonstruck is dead and buried - Cage's movies of more recent years are an true embarrassment.This cringe inducing turd is unwatchable even by Cage's recent standards. I cannot make this warning any clearer, do not attempt to watch this movie, it cannot be saved by any group of friends with their popcorn &amp; beer, it is irredeemable (not a case of so bad its good, just pure bad). Cage must have just enjoyed his Thai vacation for the most part, and just gone along with whatever script/director would foot the bill on this one, otherwise I can't imagine anyone reading this script and wanting to be a part of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems as if a strong force among the general public really wants this movie to fail but it was quite good. It's got some standard action in it, with a few very well done action shots, but really this is a character piece, not a thriller or a roller-coaster. People who understand this going into the theaters are really going to enjoy this film. People that have other, predefined, expectations going into this theater probably aren't going to be satisfied with the films unusual pacing. I went in just expected it would be good and I got more than what I paid for.A solid movie for the disenfranchised, I give it high marks for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, there I went to see this movie with my brother. I like Cage as an actor and ofcorse he has some lame movies but most of them I like. Not this one.There is a story in this movie but it never 'catches' you as a person among the audience. Why ? Because action- and emotion-scenes instantly follow each other up before you have the time to 'get in' the scene.Example; When the scene starts that Joe has to eliminate his first target your thought is 'Finally, we are getting some action!', but then, 3 minutes later he needs medicines of a local apothecary where he meets this girl and he is that kind too her that you just don't believe that he just taken out his first target. By the time you are getting into the emotion-like-scene you are once of a sudden facing his preparations for his 2nd elimination.So basically, what is missing in this movie is the proper followup of scenes and the moment you are realizing that you start to hope that the end is something special and although it's quite a good end, it can't compare the 90 minutes you seen before it.Based on what I typed here you, as reader, might think I am only negative about this movie and that it is total crap which is untrue as well.The story is new and fresh but I still think they could combine the 2 story lines, joe being a killer and joe being in love which lead into 1 at the end, a bit better so it is more clear that the 2 story lines are merging to 1 then just making it clear to the audience in 1 scene.That's why the movie became predictable when you realize how the story is being told. Like more productions of 2008, the story is good but they should have worked it out better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I had in mind was that since the Pang brothers mostly direct horror movies, I thought this should be Bangkok Ghostly. It should be a horror movie focusing in Bangkok rather than a action thriller. Anyway, It is interesting that some directors have the guts to not only direct their specific genres but to try and direct other genres. Bangkok Dangerous is a remake directed by the Pang brothers. The movie does give you the gritty feeling like the movies directed by them. It is quite gloomy too.The story: It is action-packed. I would not call it an action movie but rather call a thriller. It does not boast great action scenes but it is quite thrilling and there is some suspense. I have no idea but Nicolas Cage is funny in this movie. It is always funny to see his confused and stunned looks. I don't know whether that is a bad thing but it spoils the dark feeling of this movie. Other than that, it is good with the thrilling music.Overall: It is not bad for a Pang brothers movie as we all know that they did their specific genre, horror, good but if it is directed by some other big-action directors, it will be disappointing. Those who are the Pang brothers fans, this would probably be interesting. Those looking for a big plus non-stop action movie, this will probably be a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of this film is an easy one: a hit man has an assignment in Bangkok and during that assignment he finds out he's come to the last stage of being a hit man. He's crossing the rules of the business. This story, although simple, can be the base for a film. The Matador (2005) for instance was a good example of a similar story in a film. That film worked very well. This one does not.For me this film does not work because of two major factors: 1) it is hard, if not impossible, to grow some liking/sympathy for the lead character, and 2) it is as boring as the average re-run of a soap series. Cage is playing on auto-pilot, not trying anything impressive and the rest of the cast is just running along on the same pace and that doesn't do the trick.This is a remake of a Thai film and although I've not seen that one yet I highly recommend everyone to watch that one instead. It must be a dozen times better than this one.3 out of 10 hit men falling asleep at the job due to utter boredom</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lean, loud gnarly self-remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pang twins have done a Hollywood remake of their own 1999 film about a solitary hit man who gets into deep trouble when he becomes less solitary. Nicolas Cage plays Joe, the hit man. Things are different from the original, which being entirely in Chinese and Thai, had no Americans wandering around in it. But what remains consistent is a chilly, acid blue look, a bleak world view, and a style that is admirably lean and focused. I love the name Oxide; it evokes the look of the Pang's films. In their The Eye, their style was hauntingly hallucinatory. That one had an inferior US remake by somebody else; no such trouble here. This movie is thoroughly enjoyable, if you don't mind the occasional severed limb or trunk. The Pang's material is limited, but they're in excellent control of it and direct with urgent forward momentum. And urgent fatalism: the wages of sin is death. The Pangs are the artiest of committed B-picture filmmakers.In the original version the hit man is Kong, and he's deaf from childhood. He can be a killer partly because he can't hear the shots. He goes to a drug store and meets a pretty young woman who can communicate with him using sign language and a relationship develops. How sad it is when one day she discovers her gentle, sensitive boyfriend is a killer. The same thing happens here but it's the girl, Fon (Charlie Yeung) who is mute, not Joe. Since this more expensive film is noisier than the original Bangkok Dangerous, I missed the moments of intense silence it had. The soundtrack is rather too relentless. But relentless isn't altogether undesirable in a movie of this kind. You don't really ever want it to stop.Joe (Cage) comes to Bangkok to carry out a series of four hits for unseen, unknown bosses. Kong (Thai actor Shahkrit Yamnarm) is Joe's messenger, who picks up assignments and payoffs. While in the original version Kong was the teacher, this time he's the younger man who offers himself to be taught by Joe. This is a lethal, more grownup version of the Karate Kid.Everything about the situation contradicts what Joe says is the hit man code: befriend no one, remain secret, do your job and get out leaving nothing behind. He immediately befriends Kong and the girl; and Kong befriends the nightclub go-go girl he picks up Joe's instructions from and she becomes his girlfriend.But what is right, is Cage's style. He has long greasy hair and a manner and look that combine haggard and steely; he almost looks Asian, and when he tries to blend into a Bangkok crowd it's convincing. He's turning into David Carradine, Tarantino's "Snake Charmer Bill": Caine, "walking the earth." Bangkok Dangerous is rich in what it has to offer: nihilism and violence. This being a bigger budget, there are more crowds, explosions, expensive motorcycles--lots of high speed chases in expensive motorcycles. The Pang twins work 'seriatim,' when they work together (they've also worked apart). That is, first one directs a scene, then the other directs the next scene, and so on. Being twins, they think alike--yet independently. This is an aesthetics of violence. It's all blue, then yellow, and one scene is shot all in red. It's utterly beautiful, and despite the noise and the American, austere. I even thought of the Melville classic, Le Samourai. Alain Delon might not recognize himself in Nicolas Cage, but there is the same lack of affect. Purists may scorn Cage for World Trade Center and the National Treasure franchise. But he still verges often on interesting projects--e.g., Windtalkers, Matchstick Men, The Wicker Man, The Weather Man, Lord of War (the latter a sort of preparation for this), and most importantly Kaufman's brilliant mind-bender Adaptation. Cage works too much, you can say, but his B-pictures are good ones--or self-consciously, archly B B-pictures, like the Fu Manchu episode in Grindhouse (also an ironic preparation for this movie). It's because Cage is a Hollow Man that he is perfect for this doomed role. Clive Owen would have ruined it.The US press has shredded this movie (in England it seems to have done better). The question arises: how high can you rate a B-picture? We have to consider that this is also a remake that has lost some of the integrity of the original, even though both were done by the same directors. Under the circumstances I might give this a 7/10, but to counteract Bangkok Dangerous's bad press I'm giving it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit-man Nicolas Cage is in Bangkok to make 4 hits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bangkok Dangerous" is a good neo-noir, above-par in certain respects. I'd like to rate it 6.5 It doesn't warrant deeply negative reviews, because the story holds together and it's well-acted. It comes across as a modest b-film, and yet its estimated budget was $40 million. I'm not sure what ate up so many dollars. The film has good location photography, even a boat and motorcycle chase through the river market.Nicolas Cage, an actor I've always found to be very skilled and watchable in a variety of roles, here plays a hit-man who has come to Bangkok to do 4 hits. He receives his instructions and targets one by one and through intermediaries, so that his employer is unknown.The movie does a very good job in story and character development of Cage. Cage has rules he follows to survive in this tough trade. However, he wants this to be his last job we learn at the outset. That shows already that he has reached a kind of emotional limit and is susceptible to changes and other influences than coldblooded assassinations. That's what the story is about, showing how he begins to break his own rules, how he starts drawing new lines, how he becomes emotionally involved, and how he craves some kind of a link to the future. His character arc and actions are well-explained and shown. However, he is not master of his own fate because of the actions of other characters beyond his control.The movie is definitely noir, both in story and filming. In fact, the climactic sequence is filmed very darkly. The action is reasonably clear despite the darkness, but a few portions remain unclear because the lights have been turned out. In these parts, the filmmakers chose not to use sources of light such as John Alton may have used. This gives way to more light as the sequence proceeds so that we can follow the action to its climax.Cage is assisted very nicely by a character named Kong (Shahkrit Yarmnarm) and a love interest named Aom (Panward Hemmanee).I liked this film, finding it to have an intelligently conceived neo-noir character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe, an international hit man who follows a simple code, arrives in Bangkok for his last contract - four kills and then retirement. He hires Kong, a local street hustler, to run his errands, and he gets to work. By the second hit, Joe has started violating his four rules, losing his anonymity, leaving behind traces, and getting emotionally involved. Only one rule remains intact: don't ask questions. Can Joe regain control and get out alive....If you are a Nicolas Cage fan his films always lie in two camps, the one where he puts in a good performance and people seem to like, or the one you know will be critically mauled, but you know you'll like anyway.And this one falls into the latter category. Its easy to understand why it failed and critiqued so badly, it looks cheap, Cage looks asleep half the time, and it's always a bad idea for a director to remake a film by themselves, its as if they owe a debt the their original film so make this one half heartedly, see also: The Vanishing.But it's short, there are a few good set pieces, and cages hair puts in the best performance ever.If you don't think Cage is one of the most entertaining actors working today, you will probably hate this.But if your a fan, you'll cope with this misstep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BANGKOK DANGEROUS.It was good, but not brilliant.There are 2 problem I have with this movie really... 1) I am not a huge fan of Nicolas Cage. All of his roles are the same. He can't change his character. But he has made some fantastic films. My favourite Nicolas Cage film is Face Off. 2) I don't know why all these films have to me remade. I love some Asian films yet a lot of them have been remade... and they are never better than the originals. Prime example is Ring... I love the Asian version, but I hated the American version. They murdered that movie.But, this remake was pretty good. It was entertaining and full of action. The action scenes were really well put together, and the hits Nicolas makes in the film were shot brilliantly.The film is about an assassin who has his own set of rules... all of a sudden he decides to break all his own rules in one go, while still doing the jobs.Nicolas Cage was OK in it, but like I said before, he didn't change anything from his last few roles... except his silly haircut in this. It really does not suit him. Haha!I have seen the original, but it was many years ago and don't remember too much about it. But I will watch it again soon so I can compare again.I like the supporting cast though. Shahkrit Yamnarm who plays Nicolas' sidekick was good and the leading ladies were convincing. Especially Charlie Yeung who plays Nicolas' love interest. I actually felt sorry for her.I give this movie a 7 out of 10.Good film, but i honestly think Nicolas Cage was not the best choice.For more of my movie reviews, please check out my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

The Pang Brothers Screenplay works, but the culmination is very underwhelming. Their Direction, on the other-hand, is stylish. Cinematography is well-done.

Of every film of his I watched since I reckon I've not watched 50% all the way through and the rest i sucked it up and wish I hadn't.With Cage it's a little different even when he is bad by his standards there is always something to watch that makes the journey worth it.Bangkok Dangerous was one of those films, while the acting was only OK, the script passable and the direction just reasonable I stayed interested in the movie and Cage's characters until the end of the movie.Worth the trip to Blockbuster to rent (but not to own).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage has teamed up with the Pang Brothers in a lackluster remake of an even more lackluster original. Bangkok Dangerous (2008) embraces every hit-man cliché imaginable. I would normally suggest skipping a generic title like this, yet I'll make an exception today. The original film is to its remake what hotel coffee is to grocery store brand. I don't drink coffee, but if I did, my preference would presumably be ground roast. Since that isn't a choice, I'll take the generic brand. The original movie spends too long developing a story. If you don't remember it, I'm not surprised. The protagonist (Kong) has no dialog to fill the void. There is no reason not to fast forward. This was corrected in the new version, rather lazily I must say. Now we have Joe as protagonist (Kong's buddy from the first movie) describing the difficulty of his job. Unlike Kong from version 1.0, Joe can speak. It's "lonely," he says after he pulls the trigger and observes his target's death. Not that we care whom he does or doesn't kill. Joe, an American, accepts a job in Bangkok to kill some more random people. He comes with full support of the Russians, whoever they are, which I find very amusing. Anyway, he meets Kong (an antiquity salesman in this version) and starts killing. Kong also becomes his apprentice, despite his admission that all his assistants are temporary. Joe encounters Fon (still a pharmacist) after a good honest day of work, and falls in love. She's the deaf-mute this time. In this relationship, the Pang Brothers provide the greatest tribute to their original film. Fon still leaves Joe after she witnesses him murder two thugs. She is still marginalized to the degree she was in the first movie. Her character has no significance.Joe acts more nobly than Kong did in the first movie. He conforms to Hollywood hero conventions and doesn't murder a good politician. The new Kong calls him a hero, just in case you didn't realize it. It doesn't matter, though. New Joe still kills himself (and the people who wanted him to kill the good guy) after realizing how woeful his life is. Note: neither sidekick character dies. Kong gets Aom at the end.The first film has a protagonist acting out of spite, anger, and hatred. The new one has a protagonist acting out of fear, guilt, and paternalism. In the first movie, we don't know enough about the hero, and, in this one, we know too much. Both flaws originate from a tired story. It simply isn't compelling. Both undesirables feebly counter an incomplete story with a forgettable hero. The Pang Brothers were new filmmakers when they first directed Bangkok Dangerous, with more enthusiasm for the project. Now they are settled within the directors' chair, were creativity dies. Fortunately, this means that we get body shots. Cage doesn't portray enough depth for the original's close-ups. The camera simply follows Joe for the whole movie.Not even Nicolas Cage appears to be taking his role seriously, but why should he? Pawalit Mongkolpisit (first movie's protagonist) brings seriousness to the part. Cage doesn't and looks like an old man (with a wig) trying to relive his youth. His isn't a wooden performance, it's a thoughtless one. Wooden implies tacit unresponsiveness when emotion is warranted. Cage's character isn't wooden because he's an expectation. Cage should at least be praised for not straying from that goal, though he should have. At least the Pang Brothers are improving. They cannot dilute this story any more than they already have. Perhaps when they decide to three-make it in 2020, they'll toss out the script and direct something else. We don't need another Bangkok Dangerous. The second movie's blandness is the average of what all incarnations would be. I'm not willing to sit around and wait for a good Bangkok Dangerous to be made. I've reason to recommend this Bangkok Dangerous over the other, but both are mere time-fillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly entertaining Nicolas Cage wig extravaganza.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous suffers from a lackluster romantic subplot that would've served better if it didn't exist. The reason I start mentioning this is because the amount of Action the movie is suppose to have is substituted for Drama, which is NOT GOOD if the movie doesn't even have well written Drama. Anyways, Bangkok is a clichéd Hit-man movie that you have probably read in a book, or watched in a film, time and time again. You know those movies where the deeply disturbed assassin gets a change of heart? Same exact thing happens here, with clichéd villains and plot points to boot. Nic has seen better times, and has appeared in better films, but with Bangkok he proves that phoning it in is the ultimate way to make money. Hell, ask Sam Jackson. Nic narrates and broodingly grumbles an assortment of passages that are not only unnecessary, but tediously clichéd; All they do is lazily describe a character that has incredible potential to be something memorable, but isn't. He falls in love, and he changes his ways. He gets heartbroken, and he gets angry again. Pleeease. Besides this, the performances by Nic and the supporting cast are decent at best. The Pang Brothers, aka, the guys that did The Messengers have a solid flair for tasty imagery. The problem is that they are working with a redundant script that provides everything but a well written story. My opinion- stay in China.And ... I really don't have nothing else to say about Bangkok Dangerous. If you're an Action fan, then this will probably satisfy your rental needs (the movie is kept at a nice pace, whilst having three good Action sequences). If you aren't, then you will probably hate this. This latest Nic Cage movie is a mediocrity that serves only one purpose- letting you know that it is based on a supposedly superior film. That and Nicolas Cage's wig. It's entrancing. 4.7/10</fullReview>

The screenplay was good, the movie drags a bit in the middle half. The build up to the end was kinda dissatisfactory, I wouldn't want to reveal the end but really I thought it was unnecessary. I liked the romantic angle between Nicolas Cage's character and the deaf mute girl. the girl is the reason why Cage's character develops a conscience and finally instead of killing 'Somebody's bad guy', he goes and kills the real bad guys. Cinematography was good, screenplay was good and the acting was pretty decent as well. Definitely worth a watch at the theater...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't prejudge from other reviews! Very nice and well Executed film and nice plot. If you want good action and love story, this is it! I don't want to spoil anyone, you want assassin and love connection, little suspense, this is very good movie to watch. Nicolas gives well performance and all other casts do well. You don't see Blonde girls, but very nice Asian actress. If you are looking for Nudity, this is not it. I, for one, love to watch Nicolas's movie because there aren't too munnecessary stupid nudity like most of movies these days. This is WHAT DRAMA IS, WITH ACTION, WITHOUT NUDITY. Also, if you are Nicolas fans, it's a MUST SEE. Looking for top 10 global ward movie, go look at Benhur. This is action, drama,spicy, love, friendship. Enjoy everyone^^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bangkok Mildly Threatening.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We just have to accept it for what it is. Comparing BANGKOK DANGEROUS 2008 to its original 1999 version is like comparing American IDOL karaoke wannabes to real vocalists in hardworking rock bands. The original BANGKOK DANGEROUS 1999 - with its unassailable hook of the deaf mute teenage Bangkok hit-man - wipes the floor with 2008's version.The strange fact remains that both films were created by the same writers-directors, Oxide and Danny Pang.Although one is tempted to make jokes about Nic Cage's mullet, or his low-key performance threatening to drive us to severe napping, we must adhere to our sacred task of reviewing movies for the greater good (which does come with provisions in a minor subclause to make jokes about Nic Cage's mullet).Seen with fresh eyes, BANGKOK 2008 is not as shabby as it may seem. The story elements of the original have been juggled around, and it is not as compelling due to Cage's powerful hit-man not having as much of a crutch to overcome as 1999's deaf teenager, but otherwise it is a well-constructed piece of second hand trashiness.Cage is hit-man Joe, in Bangkok for four last kills, narrating he has lost the taste for the job, intending to walk afterwards. He employs young street hustler Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm, coolly Westernized) as his aide, who soon becomes his confidante and student. He falls for Fon (Charlie Yeung), a deaf mute Thai girl who works in a pharmacy. Aom (Panward Hemmanee) is his stripper contact in a nightclub frequented by the bad boss, Surat (Nirattisai Kaljaruek). Surat's last ordered sanction to Joe is a "good man" (as Kong advises), and Joe refuses the hit, opting to go after Surat.Taken as read that GROSSE POINTE BLANK (1997) is the sine qua non of The Modern Hit-man genre for its black humor as much for its brutal subject matter and unique redemptive stance, BANGKOK DANGEROUS goes for the same kind of redemption for its hit-man, without the humor, and incorporates an "Eastern" master-student relationship into the mix, which is more poignant than the actual hetero courtship that the Pang Brothers insert sideways into this movie. I'm not buying the stilted courtship between Fon the religious deaf mute and Joe's middle-aged sociopath hit-man.When Fon takes him to the temple to place fifty separate coins in urns and worship a golden statue, is Joe looking ahead to being "with" this girl and having to endure these superstitions every weekend? Is this killer really going to put up with these inane dalliances after The Getting Of Panty? No. Wasteful non-sequitur montage that could have been better spent making jokes about Nic's mullet.BANGKOK is a melding of Hong Kong/Thai cinema with a glossy Hollywood caress; the Pangs throw their camera amongst the Thai culture of floating markets, colorful streets and loud nightclubs where scores of chorus girls dance in unison WITHOUT taking their clothes off (not buying it!). The Pangs now have good funding, and it shows. Look at the elephants.Joe opens the movie narrating, "Bangkok. It's corrupt, dirty and dense" as we are choking amidst the bombast of traffic and crowds. By the time he arrives in the temple with Fon, he has found quietude. When he meets Kong hustling tourists, Joe narrates that his aide "has to be disposable," and by movie's end, Kong is indispensable as Joe's friend, ally and - in the alternate ending - his savior.I don't usually side with Alternate Endings, as they ruin the payoff with syrup for girlies in focus groups who can't handle the hero having to die at the end - but in this case, when Joe follows the original script, there is really no reason for him to do so, and I actually prefer the Alternate Ending on the DVD for a better payoff.As for that mullet, does Gene Simmons know you have his extra wig, Nic?...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure it's non-stop action, it's predictable, it could never happen, but it never once tries to deny any of that. In fact Bangkok Dangerous embraces it. I enjoyed kicking back and watching Nic Cage do an action movie like this. Thailand serves as a really cool setting and the action sequences are all highly entertaining. I wish he'd get back to doing flicks like The Rock, Face/Off, Gone In Sixty Seconds, etc. One the film's biggest drawbacks is the conclusion of Nic Cages character. The movie seems very influenced by The Professional and The Replacement Killers (though not quite as good). I'd recommend this film to someone who wants a 90 minute adrenaline rush that isn't looking to be overly critical. It definitely had a Hong Kong action feel which is a major plus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Switching from one action scene to the next, the film should have been more intensive, whereas there's an overall apathy that doesn't get to give a real insight of the hit-men world. There are certainly a few good bits of action, mainly the notable floating market scene and the assassination with Thai police in pursuit of Cage. Nevertheless the never dull locations and the decent action cannot overcome the silliness of the plot and the lack of empathy in many characters, or the 360-degree turnabout that derails the little suspense and interest a viewer could find. On the whole the story has never got a real development, so I'd define the film not a failure but something a bit disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to be surprised by a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I keep telling myself that I'm never going to watch another Nicholas Cage movie. I keep saying, I don't really like him as an actor, and his last few vehicles have been awful. Next was bad on so many levels, it felt like I could see the future of how much it was going to bomb. Ghost Rider was one of the worst comic book movies of the last decade, and really could have set the entire genre back 10 years. Luckily that didn't happen. The National Treasure series is so campy that it actually redeems itself by not taking itself too seriously. I'm not going to comment on the Wicker Man.Still, I found myself talked into seeing this movie. It's not as bad as Next or the Wicker Man. It's still not a good film.The cinematography has a washed out, and digital look, and it tries really hard to have a stylized look. I just kept thinking it looks like a cheapened version of the Bourne movies. I did like how it reminded me of the look of the original Hong Kong version of the Eye.I was also pretty engaged at the beginning of the film. The first few sequences are well done. Cage plays an assassin who has had a long career. You're not given too much back story, and that's a good thing. It starts with an assassination of someone in custody in Prague, and the set up for the kill is well done. Cage also does a good job of selling the character at first, even though his Tom Hanks wannabe Da Vinci Code haircut is pretty distracting.Cage even has a pretty chilling piece when he kills his errand boy because he "leaves no traces behind." Unfortunately the originality leaves the movie at this point, and what replaces it is a movie we've seen a thousand times about a bad guy having a change of morality and helping the good guys.The film has some gorgeous shots of Bangkok, and there really are some nice parts of the film that show just how amazing that part of the world is. To see elephants walk through the middle of the city, and in a scene where one is drinking in a canal that has a park was truly a great back drop. They even had a pretty realistic shot of a club. You hardly ever see clubs done right, as in a typical night club, you can barely hear yourself think. That doesn't make a good locale for most movies, as they need to have dialog, but in this movie, that's not the case.I can even commend Shahkrit Yamnarm, who plays Cage's errand boy in Bangkok. He was believable, even though he didn't have much to do.What I cannot fathom, is how in the world, an American man who speaks no Thai, can have a real relationship with a deaf Thai girl!! It made me cringe to watch that relationship try to form. Cage was SO over the top, I saw no way that any woman would want to be around him. He would be blown off as some creepy tourist, and the fact that the girls mother doesn't throw him and his ridiculous hair out on the street, blows my mind. Let alone the fact that she looked half his age. It was just creepy all the way around.The other issue I had, was that in the end Cage decides to impart his knowledge on Kong. They train together, and I know for cinematic effect they have to condense everything, but you just can't teach someone how to fight at that level in 1 month. It just doesn't happen. Even training for several hours a day, it takes months &amp; months to learn hand to hand combat skills.Lastly, the ending. I won't say exactly what happens, but it's impossible to believe. I don't mind moral filled endings, but this just didn't fit the character. There's no way that Cage's character would have made those decisions in that situation. I'm sorry, but it makes no sense.So in the end, if you want to see a better assassin grows a moral compass and does good instead of evil, I have to recommend the higher action, more fun Hit-man.Next time I'll stick to my guns and avoid all 2086 movies that are in pre-production with Nicholas Cage attached to them.</fullReview>

Beside being the lone star of the movie makes it much worse, all the acting was below average. The soundtrack wasn't that good &amp; it reminded me of "Next" soundtrack, which was a very good movie by the way, &amp; I thought this one will be like Next, but it had nothing to do with it, not even close. The only good thing about this movie was the ending, it was one of the very few good movie endings, so real, &amp; unexpected!

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers I guess, but nothing you won't have gathered from the trailer or the back of a DVD cover.This started out surprisingly well despite Nicolas Cage looking even more bizarre than he has in perhaps any other film. At no point was it great, but certainly solid.The script is brave enough to establish him as a genuinely cold-hearted assassin, the plot was interesting, the backdrop too. I also liked every one of the scenes with his sidekick. In particular the awkward romance with the deaf pharmacist was actually very sweet, honest and remarkably subtle for a film of this sort.Perhaps the film should have stayed with that romance, because the hit inevitably goes wrong - hey, at least it wasn't his "one last job"! - and things descend immediately into dull shootouts until the final scene which I'm not sure I fully understood because my brain had died. A real pity, because it's only the last act that lets the film down. It could quite easily have been a handy genre piece.</fullReview>

He gets hooked up with a street hustler for an aide and guide, whom he intends to kill when the job is done. He also meets a deaf mute pharmacist....zzzzzzzzzzz.What sorry was I sleeping? Slow brooding film is too slow and brooding. It put me right out. Which isn't normal for the Pangs who create films that make you want to watch to the end even if the material isn't very good.

I did not try to find the hidden meaning.We watched it because it had guns, assassins, and hopefully a lot of cool action. I have never been so wrong. For the 1st half of the movie, I didn't even see where the R rating came from. There was a conspicuous lack of bad language, and very little violence for an assassin movie. Not to say that I look for these things in movies, however, it was almost unrealistically clean cut. Then the second half happened, when a man has his arm amputated by a boat propeller, and another man is blown in half by a grenade. Other than that, there was no cool action except Cage shooting people in dimly lit warehouses. If you are looking for deep meaning, do not see this movie. If you are immature like me, and like to watch gratuitous violence, do not see this movie.The premise is bad, the script is bad, the cast is bad, the acting is bad, plot is bad, the title is bad, the ending is bad, the pathetic attempt at romance is bad, the plot holes are bad, the action is bad.

		<fullReview>Joe is an anonymous hit-man who is known by nobody and does his job with ruthless efficiency. He is in Bangkok for four hits before leaving again. As usual he finds an errant boy that is willing to work for cash, ask no questions and be disposable and he goes about his business. Something about the errant boy (Kong) makes him agree to teach him his trade though, and soon the two are training together. At the same time, a visit to a chemist's sees Joe meeting a deaf mute girl who seems to offer him something more pleasant than his life of killing. This softening of his rules makes him happy for once, but at the same time the nature of his work means that any looseness is a dangerous thing.Like everyone else, I went to see this film figured that, although not great, it'll probably deliver some good action sequences within an obvious plot. Sadly the reality was different and, despite the subject matter, the Bangkok Dangerous remake is a terribly dull film with almost nothing to recommend it for. Let's start with the plot. The plot is essentially the old "hitman gets a heart and risks everything" story and here we have Joe finding more to life in relationships ? in particular one he builds with the deaf mute girl. In itself this is not a bad idea and anyone moaning about this plot or device has clearly never seen how good it can be done in the work of Takeshi Kitano. This is not a Kitano film though and instead of developing this thread, it is just dolloped onto the screen without worrying whether it works or not. It takes good actors and direction to make this (the heart of the film) work and it seems we have neither here. Not sure what the director's told them but the girl in question just smiles while Cage is just plain awful ? there is nothing between Cage, the girl or Kong to explain why he has any connection to them emotionally.Indeed generally Cage is a massive problem in the film because the days where he was fun or interesting appear to have long gone and here he appears to know it. His performance is dull throughout and I do not mean that he is "dead inside" in the way that he is trying to be, but just that he is dull. I'm not sure if he has seen any Kitano but this is what he should have aimed for (particularly in the relationship stuff). His lumpy presence sucks the life out of the film and he cannot do anything to engage the audience ? hence the ending, which should have impact, has nothing and the film limps off the screen. He is also poor in the action, although this is not all him as it seems to be directed by people who have only see it done by others. Now, I know this is not the case and I have added the original to my rental list to see for myself if this had been done better before, but here the Pang's have no fluidity, no thrills, no nothing ? even the cinematography seems to miss the "gritty urban" feel it is aiming for an ends up just being murky to no benefit.The Bangkok Dangerous remake is a poor film. It is not so screamingly bad that you can take that away from it but just that it is dull as dull can be. Nothing really works in it whether it be the action or the emotional core of the story and it doesn't help one bit to have Nicholas Cage as the charisma black-hole at the heart of it all. I will check out the original just out of interest but I have no doubt that I will never be watching the remake again as it is as dull as it is poor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe (Cage), an Assassin, is on his last assignment in Bangkok to take out 4-enemies of the local crime boss there. Whenever an Assassin tells you the rules he lives by, you can be sure by the end of the movie, he will have broken at least two of them. Sorry, you will have to watch the movie to find out which two. This held me because things weren't always as predictable as I envisioned and that's a good thing. Joe picks Kong (Yamnarm) to run errands for him and falls for Fon (Young), a deaf mute woman. We see Joe changing from a hard-nosed assassin to someone with some humanity within him, but he still doesn't forget why he is in Bangkok. Joe is a pro. Nicolas Cage is a terrific actor and I am not sure if he picked up the "stare" from Keanu Reeves or wheter Reeves got it from Cage. Either way, I love it. That "stare" by both says volumes. The cinematography around Bangkok is quite good. The acting by all is on the mark, and the dialogue is realistic. On the down side, the boat chase goes on for too long as does the shoot-out at the factory later on. I guess it's safe to say all chases and shoot-outs go on for too long and we are not sure why. All in all, however, this is quite enjoyable.Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't planning going to the movies at all when Bangkok Dangerous was released. The movie didn't catch my attention that much. I also read a lot negative reviews on the movie and that concerned me a bit. I went and saw the movie since Nicolas Cage was in it. Despite having a great actor in the film, I didn't enjoy the movie that much at all.Nicolas Cage plays Joe, an unknown assassin, whose is in Bangkok, Thailand to kill a bunch of bad guys. He hires a teenage boy (Kong) to be the messenger for his job. Whatever Joe tells him to do, the Kong does it. Joe starts training Kong since he kept asking Joe to train him the basic things of an assassin. While in his mission, Joe falls in love with a young beautiful woman who works in a medicine store. He then realizes that falling in love was a mistake and things quickly start getting out of hand.The story was okay until the plot of the young woman brought in. I don't if she was deaf or didn't speak English, but every time she was in a scene, I got annoyed. I was basically praying that a scene with the girl didn't pop out, but it did and I got more annoyed. I also didn't like the way the movie ended. In my opinion, it felt questions open and I was really disappointed.The performances in the movie were at least better than the story. Nicolas Cage was good as Joe and I wasn't surprised or disappointed either. The Asian actor was alright as Kong. He seems to fit his character well, but he didn't act well enough.The action scenes were good, but they could have been better. There are some action scenes that I felt were kind of short. The scenes were enjoyable until they stop and move on to different boring scene. It seems every time I enjoy something about a particular scene, they move to the next scene and I lose interest in the whole. The last action sequence is probably the best of all. It was not awesome, but at least I enjoy it more than the others.I think movie goers will not like Bangkok Dangerous and I don't recommend it to anybody. That's just my personal opinion. There were some good moments, but the rest was bad. The movie left me wanting more and left many questions open. If you are big fan of Cage, then I guess you will like the movie.</fullReview>

Also, his smile is disturbing. Nic, what the hell's going on brother? Also, the Pang brothers were an edgy asset to film-making.

		<fullReview>I am greatly at odds with all those who found this "boring", "slow" and "unexciting". If you want Wanted, or Loaded, then go watch them.If you want a film that is not just about the action but is about the internal conflicts that a hit-man on his final job to kill four targets in Bangkok and so at the end of his career then maybe you'll get why I thoroughly enjoyed and got this.Go right back in Cage's career before Air Con and the Rock and there was Leaving Las Vegas. Where Cage before the muscle workout was an interesting character actor - and here he is again. Not a macho cutout infallible and glorious, but rather disheveled, gauche, lost in his own world.The plot and settings (Including one or two scenes that look right out of The Man With The Golden Gun) are good, and the filming is more than competent.Again, if you want just a straight action film, this will disappoint, if you want your brain engaged and are willing to be drawn in and taken on a journey then this will satisfy deeply.Not quite a return to full form for Cage, it is better than most of his recent films, and it is above all an interesting take and holds as being a good film about hit men.Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen plenty of awful movies, this one deserves my very first post on IMDb.com. Just don't bother. This will go down as a classic example of a great actor accepting a terrible movie. For those who likes Nicolas Cage, DEFINITELY SKIP THIS ONE.Cheesy action scenes, little acting, script obviously written by a 13 year old. It makes Thai look bad to. And the woman, Charlie Yeung, she is actually from Hong Kong, conveniently dumb and deaf since she would've been able to speak Thai anyway.What a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started well. We have been told preliminarily about Nicolas Cages character "rules of engagement" and his lifestyle. But nothing was presented about his mysterious past and why he is the way he is today. The girl he gets to like can't talk and so little is known about her, as well, other than her being a disabled pharmacist. He tries to solve the issue of the unfortunate misunderstanding between them but he makes only a small effort. There was an attempt to convince us that Cages character was going through a moral change but that attempt was mild. Killing himself at the end was the best solution for the story. I am just not sure about that. Cage doesn't make good movies these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Personally, I enjoyed the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened to catch part of the Pang Brothers 1999 version of Bangkok Dangerous, and yes, that one sucked. Poor cinematography, cheaply done, in short, something that anyone with a modern digital camcorder could have surpassed with just a rudimentary knowledge of film making.My wife and I got burned going to that stinker, Babylon AD with Vin Diesel, and since I told my wife that the original sucked, her trepidation factor was high that we may be wasting money again, but we wanted to go out to the movies and, hey, what were we gonna do, go to Tropic of Thunder? Nope. I like Nicholas (Coppola) Cage and have probably seen almost every movie he has been in (after writing that line, I checked out his filmography at http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/ and realize I haven't seen them all by a long shot). Now, Nicholas is no Robert Duvall or Billy Bob Thornton, but at least, he's not Keanu Reeves).The movie has several exciting segments, and you definitely see an arc of the hit-man's character, as he changes from a no-nonsense, kill em all and erase your trace guy to someone who starts to caring about a couple of folks, his apprentice / student, and the deaf pharmacy worker.So, there's adventure, action, pathos and yes, some humor. Heck, whadya want from a movie?Is this the best movie ever? NO. Is it the worst movie ever? No, there can only be one Sound of Music.It's worth a few bucks and an hour and forty something minutes.There's probably not an award in it for Cage, but I saw the Dark Knight, and from an entertainment standpoint, I put them on an equal standpoint.But, heck, my all time favorite movie is Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, so probably, my tastes are different than others.I give it 3.8 stars out of a possible five, and one and a half thumbs up.~Doc</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage's stars in this remake of the hit 1999 classic "Bangkok Dangerous" a film that while entertaining with some impressive stunts ultimately doesn't offer anything new beyond it's presentation.Joe, or stale-acting- wooden- performance-laden-cardboard-cutout-hero of the story is a hit-man (sound familiar) takes a trip down to Southeast Asia to do some good 'ol fashioned killing for some nameless party that the audience knows nothing about. Along the way he hires a streetwise pickpocket (how original) and then falls in love with some nameless dancer. But then trouble ensues and.....you get the idea.This recipe has been done before in film with more class and tighter direction but neither of these qualities that are essential in making a successful action movie are present in this film. Cage looks the part but most of the time he seems like he's on autopilot throughout the entire picture. At least Kong, his sidekick's acting is more believable as well as the female dancer whom he later rescues but even those little points can't save this regurgitated mess soaked in Hollywood juice.Although Nicolas Cage was great in Face Off and Lords of War but like Ghost Rider, Next, and those before them, Nick truly has fallen from grace. I've never seen such putrid garbage in my life. I came out of the theater covered in leeches, polluted of "stoned" acting, washed out cinematography, and rickety direction that makes me wonder if this film was made on a budget big enough to feed a bunch of stray cats and whether or not this remake was justified in the first place, why bother?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite awful, but Nic Cage still seriously needs to get his act together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Joe (Nicolas Cage) is a hit-man who arrives in Bangkok to carry out a series of assignments for local crime boss Surat (Nirattisai Kaljareuk). Unfamiiar with the city, he enlists local pick pocket and scam merchant Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm- these funny Thai names!) to run some errands for him in exchange for money but when he clocks on to the business he is in, Joe instead ends up training him to be a professional killer just like him, whilst entertaining a romance with a deaf local pharmacy worker. But things get too hot to handle when he's asked to carry out a political assassination. How come no one hires him to take out Gary Glitter???I really think I have no idea what I'm missing out on not watching enough Hong Kong/foreign language action flicks. My interest in action films, and indeed pretty much all films, tends to focus only on the most widely publicised of them, which is of course those from the Hollywood market. The HK film-makers must have only a fraction or so of the budget the Beverley Hills bigwigs have but with sheer skill and determination produce results that, for the most of the ones I've seen, have blown me away with their sheer professionalism and incredible ability. Thais The Pang Brothers would appear, John Woo style, to have re-made their film Bangkok Dangerous in the land of the rich and famous so ignoramuses like me will give them better profits. I only hope the Thai version of their original film is more satisfying than this!After a promising opening, with a tense voice-over from Cage and some flashy, slick visuals, this descends into a dull affair, with Cage doing his flawed action man impression whilst entertaining an awkward romantic sub-plot that feels at odds with the sharp violence on display. It all just fails to hold together as a whole and the end result is a meandering, uninvolving actioner with more style than substance.It's not awful, and does have it's moments, but you just long for the day when Cage will make at least an okay film again. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is clearly one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my life. After leaving the theater in Chiang Mai, I wondered if some Thai buddies of Nicholas Cage got him to remake a really bad low budget Thai film. In fact, I think that must be what happened when Nic lost some kind of bet. Nothing Nic did made any sense. His hits were of little to no imagination and sometimes just downright stupid. What kind of hit-man stands in full view of an open window with a giant plain as day rifle sticking out the window? It didn't even help that I was in Thailand watching the movie even though I lived in BKK for awhile. It did give me a strange urge to go down to Nana Plaza though. If you see this movie after reading this review, you deserve it.If Nic didn't lose a bet, his career is over.</fullReview>

The character Joe(Nicolas Cage) is one lonely guy, cause in the business of being a professional hit-man, his life as been like living in a suitcase. The Job is beginning to take it's toll on him. And he eagerly wants to retire. Joe goes to Bangkok for one last assignment, with whom he gains a partner named Kong, a young con artist, and he also begins a romance with a deaf mute shop girl. I don't want to give anything more away, so that is all I'm gonna tell you. But I'll tell it was quite entertaining, and also a great performance by Nicolas Cage, he showed the darkness within a mans soul quite believable. The film was has dark as the character was feeling. A well made film, and brilliantly directed by The Pangs.</fullReview>

This movie was badly paced, with less than stellar dialogue and waaaay too much of Cage's overly-serious narration. The biggest problem I had with this movie is how little talking there was, especially in the latter half. A lot of the scenes were only supported by soundtrack, and actors giving visible reactions. Also it was funny to see super hit-man Joe not be able to hit a guy through some water bottles when he was 5 feet away. Cage is a much better actor than he showed in this movie. It really isn't worth seeing unless you're some hardcore Nicolas Cage fan, and you thought Ghost Rider wasn't a big steamy pile.It only gets away with 2* because there really are a lot of movies out there that are way worse</fullReview>

Usually, Nic Cage action flicks are cheesy but have some sort of entertainment value as he can act it up when he chooses to. I couldn't believe my eyes and ears in almost every scene. Even some local chavs behind me were laughing in disbelief. The montage scenes where he is taking the deaf and dumb girl out to dinner and stroking elephants were among the worst I've ever seen. Also, his smile is disturbing. Nic, what the hell's going on brother? Also, the Pang brothers were an edgy asset to film-making. I'm surprised that between them and Cage, they did not sit forward in the editing suite and say 'we can't release this crap!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage plays an assassin who wants to get out of the business for good and he accepts a last job in Bangkok.And like in every assassin story he falls in love with a girl he meets in a store and later takes on a student.The action was not spectacular nor was the acting. But that is not the reason why critics blasted the movie. It was because of the predictability of the script. The original Bangkok Dangerous was excellent because it had a deaf and dumb assassin and it had a pretty good though not exactly novel revenge story.Sticking to the original script would have given this movie an edge over other regular assassin movies. But this movie was still far better than say Wanted which won out because of curving bullets and a mega budget.Yes the romance lacked fizzle, yes Nicholas Cage was as wooden as usual, and yes it is predictable but as I said worse movies have been hits.And my advice is this: the movie is watchable... just don't expect anything from it... and you may be pleasantly surprised...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicolas Cage now as lousy an Actor as Stephen Seagal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have given up on watching Stephen Seagal movies as even where he has a decent cast and script, like Pistol Whipped, he's by far the worst thing in that movie. Which is sad, because Seagal's earlier theatrical releases he had an electric presence.However, I am still a fan of Nicolas Cage movies so even if they are half way decent, I'll watch them, like Next. On the other hand, I haven't seen Ghost Rider (looks like a cheesy cartoon from the trailer) nor The Wicker Man (why the hell would you even think about remaking the best horror movie of all time is beyond me). So I have my limits on seeing Cage in terrible movies. This movie was also better unwatched as well.Well, Bangkok Dangerous has got to be one of the worst movies of the Hit-man genre ever made. It has absolutely no redeeming features. EVERYTHING is a derivative of some other far better action movie, I found myself wanting the hit-man to get killed in the first half hour.To save you time of watching the movie: Here's the whole story: Nicolas Cage is a ruthless killer who goes to Bangkok to do 4 last jobs where he gets a low life courier turned student, a girlfriend and a conscience where he can't complete the last assignment. The bad guys decide they need to kill the hit-man so Nicolas Cage has to kill an army of bad guys and kill himself as the police are closing in. The "artsy" stuff was tired crap, with a lousy script, directing and editing with Cage just phoning in his performance, just like Seagal.I give the movie a 2nd star simply because it does give you a bit of Thailand scenery, but it could had been filmed anywhere .</fullReview>

His acting is laboured all the way through the movie as he tries to convey a mysterious gun for hire who works alone. Needless to say, he breaks all his own rules and makes friends with people including a local deaf girl. A relationship which never gets started and never goes anywhere. Long empty moments punctuate the movie which, instead of creating mood, create a sense of "why am I persevering with this?". The ending is just terrible and there are no conclusions. Hollywood seems to be on a trend at the moment of trying to finish movies without the happy Hollywood ending. The achieved it with this movie but the problem is that the unhappy part lasted throughout the entire movie. Don't waste your time with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with great acting and characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original film, but I plan to buy it. If remakes are usually worse than the originals, then the first Bangkok Dangerous, must be an amazing film. This updated version with Nic Cage playing an assassin who breaks his own rules and befriends a couple of people, is a great character study, with a wicked soundtrack, great scenery, good performances by all, and some pretty cool action scenes. First off, this is mostly a dramatic picture, not a "Hard Boiled" styled action flick. So if you are expecting some John Woo stuff, forget it.However, I think the story was good enough that it didn't need a lot of action. And when it came, it was pretty gruesome! This film focuses on themes and how human interaction can change people. Cage's character must remain a loner, he cannot care about the human race, which he sees as a different species, if he does, he will start to feel remorse, and this is not a good thing for an assassin. Of course this is a movie, so he will break this rule, but it's not that he breaks it out of want, he was forced to.It's strange how this movie takes plot twists, that are usually predictable, but not always, and makes it seem as if there is no other choice. Once the plot twist happens, you knew it would, but somehow it's still shocking.*****SPOILER***** While out with is mute girlfriend Cage is attacked by muggers. His girl doesn't see them and cant hear them, so she is oblivious as to what is happening, and it would've stayed that way except that when Cage is forced to defend himself, he does what comes naturally, he executes them. He had them down, but couldn't help finishing them off. In doing so, his mute girlfriend gets blood sprayed on her back and when she feels the spray, she looks and sees that there is blood on her. She sees Cage, and takes off running. Her and Cage never get back together. Had he left the muggers knocked out, he could say that he was defending himself, but instead he appears like a cold blooded killer, which he is.This is only one example of how the plot twists are used to show character, not just for the sake of shock value, which is typical in movies.All in all, I thought it was great and I would recommend seeing it. Ill be getting it on DVD for sure! 8/10 (I am giving 10/10 on IMDb, because I think the movie needs to go up a bit)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Nicholas Cage plays Joe and the other guy plays Kong, this almost feels like more of a prequel to the Thai movie than a remake. Joe is a broken man with his only friend being Kong he taught how to kill in the original and Kong is the main character in that film. Albeit Kong is the deaf/mute in the original and Joe's woman is the same woman that gives the jobs to Kong telling him who to kill. Also the Thai movie is very much a character study, very slow paced with much of the pounding emptiness to make the viewer feel what it is like to be deaf as Kong is. This looks more like a typical gun crazy action shoot em up. Now the in the Thai film Joe was certainly Asian as well however Cage does borrow the haircut, and leather jacket in which Joe sports in the 1999 version. Now if Joe ends up being shot through the hand and becomes less able to perform jobs / and or semi-retires do to what he goes through in this film than it should be viewed as a precursor to the very good Thai film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Bangkok Dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I can mark today as Remake day, having to watch two movies which are adaptations or updates to their original, both of which have Asian origins, though one I will be going in blind given that I've not watched its predecessor.I've only caught the DVD of the Pang Brothers' Bangkok Dangerous, arguably their breakthrough film about a deaf mute hit-man, which made audiences round the world sit up and take notice of their talent in crafting gritty stories. There are remakes that have their rights sold to others, and they join the ranks of the rare few who get the call from Hollywood, and given an opportunity to helm a remake of sorts with a bigger budget, and presumably better known stars. Unfortunately, whatever that made Bangkok Dangerous unique the first time round, got thrown out of the window for tried and tested, and therefore safer and predictable fare, that this one looked no more than a bland, generic action movie.One of the chief aspects of the original that was junked, and that was probably a bad call, was with the mute hit-man now being your typical usual hit-man, joining the ranks of thousands already out there in cinema. Granted now that you have your Hollywood star, there's absolutely no way he would want to be silenced and not given an opportunity to speak on screen. Nicholas Cage, being producer here, naturally gets a say in the revamp, and sadly, he wanted to relive his Castor Troy days in Face/Off.Why do I say that? I thought the Pang Brothers' story, and the original movie, steered very clear from trying to resemble your typical Hong Kong / Hollywood action flick, and wanted to stamp their own authority in their take on the action-hit-man genre. Hence their original film. This remake probably allowed them to pay a little homage, and probably tested if they can make a bland action film. They succeeded, and allowed themselves some room to pay homage with a balletic slow-motion action sequence where Cage's Joe engages in a fire- fight with 2 guns blazing, with an enemy across stacked water-containers. Tell me if you're not seen something like that before, and they should have thrown in some doves for good measure too.Nicholas Cage as Joe (in a little name reversal from the original) came at a time where his star wasn't fading that fast, yet. This movie was made a couple of years ago, before Cage turned in some rather blah performances and works such as Ghost Rider, and Next, which was utter trash. There was a Next moment in the movie too, which made me groan out loud, not in pleasure of course. With that Tom Hank's inspired hairdo, Cage plays your hit-man without remorse in executing (pardon the pun) his duties. Like Jason Statham's Transporter, he sticks to his rules, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken, and when they do, things get broken.In this version of Bangkok Dangerous, the international hit-man goes to Bangkok for 4 jobs before he can finally retire, and in a land where he cannot speak the language, he decides to adopt a protégé in Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) to do his dirty work at first, before breaking a rule and train a disciple ala The Professional (keep that counter on for the numerous references). Each kill brings him closer to his goal, but the jobs do seem to get nastier, and tougher. I thought a hit-man should be as clinical and as quiet as possible.There are some quiet moments, and here's where the problem is. So you say you want a deaf mute person eh? We'll give it to you then, in the form of a love interest Fon, played by Chinese actress pretending to be Thai (it's easy actually since you do not have to speak) in Charlie Young. In yet another flower vase role she plays to perfection, the romance between the hit-man and his lady love rang really empty, unlike the emotionally charged one in the original. Perhaps you can blame the cast, but I'd put it squarely on the shoulders of the creators.The only time where something was kept from the original, was that iconic image of the hit-man with his gun to his head. Otherwise, Oxide and Danny Pang in their update of their own film really messed it up, in providing an average action flick with a one man army that could still entertain, but provides the audience with a niggling feeling of deja-vu. Heck, even Job #4 looked like Joe was a Harvey Lee Oswald wannabe.</fullReview>

Read along as he quotes some stuff from "Becoming an Assassin for Dummies". Something about four or five rules, but don't worry about remembering 'em, 'cause he won't either.3. Pickup a sidekick named Kong... no, not King or Hong or even Donkey, it's just Kong. You'll be playing the name-rhyming game for hours afterwards.4. Next we'll fall instantly in love, Vegas style sans cocktails unfortunately, with a sexy deaf pharmacist... happens to me all the time, but then I find myself divorced by morning. Anyway let's move on...5. He blows it with the hottie pharmacist, 'cause he whacked two dudes in front of her... well actually she's walking in front of him and only notices, because the blood splattered on her back and since she can't hear the gun shots... you know, taken in a dark comedy context, this scene is absolutely hilarious in a slapstick sorta way.6. The sidekick, he considered a gutter rat a day ago, is now officially his student to become a great assassin like himself... oh screw this, let's cut to the chase. The student rats him out, he "says" goodbye to his chick, he hunts down his contractor, saves Kong, and proceeds to kill himself and the contractor at the same time. The end.ps. Don't forget to keep playing the Kong Name Game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that although the plot of the story was quite reasonable, the acting was really bad. Mr. Cage seemed to be acting way below his normal standards (in order not to show up the other 'B' rate actors?) and it was embarrassing to watch at times, especially when he was out with the 'Thai' girl from the pharmacy. The scenes when he was out dating 'Fon' did not seem to be in context with the plot which I assume to be an action, shoot-em-up type of movie. It shows the standard of the actors employed when they could not find a Thai actress to play a dumb pharmacist!! (I think the actor used was Chinese.) I am a Brit and have lived in Thailand for 17 years now. I can tell you for sure that there are many Thais who could have played her role quite easily. If you have nothing else to do, like watching paint dry for example, or you are suffering from insomnia, then this would be a good movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great movie from Cage! Oh, and viewers describing Cage as 'lacking' are just missing the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage just keeps getting better. Don't believe the negative reviews. If you are a Cage fan you will absolutely be riveted by this one. Cage's presence is captivating. He is an epic actor and really deserves much more credit. Credit given where credit is due. This movie is unbeatable, believable, he looks amazing. Marks out of 10 - well an unquestionable 10.When I went to see this film I was rivetted from the first minute, he sows the seeds for a movie which depicts love, determination, culture and clever movie stunts. Visually it is very stylish. Cage is convincing. This is not say it is totally perfect because it isn't; at times Cage's resilience and calm during shoot outs befits a reality not within the sphere of normality. But that is why we go to the movies.The film relies heavily on Cage's performance which is excellent. The writing is good. Cage is has presence which fills the screen, he is magnetic. A convincing 'normal' person who falls in love with a bemused yet polite approach towards Bankok's culture.Overall this is an entertaining film and anyone who dismisses Cage as lacking is really missing the point. Since Wild at Heart, Cage just continues to get better and better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a load of rubbish!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this film with my boyfriend- (his choice not mine) and both of us and the lodger thought everything about it was awful. The storyline was confusing and weak it didn't seem to make much sense at all. The movie seemed to jump from one scene to the next with no explanation of what was happening- i.e Cage one minute inside a building then next in a swimming pool.The acting was poor and the characters unlikable. The only think i liked about this movie was the scenery of bangkok, which did make me what to go there, aside from that I couldn't wait for this movie to end and was hoping somebody might shoot Cage dead and give us all a break!! Stay away at all costs...disappointing for Cage who usually make good movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the original before seeing the new one.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to see the newest version of what was a great original film. Just from the synopsis that is given about the movie, it is already ass backwards. Nicholas Cage's character in the original was the mute. The movie itself dealt with the main character (assassin) trying to cope with being mute and falling in love with a drug store clerk. While in the end everything comes crumbling down back on the assassin and his partner. There wasn't much dialog and the music helped set the tone and tell the story. I am not surprised Hollywood would "F" up the basics of what was a very easy movie to follow. I am sure Nicholas Cage wanted a bunch of lines and couldn't handle playing someone that couldn't speak throughout an entire movie. Goes to show how twisted this business truly is. Only arrogant Americans could dismantle a respectable film. Not some damn production to put a multi-million dollar contract into Cage's pocket. Have directors totally lost touch with reality?! Granted it would seem a little redundant to create a movie exactly the same way that it was previously done, but why remake a film that was already good in and of itself. Its only been 9 years and they need to butcher it up because.... Could anyone shed any light on why they felt the need to do this?! Weak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may think 10 of 10 is too much for this movie but as long as a movie really gets to me it has done its job. There is nothing i want improved in this movie. It is excellent. The story is about an ice-cold hit-man travelling to Thailand and gets charmed by how nice people is and ends falling in love. I think many wont understand this movie, but it has depth and ton of it. I was really drawn to this movie from the start, its very interesting and i love this story. Nicholas Cage does a really great job of portraying this character and this movie is a must see.Great action, good lovestory and well acting with incredible music by Brian Tyler which makes this movie one hard to forget. I totally recommend it for anyone who likes movies for a bit more depth than usual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Nick Cage fan. I'm A fan of the Pang Brothers. I fell asleep on this English remake of their first/second (depends upon which brother) film.The film has Cage as a hit-man known as Joe go to Bangkok for one last hit, or rather series of hits, there are four targets all in Bangkok which will allow for a large payday for a little movement. He gets hooked up with a street hustler for an aide and guide, whom he intends to kill when the job is done. He also meets a deaf mute pharmacist....zzzzzzzzzzz.What sorry was I sleeping? Slow brooding film is too slow and brooding. It put me right out. Which isn't normal for the Pangs who create films that make you want to watch to the end even if the material isn't very good. Despite not really caring what happened, I'll try it again when it hits home video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cage's worst movie -- ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a violent movie and a greater-than-average amount of gore. I can handle that but this movie is a real stinker which was trying to be a good movie. If it was any worse, it would fall into the "classic stinker" category which includes movies such as "Plan 9 From Outer Space" or "Attack of the Killer Tomatos." I kept thinking that Cage was hungover when he made this movie. The plot was bad (a hired killer mentors a Thai thug in the business and falls in love along the way) and the cinematography was bad as well. Many of the scenes take place at night and it's often hard to see anything due to the darkness of the images. Don't even get me started on the bad acting. Cage could have phoned it in.Do not waste your money on this loser. Do not go to the theater to see it, do not rent it and, God forbid it gets to TV, do not see it on TV either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There certainly are better ways to see Bangkok -- you're less likely to fall asleep watching a dated tourist board film on the Travel Channel.No matter how high the body count rises, it is impossible to fight back the yawns. Even Nick Nolte, as the professional hit-man who discovers his heart of gold(!), seems ready for a nap as he deadpans his way through this exercise in total stupidity. The characters are entirely unbelievable, the plot is virtually nonexistent, the cinematography is pedestrian, and the inevitable shoot-em-up climax has been done better thousands of times.Even when this film comes to late night TV, you'll find it more entertaining to watch an infomercial for "The Magic Clothesline," or "Elvin's Extra-Slow Drying Paint."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am writing this review even before the movie is over (about 95% done), and I can tell you I don't need to wait to give this review. The previews looked pretty bad, but I figured there might be a chance it was OK. Perhaps I was just wishing for an Asian themed Lord of War, but I was totally disappointed. The plot was terrible, the characters barely developed, and the overall story was garbage. You really never feel drawn into this film, and its just really, REALLY stupid. Boring from almost the minute it starts, I cant believe I didn't turn it off to be honest.UPDATE: I just "watched" the last scene. WOW, what horrible film making.

		<fullReview>There's fast food and there's real cooking. There are those who are content with shoving a TV dinner in the microwave and eating it four minutes later, and there are those who don't mind spending an hour or so preparing a meal (and in the truth only a fraction of that 60 minutes is spent doing any cooking) and enjoying food. Films are like that, especially the films out of Hollywood - there are those which are formulaic, trite, cliché-ridden, the cinema equivalent of fast food, but which have their fans and, most importantly for their producers, make enough money at the box office to keep everyone involved happy despite essentially being pap and dross. And there are those films, invariably independent although not always, which are original, well-made, honest, often challenging, truthful and a joy to watch. On a flight back from Hong Kong to London two days ago, I saw one of each kind: a piece of throwaway dross called Bangkok Dangerous and a little gem called The Savages, as unalike as chalk and cheese and from different worlds. Bangkok Dangerous had the star (Nicolas Cage) and a big enough budget to be filmed on location in Thailand. The Savages had the respected actors (Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman) and enough honesty to put the rest of the blockbuster film industry to eternal shame. So far this review of Bangkok Dangerous is identical to that of The Savages, but from here on I shall simply deal with Cage vehicle and ask just why such clichéd rubbish is always so popular. Briefly, a professional 'assassin' - killer would be a better word - is summoned to Bangkok to ply his trade. The voice-over tells us that there are only four rules in his game, the fourth of which is to get out while you are at the top. On this, his last mission, he breaks all four rules and pays for it with his life. I have to admit that I am no fan of Nicolas Cage, although I couldn't tell you why. Here he pretty much goes through the stock moves expected of the central character in this kind of nonsense, none of his actions making the slightest bit of sense. By chance he meets a deaf-mute young Thai woman in a pharmacy and is smitten. Why is she deaf-mute? No reason. How come an apparently hard-headed, hard-hearted killed could suddenly go all mushy over someone he can't even communicate with? Again, no reason is given. On each assignment he hires a gofer whom he then kills once he is not longer needed. In Bangkok his hires 'a piece of garbage', but then inexplicably grows to like him and trains him up in all his own skills. Why? No reason is give. In the stock gun battle at the end of the film, Cage remains unhurt throughout, despite dispatching up to ten opponents and apparently being shot at at point blank range. The reason is obvious: he's the 'hero' of the film we can't have him going down until the end. And on it goes, plot cliché after plot cliché, stock-standard dialogue, wholly implausible situations following other wholly implausible situations. Why? Because there are sufficient numbskulls and dunderheads in the US and elsewhere around the world who are happy to pay good money to watch rubbish such as this. These kind of all-action leave-your-brain at home movies are money spinners. And that, for some, is what it is all about. Avoid unless you are a card-carrying numbskull or dunderhead.</fullReview>

His deaf girlfriend doesn't help that either . But yeah I suggest not wasting your money on this film.

		<fullReview>Wow... Really? Without being a true fan of his, I've still enjoyed most of Cage's efforts, but this can't even be classified as one. To be fair, it seemed as though no one truly tried. For an action movie, the whole thing crept along at a crawl, riddled with plot holes. Cage's character kicked things off by telling us the four truths of hit-man-ing and ended up breaking every single one before it was through. His romance with the deaf-mute-kind-hearted pharmacist consisted of him gazing at her with a look of profound confusion and following it up with a patented Nic Cage-awkward smile every time she looked up at him. The fact that he took the "disposable" street hustler under his wing and taught him all he needed to know to become a hit-man in under a month was ridiculous. The action sequences were anti-climactic and left you wondering how anyone could get themselves in or out of such situations. The final shootout? Boring. Boring. That pretty much sums up this flick. If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, do yourself a favor and rent Weekend at Bernie's. Cheers.</fullReview>

I've never commented on a movie on IMDb. However, I felt so strongly about this horrible movie that I should at least try to warn other movie watchers. Please do not watch this movie unless you enjoy scratching your eyeballs or head butting stone walls because I'd rather do either of those than watch this movie again. Nicholas Cage is awful. The rest of the cast is awful. The whole tone of the movie is awful. The entire movie is either the color blue or red. If you don't know what I mean about the color try watching it without renting or buying the movie just to see this "creative" (very sarcastic) use of color.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the first review here and after seeing the film, agree 100%!Keep the original premise and set it here in the USA.There is still a tendency for the citizens and film goers here in America to ALWAYS think that "these kind of things" must happen in exotic locales and NEVER in the USA or at the hands of "The American people" via their Government or their Corporate non-elect. I know that is not really the focus of the movie, it is far too typical Hollywood summer/back to school testosterone fuel for the folks who don't have enough money to be serious gamers, or deal with more involved story lines. (I'm not a gamer but, I try to keep up with the games to understand conversations.)Taking this film idea and setting it in America, along with keeping the deaf-mute hit-man/private contractor, would give it the edge it needs to bring in the bucks and keep the Pang's making more and hopefully better movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected better from a seasoned veteran of film like Nicholas Cage. The first 10 minutes tricked me into believing that this movie was going to be great. For me there is nothing better than a Hit-man movie, unfortunately I was greatly let down. Instead of making the profession look cool and fun this movie tried to turn it all upside down. It was like some independent film maker on his own mission to taboo being a Hit-man. Using a love interest as well as a sudden and completely unexplained newfound conscience which consisted of the usual garbage of over-dramatization. For me the only good Hit-man movie is one that glamorizes the profession, such as..Hit-man. That was a great movie and video game. All in all this movie had a lot of potential that it wasted on trying to show how a Hit-man can turn into a caring, sharing LOSER. By the way in real life this would not happen, so it's pointless to have Hollywood always over-dramatize everything, like they did endlessly in American History X. Leaving you with no understanding of people's true intentions or what was fact and fiction. Makes it very one sided. I will never watch this again, hopefully YOU won't watch it at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous was an awesome action movie. It had many different great action sequences. It wasn't very bloody besides for one or two scenes. The movie it's self though was so cool. The end of the movie was a nail bitter and kept you on the edge of your seat. The movie was pretty realistic as well. Going into the movie I expected a very far-fetched movie but it wasn't. It was believable with great visuals and acting. The acting was very good. Nicholas cage did a phenomenal job. The visuals were all shot in Bangkok. The whole movie pretty much took place in bangkok. The story was good as well and kept getting better and better. Their was really only one thing at the end that might disappoint some people. The end was very controversial. The meaning was great in the movie. The thing that was the coolest was that Nicholas Cage wasn't afraid to die. The movie kind of starts out slow but then really picks up. The end in my opinion makes up for most of the movie. Overall a great action movie. Go see this one action hit of the fall.</fullReview>
