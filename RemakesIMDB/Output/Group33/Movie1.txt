		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Bangkok Dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up this DVD because I've been to Bangkok couple of times, and wanted to see how the filmmakers Oxide and Danny Pang manage to capture the more sleazy side of the city, and combine it with gangster noir to come up with Bangkok Dangerous. I've heard about the movie, and was surprised that our National Library actually had this DVD in its collection.Bangkok Dangerous tells the story of a deaf mute assassin Kong (Pawalit Mongkolpisit). His is a life of mission after mission, a cold and professional, though small time, killer. Growing up being bullied because of his disability, he finds work at a gun range as a cleaner, until he chances upon Joe (Pisek Intrakanchit) and his girlfriend Aom (Patharawarin Timkul). Kong learns his skills from Joe (in an excellent montage), and together, form a tag-team partnership.During the course of work, Kong chances upon the beautiful Fon (Premsinee Ratanasopha) who works at a drugstore, and in between missions, he romances Fon, who doesn't shun him in spite of being a deaf mute. The killer has finally known what it is to develop feelings and to love.However, if you live by the gun, chances are there will be those who are after you. Things change for the worse when Aom offends one of the gang's ranked member, and gets raped. Joe goes for revenge, but ultimately gets literally betrayed by the hand that feeds. Kong has to decide - to finish what had started and avenge his friends, or to try and begin life anew with the woman he loves, even after she has started to avoid him, knowing what he does for a living.In a cosmopolitan city like Bangkok, this film manages to capture a kaleidoscope of colours, mood, and use various camera angles to its advantage. It contrasts the shady underworld and strip bars, and its pulsating music, with the silent, kind world of love that Kong for the first time experiences when he's with Fon.It's a story of finding one's own morality when living in the midst of violence and sleaze, and the seeking of redemption from a life of sin.Code 3 DVD extras: Filmography of filmmakers and inspiration for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bangkok Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Really enjoyed this one. The imagery is beautiful and imaginative, excellent editing and vibrant colors.The cast was good, especially the guy playing Kong, the deaf assassin, he did a fantastic job, showing a full range of emotion without uttering a word. I really felt for the guy. In fact, I completely fail to see how the characters are flat and undeveloped like someone said. True, we don't get their life story, but i found my self really caring for them, they felt sort of real even though you didn't get to know that much about them.That, and the girl playing Kong's love interest is so cute it'll make your eyes hurt...About the action. Some people complain about this not being up to par with John Woo's action choreography, but who said an action flick, just because it's from Asia should have to be about making every shoot-out look like the Swan Lake? This is grittier, more unrehearsed, it's not about looking good firing that gun (even though I'm a big fan of that too).I thought that there was some really smart stuff, where brains won over brawn, watch out for the scene with laser sights at the end. I went "ahhh - Clever!"This is not a perfect movie, it has flaws. I felt the ending to be a bit formulaic, and the whole "violence begets more violence" concept surely is nothing new plotwise, but still, it's not dumb and full of holes like so many other action movies. And it's sooo pretty to watch...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was actually a pretty superior 'hitman' film.If you want full-on action in a style of early John Woo, then no, it is probably not perfect for you, but the directing is excellent, the character development is good, and the idea as original as any other.I liked it, and liked the style particularly. It does borrow a lot from early Woo i guess, but it is borrowing and not stealing. There is enough originality of idea and of direction. The acting is pretty uniformly good as well. The critics in Toronto liked it too. (see awards and nominations)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous I felt was a very stylish, well acted film with themes and, to an extent, a plot that ran along the same lines as alternative assassin flick Leon. Bangkok dangerous forms its protagionist with character interactions but mostly by delving into how he became the cold killer he is through a series of flashbacks which are not integral to the plot or even shown fluently but integral to our understanding of this troubled soul. The camera work in this film is its pro and con, at certain points style, fluidity and technique are all concentrated together to make some memorable scenes whereas occasionally certain shots has failed to impress and look slightly amateurish. The relationships in this film could also have had more focus on them because instead what we have is a series of different characters stories when we should have one large companionship struck by fate, betrayal and love. Warning for anybody watching this soon, the music ranges from OK to terrible and frequently fails to match the action. In conclusion: Pretty good, if actions you're thing then this is you're thing but you'll probably cry you're guts out anyway. Its still quite moving. Plot - 5 Plot Development - 7 Acting - 8 Style - 7 Music - 3 Action - 10 Average - 6.66 Stars</fullReview>

I haven't seen that one yet, i probably will, but i really loved this one, i really felt for the main character, i felt sorry for him that he was deaf, i just kept thinking during the movie, please get back together with Fon, she was so sweet and cute, she was perfect for him, all in all great movie, i am a big movie fan, American and foreign. And for me, this was grade A for a foreign film. Bravooooo. I will admit i cried at the end, why did he have to kill himself, i guess, he would've ended up in prison for life anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film with a great visual style. Although I kept finding it hard to overcome the problems a deaf\mute assassin would encounter, it was something that was easily overlooked. Revenge, death and love, what more could a story ask for, and this one delivers it well. As with a lot of good Japanese movies, there is a heavy emphasis on visual style to convey a feeling, action or even thoughts of the characters onscreen, and this is done well here. Added to that is the use of audio to either cover the sound in a scene, or totally ignore it, showing the problems of the assassins' deafness, and yet at no point is this made obvious to the viewer, it's something you just notice. There's no Hollywood here either, and it's well appreciated. Watch this film, it's a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre, with occasional flashes of brilliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous is the story of a lonely mute who becomes a hit-man, partly to avenge himself upon the world that has alienated him. Only when he finds happiness does he realize the full horror of his life.The film boasts some great performances, particularly by Pawalit Mongkolpisit as Kong, the main protagonist. His face is beautiful yet impassive, and his large eyes convey all the strangled emotions of a person unable to communicate with those around him.There are many excellent moments to savour in this film, but the contrived way in which Kong's partner is forced out of retirement is ridiculous. However, despite the generic plot - which at times has a square-peg-round-hole forced feel to it - and the thoroughly predictable narrative progression, the film is actually pretty rewarding. It has a tender humanism at the centre, which gives the film real depth, and there are many moments worth savouring.Score 7/10 (6 is too low, but 7's maybe a little too high)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, good have been better, but still a solid action drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to agree the quote that said that this was Wong Kar Wai mixed with John Woo and that was my thoughts exactly when I saw the movie. Its a good movie, could have been great, but definitely worth seeing. The movie is gritty and realistic and like a Woo film has characters that are flawed, but sympathetic and likeable which makes the violence and there is some graphic violence here have a lot more impact than in the average smash and crash movies. The hitman with a heart of gold scenario has been done before, but this one covers some new ground.*SPOILER ALERT*--------------------------------------------------------- The new ground covered is that the hitman actually realizes the consequences and impact of the killings he has committed on the victim's families, which if I recall is rarely ever touch upon in the hitman movies. Most of the targets in other movies of this genre all thugs who probably deserve a bullet put through their head and not an innocent person who is just living his life.*END OF SPOILER -------------------------------------------------------- This film has a lot going for it: stylish visuals, tight direction, and good melodrama, but I think the major fault of the film that kept it from being great was when the main character was onscreen, I felt that we should have been looking through his world through his eyes, as if we were deaf too, but instead only does this when he is making a hit. I think that would have been a lot people than having the characters write notes to him and having us hear what they are saying to have. I really like how the director's made what could have been an imitation of the classic restaurant shootout in A Better Tomorrow and with a visual twist gave the scene an originality all its own. I also found the ending to be a bit, corny and manipulative, although it did work and the decision that Kong made to change his fate was sad and at the same time clever and creative. All in all I would give this movie *** out a possible ***** because it did breathe some fresh life into a very cliched genre and is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a Teenage Hit-man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a dead man's blood seeps across bathroom tiles, the opening titles to BANGKOK DANGEROUS appear in it. From its first scene, this movie is art.Writers-directors-brothers Danny and Oxide Pang launch BANGKOK DANGEROUS at us with the intensity of an adjective incorrectly following a noun, in the story of a hit-man who finds redemption.But there's an inventive hook to this old story. Hit-man Kong (Pawalit Mongkolpisit) is a Thai teen who lives in squalor with roommate Joe (Pisek Intrakanchit), a young ex-hit-man whose gun hand was injured when both he and Kong were in a street shootout. Kong has no other friends and his only education was the snarling underbelly of Thailand: brutal mobs, dirty dance clubs, seedy streets, bashings, blood and bullets. And he is deaf and mute. And you thought YOUR teen years were screwed up.Kong's whacking expertise is shown in the opening scenes, where a poignant dynamic is unveiled, that is, even in his supposedly ruthless hits, Kong does not seem "heartless" or "merciless" - but not because he has a "heart of gold" - it is because he has been so desensitized from a young age to regard whacking as just another job. We discover through flashbacks that Joe and his stripper girlfriend, Aom (Patharawarin Timkul), befriended the young Kong at the shooting range where he worked sweeping bullets, and took him under their wing to become a REAL bullet sweeper.Kong is a sociopath through nurture not nature.An excellent scene punctuates this point: Kong takes aim from a rooftop at a mark below. A little girl on another rooftop sees Kong and looks down to see what he is aiming at. Instead of alerting a nearby grownup, she also aims with her little hand. She pulls her imaginary trigger as Kong squeezes his real one. When the mark goes down... she jumps up and down in joy.This kind of scene is verboten in American movies. But the Hong Kong-born Pang Brothers illustrate that unless anyone tells you something is "bad," how would you know? The violence is portrayed like real violence: quick ,efficient, sudden; no camera playing lovingly over splattered faces. It's indie, it's scarring and raw with forceful sound design and evocative music. It's movie "making" - Kong enters a room with his gun drawn on six guys, who all look up, frozen. Jump cut. Six guys lie strewn around the room, dead, bloodied, without seeing a shot fired. And Kong looks like he has not moved.When Kong falls for a teen pharmacist, Fon (Premsinee Ratanasopha), his infatuated reaction is believable because of his age and circumstances. He has never attended any special schools for his disabilities, and he is basically a shutaway who only ventures out to kill, so we imagine his seclusion has left him a lonely virgin.Even though we know Kong's "redemption" must be coming, it does NOT come via the doe eyes of Fon. One idyllic night, as they get close to that moment when anyone who has watched a romantic movie knows they are going to exchange girl germs, they get mugged. And Fon, who has spent the night trying to guess the quiet, shy Kong's job, gets to see first hand his greatest abilities. And she is repulsed.As John Cusack showed us in the magnificent GROSSE POINTE BLANK, a hit-man can find redemption even whilst in the process of doing that which he is being redeemed from. BANGKOK's powerful redemption scene comes as surprisingly as the rest of its scarring adventures in misanthropy.The other most affecting thing about BANGKOK is its original soundtrack, which is credited to Orange Music. We have grown so inured to Western Civilization's glossy neo-classical John Williamses and Hans Zimmers and Danny Elfmans that it is a welcome jarring evocative earful when exposed to people who have not been exposed to them.A rape, a revenge, a setup, a hit gone wrong. An eye for an eye.When Fon realizes she digs the bad guy, it is too late. The Pangs have packed up, moved to America and scored funding to remake their own movie with a bad mullet...--Review by Poffy The Cucumber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai", but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai", in that they are both films where the anti-heroes are vicious professional killers, molded by the circumstances of their youth, both awakened to the possibility of love. But I liked Bangkok Dangerous much more, in that the grit seemed less contrived.The reference to Charlie Chaplin is significant. In Thailand, Chaplin is revered even more than the French worship Jerry Lewis. To the Thai people, "The Little Tramp's" struggle against the domineering authority figures of his world is something that the average Thai relates to deeply. In Bangkok Dangerous, Kong, the killer, is a little guy buffetted by forces he doesn't fully understand -- but ultimately ones he fights back against.Don't be too critical when watching this. Just settle back and enjoy it; and you will indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than an action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again. make a good Asian film and soon Hollywood will come around and ruin it for you. Those who have followed my criticisms of remakes know how I feel. For others, The Departed was a shallow remake of Infernal Affairs.Now, I see that Nickolas Cage is in a remake of this film. Despite the fact that the Pang brothers are directing and writing, it cannot hope to capture what was here.This is not just an action flick. It is so much more. It is the story of a child with hearing and speech impairment that was cruelly taunted by other children. He grew up into a meaningless life and meaningless jobs until someone noticed he has an ability that could be honed to perfection. Sure, he became a hit-man, but someone cared enough to teach and guide him to his potential.Now, with just two friends, Kong (Pawalit Mongkolpisit) was happy. He lived with his teacher (Pisek Intrakanchit), and got assignments from Aom (Patharawarin Timkul). Life was good, but about to get better.He meets Fon (Premsinee Ratanasopha) and love enters his life. He is supremely happy. Unfortunately, she learns the truth about his occupation, and he has to do some real soul searching.The streets of Bangkok are a perfect backdrop used to maximum effect by the Pang brothers, and the cast is a group that you can really get close to. This is a story that can never be duplicated by someone from Hollywood, and I am disappointed that they would even try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides the action and fun gun fights and the awesome training montage there's another subplot. Love! It sound dorky, but I totally felt for Kong (the main guy) who falls for this pharmacy girl and they start dating awkwardly since he can't hear or talk. She guesses his job is a gas-station man, but he mistakes her "words" for hit-man and he nods. Later when they get jumped by thugs and he saves her by shooting them she freaks out and leaves him. He just saved you! Stupid chick! So he gets depressed and goes back into the hit-man world... Overall a fun slow-action movie that is great for passing time and has a little bit for everyone. Some blood from the fighting, but it's nothing dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but engaging and certainly miles better than the 2008 remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the mess of the remake I figured I owed it to the Pang brothers to at least see what they had done originally before messing it up ? or perhaps seeing that they never had anything in the first place and that maybe the remake just reflected that. The first thing that will hit you watching the original after the remake will be the change in the three central characters, as here we have the roles and interaction changed around a bit and working better in this orientation than with Nicholas Cage's version. Now, I am conscious that there is an in-built pressure on me to like this film more than the remake simply because it is the "original" and is a foreign language film, but the fact of the matter is that the 1999 film is superior to the remake.However, and those having seen the 2008 film will back me up on this, that is not saying a great deal and it does not read then that this film is brilliant. It is not brilliant but it does do what the remake didn't manage to do, which was to have a certain amount of story that I cared about and to wrap it up in a style that covers the weaknesses. This is helped by the character dynamics, which work much better with the three or four characters inhabiting the roles they do (ie the "deaf/mute" thing is much better with the assassin than with the girl). It isn't perfect though but it works and I was reasonably engaged by the characters even if the plot was straightforward enough. Those looking for Woo-style action will be disappointed; there is gun-play of course but it is not really designed to thrill or excite. What the brothers do do well though is visual style, which is mostly quite engaging and energising, even if they overdo the sentimentality really badly at the end.The cast are better here as well, mainly because they fit their characters and make their interactions work. Mongkolpisit's Kong is an effective presence on the screen, which he needed to be in order for his condition to work. Intrakanchit is good but given a lot less to do than I expected. What really helps the film is that the two female roles are quite good. Ratanasopha's sweetness and natural warmth comes through and thus convinces you of her falling in love with Kong ? something that the corresponding roles in the remake never did. Timkul's Aom is strong and sexy even if she is more of a plot device than a character in the film.Overall this is not a brilliant film that deserves to be shouted about but it is still an engaging and effective film thanks to a solid story, good performances and good delivery from the Pang Brothers. It has its faults but the strengths cover these up pretty well to make for a film that only really blows it by how heavy handed it is in the final few minutes. Oh, for those moaning that they accidentally hired this instead of the remake ? trust me, you've much, much better off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Asian: brilliant pictures &amp; scenes, weak story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bangkok Dangerous" is a very nice piece of Asian Movie-making - and a typical one as well. The pictures and scenes are brilliant and almost breathtaking, while the story is kind of weak - or at least very straight, simple and without any surprise.And the story holds a lot of "stupid" things, too: f. e. sometimes our deaf killer almost doesn't understand anything when other persons speak to him very slow and clear, one scene later he gets his next killer-job in the darkest corner of a dark road and he is able to read lips perfectly under this bad light conditions...But with the Pang Brothers bringing this simple story to life with such great pictures, a lot of good used special effects and many nice-to-watch digital baubles this movie is definitely worth watching.Sometimes the movie is getting - after my fancy - a little to violent - but hey, this is an Asian movie, so what do you expect, right?A very good movie, but because of the poor story: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bangkok Dangerous" reworks many familiar themes - doublecrossed hit-man in love - in a mishmash of imitation John Woo and Takashi Miike, this time in Thailand. All that's missing are the white birds flapping around. Woo and Miike need not worry. The film school cinematography is highly irritating and the first half is slow and filled with labored flashbacks. The second half, however, succeeds in building suspense and interest, thanks to the affecting performance of the guy who plays the deaf and dumb hit-man. There is a scene towards the end that is remarkably original and powerful - you'll know it when you see it. Uneven but worth seeing, if only for the novelty factor - how many Thai films have you seen?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first shot, I could tell that I have something in common with the directors. We're all very big Wong Kar Wai fans. Don't get me wrong, it's not just a big Wong Kar Wai imitation. There's some John Woo and Ringo Lam mixed in there too. The main problem is that the story and the characters aren't strong enough to carry the slow-moving method that they borrowed from Wong Kar Wai. Still, the intense violence works surprisingly well with that familiar quirky visual style, and some moments are really quite impressive. The Pangs should try this combination on a more fast-paced script, it might amount to a decent action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bangkok Dangerous" is, in the grand scheme of cinema, a dinky little action-drama flick. However, given what went into it, the film delivers more, pound for pound, than most films from big name action auteurs. The film tells a gritty simple story of a deaf-mute street punk hitman who shares brief moments of happiness with a lovely innocent and, unable to reconcile the divergent dichotomy, comes to an inescapable last hit. Wrought from heavy stylistics with excellent music and camera work; a scant script; and an apparently limited budget, "BD" is a paradigm of efficiency for neophyte indie auteurs who seem to err most often by trying to say too much with too little. A good watch for action junkies who can hang in there as the film looks cheap in the beginning and the talent behind the craft is not immediately apparent. (B+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the reason it was remade was the copious subtitles required of a Thai film, but the idea, plot, and execution were pretty good. Only, we were offered the Nicholas Cage version on the cable channel, which confused greatly. Seen objectively, it's a good foreign film that happens to center on a hit man. The hits are not the point, tho. The point is how a human being decides that killing others is okay. This logic engine wants ten lines; I don't like being wordy. The acting is good, the characterization is good, and when it looks as if the stripper friend is going to get raped, hit the fast forward because she does. Little is shown, and it's integral to the plot because it is what starts Kong on his self-determination that leads to his destruction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pretty obvious the Pang brothers has been reading way too many Asian comic books, because the style of this movie is like some lame and mainly boring comic book with flashes of somewhat good. It's basically a low budget film that is mediocre at best that tries to be cool like some Asian comic book. Just about everything about this movie is pretty generic, except the hit-man in this is deaf. With it's plot of seeking redemption while living amongst death and violence. Everything is this if your a movie vet, you probably seen already except much better although I give the film props for capturing everything it had to it's advantage. It's basically a generic film that is getting more hype than it really deserve, if the film took place in the US instead of Bangkok people would not be so generous to it, although Bangkok is much more dangerous in some areas compared to the US. And if your looking for a HK style shoot em up or a engaging action movie you will be disappointed, this film is uneven at times as well.6.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically impressive direction and editing, but otherwise dull and uninvolving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pang brothers overrated supernatural thriller 'The Eye' has caused a bit of a stir in recent months. I thought it was overrated, but had certain elements that made me interested in seeing the brothers previous collaboration 'Bangkok Dangerous'. To me 'The Eye' was very disappointing, and let down by an uneven script. 'Bangkok Dangerous' is even worse in that department. It's visually impressive, sure, especially the flashy editing, but the plot is minimal, and the characters are paper thin cliches. While I agree that film is essentially a visual medium I still believe in a strong story, and this movie doesn't have one. Pawalit Mongkolpisit tries his best in the difficult role of deaf mute assassin Kong, but we never really care about the fate of his character. The film throws in the tired old killer-redeemed-by-a-beautiful girl plot (and Premsinee Ratanasopha who plays Kong's potential love interest Fon is indeed beautiful) but doesn't make it either interesting or especially believable. This is the first Thai crime movie I've ever seen, and I had quite high hopes, expecting a new and original approach to Hong Kong genre cliches, but instead it was pretty much more of the same. The violence is generally more realistic and less flamboyant than most Hong Kong action flicks, but it shares a similar style over substance end result. The Pang brothers improved over this uneven film with 'The Eye', so I will still give them the benefit of the doubt for now. With a good script the pair may be able to do wonders, so I look forward with interest to see what their next collaboration will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but annoying Thai film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty good action flick from Thailand. This alone makes it remarkable, since I don't think I've ever seen a Thai film before. The story, action, and--a little less so--the characterization are all compelling. What makes the film annoying are its wretched production values. The film often looks as if it were filmed through gauze, or with Vaseline on the lens. Moreover, the directors seem to change film stock for no apparent reason. Nevertheless, it's definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulling out every visual trick and camera angle in the book doesn't save this dull and vapid snoozer.The box review compares the film to John Woo and Terrantino, but this is far from true. Yes, lots of people get shot and there are even gangsters involved. But Bangkok Dangerous can not come close to Woo's awesome action choreography, nor his, and I thought I'd never say this, depth.Calling the characters in this movie cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard. True, the melancholy killer theme is reminiscent of Woo's "The Killer", but the comparison ends there, and there is so little character development that the audience hardly cares who gets shot or why.This movie has even less in common with Terrantino's films, which have infinately more character and a much more interesting plot than this **SPOILER WARNING** "assasin takes revenge on treacherous boss" predictable yawner. Save two hours out of your life and skip Bangkok Dangerous, unless you are absolutely dying to see lots of red, green, and blue lighting and overdone digital editing, which is really the only thing this movie has going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to engage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This struck me as a rather average movie from directors who have yet to find their voice.After a while, the self-consciously arty editing and sound track became wearing, and there is a general feel of style over substance.For a movie with art-house pretensions, it has very little to say. The formulaic plot follows a predictable course to yet another shootout in a warehouse. And as others have pointed out - the crass sentimentality of the love interest stretches the credulity, to put it mildly.Bottom line: this felt like a rather cold and academic exercise. The characters failed to engage, and in the end, I cared not a jot about their fate (not that you won't have predicted their fate in the first 20 minutes). Better to spend your cash on a good Tarantino and remind yourself of how this sort of nihilistic violence really should be done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage is always a reason for me to go and see any movie is the star.This movie is about an assassin / hit-man Joe (Nicolas Cage) who is hired to go to Bangkok and assassinate four people who are bad. Joe befriends a local pick-pocketeer Kong (Thai actor Shahkrit Yammarm) to help him with odd jobs. In the beginning, Joe keeps a distance with Kong, but later becomes his close friend. Joe also falls in love with a dumb pharmacist. When the big villain kidnaps Kong in the end, Joe goes to rescue Kong, but in the end ? along with killing the villain, kills himself too.The Pang brothers made their BIG directorial debut in Hong Kong with the same movie in Thailand in 1999. This is their better and improved international version of the same story and same title ? with Nicolas Cage as their brand ambassador for international market. Do they succeed? I would say NO ? because throughout the movie I felt as if I was seeing an Indian movie of 1980s. The story the characters, the events, the love story ? everything was so clichéd, that I was bored.Nicolas Cage also could not lift the spirit of the movie. He looked old and haggard and mumbled his way through this deadpan character. Though I should say, he put a sincere effort.The print of the movie was intentionally made high contrast, dark and blue, as if to give international look (?), but it looked very amateurish. Most of the movie is also shot in dark ? that too makes it unpleasant viewing.I would recommend the movie only if you are a great Nicolas Cage fan or Action fan or Thai person. For everyone else - a movie that one could skip without a blink.(Stars 3.25 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kong has been mute and deaf since childhood yet he is a very talented assassin who kills for money on behalf of his mentor, Joe. One day he visits the local pharmacy and meets Fon.Kong experiences love for the first time and tries to hide his life as an assassin. Meanwhile Joe's girlfriend is violently raped by a crime boss, Joe takes his revenge and in turn he is killed by his own boss, for breaching work ethic's 'Don't kill a client'.During a midnight stroll, Kong and Fon are attacked by thieves and Kong reacts with his killer instincts by killing the thieves; Fon realises Kong's profession and leaves in fear. Soon Kong must face up to his past as he looks to destroy the people that killed his mentor and friend.I expected a film with high octane violence like the John Woo movies but what I got was something entirely different. The character Kong is full of sadness and pain especially the scene when a young Kong, tries to scream and cry; yet no words come....This was very touching and sad; it maybe ignorant of me but I never realised or it never occurred to me that a mute person cannot shout or scream when in anger...The bond between Fon and Kong was very cute and the way she tries to talk to him. The training scene was also a plus, very exciting to see how Kong learnt his trade.It may lack the high octane shoot-outs but it delivers something much more, an actual story with great moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite 'em up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pang Brothers' debut film is brimming with energy. This version of Bangkok Dangerous was filmed in Thailand, not their homeland of China. It must have been challenging to secure funding and other rudimentary objectives before filming began. Their deaf-mute hit-man concept is unique (at least from my own limited film viewing experience). Bangkok Dangerous reflects the precision and enthusiasm of their direction. I can see how many people enjoy it. I can't say that I'm one of them. I found the movie severely lacking a plot until halfway through, and I didn't like how many action sequences were framed. It's so distracting to watch this subtitled movie while various faces appear. Your eyes are drawn to someone's face in anticipation of, well anything, and you miss dialog. Close up shots are to provide introspection within character or audience or heighten the experience of an action segment. If overused, like they are here, they become a murky amalgamation of meaninglessness. However, I must confess that if you know Thai, you won't experience the framing problem to the degree I did.Kong is a warm blooded killer from the mean streets of downtown Bangkok. We see him shooting people throughout the opening segments and cannot detect if he has any remorse for his occupation. He looks passé in comparison to the modern hit men of Western cinema. He goes home after a hard day of work to his shared apartment that is inhabited by his "employer" Jo. Jo may not really be his employer. I couldn't tell what his job is. He seems to exist to provide Kong companionship. Oh, and he also brings in business by asking his girlfriend, Aom, to deliver requests to Kong. Aom is a go go dancer (exotic dancer), who is later raped by an angry client. Jo vows revenge and dies trying to avenger her. She is also killed by the angry client. Kong is left alone with no support network until he meets a pharmacist, Fon, who empathizes with him. He loses her when she witnesses him kill two thugs that interrupt their date. Kong is now completely isolated and decides to kill everyone involved with Jo and Aom's deaths before he commits suicide.Kong's condition offers no dialog. We must sympathize with him like we would a silent movie protagonist. He is portrayed Pawalit Mongkolpisit, who admirably adjusts his facial expression to gain our sympathy. I imagine this is why so many shots are extreme close ups. Since no recognizable plot occurs until midway in, Kong receives no initial characterization. The movie should have commenced with Aom's rape. The slow buildup is inefficacious in creating any reason for its existence. It does eventually evolve into a standard revenge tragedy film with an inconclusive romantic subplot. Fon alerts the police of Kong's final assault, like Jo also serves to advance the plot. Anyone could have done that, why her? She is attracted to Kong, decides he is a bad dude, doesn't even want to look at him, and then realizes her affection. How lazily convenient.I don't even mind the movie's slow pace. Hitchcock taught us that speed can be terrible in eliminating tension. He also gave us a reason to care about what was happening to his characters. The Pang brothers don't do that. Bangkok Dangerous is amateurish work created by well-intentioned people. It permits many mistakes more experienced directors would not allow. The American remake (by the same directors) amends the storytelling faults of this original production. It isn't very good either, by the way. At least they are improving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie from Thailand about a killer doing his job... i.e. killing ! By mixing flashbacks, an expected love story, a tragic end, and a lot of killing the director managed to create a very boring and unsurprising movie. Add to that some non-sense some slow motions - Asiatic directors simply love it - and you have a less than second rate violent movie.I guess the biggest challenge that the director succeeded in overcoming was in making the killings last for almost 2 hours. If this is the type of movie that Asia enjoys then it is rather sad, depressing, gloom and boring.I have just read the review of another IMDB member and did not find this movie well directed at all nor did I learn anything about Thailand. Did he really watch the same movie ? This one was classified 18 (i.e. for adults only) and does not contain an ounce of information on what Thailand is really like (unless of course Thailand is a country full of murderers and assassins). If Thailand is like in the movie then corpses must pile up in the toilets !Violence to the extreme is not sufficient to make a decent movie, and this one definitively lack of all the ingredients to make it even watchable. My advise: stay home and read a book.</fullReview>

Though it does ride into sentimentality towards the end, i still found it a profound experience.

		<fullReview>That quote from Uncut magazine sums it up very well. The filming is astounding for this Danny and Oxides first and second film respectively. The film starts with a CCTV type view, rough, drained of colour and looking squintedly down from the corner of the bathroom where the first murder occurs. There is a lot of death and violence in this film. Fons touching caringness and innocent vulnerability reaching out to Kongs detached autonomic life and ultimately changing him.This film is an accomplished violent action film but also a visually stunning love story about the darker side of Bangkok at the end of the twentieth century.Everyones going on about Iranian films at the moment and although I've yet to watch them, after seeing this I'm more interested in the Thai film scene.Addendum 18 Jun 06: This is a tragedy about an unsavable anti-hero in a deaf hit-man. It addresses the human striving for atonement. With this the human desire for justice along with order.This film is the first I have viewed in a while that depicts a, very tight, society where all the members are armed. It is not a Reservoir Dogs where only the anti-heroes are armed and the general public is innocently vulnerable.The pole dancing ladies are clothed assumedly due to political restrictions.When Kong enters a room, not meeting his lady contact in a strip bar to get more work, everyone is armed. This theme is built up; a revenge attack deemed necessary by Kong, after the situation has deteriorated into unprofessional, emotional killing, inside-killing and retribution, is visualised to the viewers in preview. The audience are shown the anti-hero walk along corridors on his way to deliver his justice and as he walks the shootings are shown in flashes. When he actually gets to the destination room the killings have already taken place with a sole-survivor hiding behind a dead body.He finds love in a tender, tending, young lady who serves him medication, he shows her his motorbike and they form a relationship. It is her love that is under the skin of this film waiting to nullify it with a happy ending but she arrives to the scene of the final battle a few seconds too late, blame the not amazing Bangkok traffic.By this final battle, Kong enters a room with a gun to his hostages head and the four men in the room have guns drawn with more gunmen racing in. It is the norm. The told cinematic justice of this is that everybody dies, although they all were armed before everybody died, it is their deeds and not the weapons they carry in this late 20th Century situation that forms the end into a slaughter.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's debut at the Toronto International Film Festival was quiet and unannounced. It captured a glimpse of the work and life of a hitman. The subject matter is somewhat shocking, dark, and not for the faint of heart. The characters and locations seem very real and reveal a bit about Bangkok that is not seen in tourist magazines. Being shot on location adds to the realism and intrigue of the movie. Although the subject matter is not unique the movie was presented with superb artistic flair. It was delightful to watch. The main characters were great. And the few moments of humour helped make this movie complete. The movie was straightforward but there was just enough ambiguity at times to keep the viewer thinking. For example, the opening scene belongs somewhere chronologically in the middle of the movie. This is a very smart if not sly and cunning movie . SPOILERS FOLLOW: honourable mention needs to go to a a scene that I thought was nicely done. In that scene the hitman had had enough. His best friend was murdered. Now, he was really mad. One could say he had entered the nastiest psychotic but silent rage i've seen portrayed on film. He stalks the killers of his friend and as he's drawing close his image is split in two . Talk about psychotic. And each one of him had a couple of guns. Neither images of him looked too happy. You can guess what happened to the bad guys. Hopefully this movie will be released in north america.</fullReview>

Assassinating his victims with no remorse or feeling.The direction (by the Pang Brothers) is superb. I'm sure we will all hear about these guys in the future. Along with a fantastic soundtrack the action is very realistic and very cold at times.If you have ever lived or worked in Thailand you will like this film even more as it touches upon certain moral values placed upon modern day Thai society. I'm not saying that all Thai people are like this in this movie, but there is a very small part of Thailand that is. The same can be said of any capital city.

I'm a huge fan of John Woo flicks like Hard Boiled and The Killer. After finishing off this film, I felt it was more of a violent drama than a pure action film.This film incorporatated many of John Woo's filming styles. Slow motion is used generously, but very well (especially at the end).

		<fullReview>Bangkok Dangerous is a low-budget, synthetic and dull crime movie. The central character of the hitman is a mute, which saves the Pang brothers from working on dialogue, something they have real problems with. Much of the special effects budget seems to have gone into showing blow flowing from the bodies of just shot victims, especially those shot in the head. John Woo's The Killer has one great action scene after another, from the Dragon Boat race shooting to the final showdown in the church. The Pang brothers settle for crummy action scenes -- a killing on a HK subway car, a shootout in a bottled water plant and a lame assassination from an apartment rooftop.The disjointed editing and washed out visuals are not art, just an attempt to cover up the bad photography and screwed up production values that typify this movie.

You know, trying to manipulate your reaction instead of letting the scene play out. If you are familiar with Wong Kar Wai's Fallen Angels, Beat Takeshi (Sonatine, Violent Cop, Fireworks, Boiling Point, Brother), Takashi Miike (Dead or Alive, Fudoh), or just looking for some cool HK style shoot em up, you will be highly disappointed.

		<fullReview>Aside from its generally above-average direction and some creative moments, (although, unlike what some of the other reviews might lead one to believe, nothing that particularly eclipses what some of the other top-flight Asian crime-kings are doing) Bangkok Dangerous doesn't have much of interest. The story might seem okay in the West, but for those who've watched any significant number of Hong Kong movies this is all familiar territory. Although the deaf-hitman concept is mildly interesting, it hurts the movie more than it helps, due to the fact that dialogue scenes consist of people talking slowly to him and him making faces back. I used the fast-forward button a lot watching this one. Good lighting and a few slick moments (action and not) aside, I found this quite a chore to watch. I would rather watch Beyond Hypothermia, The Odd One Dies, or even the poorly-received Full-Time Killer for a better "Hitman(person) In Love" story.</fullReview>

The sentimental emotional ending is much harder to watch than the blood that's in it. This is silly, this is naive and the cutting is now rather conventional compared to the first 45 minutes.I don't know very much about thai movies and can't tell whether this plot is traditional or whether the directors, Oxide and Danny Pang, have made a failure imitating the West.

		<fullReview>The dialog is somewhat limited, and even though it is in Thai with English subtitles, you feel there tones and see the feelings in the expressions. The expression of emotion through action instead of words successfully makes the high action sequences more intense. The youthful flashback sequences explain clearly and simply how this man who is loyal to his friends can assassinate his victims with no remorse or feeling. The use of sound and visual effects greatly intensifies the experience, and is comparable to Requiem For A Dream. Going from the loud club scenes to the silence of the deaf assassin finishing off his target successfully absorbs the audience deeper into the story. The characters are portrayed well and they are people for who the audience has compassion. The development of people and motivations is strong without dragging out the story. The directors did a wonderful job in making this violent story a film to be seen. The rate of events is more akin to drama than action, and this is enhanced by extended length of the hunting scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A genuine surprise. I had seen The Eye, and felt that while it had some excellent set pieces and scary moments, that it could have been better. Perhaps the American remake will be good, unlike The Ring. I had also seen Bangkok Haunted, a horror movie which had atmosphere, but few scare. So I came to this, knowing that the directors were stylish, but that they needed a superior, straighter story to tell if I was to appreciate them fully. This has it all. Great story, which will hold you until the end, fully drawn captivating characters, explosive and original action, strong performances, superb editing and dialogue, and packed with emotion. As I may have said, I'm a sucker for sentimentality, and real love stories, not the ones Hollywood tries to sell us 95% of the time, and this has both. But don't be put off if you hate that sort of thing, there is a lot of violence too, and the lovers are both very attractive. So, the story, not totally original, few are these days, but too much emphasis is placed on originality, and this adds many clever twists to an old story. A deaf-mute hitman seeks revenge on those who wronged him, while protecting his girlfriend, and proving he is not simply a killer. The climax is just as good, if not better than anything in The Matrix, and this has as many stand out scenes. But enough praise. It will probably be difficult to get hold of this film, but see it if you get the chance. Truly beautiful. Will probably climb my list as time goes on.</fullReview>
