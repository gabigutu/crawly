		<shortDescription>Want a Freakishly Good Time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, I was dragged to this movie by my 12-year-old cousin. At first I thought, "Lindsay Lohan? Who's that? And Jamie Lee Curtis? Isn't that the 'scream queen'?" I didn't want to go, but that was that.Within the first few minutes of the movie, I rolled my eyes. I thought it was just a cliche movie about a mom and a daughter that fight a lot. I was bored. But ten minutes later, the magic began. I found my eyes glued to the massive screen, I found myself "shushing" anyone that interrupted my connection with the two stars. I was hooked, and that was that.Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis work wonders together. They have wonderful chemistry on screen that make you believe that they have, in fact, switched bodies. Both actresses were brilliant in their roles of switch reversal. Their acting was so real, their expressions so priceless. Awesome, too, was the movie's supporting cast. Enough said. The script was amazingly well written, the directing extraordinary.To sum it up, this movie was "freakishly good." Pure magic, I tell you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What, me cry?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look . . . I'm mainly into sci-fi, fantasy, action-thriller, and special effects movies (i.e. Matrix, LOTR, Identity, Star Wars, etc.) and generally try to avoid chic flicks and warm-fuzzy feel-good movies. After watching the current Freaky Friday starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan now I understand why.See, I'm a guy, and guys don't cry, well, that's what we've been told. On top of that I'm 48 years old so I'd better have my maturity act together. So, what happened? Besides laughing my butt off at the truly funny scenes (my wife and I caught a few stares from other movie-goers), I had to strain every muscle in my body to keep from bawling like a, no, it can't be true .. . girl.I might have to consult a therapist (Jamie Lee can certainly fill that role anytime) to understand why this movie had such a profound effect on my emotions. Maybe it's because my parents never really understood me (I certainly understand them now) or maybe it's because I have a couple daughters and I've rarely tried to put myself in their shoes. This movie accomplished that for me, big time . . . the ultimate exercise in empathy.The interaction between mother and daughter was superbly acted and very believable especially with the switched roles. Moreover, the supporting characters, from the little brother, to the fiancé, to the grandfather, to even the detention monitor at the school were also outstanding and made this story a real winner.I can honestly say that this is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and I will most certainly buy the DVD when available. I can't believe I've been saying all this about a movie way out of my usual genre but here it is, in writing. Please watch this movie, and then tell me I'm not losing it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is about the third adaptation of the Mary Rodgers novel. Finally, the team behind this film has gotten it together. It's obvious the original text has been revised in order to include the language of today. But the best thing about the movie is the casting assembled for it, with a sure director's hand behind it.Actually, this is about the first film that has made me laugh since "Bringing down the house" that came out earlier this year. Most comedies today seem to forget that the basic premise for their existence is to amuse the audiences and entertain them, at the same time.Mark Waters, the director shows he has a fine sense of how to make things move constantly in this comedy about identity changes. Of course, this film wouldn't be half the fun it is without Jamie Lee Curtis, who has never been as effective in any previous films. Her take on Tess Coleman, the not so cool therapist, strikes the right tone.Her daughter is played with a lot of conviction by Lindsay Lohan, who is totally believable as the typical teen ager working through the pain of losing a father and getting a replacement she is not too fond of.Things move at a rapid pace; there is never a dull moment in the film. It's a perfect summer comedy that will leave the viewer satisfied and happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaky Friday: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make Freaky Friday work perfectly; you would have to believe that Jamie Lee Curtis is Lindsay Lohan and Lindsay Lohan is Jamie Lee Curtis. Although at times it seemed that way, at other times, it just seemed like Lohan was trying to be Curtis and Curtis was trying to be Lohan. Any way you look at it, Freaky Friday is a family-friendly film that tries to please everyone, and does. It pleases shallow teen prep girls because of Chad Michael Murray. It pleases teen boys because of Lindsay Lohan. It pleases older men because of a Jamie Lee Curtis thong shot. It pleases older women because of Mark Harmon. It pleases the whole family, being that they already saw Finding Nemo and it's the only other family movie out there.Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) (changed from Ellen Andrews from the novel by Mary Rodgers) is a harried psychiatrist who still has time for her family. Anna Colemen (Lohan) (changed from Annabel Andrews) is supposed to be a typical teenager (but is anything but), and has daily fights with her younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) (changed from Ben Andrews). Tess is going to marry Ryan (Harmon), because her husband died three years ago (can't there be a Disney movie with both parents still alive?), of whom Anna doesn't approve. After a fueled feud, Tess and Anna open fortune cookies that switch bodies: Tess is in Anna's body, and vice versa. Whatever will be done?Although most people have praised Curtis for her accurate portrayal of a typical teen (although with the people at my school, what she does is anything but typical), and she should be, Lohan does better at being an adult. If Lohan, a teenager, could be an adult so well, that's rather scary. I thought at most times Lohan was Tess, but Curtis was having too much fun as Anna to really be thought of as great. Instead of acting like Lohan, Curtis just acts like a young kid who just ate too much ice cream.One part of Freaky Friday that I didn't like is how often we were put in an awkward situation. And when they were there, they just didn't seem plausible. All of a sudden, Anna-as-Tess is a guest on a talk show, talks to someone she has a crush on, and watches Tess-as-Anna perform? Not only were they awkward, they were just not believable. On the other hand, Freaky Friday not only has some genuinely funny moments, but is also quite touching at times. Obviously, it was going to be, and Tess and Anna were going to learn to respect each other, considering it was shown in the trailer.One other part I didn't like was how far it strayed from the book. It only focused on Anna-as-Tess (Annabel-as-Ellen), and how she spent her day. Of course, back then she was a housewife, but now she has to be a successful doctor. I do admire it for changing it, unlike others, which is basically watching the book. Overall, Freaky Friday is a likable, pleasant 90-minute diverter. It won't change your life, but you won't be upset you saw it.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An homage to the old Disney and a hoot for the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been wanting to see this film since the trailers started playing many moons ago. I saw the Jody Foster version when it first came out in 1976 and like that one, the 2003 version is an excellent all ages movie. It reminds me of the great flicks Disney use to release all the time during the 60's and 70's so it was no surprise they reached to the vault to redo "Freaky Friday".Jamie Lee Curtis has her best comedy role since "A Fish Called Wanda". She was having fun with the part and many of the teen mannerisms she did as Annabell were dead on. Curtis is one of the most underrated actors in the world. Just based on her performance "Freaky Friday" was a great ride.Lindsay Lohan made the movie better with her take on Annabell. I have liked Lohan since "The Parent Trap" and if she decides to stay with acting she might go on as long as Jody Foster has in the business. Lohan has one thing that actors like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have and that is an expressive face. Acting is so much better when the actor can add to their part through the expressions in their face and Lindsay can do that.Watching the movie was a delight for me. I never got the feeling that 35 year old men wrote the script (they didn't) like I do with some of the "teen" movies out today.The music used by the movie band "Pink Slip" was above average and the other soundtrack music fit the film as well.Now if they would just do a big budget "Herbie the Love Bug" feature, I would be even more happy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deserves all high ratings. Not only does Jamie Lee Curtis prove to me a great Comedian, but the punch lines are displayed at exactly the right moments and exactly the right way. Curtis as a teenage girl is just as funny as Lindsay Lohan acting out the part of a grown woman trapped in her daughter's body. I loved this movie and it got great laughs out of me. I was actually able to sit in my room alone and laugh to myself without feeling stupid. So far, I've seen it three times and I don't think I will ever get tired of watching it, it just keeps getting funnier and more entertaining each time. Simply a masterpiece and I hope everyone who likes real real funny comedy gets to watch this one! This is gooood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely wild and wacky comedy that will make you laugh and feel good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan shine in this absolutely wild and wacky comedy that will make you laugh and feel good. In my opinion, the way she and Annabelle (Lindsay Lohan) magically exchanged bodies was really creepy. This was because the earth rumbled when it happened. If you want to know how it happened, you'll have to see the movie. I said that because I don't want to spoil anything. If you ask me, the way Annabelle and Jake (Chad Michael Murray) met was absolutely romantic. Also, to me, he was an absolute charmer. I especially loved it when Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) scolded Annabelle when she was making trouble. In conclusion, if you like Lindsay Lohan or Jamie Lee Curtis, I highly recommend this absolutely wild and wacky comedy that will make you laugh and feel good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the right touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freaky Friday has just the right touch. In making an identity-switch movie, there is always the temptation to overdo things, in both the comedy and the pathos sides. Jamie Lee Curtis has just about the right balance portraying a 15-year-old in a 40-year-old body. On the comedy side, although on occasions coming across as just a little bit too silly, Curtis has on the whole brought out the funny side of the situation without undue exaggeration. The important thing is her success in making the whole thing believable. On the pathos side, her toasting speech in the engagement ceremony is touching performance. Lindsay Logan, on the other hand, has much less opportunity of repeating her brilliant performance in The Parent Trap (1998). The fault is not hers. It's just that it's much less fun watching a 40-year-old in a 15-year-old body than the other way around. While this is obviously the ladies' show, the two beaus provide reliable support. However, it is the fantastic pair of grandpa (Harold Gould) and little brother (Ryan Malgarini) who stole the show, particularly the little guy. I for one would love to see a sequel with this pair swapping bodies. Good flick; well worth the admission price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put yourself in others shoes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an excellent entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed it and well put-together explaining individual mind-frame and it works.I am sure we easily judge into other people's positive and negative attitudes, but unless we put ourselves into their shoes, we will never know. Hence this film takes us into the journey of a daughter and mother who have complete different personalities. After a while, the daughter and mother switch "only" bodies (via some weird Chinese magic), by which they realize each others "actual life".This film could have been made in various forms, but the writer and the director chose a way by which they can convey their message to the society while entertaining at the same time, which I personally think is a better option. The film is very light-hearted, well scripted, well directed, excellent costumes, brilliant acting skills, and finally very easy to follow the storyline.Please do yourself a favor and rent this DVD (and order a pizza) and watch it at home with your family - maybe it will do you some good.Enjoy!

		<shortDescription>Curtis outstanding as troubled teen in mom's body</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I couldn't understand why this was the version to see. It didn't seem any better than the Shelley Long/Gaby Hoffmann version I enjoyed years ago. Lindsay Lohan was a holy terror and her mom was merely uptight but nothing special. But of course all that changed when the magic spell took effect and Anna woke up horrified.There are many deserving performances, mostly dramatic, that get Oscar nominations each year. It's easier for a movie like this to get recognition when comedy has its own categories. But Jamie Lee Curtis was amazing. Such a bizarre sight, this middle-aged woman acting like a teen! Maybe Oscar would be asking too much because of the competition, but Curtis certainly deserved a Golden Globe nomination. And Lindsay Lohan did a capable job of the mom in a teen's body, trying so hard to fit in at school.Harold Gould's performance also should be noted. He made quite a likable buffoonish grandfather. I liked Rosalind Chao's clueless, almost stereotypical restaurant hostess. Lucille Soong made us notice as Chao's meddling mom who just HAD to help this family. And Jeff Marcus as one of Tess' more troubled patients.Although the musicians showed talent, I will say I agree with the first opinion Tess had of her daughter's music. It was all just noise! I liked the music for the wedding rehearsal.I still want to see the Jodie Foster original, and twice I have been annoyed that someone felt the need to do a remake rather than show the original. But this one was really worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a remake and it delivered big time! Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are an unstoppably funny team of mother and daughter that have just the right chemistry, the right dose of sarcasm and the right dose of whatever it takes to make you laugh and enjoy this film. No film this cheery and delightful would be complete with the dish! And the dish here is Chad Michael Murray with awesome hair, playing the love interest of Lohan's character.The story is about this mother and daughter who don't seem to appreciate each other's lives, so one Freaky Friday, while having dinner at a Chinese restaurant, they both receive fortune cookies with a weird message in them. The next morning, they wake up to find out that they have switched bodies, whereby the mum's character now has the daughter's thinking and reasoning, while the daughter now had the mother's thoughts and reasoning.The result is a pure riot! A must see for everyone who enjoys watching films that warm the heart and make you laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one who believes that a good film can be made very, very good by a single moment of spectacular excellence, a standout, blow-'em-away scene, maybe just two minutes long, that grabs you by the balls / heart and exudes some sort of sheer magic. Great films, I mean, truly majestic films (a club whose members you could count on your fingers) play at this level all the time, and I haven't seen one of those in half a decade. So we settle, well enough, for the shining, gilded tips that we can sometimes find in sturdy, self-sufficient films. These moments aren't great by themselves; take them out of their element and they're near worthless. No, these moments are great because the movie did the footwork in bringing you there, in setting up the big fall, the miles of development that gives that moment it's striking power. In The Usual Suspects you had Verbal Kint's revelation. In Requiem For a Dream, the climaxing montage of wrecked and debased humanity. And in Freaky Friday, in a measure of less gravity and only slightly less potency, we have too-uptight-for-her-own-good, conservative, forty-something Jamie Lee Curtis rocking out some killer power chords on an electric guitar. It's a moment of sheer unadulterated glee, of complete Dadaistic, fearless, uncynical and unfettered freedom that pretty much can exist only in the pre-slated innocence and silliness of a Disney film (which is probably their greatest under-appreciated asset). It is a moment of catharsis, of really breaking free, and where the movie comes full circle in its inner-child liberating mission.Let me explain. What we have, for the bulk of its 90 minutes, is a film that sometimes (and only lightly) sermonizes about understanding, but is mostly about cutting loose and having fun. The formula's a winner. The real danger of the setup - typically dysfunctional family sans father figure, overbearing mother, rebellious teenage daughter - is that once you give them a unique chance to reconcile and identify with each other, after some initial hi-jinks, we go down some treacly, familiar road that's more pushy than good for you. Thankfully, that all takes a backseat to really exploring the sort of fun you can have when you've got a capable director and some really fine actresses to play around with. This lets all the pieces fall into place for that aforementioned climax.Jamie Lee Curtis jumps right into her role and comes off charming and amusing as the back-talking, slang spouting teenager trapped in her mom's body. There's no doubt she's having a good time, but put any other aging actress with a prudish complex in her place (these are in no low stock), let her go wild, and I guarantee that you'll get pretty much the same result, which isn't a bad thing, really. On the other hand, I'm starting to think that Lindsay Lohan is the real deal. Before I watched Mean Girls and Freaky Friday, I really couldn't see what the big deal was, but now I'm believing that she really deserves her big star push. I mean, she wouldn't be able to carry a dry melodrama about accountants with a fondness for Neiztche, but she can certainly polish roles befitting of her to a damned spit-shine. I suppose I give her more credit because it's a much grander feat for a 15-year old to play a 45-year old than vice versa, but moreso I think she brings just the right flavor, oscillating between appalled, disciplinarian harumphs and vulnerable, sometimes happy realization of truths. It's the second part, the letting her hair down, erasing that prim guard, and partying like a middle-aged woman trapped in a teenager's body learning to be young all over again only could, that really buoys the whole movie. And when we see her eyes well up with tears and her heart teetering on edge as she tells her daughter, Anna, in her mother's body, to put her relationship with her fiancé on the line in a moment of self-sacrifice, that is when we realize that this whirlwind of absurdity has suddenly shut down into an honestly touching moment, and Lohan pulls it off flawlessly.Though for all this, the tradeoff is that Freaky Friday requires you to suspend a whole lot of disbelief, not for the completely sudden and unexplained body switching idea, but for the ways through which mother and daughter are able to hold a day in each others' lives together. From unpassably lousy psychiatry and driving to waltzing through a teacher's lounge to cheat on a test, the film is full of near impossibilities that you have to accept our plucky heroines have the gumption and luck to pull off. The most annoying of all these is Anna's teenage crush, Jake, who, at the drop of a hat, does the following: takes nagging interest in daughter, falls in love with mother, completely disassociates with daughter, stalks mother, falls out of love with mother and back in love with daughter. Though for the overall lightening fast, aimed-for-children pacing of the film, some of these are necessary shortcuts that can be forgiven under sheer winsomeness. If you're taking the film that seriously, anyway, you've completely missed the point. A plodding drama with prim respect to plausibility and minor character development is exactly the sort of stuffy fare that this vehicle of pixish momentum is made to make you forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freaky Friday, this was such a funny movie, and a huge surprise for 2003. This is actually a new favorite comedy of mine; Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan have such a great chemistry, I was really impressed with, new comer, Lohan's performance. She and Jamie just made this film an absolute blast to watch. I think I loved Jamie more though, she captured the whole essence of being a teenager perfectly, she did not over do it at all. Not to mention she's just an absolute pleasure to watch on screen, she's such a terrific actress, I love her so much. The story was just so perfect to update into today's society where everyone is so busy to even notice each other.Anna is a teenage girl, she's pretty typical, she loves music, is a bit angry with her life, a bit of a drama queen, is annoyed by her little brother, and annoyed with her mother who is constantly on her case. Tess, Anna's mom, is a busy lady with a constant on the move schedule, she and Anna just constantly bump heads with one thing or another. Tess is also getting married again to a man who Anna is not too fond of. One night when Anna asks her mom if she can perform at a concert on the night of the wedding rehearsal, it doesn't go so well and they get into a huge fight. The restaurant owner's mom gives them a fortune cookie and ends up switching bodies. They end up learning that maybe their lives are a little harder than what they really expected it to be.Freaky Friday is a very enjoyable film that I'm very sure you'll have a good time watching. It's a very impressive comedy for any age. My favorite scene was without a doubt when Anna(in Tess's body) goes on TV discussing her latest book and tells the truth about why adults worry so much, not to mention the scene where Tess and Anna discover their bodies are switched. This is just a great remake, it has a great cast, a fun script, and is just all around a good movie, I highly recommend it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's smarter live action movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And by smart I mean, well-executed and well directed, with each actor/actress delivering a truly unique performance on their own. This is probably one of the better movies in Disney's live action cannon. The story of a mother/daughter switching bodies for one freaky Friday results in mayhem in both characters' lives, ranging from Tess' hard time coping with her daughter's high school life, to Anne's somewhat ignorant approach to her mother's job as a psychatrist. The soundtrack's pretty cool and showcasing a then almost unknown Lindsay Lohan who delivered a great performance. Add that with Jamie Lee Curtis' charm that only she can deliver, and you got a winner. One to add to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun injecting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this is classically the sort of movie most love to hate, and I know I thought I would when the premise of the story made itself obvious, it ended up being quite the opposite for me.Jamie Lee Curtis pulls off her part extremely well as you'd naturally expect from her, but being my first experience of Lindsay Lohan I wasn't prepared for her performance to suck me into the story and the movie like it did.The music is what really attracted me to it, like being at a live performance, and avoiding actors-with-real-singer-voice-over is really something this genre of movies should do a lot more of. And that's where Lindsay's talent has a real impact on how well this scenario really comes off.Don't expect it to necessarily surprise you by breaking the formula that you might be expecting, but although it's incredibly hard to act these parts and make it believable, I think Jamie and Lindsay manage to do it really well without making it overly obvious and cheesy which would be so easy to do.The key characters give a good mix of comedy and fun and support the story well enough so that you can actually sit back and let yourself get wrapped up in the fun and forget about the unreality.The presentation and content of this often used story is the difference here, it injects fun and life into your day and gives you the smile that you're hoping to come out of a movie like this with.Undoubtedly worth watching if this type of movie appeals to you, but equally a nice surprise for those who it wouldn't normally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen the original though knew the concept. I enjoyed the film and Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan did good jobs of inhabiting each other's bodies. Curtis really goes to town with the gestures and mannerisms of a 16 yr old (proving perhaps we're all still 16 in our minds) and Lohan does a good impression of a mature mom whilst actually being 16. The end is highly predictable though none the worse for that.Of the supporting players Mark Harmon has little to do but look baffled at the character changes and the annoying part goes to Harold Gould as a rather pointless deaf grand-dad. The part of the teacher played by Stephen Tobolowsky could have been expanded as his dry approach was amusing.Overall a film well worth seeing. Lindsey Lohan should go far and Jamie Lee Curtis is still worth good movie parts which she seems to find hard to get these days.</fullReview>

Freaky Friday as we all no had originally starred Jodie foster. Lindsay Lohan shows a great strength and will be the next Jodie foster in my opinion and many others I'm sure. Jamie lee Curtis is a ray of light in the movie she shows how mothers mainly react towards Anna's behaviour but for Lindsay to act as a daughter and a mother well you have to be extremely talented to do that. Don't you. Lindsay Lohan overall is a great role model and inspiration in this movie! Katie -x- Lindz no1 fan :)</fullReview>

After seeing "Herbie: Fully Loaded," I wanted to see more of Lindsay Lohan. Hey, I am 41, but I am glad to say that I am one of her new fans. She is both pretty and quite talented. Of course, for us "older folks," there is also Jamie Lee Curtis and Mark Harmon. Harmon plays the straight man to Curtis; she is hilarious here."Freaky Friday" was fun for my entire family.

The film actually and surprisingly provides some fresh and original moments. Set in contemporary times, Lindsay Lohan completes a trio of teenage rockers, whose performance depends on a guitar solo to launch their careers. The generational switch , complicates and upsets the balance , of awkward teenage growing pains, and the mothers new fiancée'. Smartly directed by Mark Waters, the pace of the movie is even and strong. The family structure does survive, but with a better understanding of each others point of view and lifestyle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>old-fashion trash made into a vibrant, more realistic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For teens I highly recommend this movie. It is much better than all the other Freaky Friday movies. This one was much more "today" and had colors that don't hurt my eyes to look at. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis were perfect for these roles. I think the director did an excellent job at choosing his cast and re-making garbage, into something I could watch again. Especially Lohans little "boy friend" that's something I can watch over and over again. Her brother may have been perhaps the funniest part of the movie. In other Freaky Friday movies, I didn't really find anything funny, just dull and boring. It's also interesting how they change the "body switching item" each time. In one of them it was a watch or locket or something like that, and this time it's something different. It always is. I highly recommend this movie for just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>modern, good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Freaky Friday' (2003) is a remake of a Disney movie about a young, rebellious girl and her mother swapping bodies for a day. This enables them to see each other through a new set of eyes so they are able to understand their points of view better and (hopefully) respect each other a little bit more.'Freaky Friday' is actually an enjoyable escape for a couple of hours. There are plenty of laughs, and the characters are believable in their roles. There is a definite focus in the film, so it does not require much thought. It's the sort of film you can just sit back and relax with.It's been too long ago that I've seen the original, so I will not compare. I will just state that I think this was a good remake of the film. A film like this one is dated quickly because relating to the characters is a 'must'. This film is in tune with current family values and relationships and in with modern trends. Well done. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that had bad timing when it came to its release. An overworked mother and her daughter do not get along. When they switch bodies, each is forced to adapt to the others life for one freaky Friday. I thought this was cute and not bad. All of the fancy characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaky Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a widowed mother with a daughter, and they don't exactly see eye to eye. Tess is engaged and soon to be married, but Anna (Lindsey Lohan) isn't very thrilled about it. The family goes out to a Chinese restaurant where Anna and Tess each receive a fortune cookie. This fortune cookie curses them into each other's bodies. Anna is in a high school band that plays in her basement, until they found the chance to play at a local club called the House of Blues. This opportunity is the same night as Tess's wedding rehearsal. In order to have the curse reversed, both of them must learn how to be selfless. At the event, Tess is in Anna's body as she performs at the House of Blues. This was a small step to fixing everything. Then when they get back to the wedding rehearsal, Anna delivers a touching speech to her mom letting her know how happy she is for her, and even though she misses her dad; she is willing to make room for someone new. But was this enough to break the curse?The message director Mark Waters was trying to portray was that in order to understand someone, another must walk a mile in their shoes. Tess and Anna fought all the time and didn't ever take the time to talk. However, once they walked in each other's shoes, they learned that the other's lives weren't as perfect as they assumed. This would be a message to any kind of relationship. In order to have a great relationship, people must learn to listen and understand to what others are feeling or thinking. This movie was very entertaining and touching. Many teenage girls can relate to fighting with their mothers like this. It doesn't matter what kind of family they come from, they are all the same. They really show how a mother and daughter's relationship can grow by putting them in different environments where the characters must step out of their comfort zone. The sense of fashion is completely different, as well, and I believe it really helps the audience to connect with the characters. While the comedy is amusing to watch and to hear, I believe the message is just as important. The director,writers, and actors did an amazing job with making a movie that would touch the audience's hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah poor Lindsay Lohan before she lost the plot,she was great in The Parent Trap,Herbie Fully Loaded,even this movie was good so here is my review on Freaky Friday.Lohan plays Anna Coleman a rebellious teenager who likes to rock it out with her mates and their band that's up for a completion,but Anna's overprotective mother Tess(played by Jamie Lee Curtis)doesn't want her to miss out on her engagement party dinner with her new fiancé(played by Mark Harmon who also starred in the 2004 movie Chasing Liberty as Mandy Moore's dad who's a president). But when Anna and Tess receive mysterious fortune cookies from a mysterious Chinese woman the two wake up the next morning in body swap reverse. So now Lindsay Lohan IS Jamie Lee Curtis and vice versa for Curtis' charcther. Now the two must figure out how to change back before Tess' big day ???Overall I found this to be a guilt pleasure of mine,its funny,charming and its a great film to watch with your mates. For what it is i'd say check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Family Film WIth A Good Deal of Honest Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Family Fun" doesn't need to be completely innocuous or empty-headed, and this comedy is a well-crafted, easy-going, energetic time-bending teen fantasy--that will also appeal to parents, as both generations get in their licks when mother and daughter change identities for an inch of time--long enough for either to learn some worthwhile lessons.Freaky Friday is not a stupid film, nor is it cutting-edge--Curtis and Lohan are obviously having a delightful time, and if you're not looking for consciousness-raising of any significance, you will too! It's pleasant to watch a pro at work with a talented younger performer, and with luck, perhaps Lohan will someday achieve the promise as an adult she shows in this delightful romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Which Friday is Freaker?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FREAKY Friday REMAKE Which Freaky Friday is better?The original one with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris or the remake with Linsey Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis? Or perhaps the 1995 with Gaby Hoffmann and Shelly Long ? Who has heard of this version? They decided not to release it on DVD or VHS so lets not even consider it but it is good to acknowledge it exists. OK so which version is better? The 1976 version or the 2003 version. That all depends on what type of movie you're looking for. If you want lots of laughs stemming from silly slapstick moments with lots of charm, the original delivers. The plot exists to serve the comedic moments of the film, and there are plenty cleaver gags constructed for that purpose. There the types of gags that one might find in a Buster Keaton or Abbot &amp; Costello comedy. Thus the original is a fun picture. If you want a film that is more witty and in-depth the remake delivers. There are hardly any slapstick moments in this film, but what it lacks in comic hijacks is made up for with an actual story to tell instead of a series of comedy sketches stringed together to form a story. Plus it has the charming Linsey Lohan when she was not in trouble with the law.The original film has better constructed gags and is funnier.The remake has a better written script and thus tells a more understandable and believable story.Both are well made and worthwhile films to add to your library. Which Friday you find freakier will depend on your individual movie tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Disney films ever...just an awesome time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I have seen the original Freaky Friday film I don't remember so this is my only referral I have for the film. Since the moment I first saw it I have loved it. It is probably one of my favorite films, especially from Disney. While it's no secret that I've been a sucker for Disney films (especially live action) I think Freaky Friday is something extra special. The film is just a lot of fun from beginning to end with some real emotion, and really terrific characters. The idea of the film is a little over the top so you might expect for it to be a little corny or overdone but it never reaches that point. The two lead actors do such an incredible job at making this believable from two separate sides. Director Mark Waters is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. He has an incredible way of really bringing out characters and also bringing reality to a story. He seems to have a real handle on real life and just makes you riveted to the story. He does it in this film, Mean Girls, Just Like Heaven and most recently with The Spiderwick Chronicles...simply put he knows how tell a story. Plus Freaky Friday holds it's own as a Disney film because it's cute and fun and completely family friendly.Lindsay Lohan in her starring Disney days plays Anna Coleman, the misunderstood, frustrated and typical teenager. Lohan became a star via Disney films for a reason...you just relate to her and are drawn to her characters. She's very 'girl next door' and she DOES have talent. The amazing Jamie Lee Curtis proves her versatility as Lohan's Mom Tess. As Tess she is the perfect mother type to Lohan's rebellious teenager but she really shines as Mom with Lohan inside her. She does such an amazing job of being the same character that Lohan is before they switch. Lohan also does an equally good job playing Curtis' character. They are truly the shining point of the film and they are awesome. Curtis is well deserving of her Golden Globe nomination for the role but Lohan should have received one as well. Chad Michael Murray is the token 'hot guy' that Lohan's character is infatuated with. He doesn't really do much except look pretty but I will say he has great chemistry with Lohan BUT he also has great chemistry with Curtis...weird but very cool for the purpose of the film. The supporting cast is excellent and all very important to the film including the terrific Mark Harmon, very funny Harold Gould, really terrific Ryan Malgarini, Rosalind Chao, Lucille Soong, and Stephen Tobolowsky.Despite the film having a really strong moral message it's not overly intense. It's so much fun and it's just something you can sit down and laugh and smile and just have a really great time and anyone can watch it and it's the type of movie I could watch again and again making it one of my all time favorites. Pretty impressive for a remake. You definitely need to check this out and watch it with the family because I think it is the ultimate family movie with something for everyone and a really cool message to boot. Definitely huge marks here!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's best motion pictures ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a wonderful film that stands up under countless rewatchings. In fact, once I come in at a certain part in this movie, it's nearly impossible for me to leave the room until it's done. From start to finish this movie is captivating, highly interesting, well-paced, and full of laughs.Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis play a mother and a daughter who have switched bodies. And, boy, have they switched! Both Lohan and Curtis convince us of the switch, and they deliver the resulting hilarity with delightful efficiency.Also notice the amazing use of sound and music (the former of which has probably been overlooked) used to heighten the mood of this movie. Who can fail to love "Take Me Away" or the ending song at the wedding? And each time I watch the "privacy is a privilege" scene, I'm tickled pink by the drum-like sound effects that enhance the conflict to a wonderful intensity.Oliver Wood ("Mr. Holland's Opus", the Jason Bourne series) does some excellent work as the director of photography, so keep an eye out for that, too.Oh, and this is also probably Lindsay Lohan's best movie. She is really a wonderfully talented actress, and it has been very disappointing to see her life go downhill in the past few years. This movie is like a time capsule, which takes you back to the time when she was still a sweet teenage actress with wonderful red hair and no tabloid scandals. It all has quite a tearful nostalgia to it.But in all seriousness, this is a wonderful movie which the whole family can enjoy. Please, please watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it, part of the reason for my watching this was to see Lindsay Lohan. I was surprised to see, however, that she was overshadowed very slightly by the performance of Jamie Lee Curtis.Jamie makes us honestly believe that she is Anna trapped in her mother's body. I mean, she almost played Anna better than Lindsay Lohan did! The gestures, the way she spoke (even more than the words alone), the way she treated Anna's younger brother- it was all done to near-perfection.One of my favorite moments in the film is when she (Anna in her mother's body) does a somersault over the couch to avoid getting kissed by her mom's fiancé.Go agile Jamie! This is not to say Lindsay Lohan's performances as Tess Coleman were not excellent, but I felt like she was a little too mean at times. Perhaps, though, that was to portray Tess's realization that Anna's life really was almost as bad as as Anna had been saying. Her reaction might have been to decide to expose her more aggressive side in the light of such situations. In the beginning we don't get much insight into Tess's behavioral patterns- she acted extremely calm and psychiatrist-like- so seeing her as Anna was interesting.As for the script of the movie, I love the changes they made from the original. In the 1976 version, the rift between mother and daughter was not quite as large. In fact, the reason why they switched was because they simultaneously wished they could live each other's lives for a little- something Tess and the new Anna would never have done in a million years.The switch did not happen on the eve of the mother's wedding, so all of the suspense about that event was not there.I personally enjoyed the new changes. I absolutely and completely loved PeiPei's mom, and the fortune cookie idea was an excellent one that added magic and mystery to the film.The only part that I expected that never seemed to happen, was someone catching the gist that something was not right here, or either Tess or Anna admitting what had happened with their bodies. It was strange, but it added suspense. The closest thing to it, was Jake (Chad-Michael-Murray) hitting on Anna while she was in her mother's body. That, was one of the "freakiest" things in the film.I thought, They are not going to do this."When I look into your eyes, I feel like I know you." Oh no Jake, don't do it please! All freakishness aside, the film was an excellent one. It contained a great lesson, great laughs, superb cast and an excellent modernization and tweaking of the script. The music also, was excellent.I'm not sure just how it compares to the 1976 version, in terms of quality, as I saw that movie when I was...6? But I always remember how I felt about a film, and I loved both of them alike.The concept of the movie itself is completely nuts (blame Mary Rodgers, the writer of the novel), but nonetheless, it has somehow been made to work- twice. I don't know what to say about the 1995 TV version, because, I never did see it.This is a film I would definitely recommend. Disney gets a definite thumbs up, yet again.</fullReview>

The mother is now the daughter in the daughters body and vice versa. The antics of this movie are hilarious when the mother has to go to high school as the daughter and the daughter has to go to work as a psychologist as the mother.I thought that the movie was funny and yet touching in a way. The way that the mother and daughter see each others lives totally changes and brings them closer together.The best part was the ending so rent this movie on a funny freaky Friday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not expect to find the premise of this movie very believable! Well, of course it isn't. But, that did not prevent it from being thoroughly enjoyable and rewarding! In my opinion, the actors all played their own roles in a very believable fashion. (once you allowed the unreal to be real) Then, for me, it was charming, heart warming, and allowed what each of us would like to be able to do. Namely, to see through the eyes of another what their personal reality is. And to allow that new reality to change your own view of life.I really liked it. I would recommend it to anyone, anytime. It is uplifting and satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun - Jamie's best role for years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun and harmless remake of the popular 1977 Disney film of the same name.Jamie and Lindsay star as a mother and teenage daughter, who don't exactly see eye to eye. They constantly argue and don't understand each others livelihoods and problems in any way shape or form. That is of course until they are magically transferred into each others bodies for a day with genuinely funny consequences.Despite the over familiarity of this type of subject, it is handed with real skill and does more than enough to have you chuckling throughout and basically watching the stars make fools of themselves! Lindsay Lohan is great, but the real star of the show is Jamie Lee Curtis in her best performance for years, she clearly enjoys herself in her role as mother (and daughter!!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As overall, Freaky Friday is a good film but not perfect. First of all there is some bugs. One of them is that, In the first morning after the "personal change", Anna(actually is mom) wearing some "old" clothes. But when the step father brings she to the school we saw that Anna's clothes aren't the clothes which she wore at home. The relation between Harry and grandpa is very funny and adds joy to the movie. Harry's grandpa imitation "earthquake.. earthquake wow" quote is certainly bringing the house down. Watch this movie if you want some fun. Lindsay Lohan is great at all. Jamie Lee Curtis shows her quality as an actress.</fullReview>

You took my heart and put it back together again. Anyone know why they changed it? I'm not sure if they changed it because it was kind of "dirty" in someone's mind, but it's possible. Let me know what you think...I'd really like to figure it out. I really like this movie---but that's the only thing I can find that annoys me--I like the movie version of the song much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that I didn't like it, because I did. I had not seen the original 'Freaky Friday', and this one had received lots of build-up, so naturally my expectations were a bit too high. Overall entertaining, an old Asian lady sees mom and daughter arguing, puts a 'spell' on them so they switch bodies, have to live as each other for a time. Daughter in mom's body has to pretend to be a psychologist. Mom in daughter's body has to go to school, and play in the rock band. Interesting and funny things happen, somehow all drastic outcomes are avoided and all ends well. It is a cute, mindless type of movie that can be watched at any time I am bored and need a few well-done chuckles. Much like Sweet Home Alabama and Legally Blonde, two other fluff movies I own and enjoy. Not everything has to be a potential award-winner, after all.</fullReview>

This movie also brought tears to my eyes (where Anna gives her speech at the end). I also liked the way they protrayed the daughter's life, it wasn't that she didn't study, her school work was hard, and the teacher WAS out to make things hard for her!

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I am convinced that many movies are about movies as a matter of demand. When we enter that darkened room, we often expect not be taken to another real reality, but to a movie reality that has some degree of self-awareness.A great many of these movies have some sort of body-shifting. The plot mechanics are simple: a dead person in a borrowed body; bodies (or identities) shifted, sometimes a simple con. "Face/Off" at least had a novel way of getting us there.Here we have the magical body swap. Once that's set up, we have the sweet situation of knowing that we have an actress playing a role playing a role. The rest is all skits exploiting that as the story moves through some trite, incidental story.The question is how much folding can an actor do? The idea is that we are supposed to see Jamie Lee (wife of the prince of folding: Christopher Guest), the Mom, and the daughter all at once. Folded acting; actors -- real ones -- live for this sort of opportunity. How different actors deal with this is a survey of how the world is put together.We can have the silly model. That's where the actor just goofs. Its what Jamie Lee does here and is made possible because teenagers (at least in films that have a fake "adult" perspective) are inherently goofy. Silly is fun.We can have the parody. This focuses not on making fun of the character, but of the other actor. "Face/Off" had this meta-goof. "Third Man" is the icon for this sort of thing, metaparodied in "Heavenly Creatures." We can have a parody of the whole thing: "Cat People" was about the misfit of sex in movies reflected by the perversion of humans in cat bodies.What's the point? That American humor -- even a movie as supposedly trivial as this -- is sophisticated and highly self-referential. Check out the references: she is a writer, an analyst and appears on a TeeVee show. That adds so many more layers and we love it:Annabelle is in Tess who is on TeeVee as the writer of the book to support the ideal of her publisher lover. That's five folds, and it matches the previous record of "Nurse Betty."As balance, there's the bit the other way as well: Tess in Annabelle as a rock performer, possibly the most `ironic' type in our society.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considering it was a remake, I thought it was good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think it would be too great since I already knew the plot and basically what would happen, but it turned out to be very enjoyable. The 2 leads, Jamie Lee and Lindsay, were good and without them it would not have been as good. As others have stated, the first 20 minutes sort of drag as you wait for them to switch bodies, but once that happens, there are some funny situations. The mom in her daughter's body finds out school is harder than she thought. There is another girl and a teacher that have it out for Anna. And when Anna as her mom has to go to work and listen to people discuss their problems, that was very funny. Plus, the Chinese restaurant workers were cute with their little accent.FINAL VERDICT: Just pretend what happens is possible and you will have a very good time. It's a light hearted comedy thats meant not to be taken seriously. I recommend it for those who aren't looking for a thought provoking drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that I could honestly call this one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. "Freaky Friday" stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan as a mother and daughter who end up inside each other's bodies, see what each other's daily life is really like, and switch back through the power of love. It's a simple enough story that's been done, but this film takes advantage it. Lohan and Curtis are both very good at seeming as though they are really inside each other's bodies. Putting them in implausible situations (such as the daughter in the mother's body having to go on live TV) are unexpected scenes that end up bringing big laughs. The ending is the usual, involving the mother and daughter coming to a greater understanding of each other, but this one might actually bring a few tears. Jamie Lee Curtis is hilarious in her imitation of a teenage daughter, and her scenes of trying to adapt to situations at work or at home are some of the funniest in the movie. This is Lindsay Lohan's best film since "The Parent Trap," and both of these films are remakes that actually prove to be better than their originals. It's not absolutely perfect, since some of the material can be a little over-the-top at unnecessary times, but it's still very enjoyable. All ages alike will find something to enjoy here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaky Leads. Not So Freaky Script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freaky Friday (2003): Dir: Mark Waters / Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Mark Harmon, Harold Gould, Chad Michael Murray: I am not sure why the emphasis is on Friday since it is the dawn of the weekend. Promising remake faltered by cheap sets and simple plotting. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan play a mother and daughter duo whose bodies are switched due to a lame fortune cookie mishap. Curtis plays a psychiatrist who just completed a successful book. Lohan plays her rebellious daughter who plays in a band and serves detention often at school. They devour fortune cookies at a Chinese restaurant while in the midst of bickering and they switch bodies. This is totally lame in its earthquake effect. Directed by Mark Waters who had already made the embarrassing Head Over Heels. This is not much of an improvement given the fact that Curtis and Lohan actually pull off convincing portrayal, but they are trapped in a formula driven showcase that is beneath them. Mark Harmon is wasted as Curtis's fiancé, and the women at the Chinese restaurant are lame. Harold Gould makes a wasted appearance as grandpa. Chad Michael Murray plays the boyfriend whom mother disapproves of. Remake that toys with one's speech and habits while also addressing age, responsibility and parental role models. Unfortunately it is a remake that is hardly freaky on any given day. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a certain chemistry between Jamie and Lohan and their clash of generation is rather funny. As Jamie had been also a high grader decades ago (« fog », « Halloween »), this movie is also interesting the evolution of education and it's rather a bad one : clothes, manners, knowledge have become loose ! Actually ; when you see how Lohan dresses to go to school and the kind of music she does, well, it's not very kind, open and charming. I know that teenage means rebellion but emancipation can be light too. However my biggest dislike with this movie lies with its treatment of supernatural. The fact that mother and sister have changed souls and that audience can't discern it visually diminishes the impact. Maybe i am dumb, but every time i saw Jaime inhabited by Lohan's soul, i reacted as if she was Jaime who was still playing (I know it was that actually!). In other words, as I witness always the same body, for me, the person stayed the same. To be clear, as soon as the exchange happened, i would have rather Jaime playing the part of Lohan and vice- versa. This way, the supernatural effect would have been clear and it would have been more funny to see Jaime going to high school with Lohan's look? It's all the more logical that the movie cover makes this choice: Jaime dressed as a punk girl and Lohan as a Lady! I'm sure this kind of subjectivity reality has been done before (maybe in « X-files ») and i'm sure it would have benefit greatly to the movie !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) can't seem to get along with her teenage daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan). Tess is a therapist getting married to Ryan (Mark Harmon). Anna's life in school isn't going that well. Stacey (Julie Gonzalo) is picking on her. School hunk Jake (Chad Michael Murray) doesn't know she exists. She keeps getting detention. Then Jake talks to her. Her band has an audition but it's her mother's wedding rehearsal. They get into a big fight at the Chinese restaurant and magic fortune cookies set them switching bodies.As a Disney teen movie, it's relatively harmless. It's better than most. Lindsay Lohan is good at playing the teen at this point and it's a good start to her high school roles. It's easier for her to play more uptight during the switch. Jamie Lee Curtis is great at being childish. She has the tougher job. The great thing is that both actresses do credible jobs both before and after the switch. The story isn't that special. It's a pretty straight forward body switch.</fullReview>

Superb concept, believable screenplay, honest performances and lovely background music is what defines this movie for me.Jamie Lee Curtis truly rocked the show. She was amazing throughout the movie. Lindsay Lohan was great too. In fact, this is the best movie that i have seen of hers. Supporting cast was superb with each one of them putting in their optimum. The best thing about the movie was its emotional connect; truly loved the scenes between Tess and Anna. The movie also made me think about the people in my life and my relationship with each one of them. I would rate it very high on entertainment quotient too. It made me laugh, burst out with joy, feel sad and even cry. Truly made my evening.I would strongly recommended this movie to everyone on account of its sheer entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is such chemistry between Lohan and Curtis that I was sucked into this fantasy lock, stock and barrel. The two divas do not miss a trick when it comes time to convince us that they are indeed the other person trapped in a new body. Curtis winces, sashays, smirks, wails and gasps like a teenager, and Lohan captures every nuance of a beleaguered middle-aged professional struggling to maintain control In a situation that defies her every attempt to cover up one wacky trap after another. She has to let her daughter, who now inhabits her body, represent her as a psychotherapist, both in the office and on a TV talk show to discuss her book. The results are always hilarious, with Curtis acting exactly like a teenager attempting to navigate through session after session with her Mom's nutty patients. Equally wacky are the scenes of Lohan, with her mother's uptight personality trying to fit in as a high school student deflecting the amorous advances of Jake, the daughter's motorcycle-riding stud boyfriend. Underneath all these hijinks is the serious part of this, and every, switch movie, the journey that mother and daughter take that gives each a firsthand understanding of what makes the other tick. I'm a 58-year-old guy, not a fan of most chick flicks, funny or otherwise, but I was crying like a kid when Curtis and Lohan finally "got" each other and reached a point of mutual admiration and love that, unfortunately, seems to be possible only in movies. That's why they make them, why we see them, and why we are grateful when one of them turns out to be a timeless classic, like Freaky Friday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this version. Would anyone back me up if I gave an idea to the director? It's been about 7 years since Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, etc. were in the film. Wouldn't it be cool to bring them back and reverse the movie? Summary of existing movie: They are themselves, switch bodies and try hard to get back to themselves, and do things for each other they'd never normally do unconsciously because it's a last moment thing and realize the life of the other before returning to their bodies.Summary of idea: They have the other's life and kind of like it. (Since this is 7 years later, Anna would be 22 if she was supposedly 15 the first time). Tess wants to be young again and Anna likes what her mom did. They get switched by the same restaurant and fight to get back to who they've decided they like themselves as. My review of the existing movie is: I love the songs, I love the charisma between the characters, and it's an amazing movie.So,is my idea a stretch or interesting?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Thought Not Totally Convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been various versions of this movie from the original with Drew Barrymore to a lesser known remake with "Diane" from Cheers to this one. Of course, there are other parent switch movies involving guys as well. And, a few cases where there is only a one way transformation, that is, the adult becomes a younger or older version of themselves.Most of them are enjoyable, teaching little lessons fairly painlessly, though not really dealing with some of the more "R" rated ideas of the plot. For instance, compare "Back to the Future" that does face up to Marty needing to avoid the affections of his now teenage age mother. The plots tend to be "PG" rated as well, sex not an issue, though "Big" for one does address that, though again, not very much.Anyway, back to this movie. This was fairly enjoyable, a good follow-up to another Lohan re-make (better performance by her probably in that one), "The Parent Trap." The star of this film is actually Jamie Lee Curtis, who has the most fun with the transformation. My problem is that I didn't really believe she was her daughter in that adult body. It was a fun "teen" performance, but I'm not sure how much of the Lohan character was in it. Lohan was a it stiff in the movie overall, I think, even her teen not that exciting really. Mark Harmon played a real nice guy -- somewhat atypical, since he did play nice, but not quite this blandly.I did like it overall. Not great though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the title of this film, I thought it was a scary movie that I didn't like but my friend told me it was really cool. After watching it once, it became one of my favorite movies. I really enjoyed it.This is a story about a mom and her daughter who don't get along well. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis worked together. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is an overworked mom and Anna Coleman (Lindsay Lohan) is a typical teenager who has some problems at school and has daily fights with her younger brother. When they switch bodies, each is forced to adapt to the other's life for one day. They think each other's job is much easier than their own but they get to know that it's not so easy. Later Tess and Anna are getting to learn to understand and respect each other. Then they switch again and have a happy ending.Their acting was so real and their expressions were so creative. Lohan acted well like a real working mom and Curtis acted just like a young kid. You have to see her act. I burst into laughter many times because her acting was so funny. Curtis is a great comedian. Moreover, the supporting characters, Anna's little brother, her grandfather, her boyfriend and Tess's fiancé, were so natural and so real.Also I like songs from this movie. It has some oldies but goodies such as 'Happy Together', 'Take Me Away', 'What a Wonderful World' and Lindsay's own song 'Ultimate'. These songs were well-suited to this pleasant movie. 'Ultimate' became very popular because people liked this movie and the song.Freaky Friday is not only funny but also quite touching. So far, I've seen it hundreds of times and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it. Everyone who likes a really funny but touching movie has to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disney magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this flick because it's Disney, and it's Lohan. I haven't watched the first one so i won't be able to compare it. I think this one has its own credits though.At first, I didn't see anything special. It was all the typical mom-daughter catfights. A daughter rebels because her mom's getting married again and had totally forgotten her first husband. Furthermore, the mom doesn't try to understand her kids. And of course, the brother-sister brawl. The only thing that looked cool was Lohan playing the lead guitar in her band at their garage.But everything got exciting when the transformation came about. I think both Curtis and Lohan did a pretty good job. Curtis was exceptionally hilarious. She made it all fun to watch. I think the highlight of this movie was the one when Curtis played the guitar on the band audition. I had goosebumps; and was a little misty-eyed. I also liked the part where Curtis was supposed to postpone the wedding. That was one big emotional scene for me.Then there's the Chinese vudu assimilation in the story which I think is cool. I think its unconventional (the cookie thing, the mother prying over others' business and the daughter being mutinous about i). It personally makes it interesting.I say this is definitely one of Disney's magic. One that is fun, a de-stressor for that matter, brings out the child in you, and one that never misses out givin' lessons, which is important (especially if it is meant to be seen mostly by kids and teens).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Body swapping has always been a popular cinematic theme, with the idea of being someone else offering the chance for escapist wish fulfilment and fantastic thrills. While Freaky Friday from director Mark Waters (responsible for Hollywood films such as When I Turned Nine and Mayonnaise, and who also worked on Apollo 13 and French Kiss) uses this basic premise, like John Woo's Face Off, it takes things in a darker and more sinister direction. Freaky Friday offers brilliant on screen chemistry between quintessential chameleon Lindsay Lohan (Mean Girls, The Big Scene) and veteran actress Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, A Big Match). Though a penniless street artist with no straight visions in life, Lohan is quite happy having her boyfriend at her side.One day, she receives an anonymous phone call followed by a visit from a wealthy middle aged woman. Soon, Lohan is whisked into a big mansion where she meets an old financial tycoon Jamie Lee Curtis who challenges her to a devious little game. The catch is if she loses the game, he must trade his youth to the old man in exchange for three billion smackers. Not only does she bet in a flash, but also squanders everything she once had including her youthful body. Now, in a tight battle of wits, Lohan must find a way to get her own life and body back before Jamie Lee erases all traces of the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Freaky Friday is based on the novel of the same name by Mary Rodgers. It stars Lindsay Lohan as Anna Coleman and Jamie Lee Curtis as her mother. Constantly bickering and with different ideas on life, their lives are turned upside down when an enchanted Chinese fortune cookie puts them in each others bodies. Support comes from Mark Harmon and Chad Michael Murray and it's directed by Mark Waters.This is the third time this material has been adapted by Disney, with the original coming in 1976, and a television remake airing for ABC in 1995. Does Disney think the material is so great that it warrants retreads? Or does the house of mouse feel they have yet to fully do the source justice? Either way, and this version is surprisingly sprightly and accessible fun, it's becoming all a bit too old hat these days. Lohan and Curtis do good work, and the set ups provide enough giggles to stop it from sinking into a mire of unimaginative blandness. While the soundtrack is rocking and certain to appeal to its target audience. But have we advanced from the likes of Big, Vice Versa and the original from 76? Truthly? No we haven't, and we are just left with the feeling that the formula is now used as a cash cow cop out when studios are in need of some box office figures. 5/10</fullReview>

She was quite talented, and it is a shame her career has suffered because of her own issues. The film is very funny at times, and very refreshing to see a soul-split film in recent years that is actually good. After watching this, I will try to seek out the original with Jodie Foster.

		<fullReview>Okay, okay. We've all seen thousands of similar movies with different skins. Two individuals have problems with each other, something phenomenal happens, this creates more problems, problems solved, everything goes back to normal, both individuals are better people now. From the beginning I knew the outcome of the main plot it and wasn't very surprising. Combine this with all the mushy, romantic, drama bull crap and what you have is a very annoying movie. Sure, there are some humorous moments. Like Anna messing with her brother while in her mom's body. Some of the 'funny' parts however, are horrendous. Like Anna (in her mom's body) crowd surfing in a friggin TV show! Not very realistic or funny to be honest. There is also the typical stupid shopping scene and of course, the everything turns out perfect scenes towards the end. And another thing is that the background music, like in many other movies, is abused by making it's volume too high at some points thus making it distracting.So you're probably wondering that if the movie is so bad why did I give it a 6? I really can't point my finger on it but something about this film is quite charming. Maybe it's because the humorous parts which are actually funny are in plentiful unlike most movies of this nature. I really am not sure but I did definitely find this movie entertaining when I probably shouldn't have as I usually despise these kinds of formulatic films. Do I recommend checking it out? If you like these kinds of movies then yeah. But there are definitely better family comedies out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The basic plot of "Freaky Friday" (2003) has been done by Hollywood so many times, one would think a studio would be embarrassed to come out with another version. On top of which, this film is a remake of one starring Jody Foster.Switching bodies, an older person suddenly becoming younger - think everything from "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" to Lifetime's "Drop Dead Diva," with "Big," "17 Again," etc. in between.Now here's the funny part - almost all of the manifestations of this basic plot range from good to excellent, and this "Freaky Friday" is no exception. Why? I'm not sure, but this version benefits from good performances from Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan as a mother and daughter who get switched in a Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, it's on the eve of the widowed mother's wedding rehearsal dinner and a big audition for the daughter's band. They can't be switched back until they reach a mutual understanding of one another - can it be done in time? I think audiences can relate to walking in another's shoes, and in the case of this film and "17 Again," parents understanding what makes their teens tick is something that all parents wish could happen to them. In any event, "Freaky Friday" is a warm story that wrenched tears from me at the end. Highly enjoyable. Again.</fullReview>

In addition, the mannerisms and the whole way of acting like her mother is done so well, making the transformation into her mother even more realistic. It is the first Lindsay Lohan film I ever watched, and I am impressed by her acting skills.

		<fullReview>This is one of the most entertaining comedies I have seen in a long time. I started smiling from the start up tune "Happy Together" by the Turtles and didn't stop until long after Simple Plan finished their version at the end. Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely brilliant as Tess Coleman, a harried psychiatrist with two children, about to remarry after the death of her husband. Lindsay Lohan plays her daughter Anna, a rebellious teenager who can't see eye to eye with her mother. Comparing the Lindsay Lohan of this movie with the wafer thin girl she has become, it should be noted that she looked so much prettier, happier and healthier then, that I wish she'd look back at this movie and go out and eat something. You already know that this is a "switch" movie, and thanks to Lucille Soong as an interfering old woman, the switch is done with the crisp snap of a fortune cookie. Both Curtis and Lohan handle the change in their characters admirably, and soon both Tess and Anna get a first hand understanding of each other's rather complicated lives. Mark Harmon has a supporting role as Tess' fiancé Ryan, and Chad Michael Murray plays Anna's love interest Jake, but this movie is all about the female leads as they get a new perspective, earn each other's respect and generally change each other, while at the same time delivering the laughs.

		<fullReview>I went and saw Freaky Friday a few years ago with low expectations. At a time, I wasn't fond of Lindsey Lohan. I am not anymore, but I got to like her as she went on. I appreciated her comedy Freaky Friday because of many things. But it's not really her comedy, it's also Jamie Lee Curtis's comedy also. Freaky Friday is pretty funny for a kids movie. I almost read the book, but it never really seemed like my kind of book. The movie is a lot of fun though, with a lot of laugh and a lot to love. I didn't quite like this as much as Lindsay Lohan's comedy Mean girls, but I am pretty sure it will entertain. This film and 17 again have something in common. It's not the plot either. There is a moment in 17 again where the lead character's daughter falls in love with him and she doesn't realize it. There is a moment in Freaky Friday where CHad Michael Murray's character falls in love with Jamie Lee Curtis's character. Though it's Lindsay Lohan. See the similarities. My problem is not that both scenes are similar(I don't blame Freaky Friday because it came out first). My problem is that it is weird. Overall, I had a lot of fun with Freaky Friday. That isn't a flaw, but I don't really like it that much. Unlike 17 again, it doesn't go too much into the love. I had a lot of fun with Freaky Friday and I guarantee you will too.</fullReview>

After having a big fight with each other on Thursday, Anna (Lohan) and Tess (Curtis) switch bodies on Friday morning, and throughout the entire day, you see hilarious moments as Tess acts like a rebellious teenager and Anna acts more mature. Tess is supposed to be married on Saturday, and if they don't switch back, they'll have to post-pone it. It's also awesome to see Jamie Lee jammin' down at the concert later toward the end of the movie! If you love comedy, you'll love FREAKY Friday!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A thin but zippy and competently glossed remake. The leads make it. Jamie Lee Curtis is an underrated Hollywood figure who seems preternaturally capable of becoming an energetic teenager for the better part of 90 mins. Lindsay Lohan has the composure to reign in her own natural charisma at given moments to convincingly fulfil her part of the loony personality swap. In short, it works.It's in the nature of a film such as this that the clichés queue up to get ticked off. In fact its more than typical, it's actually necessary, since the gags are about lampooning age-group trappings. This is quite nicely offset with the secondary characters, particularly the Harry-and- his-Grandpa relationship like an parallel Werther's Original commercial. Mark Harmon's fiancé to Tess never gets in the way and director Mark Waters keeps the whole thing moving on. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly enjoyable film, headed by two excellent leads!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film, and I do slightly prefer it to the Jodie Foster version. True, the first 15 minutes were a bit slow, and some of the script was a bit weak, not to mention the rather predictable storyline. But you know what, the performances of Lindsey Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis more than compensated, their performances were really entertaining, and I felt the chemistry between them. I loved the soundtrack, and I thought it was very sensible updating the story, so that it would appeal more to someone like my 13 year old sister, who really enjoyed it. The script, while contrived in some places, was on the whole, very funny, and anyone who's seen the 1976 film, will get a more of the same film, except updated. What I did like, is that Lohan's character is a representation of all of us, someone who doesn't do mornings, doesn't always get on with her mum, and has friends and enemies. In the 1976 version, Jodie Foster's interpretation was more sensible than Lohan's, who put a bit of her other films in, which is quite appealing for this sort of film. Overall, an enjoyable film, with a 7/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't spend time rehashing comments in detail.I have one reservation here, namely that the story threads concerning the teacher and the bitchy girl were left open, in that although the problem was solved, the consequences of the "remedial" action which Mom took were never seen.Apart from that, I loved this film. Above everything, it was funny, largely thanks to Jamie Lee Curtis, always credible whether as harassed Mom or teen in unwelcome circumstances. However, the script was pretty good too. And Lindset Lohan showed how good she was before she went off the rails. I do hope this young woman rescues herself, and gives us the career she promised in these early films, and herself the future she deserves.The rest of the cast is pretty good, too.Thankfully, the sentimentality remains well reined in.Give yourself a treat and a laugh, and watch this.</fullReview>

But when a lady at a Chinese restaurant gives them a 'special' fortune cookie, all sorts of things happen. Lohan is in a band, but forgets to play with the cookie changes her minds with Curtis.Its a somewhat corny movie. But hey, it turns out kind of funny at times and thus earns some respect from me.

		<shortDescription>Surprising decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I looked at the TV listings last week and saw this movie come up, I wasn't in the least bit interested. After all, it was a Disney movie, so I just wrote it off as being another one of those "family" films which only the youngest of children may enjoy. When I was watching TV that night, I happened to stumble upon that movie, which was just starting. My brother really wanted to watch it, o I gave in and resigned to watching one and a half hours of Disney clichés and other crap. Or so I thought.When I watched the first twenty minutes of the movie, before they made the switch, the first thing I thought was that even if everything else didn't go too well, at least the acting by both lead and supporting actors was very commendable. They were convincing, and suited well for their respective roles. It was realistic, nothing over-the-top as with many comedies nowadays. After they switched, Lohan settled well into the role of the mature mother, though Curtis was a bit silly in her acting as Anna. It made her seem like she was much younger than the 15 to 17-year-old she was supposed to be. However, this was pretty much negligible, and even contributed to some of the humor in this story.The plot was generally well-done, though obviously there were some errors in logic which were necessary to carry it forward. For example, the actions of Anna in Tess's body (canceling the caterer, getting the earring and haircut, her "career-killing TV appearance", etc) had no effect on the outcome of this story. It would have been nice if, just before they switched back, Anna in Tess's body made everything right again (especially the TV appearance, which was the only one that actually will have a long-term effect on Tess's life). Overall, though, the plot was well done with few holes and was very well executed.What I am most surprised at, however, is how the director managed to incorporate some dramatic elements, giving this a somewhat serious feeling suitable for older audiences, yet still bring out so much humor. I have heard of people watching it and switching from laughing and crying between scenes. This movie, besides its intended comedy genre, can easily be classified as a drama.So I was wrong about my prediction of the movie. By the end, I had enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD. Don't let its producers and name fool you, this is definitely worth seeing.In the DVD the director talks about a sequel, and several websites mentioned that it might happen. And it was, but by now (end of 2008) that just doesn't seem like a possibility anymore. With movies that involve kids, they have to make a sequel within a couple of years otherwise the kid actor would be too old (though Lethal Weapon's story spanned ten years and the children matured appropriately). The only way would be to get a whole new cast, which takes out most of the value of a sequel. But if they keep this up, I wouldn't mind them doing one more remake. Or channel their talent to making more of these great family movies.Highly recommended, 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that I could honestly call this one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. "Freaky Friday" stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan as a mother and daughter who end up inside each other's bodies, see what each other's daily life is really like, and switch back through the power of love. It's a simple enough story that's been done, but this film takes advantage it. Lohan and Curtis are both very good at seeming as though they are really inside each other's bodies. Putting them in implausible situations (such as the daughter in the mother's body having to go on live TV) are unexpected scenes that end up bringing big laughs. The ending is the usual, involving the mother and daughter coming to a greater understanding of each other, but this one might actually bring a few tears. Jamie Lee Curtis is hilarious in her imitation of a teenage daughter, and her scenes of trying to adapt to situations at work or at home are some of the funniest in the movie. This is Lindsay Lohan's best film since "The Parent Trap," and both of these films are remakes that actually prove to be better than their originals. It's not absolutely perfect, since some of the material can be a little over-the-top at unnecessary times, but it's still very enjoyable. All ages alike will find something to enjoy here.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 70's novel by Mary Rodger, "Freaky Friday" will eat your heart! Jamie Lee Curtis is Tess Coleman, while Lindsay Lohan is her 100% rebellious daughter Anna. Both are complete polar opposites, from hair to even boys. Tess is engaged to Ryan (Mark Harmon from NCIS), who Anna doesn't approve because she still hasn't gotten over the death of her real father. Anna has a little brother named Harry, who bugs her like any little bro, but it takes more affect on Anna than any other sister. Anna is in a rock band created by her other friends, their band called Pink Slip. Pink Slip has been offered to be in an audition for new bands -- something that Anna can't resist. But there's one problem: Mom.On Thurday night Anna tries to get Tess to allow her to go, but Tess is angry, then Anna, and things get ugly, until they're offered a Chinese fortune cookie that holds a mysterious fortune, which they read simultaneously. The next morning, uh-oh.Anna and Tess are each other, but have their minds to keep. Both are forced to be each other, despite their goals to achieve (Tess's wedding rehearsal and Anna's audition.) As Friday passes, both start to see the truth of each other lives, which could help them get back in their own bodies and lives.Sweet, funny, and yet cheesy, Freaky Friday and warm-hearted and seemingly fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaky Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this quite a bit, plus I hadn't seen the leading older female star in a film for a while, oh, and it's a remake of a Jodie Foster film. Basically Tess Coleman (Golden Globe nominated Jamie Lee Curtis) and her 15-year-old daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) do not get along, and do not have the same tastes in many things (e.g. clothes, music, and especially men). One night though this changes when they go to a Chinese restaurant and get identical fortune cookies, I can't remember what they say, but they cause them to swap bodies the next morning. They decide to try to do all the things they think each other do, i.e. Tess (now Anna) going to work, and a bit of shopping, and Anna (vice versa) going to school. But with Tess's wedding coming up, they cannot stay like this and try and find a way to switch back in their own bodies. Also starring Mark Harmon as Ryan, Patch Adams' Harold Gould as Grandpa, Chad Michael Murray as Jake, Stephen Tobolowsky as Mr. Bates, Christina Vidal as Maddie, Ryan Malgarini as Harry Coleman, Haley Hudson as Peg and Rosalind Chao as Pei-Pei. There are a couple of good slapstick and age difference jokes, but the sentimentality can become a little off putting, and for me it is not really something I would watch again. It was number 78 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Worth watching, at least once!</fullReview>

And the mother-daughter is getting ready for her re-marrying on the following day, and the daughter-mother is to perform in a rock concert and is falling in love for a young high-school junior or so. And, etc. ? Imbroglio upon imbroglio. When you get one, like one spaghetto I guess, you never see the end of its multiplication, like with spaghetti I guess again.

		<shortDescription>Freakin' good teen comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has the custom to remake old movies. Sometimes it doesn't works, sometimes it does. And that's the case of the remake of "Freaky Friday"! If you ask me to choose between that film and "Mean Girls" (who both has the same director, Mark Waters), I would choose "Freaky Friday" first (even "Mean Girls" is a film who get's better for every time I watch it, but that's another story for now).I must confess that I haven't seen the original "Freaky Friday" from 1976. The 2003 remake is a contemporary film, surprisingly fresh and hilarious, with a very detailed script, fresh dialog and fresh songs.Jamie Lee Curtis has lately become one of my favorite actress, because she's so cool, funny and sincere and in this film she's no exception. But the real star in this picture is Lindsay Lohan, who proofs that she's a good actress considering her young age. It's a little bit shame that "Freaky Friday" didn't became her breakthrough film, cause in this movie she has a charisma and sincerity who makes that she's stand out in front of female stars of her same age; (Olsen Twins, Hilary Duff, etc. This movie was made before Lindsay became the scandal queen that she is today, but that's another story for now)From a story perspective there are some details in the story who remains unresolved (SPOILERS: Why are Mr Bates and Stacey Stinkhouse always picking on Anna? We never get to know the exact reason. SPOILERS OVER). Besides that, "Freaky Friday" is a very good film that everybody should watch.</fullReview>

Dr. Tess Coleman(Jamie Lee Curtis)and her 15-year-old daughter, Anna(Lindsay Lohan), don't see eye-to-eye on the usual things like clothes, music and each other's taste in men. The widowed Tess is reluctant to support Anna's musical aspirations and at the same time is not pleased that Anna won't give her fiancé(Mark Harmon) a break. On a Thursday evening, an enchanted Chinese fortune cookie begins to cause some mayhem. Friday morning, Anna and Tess wake up finding themselves inside the other's body. They literally walk in each other's shoes and gain some insight on the other's viewpoint. A lively soundtrack features the likes of: Forty Foot Echo, Lash, Ashlie Simpson and Miss Lohan's "Ultimate".NOTE: Annette Bening was originally set to play Tess Coleman and I personally wish she did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny and Delightful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wide generation gap between Tess Coleman and her teenage daughter Anna is more than evident. They simply cannot understand each other's preferences. On a Thursday night they have a big argument in a Chinese restaurant. Both receive a fortune cookie each from the restaurant owner's mother which causes them to switch bodies next day. As they adjust with their new personalities, they begin to understand each other more and eventually it's the mutual self-respect that sorts the things out.Even though this was a really funny film, I found it surprisingly heart felt, probably because I can relate to it. The jokes in the films are really funny, with many that will make you laugh out loud. Some scenes are also dramatic, and will make you cry (or it did for me).It's one of the better movies because this comedy is fresh. Well, Mark Water's look of it is fresh and energetic that makes you want to be a kid again. This is the definition of not only a good comedy, but a great family film.This is an obsessive film to watch, in my opinion (along with others). I've seen it about fifty (exagerrated) times and the movie never gets old or tiring. You have to give props to Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. Their performances are realistic and fantastic!This is one of the best comedies ever made, if not one of the best movies. Yes, some of the daughter and mother relationship is a bit exaggerated but it was fun watching it. If you would like to see a great family comedy, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

Freaky Friday was indeed a fun movie that my sister pleaded me (I think its an overstatement to her part..(-.-)) to buy an original copy, it was a consummate sample of a teen comedy that balances the attention within the family. Primarily Lohan's role focuses the frequent point of the film, Jamie Lee Curtis on the other hand poises the depiction of senescent-aged (another overstatement..(^,^)) Mom's who are longing and ready for building up another chapter of relationship. One attention-grabbing combo for this movie is the mishmash connection of Lindsay Lohan and Chad Michael Murray (honestly I was more supportive to the combination of Chad Michael Murray and Hilary Duff (Cinderella's Story) their even more neat duo to consider) Extremely entertaining indeed for every member of the family and even me, I couldn't switch my tedious hours by watching again and again this movie, a one ingredient list in my passing leisure times.Watch it you'll, never be disappointed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: My main gripe with remakes is often they don't follow the original. That's the same thing with turning a book into a movie. Well, luckily not every remake is like that. This new updated Freaky Friday sure isn't and my hat's off to the makers of this fun, well acted, and genuinely good, all ages comedy.Freaky Friday-the new version- is at least almost, and maybe, just maybe, as good as, the original. That is so very rare to find, the movie deserves an above average rating for that alone. It works for a couple of reasons.Number one is the incredible casting of Lohan and Curtis. These two could not have been picked any better. They both give good-very good-performances and really nail their characters. Lindsay Lohan is charming, feisty and believable. Jaime Lee Curtis is utterly flawless, hilarious, touching and just so much fun. Watching Curtis in this role one can really see how talented she is even if you've never seen any of her other films. These two females are clearly having a great time in their respective roles as well and the movie in general succeeds in becoming that rare thing-a movie that's hip for young people while still being able to cross over and be a great family movie as well.There is another reason Freaky Friday works and it's a big one. It works because it FOLLOWS THE ORIGINAL!! That is so important. It doesn't try to be so different by coming up with these complex plot twists that don't make any sense. The movie stays a sweet, classic, all age friendly charmer. It doesn't try to be something it's not, it gives the audience the best of what it is.I throughly enjoyed this very entertaining remake and would very much recommend it, particularly to fans of the original. My vote's a solid 8 of 10.</fullReview>

Lindsay Lohan is great too, but Chad Michael Murray steals the film as the good looking biker. Shame about his hair though. The film is quite true to the original, but with a modern twist, and guitar playing instead of water skiing.The film only really begins when the mother and Anna (a typical teenager) wake up rather concerned to discover they are no longer in their own bodies. Problems clearly follow, but it is interesting to see that the mother in her daughter's body has the biggest problems as she tries to cope with the school day. The end's a bit cheesy, but good anyway. Light hearted fun not to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Freaky Friday" is a remake of a middle seventy's movie (which I haven't seen).

It's really funny to see how a 15 year old teenager would act being in an adult's body, and the other way around. As the movie develops, they'll know how each other feels and they'll understand why do they act that way.The performances of the two main characters (Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan) it's absolutely fabulous. Each of them has her own charm and quality, and know how to show it in this movie. It seems to me they've come up with quite good results.Very good comedy. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Freaky Friday very recently and I found it brilliant. The story is put into practice very well. I also like the camera work and the very well written screen play. The acting of the main characters is convincing. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis do a very good job. I think its rather difficult to play a mother if you're in fact a teenager as it is the other way round. Lohan and Curtis seem to get well with each other what can also be found in the result which I think is hilarious. Of course its a typical Walt Disney production but as that I found it very entertaining and I like to recommend it to anyone who likes to know how it feels to be a person you are supposed to know very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average but rockin' soundtrack,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freaky Friday is a remake of a 1976 movie. That movie starred Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris, and I have to confess that I have not seen it. That said, I can tell you it's probably better than the remake, on the basis that the original almost always is. Another reason for saying that is because, well, the remake doesn't really set the bar very high. The story is a variation on an extremely common Hollywood tale - two people switch bodies and, ergo, experience each other's lives, and learn to appreciate each other, blah, blah, blah. It's an old story. And by old, I mean, well, overused. Really overused; there are many hundreds of movies that run along this premise, few of them innovative in any way. In this case, the two people are Tess Coleman (Curtis) and her teenaged daughter Anna (Lohan). You can probably guess for yourself what happens; the boy Anna likes comes after her in her mother's body, so he likes her mind, Tess in her daughter's body goes some way to straightening out Anna's life (which doesn't really need it) and so forth. I'd like to tell you more, but it's time for another confession. To be honest, I just wasn't paying attention. Freaky Friday is just so middle-of-the-road and average, not to mention predictable, that I found I didn';t really need to watch it; I felt I'd seen it simply through the banality of the story. Not that the movie doesn't have its good points. Curtis is fun as the teenager in a middle-aged body (incidentally, I have it on good authority Jamie Lee Curtis is over fifty. When does she intend to start looking like it?), and Lohan is reasonably good as the mother inside the daughter, but neither is spectacular. There are a few decent laughs, which I suppose is all you can ask for, as well. The only bit worth writing home about is the soundtrack; modern punk/rock covers of old Turtles songs, for example. The daughter character is a rock musician as well, so there's some rocking out involved, although to say more blows what little about the plot you haven't already anticipated. Aside from the music, Freaky Friday has little to recommend it. It's so hideously average and mundane it doesn't deserve more than a completely average rating, with half a point added for a good soundtrack. That, at least, is something. Good-o-meter rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Version Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This newly updated version of "Freaky Friday" is the best version so far. The only down part was Chad Michael Murray being cast in this film. Chad is a wannabe actor. His character became a total loser *spoiler* when he started to fall for Anna in Tess' Body. So he decides to fall for a forty something year old woman who could be his mom? Oh yeah and then he *spoiler* sings badly to Britney Spears dreadful song "(Hit Me Baby) One More Time" Plus he then suddenly falls for Anna *spoiler* after seeing Tess in her body jam at the Talent Show when Anna in Tess' body was backstage doing Anna's guitar solo. I say if they got rid of Chad's character the movie would have been a 10 star instead of a 9. I saw the first remake of this film, it wasn't as good as this one. Oh and something else wrong with the film *spoiler* briefly seeing Jamie Lee Curtis wearing a thong! If you pause the movie at the talent show where they show Chad's face in "checking you out" expression he looks like he's stoned! All those who hated this film lack taste in a good movie. Script: 9/10 Acting: 10/10(except for Chad who deserves a 0.5 out of 10) Directing: 10/10. Congrats to Lindsay and Jamie for a well done job on this great film. Hats off to Harold Gould as Grandpa who is very funny: "If I switch with Harry, do I have to wear a thong?" Hi-Larious Performance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly funny comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FREAKY Friday scores points utterly often, and it's so pleasing to watch a sort of everyday movie where the laughs comes often, the acting works very well and... well; simple enough, it's a good movie! Jamie Lee Curtis stars in the movie and even she in a character made for her Hollywood generation; being a sort of going-down-former-big-actress performs nice.The grudgy, rocked-up girl Anna is sick and tired of her brother and mother bugging her with her private life, having problems at school and having a total crush on the also rock &amp; roll loving, older boy Jake. Her mother Tess is going to marry and really wants to understand her daughter's problems; but really doesn't get into her life without seeming un-interested... being at a Chinatown restaurant they get a fortune cookie and suddenly their lives are turned upside-down. Waking up the next day, Anna's mind is in Tess' body, and opposite... and this will off course cause trouble.Tolerance playing a big part in this family kind comedy and with a lots of simply great scenes this movie really, really surprised me in every way of it's charming entertainment. The fine acting of both Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan makes the mum-and-daughter chemistry work very fine, and with moral between the fine comedy and pure family entertainment with rock n' roll consert and hunk Jake singing "Baby hit me one more time" with a truly terrible voice, this movie is actually very nice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is really good as a film, she like the way they change places for a day with 'hilarious consequences,' although she does not celebrate Christmas i still think her opinions on film are valid. She also wants to watch Bad Santa which she thinks will be a good film, but wouldn't take her kids to Lapland, which is fair enough i suppose. It was in the paper the other day about some kids who went out there and never came back alive. Sorry they did get out alive, they just never got to meet santa, which is no bad thing i suppose, he must really smell, wearing the same suit all year and wiping reindeers asses no? apropos to nothing. To make matters worse she has just lost her cross stitch patters, on top of being pestered about why she doesn't celebrate Christmas!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jamie Curtis and Lindsay Lohan did a very good job in portraying their role and the role of the other, specially the time when they were in their beds and the clock rang... i really love it !!!(",). The distinction of words, the accent, the movements, the mannerisms were clearly showed. Its like Lindsay Lohan was a real old lady trap on a teenager's body same as Curtis, a teenager trapped on a woman's body... I got confused of the character of Chad Murray, Jake(no offense) suddenly he got attracted to Anna??? But he got out of his shell, specially when he was singing the "hit me baby one more time" hahaha I'm not an idol of neither of the two but in comparison to Lindsay and Hilary. I think Lindsay is better than Hilary in terms of acting. When you saw Hilary in the movie "A Cinderella Story" it seems like her character is still lizzie mcguire, there's nothing different about her. Unlike Lindsay, portraying older than once age is difficult but Lindsay did it with consistency. Her character is far different from her other movies like "Mean Girls" and of course "Parent Trap" though years have past. i give 7 stars out of 10...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't looking forward to seeing this remake but thankfully the people at Disney updated this version and left out most of the overly silly events that could have ruined this. Story is about Anna Coleman (Lindsay Lohan) who is your regular teenager and has the usual troubles at school and plays guitar in a rock band with her friends but she also has trouble communicating with her mother. Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a psychiatrist and a widow with two kids but she's getting ready to get married again to Ryan (Mark Harmon) but she and her daughter Anna are always at odds with each other. *****SPOILER ALERT*****While at a Chinese restaurant they receive two fortune cookies that after being read switches Tess and Anna so they wake up the next morning in each others bodies. Tess/Anna goes to school and finds out that its not as easy as she remembers and also that young Anna has a crush on an older boy named Jake (Chad Michael Murray) but while this goes on Anna/Tess assumes the role as a psychiatrist and has the opportunity to go shopping with newly found credit cards but she also realizes what kind of a person Ryan really is. The two of them not only start to understand each other but also to respect one another and together they discover that they can in fact be friends.This film is directed by Mark Waters who is a capable filmmaker and one thing that is noticeable in the script is the lack of the usual obnoxious characters that we tend to see and that's a credit to both Waters and Disney. The spirited performances are what makes this remake work and while I admired the spunk and maturity of Lohan it's Curtis who uses her experience to put in the more solid effort. The big part of the fun is watching Lohan superbly mimic an uptight adult while Curtis is equally impressive portraying a troubled teen. While the concept of the film is something that we have all seen many times before this latest effort has a freshness and energy that I just couldn't ignore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lohan &amp; Curtis Make Freaky Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the third version of a movie, as well as being in the same vein as multiple other body switch movies, you wouldn't expect this one to be as enjoyable as it is. The plot pretty much follows its formula, although it is updated to reflect contemporary experiences. However, this version of Freaky Friday was clever, enjoyable, funny, and sweet at the same time. Lindsay Lohan is perfect as the teenage daughter with boys and garage band music on her mind. Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely fantastic as the girl's mother, who, amidst all of these trials with her daughter, is preparing to marry Mark Harmon. Mother and daughter are not getting along, and, due to a magical fortune cookie administered in a Chinese restaurant, they wake up on Friday in a much different state. Lots of fun and confusion ensues, like Lohan in her mother's body acting like a teenager on a talk show while promoting her book, trying to promote a romance with the hunk at high school, and coming to her own aide with the right guitar riffs off-stage. Curtis in her daughter's body has its moments too, like when she interacts with her fiancé and son, and when she finds out her daughter's teacher is picking on her because of Curtis. The film concludes with a typical, sentimental, Disney ending. This film is a prime example of actors making old material better and more unique than it is. These body switch movies have been made and remade many times over, but this one looks fresh, and, despite the overused premise, is still very enjoyable and funny. The movie ends in a way that leads us to believe there might be a sequel, but so far there's nothing in the works. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

In the ending when they made up with each other it made me cry, because it showed a sign of maturity with both Lindsay Lohan's and Jamie Lee Curtis' character. I also loved it for the fact that they went through some of the same problems that a mother and daughter go through in real life and it related to real life situations except for when they switched bodies.( I just love magical stuff like that in movies and t.v shows.) Like I said before great movie, enjoyed it very much and it related to real life. Great job Jamie Lee and Lindsay!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>annoyingly cliché totally unrealistic, nevertheless entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this movie years later, it is annoyingly cliché with the free spirited teenager and the uptight mother. I know the movie is not supposed to be realistic, but they weren't even realistic enough to relate to. They totally exaggerated each other's personalities when they were switched. Lohan's character in the begning could not be pictured moshing into a crowd, signing a strange man's body part or letting it out at the audience of that show she was on for her mother's book. I also don't think her mother seemed like the type to savatage her friendship with that guy; most mothers would want to get to know the man their daughter rather than giving him the cold shoulder, if they had the opportunity. The part where her teacher gave her a bad grade because her mother didn't go out with him in high school was really unrealistic; it was decades ago and he would have cared less in real life. The part where Anna's friend had a crush on the mother was cute, but that was in the original and in this version it was exaggerated; I don't know any younger crushes who would stalk the older woman he crushes on. At least in the original, he was not at all attractive, so it was believable, not that the other guy was gorgeous, but for a 16 year old probably. The original was better; the mother was more likable; she didn't try to savagage Anna's friendships or put her daughter down. There was a part in the new version where her mother felt her backside and was like "That is not mine!" as though she thought her Anna was chubby, but she wasn't and Curtis was not thinner than Anna. Also, Anna really was kind of a rebellious child in the original, which made you kind of feel sorry for the mother and Anna at the same time. Although perhaps that was because in the new one, they wanted to show that Mom's make mistakes. The old one probably went by the whole "mother knows best," cliché, although she did learn how hard her daughter had it with peer pressure and all. In the original, she was only a young teen about 13 or 14, so her immaturity was believable and cute. In this one, she was like 16 and acting so immature, more so after they switched places; this was kind of insulting for that generation or for teens in general. Additionally, I don't think many teens would want their mother dressing sexy; they would probably be embarrassed, showing her mom in gap jeans would be more realistic. Linsey Lohan was a lot more attractive than Foster was at that time, but that was probably because Foster was at that awkward age and Linsey was about 16 or 17. It was entertaining because it was funny, but that is about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anna and Tess Coleman are at each other's throats. Tess is going to be having a wedding rehearsal dinner tomorrow night and her daughter Anna is the maid of honor. The only problem is that that same night, Anna and her friends' rock band have an audition that could be their ticket to stardom. Seeing their argument, an old Asian mother takes two fortune cookies from her restaurant and gives them to the wrathful women. The next morning, they find themselves in each other's bodies. With Tess' wedding tomorrow and the Rock band audition tonight as well as the rehearsal dinner, this is quite a roller coaster. This is a very nice movie. These days, it's very hard to find a film that the whole family can watch with little ones in the room. This film shows a little hope that family movies will be coming back. With so much comedy, they're able to put in enough seriousness to make it touching and memorable. There's some comical violence as well as some language that would turn off little ones, but overall, this is wonderful. Get the DVD. If you don't, you'll get freaked out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very funny, especially Jamie Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, be warned that the first half hour, which is all set up for what happens later, is pretty bland. It's not horrible, but I was getting a little restless and wondering if this was going to be worth sitting through. But when the change takes place the movie instantly becomes very, very funny. Part of this is just because the movie has been waiting for this moment and gets to let loose, but a lot of this is because of an amazing performance by Jamie Lee Curtis, and actress who up until now has never really made an impression on me. Here she is hilariously funny as a teen trapped in an adults body, giving a loose, charming performance while avoiding the temptation to become caricaturish. The movie itself is quite funny and well written, and Lohan is okay in a role that probably gives her a lot less to work with. My first reaction to Lohan, by the way, was, oh, so *that's* who she is, as I keep hearing she's kind of a scandalishious teen getting a lot of press for wearing clothes that don't quite stay on and every time I heard the name I'd say, "who?" So now I know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, thank God that they are finally making Disney movies that aren't sickly sweet anymore.Freaky Friday is about a mother and daughter (Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan) who argue all the time, and so to make them see eye to eye, an insane Chinese restaurant owner gives them fortune cookies which makes them swap places with each other, O.K.Sure, this movie isn't going to be fun unless you open your mind enough to accept the storyline. But, if you can, get ready for a Disney movie that harkens (is that a word?) back to the days of Aladdin or Bambi, just less deer, and more witty banter.The acting in this movie is great and sees Lindsay Lohan paving her way to future success big time. Jamie Lee Curtis is as normal the constant pro, and it is fun seeing her working her comedic chops which she fine tuned in 'a fish called Wanda.'To sum up, Freaky Friday is the movie that breathes life back into the old parent-child switcharoo movie, and rekindles my love for Disney. The best teen movie of the year, which unlike 'thirteen' young teens can actually rent without a fake ID.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just watched the film, all i can say is that it certainly offers more than what you would expect from a Disney movie. One could say this is the best Disney film since... Pulp Fiction. I say that because Disney, as we all know, delivers crap after crap after crap. The script is witty, the execution is even wittier and even though it's all so predictable( who doesn't guess what happens in the end?) it manages to breathe life into everything. From the most typical brother-sister fight to the obligatory emotional mother-daughter sequence. It does indeed has lots of flaws, i mean who has seen a more clean cut rock band, in a movie, than this? But when you get into the core of the movie, it gets warm, it worked for me that's for sure because, being a teenager myself, i could (partially) relate to the "angst" and "rebellion"--which by the way (as Roger Ebert correctly noted) is typical behaviour, but in the world of Disney it becomes "disturbing"--whatever! The direction was quirky enough and had a kind of energetic feel to it. Like Paul thomas anderson, only dumbed down and with more cuts. It worked for the most part, i mean it was just right for the material... The use of the music was nice enough, although it could have used some less mainstream and less popular songs--we 've heard them a gazillion times already!--but they worked, did the job and that's that. But Lohan's band, even though clean cut, rocked harder than the one in "School of Rock", which was kinda lame, i know they were just kiddies but c'mon (although the movie had a better soundtrack...by the way). I was surprised by the quality of the band's music, never expected something like that in Disney movie. All in all, it's fun and surprisingly watchable. What else can you ask from Disney pictures? Enjoy.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts off so incredibly funny, it had me rolling on the floor. Then it kinda slows down but it all ends with a bang!Jamie Lee Curtis is busy psychiatrist Tess Coleman, on the brink of re-marrying with good-natured Ryan (the always good Mark Harmon). She has two kids: 15 year old Anna (a sparkling Lindsay Lohan) and young Harry, who's biggest pleasure it is to annoy his big sister and getting away with it.Problems arise when Anna's band get a big chance of playing in front of a big crowd on the same night the wedding-rehearsel is scheduled. Mom and daughter collide but then an old chinese woman does her trick (boy those orientals!) and the next morning Anna wakes up in the body of her mom, and vice versa. Tears in my eyes with laughter when Anna (what is really Tess) cries out: 'Oh the world is so mean, everybody's against me!'Although Lohan knows her way in playing the mom (in her own body, that is), Lee Curtis is the star as she transforms into a young woman in an old (no insult meant) body. She's so believable that we don't even bother about the fact that young Jake actually finds her attractive, instead of Anna.At this time the movie however does take some of it's brille away as the two trapped in another body make all the obligate moves, as Tess takes a piercing and Anna trying to make peace with her school enemy. When Tess finds out that young Harry really loves his sister it is just a bit too much, and we're reminded of the fact that it still is a Disney picture.But the ending makes up for a couple of weak points, as the rock-concert scene is very well done and at the end it was even touching when Tess and Anna make amends at the rehearsal dinner.In short: good movie, loads of fun, 7/10.</fullReview>

It drags through laborious attempts at humor that has been regurgitated Disney style, but hopefully for the last time. The acting is strained at best. There are more continuity errors than Pulp Fiction on "Random play". The movie is to Jamie Lee Curtis as Ishtar is to Dustin Hoffman, or Gigli to Ben Afleck.

		<shortDescription>Terrific Teen Movie. (Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A high-strung mom and her punky daughter learn what it's like to walk in each other's shoes -- literally -- in Disney's second update of their 1977 teen fantasy comedy. The new-millennium Freaky Friday has disgruntled teen Anna Coleman (Lindsay Lohan) living, sans father, with her uptight therapist-author mom Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and bratty brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini). The angst between the two reaches a fever pitch on the eve of Tess' wedding rehearsal: Anna wants to ditch the proceedings for an all-important band audition, but Tess sees the conflict as a show of resentment toward imminent step-dad Ryan (Mark Harmon). When the whole clan goes out to dinner at their favorite Chinese restaurant, their sage waitress (Lucille Soong) picks up on the tension between the mother and daughter and casts a spell on them via two magic fortune cookies. The next day, Tess and Anna must put up with life in each other's bodies -- until, as the fortune says, they can come to a greater understanding of one another. For a teen movie, this is a very good movie, which technically is a updated version of Freaky Friday with Lindsay Lohan taking over the Jodie Foster character and the mom this time played Jamie Lee Curtis. Thanks to these 2 performances, this film gets to live up to it's reputation because this film isn't just funny and dramatic(even though it's chock full of that), it is also sweet and touching. One of the honorable mentions of 2003, definitely the best teen film of the year. Freaky Friday isn't your average teen/remake film, although it's been said before that it's full of been-done-before jokes, I saw past this and I think that the film is great in showing how anyone can learn to understand, sounds cheesy I know! All of the characters each have something different about them, Annabel just wants a normal life, Tess just wants to understand Annabel etc., all adding to the film. I think that Freaky Friday is a different, twisted thought on the lives of teenagers and family life, switching bodies, showing most of them as wanting a normal life and being punkers, and it shows this in such a different and unique way! Lindsay Lohan has a great voice and is also a great actress, she brings charm and sass to the role of Annabel much like Jodie Foster did in the original movie. Also another one to mention would be Jamie Lee Curtis, she was excellent and sassy as Annabel's mother. Anyways, it's a quirky, colorful remake and I recommend it to anybody who is in a quirky mood! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fished out of the Disney recycle bin and given a fresh look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times when one must seriously consider the fact that Disney may have a personal patent on film recycling bins. Studios often remake films and rehash old stale ideas but Disney has taken it to a whole new level. For lack of any fresh ideas, they spin a magical wheel with a list of all their old films, and which ever film the wheel stops on it's Remake City. In 2003, Freaky Friday's number came up for the third time since it's original 1976 inception. What are the odds? Then again, since it seems that girls have been given short thrift in the film world of role switching, with guys doing it in films such as Big, Vice-Versa, and Like Father Like Son, that Disney decided it was necessary to enforce its own equal rights amendment. Freaky Friday's title comes from what happens one Friday afternoon, when through a magical spell, working mom Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) inhabits her teenage daughter Anna's (Lindsay Lohan)body, while Anna at the same time becomes trapped in Tess's body. Unlike the original film when the spell occurred simply because they mother and daughter repeated the same phrase (I wish I could be Annabel/Mom), here Tess and Anna are aided by the mischievous mother of a Chinese restaurant owner as the two argue inside the restaurant. It's a minor point, but it does lend a lot more fun to what takes place.As usual for these types of films, a lot of their success depends on how well the actors involved can convince us that the switcheroo actually took place. Jamie Lee Curtis is hands down the winner in this regard. Once she becomes Anna, everything about her spells teenager, from her voice inflection to her body language and facial expressions. She also has most of the best scenes including a sub plot of how a boy the real Anna liked develops a crush on her, a wonderful scene she has working with one of her patients (as Anna), and a hilarious sequence on a talk show where she is hawking her mother's new book. Lindsay Lohan does not seem quite as successful as Jodie Foster in the original film. Although she is straightforward and serious enough as her mother, she never seems to develop the physical mannerisms of an adult. She does have some fine moments though, especially when she changes Anna's looks and clothes into what every mother would adore, and another great scene where she deals with a teacher who has been unfairly harassing her for personal reasons.What this film also has going for it that the original lacked, is more of a sense of purpose. The original Freaky Friday was played almost entirely as slapstick comedy. In this version, both Anna and Tess develop keen insights into each others lives, and how tough it is to deal with the world whether you are fifteen or fifty. Another thing I liked about this film was that unlike the married home maker Ellen Andrews that Barbra Harris played in the original film, Tess is a widow with a successful career, who becomes engaged to Ryan. It adds some very nice human elements to the plot that were sadly lacking back in 1976.Freaky Friday is an enjoyable farce, that many young teenage girls and their mothers can readily relate to. Teenage boys may not find much to relate to in it, but they will still enjoy watching it for its off the wall goofy story. Just don't ask any of those teenage boys to admit they liked it though, because that's something you'll never get out of them. Being a guy and although my teenage days are long gone, I can admit I did like Freaky Friday, and if a film can get me to admit that it gets my grade, which for Freaky Friday is a B.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**While this movie was a pretty good albeit unnecessary remake of the original Babara Harris/Jodie Foster film, I was constantly distracted by the poor makeup; the tight shiny faces and blobs of red on the cheeks, as though they were wearing some kind of tightening product. It's hard to make Mark Harmon look bad, but the makeup artist managed in this movie.I am always willing to suspend disbelief to a point, but the character of Jake was so annoying and poorly written. He can walk through a faculty lounge with a student, and nobody even looks up, even when he opens a teachers only door, letting the "girl" cheat on the test and change another girl's test. And for this, the mother judges Him a fine young man. He comes on to to the "mother", but the girl still wants him??? He turns up uninvited at the rehearsal dinner and the wedding reception, but that's fine too.The two main characters do a good job, but this movie is not even close in quality to the original.The brother was just the usual foul mouthed sitcom brat. Aren't we all getting a little tired of that?Stick to the original. So the family dynamic doesn't address the more modern family. So what? It's funnier and more believable. Even in a fantasy there should be the appearance of truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best screwball comedies of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FREAKY FRIDAY (2003)THE GOOD:--"Freaky Friday" is one of the funniest films of the year. The premise is fairly unoriginal - a mother and daughter switch bodies and learn about each other's lives in a way they never expected - but the writing team work wonders and give the audience a lot of hysterical dialogue humour. Pretty much anything Lindsay Lohan says as her mother is funny and the interaction between Jamie Lee Curtis (as her daughter) and her character's fiancé is comedic brilliance. There are also a number of outrageous physical comedy sequences. One such sequence involves Lee Curtis going nuts at an audience about the problems with parents, and another involves a musical concert.--Making a film both hilariously funny and adding that 'life-lessons-and-morals' stuff in is always a hard thing to do. The writers of the film achieve this without making it cheesy, corny or lame, and it doesn't feel very forced at all. There is emphasis on the way this changes the relationships between various people in the family and how the characters change as people themselves after the ordeal of being put through another persons life. This is all done very nicely through some very cute dramatic scenes and lots of either hilarious or sometimes kinda upsetting mother/daughter relationship material.--Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan play excellently off each other and both turn in excellent performances. Lee Curtis shines with a vibrant, out-there performance and completely sells her side of the story. Lohan is also hilarious (and very pretty), playing both sides - the depressed, angry teenager or the annoying mother. Both actors have terrific comic timing and great screen chemistry.THE BAD:--The boyfriend character played by Chad Michael Murray is annoying and always pops in an out of scenes when he is completely unnecessary. Almost every time he was onscreen (save for the quite cute big kiss scene at the end) I felt like he was just there so teenage girls would have something to blush over.--This is an extremely funny movie for me, which is great because comedies of this type are hard to come by. There are just a couple of times when I felt the humour was taken a little over-the-top. One such example would be when the crowd carries Lee Curtis around after making her rousing speech about annoying mothers to the TV audience. Did they really need to show that? It was taking the entire scenario and exaggerating it. But 'tis a small flaw in an overall hysterical film.RATING:8/10 - Taking an old, mostly forgotten flick and turning into something miraculously funny and entertaining, the cast &amp; director deserve a true round of applause for crafting one of the best comedies of the year. Ignore the awful title and check this one out.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Being John Malkovich (9/10) Bend it Like Beckham (8/10) The Hot Chick (4/10) The Parent Trap (8/10) School of Rock (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good all-around family film (no spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freaky Friday, starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan, Mark Harmon, Harold Gould and Chad Michael Murray is a remake of the 1976 flick of the same title. The main storyline is, Tess Coleman (Curtis), an overworked psychologist, and her 15-year-old daughter Anna (Lohan) do not get along and can't understand each other. They visit a Chinese restaurant through which a curse is placed on them and they switch bodies on one "Freaky Friday." As predicted, the mother and daughter get a chance to literally walk in each other's shoes and begin to understand and respect each other a lot more as a result. The only way that the two can be switched back again is if they learn to selflessly love one another. You can probably guess what the ending is like; I won't spoil it for you. A good family film for all ages; Jamie Lee deserved an Oscar for this one- she's hilarious. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that's hilarious (especially for us teens)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: may contain spoilers!&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788; (Four out of Four Suns)Freaky Friday is a laugh-out-loud family comedy that any family with a teenager can relate to. The movie begins with a series of arguments and conflicts between the 'spunky' teen, Anna (Lindsay Lohan)and Dr. Coleman (Jaimie Lee Curtis.) They then switch bodies due to an unusual incident in a Chinese restaurant, and have to literally live in each other's shoes. All this on the night before Dr. Coleman's rehearsal dinner and Anna's Battle of the Bands. Only selfless love can switch them back, and reaching that seems highly unlikely.This is a hilarious, heartwarming film, but is not entire original in content. The exact plot has never been done, but the body-switch theme provokes a bit of a "been there, done that" attitude. Other than that, this was a great movie, great for any relative of a hormonal teenager.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Freaky Friday represents the second time that Lindsay Lohan has been in a Disney remake, and bettered the original. Freaky Friday provides no surprises, but for a movie like this, that is a compliment.Lohan stars along side Jamie Lee Curtis as a mother/daughter team that are out of touch with each other. Mom (Tess) is a widowed, workaholic psychiatrist, and the daughter (Anna) is trying to negotiate her way through the tough politics of high school. Tess wants desperately wants Anna to accept her husband-to-be, and Anna feels that mom doesn't care about the band she attempting to get off the ground. Neither appreciates the other's life and Anna is extremely put off by her mother's decision to re-marry so soon after her father's death. After a very public argument in a Chinese restaurant, the two are given a magic fortune cookie which causes them to switch bodies and live each other's lives until they work out their differences.Everything that ensues from this point forward is formulaic and predictable, but that does not take away from the fun. The mother, occupying the daughter's body, feels she can work problems with kids through communication and understanding, while the daughter decides it is time to go on a shopping binge, including a navel piercing.The performances from Curtis and Lohan make this film enjoyable. The comedic timing between the two of them is excellent in particular, the subtle way in which each adopts the others mannerisms and habits into their new body.As a parent , I found Freaky Friday to be completely acceptable family viewing. No real foul language, no innuendo and completely acceptable dress from the teenage characters. This movie also makes it clear that both the parents and the kids have problems in their lives that the other does not understand.Body Switch movies are an old and tired genre, but still, all studios should take a lesson form this film. It is fun, full of laughs, just a little bit moral and free of objectionable content, yet highly profitable. A few more like this a year would be a welcome change. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is incredibly good! The characters are likable and believable. Lindsay Lohan did a great job of acting as an adult, and Jamie Lee Curtis did an even better job of acting like a teen!**spoilers ahead**This movie tells the story of a mother and daughter who don't really get along. The teen, Anna, is rebellious and in a rock band, and completely the opposite of Tess, her very organized mother. While at a Chinese Restaurant, they are fighting and the owner comes up and gives them a fortune cookie, which they eat. The next morning, Anna and Tess have switched bodies, and they have to live in the lives of each other. Anna comes to understand that her mother lives a tough life, and Tess understands that being a teen isn't as easy as it seems. In the end, they switch back and understand how much they mean to each other.The only thing I didn't like in the movie, was Jake. While his character was fine, it was embarrasing to watch him and the mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete Suspension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To watch this film one has to suspend all belief, not just concerning the transfer of mother to daughter and daughter to mother but also the everyday happenings. Nothing about Freaky Friday rang true. Three examples are -- the easy entrance into the faculty room in order to change the two tests, the quick altering of "Anna's" exam, and the mere "fact" that the mother in Anna's body was in the proper seat in the classroom shown. Add to that Tess was totally unaware that one of Anna's teachers was a former suitor of Tess. And does anyone carry around all those communication devices?At first, I thought the young son was sweet; then the film depicted him as some mouthy monster who, along with his sister, controls the whole family, including the dullard about to become the step-father.I never, ever liked Jamie Lee Curtis, who would not be a "star" without her parents' names. In this film she seems way too old for the young kids, and Mark Harmon should be helping with grandchildren -- his own.Lindsay Loman was really good in "The Parent Trap," but after seeing this film, I conclude that she has not grown one iota as an actor. She played the role of Anna still as the twins in TPT -- everything the same except for that preposterous musical role. Was that the worst form of voice- and music over! Nice music for a wedding - ugh!As an escape this film is all right, especially since a neighbor loaned it to me. All I lost was time, but then I was sorting papers anyway.***SPOILER*** Why would anyone accept Jake? Kiss the mother and then the daughter just 'cause he felt something stirring inside of him! Creepy. And who invited him to the wedding? People just do not show up at wedding receptions. I would have said Bye to that loser.Wouldn't being in your parent's body scar you for life?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Quite a hilarious film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells story of a teenage girl named Anna and her mother Tess whohave nothing in common except that they are always fighting. Anna is havingmany problems at school. One of the reasons is because her English teacherclaims that she has failed an assessment but she probably had passed. Theother reason is because a classmate named Stacy keeps annoying her. Themain problem she's having at home is that he little brother keeps annoying her i.e. being cheeky with her and messing around in her bedroom. While hermother doesn't really understand her daughters problems.Some punishments were a bit much. For example Anna wraps a piece ofunderwear around her little brother's face for entering her bedroom for the...I don't know many times but a lot by the look of it. Then Tess punishes herdaughter by removing her bedroom door. Then Tess tells her daughter that shecan't attend the rock 'n' roll audition that Anna and her school friends hadworked so hard for. It really enrages Anna crazy "Mum your ruining my life!"But the greatest part of this movie was of course the climax of the film i.e. when Tess and Anna wake up to find themselves in each others bodies as the result of a magic spell. Now Anna and Tess have to pretend to be each other in each others bodies?! Now everyone thinks that Anna and Tess are acting pretty weird. Anna's brother now thinks that his sister is being nice to him and his mother is being horrible to him. Tess (In Anna's body) has to go school and was mostly letting her friends down because she claims "I'm not myself". Worse for Anna (in Tess's body) has to go to her mothers work as a psychiatrist , when she has no knowledge of psychology. But that's only the start it gets much, much worse! Eventually they both get back to their own bodies, this experience may have been the weirdest thing ever for them but it also helped them both to understand each other and in the process helped them reconcile. So I think this experience could help resolve other disputes between parents and children...or worsen them, who knows...But overall I think this film is quite hilarious and I'd recommend it to anyone I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>really, it's not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan are Tess and Anna Coleman, a mother and teenaged daughter who are having trouble getting along. Why is that? Tess is a successful psychiatrist, which means she is so very busy that she needs a plethora of electronic devices to plan her day. She is also engaged to a man named Ryan, who seems to be lacking in personality, but apparently makes her happy. Along with that, she has a little son named Harry whom she loves so very much she overlooks his many faults. All in all, this leaves little time for her to spend with Anna, a typical teenager who is sullen and moody; who is smart, but misunderstood by her peers and mean teacher; who is confused about her older-boy crush, who likes her back; and who's also a guitar player in a band, that has an audition on the night of Tess's wedding rehersal dinner. Tess doesn't understand Anna and doesn't take her band seriously, so she doesn't want her to go. They fight at a Chinese restaraunt. A creepy staff member overhears and brings them magic fortune cookies(in the bathroom, no less), which ... make the mother and daughter switch places(their minds...or inner souls, or whatever) and they cannot switch back until they learn to understand each other.That hardly sounds like a masterpiece, and ...wasn't, in my opinion, which is apparently different from the opinions of a lot of critics and filmgoers, who just LOVED it. I'm not sure why. The first twenty or so minutes, pre the mother and daughter switch, border between dull(the mothers's scenes) and GRATING(particularly the "hijinks" between the daughter and rather irritating little son, and the obnoxiously loud soundtrack). The movie picks up a LITTLE bit during the switch(the daughter acting all motherly toward the son), but almost immediately plummets back down again as the mother and daughter don't act like THEMSELVES trapped in the other one's bodies, but rather like cliche's of overworked mothers and teenagers.This is especially annoying with the "daughter in the mother's body" character, who does things like spend her mother's credit cards, utter cutesy expressions like "ew" and "dude," and act all giggly and "funloving." There is one teenage girl character in the movie whom the daughter is feuding with. If THAT girl had switched places with the mother, it might have worked. Did the writer not remember that pre- the big switch, the daughter was all whiny and antisocial and actually acted, oh, NOTHING like she does when she is in her mother's body?That incredible plot inconsistancy is the overall worst part of the movie, which also suffers from an annoying soundtrack(did "we" need to hear two entire songs from the daughter's cheesy band?), over-rated acting(did Jamie Lee Curtis really deserve an award nomination) and a very contrived ending. It's really not great, so why was it treated as such by critics and audiences alike? I have been stuck seeing this two-and-a-half times and I am still trying to figure this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie can be summed up in one word "Dumb". I think that this has got to be the worst one yet. It looked promising from such a well developed actress such as Jamie Lee Curtis but it wasn't. Lindsay Lohan is a very medeorchre actress, I swear, I just cringe at all the movies she's made. The parts I probably despised the most were when that guy that anabel's character liked falls for the mom. I don't care who's in who's body that isn't cool! The thing I also didn't get was when the mother gets absolutely no slack in this movie. I guess I'm a kid sort of (teenager's a better word), I think what the mother was doing wasn't so wrong. The mom wanted to get married, her daughter should have been more accepting to the mother's dismay rather than her own selfish reasons. The kid mangled up her mom too. I wouldn't want my mom walking around looking like that! You don't see the mom getting to dress her daughter in a sailor's uniform! Or some other dorky dress. Anabel over reacted way too much. The mom probably should hae taught her kids some disipline!</fullReview>

I found many of the elements of this movie very amusing. The actors were all great - the brother was hillarious, the daughter was wonderful as the mother and the mother was 'rockin' as the daughter. Even the grandfather and the husband-to-be had their moments. The mother/daughter arguments were excellent and the Chinese restaurant owners were great!In all,this movie is a lot of fun for all the family.Enjoy. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun - Funny - Good Re-Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan shine in this remake of a classic movie and superb book. The story is simple, but strong, with adequate sub-plots to keep the movie interesting. Look for funny little twists and an interesting love triangle to complicate the relatively simple main plot of a mother and daughter who switch bodies and experience each other's lives.I was surprised at the talent that relative newcomer Lohan showed, I hope to see her try a hand at more demanding roles as she matures. Jamie Lee Curtis was convincing as a Teen Ager in a middle aged woman's body. The supporting actors were fine, but don't expect any awards. The secondary roles were also a little "cardboard" but this is a minor defect in an otherwise excellent production.Freaky Friday (2003) is a light, fun/funny and at times touching film.Plot 8/10 -- Direction 8/10 -- Acting 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is good lighthearted fun for the entire family. Jamie Lee Curtis and the rest of the cast are outstanding in their roles.

		<shortDescription>Freaky Friday (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This summer, Disney had a monopoly on box office business: with Freaky Friday, Finding Nemo, and The Pirates of the Caribbean, they proved that after all these years, they were still the leading company in family entertainment. And while the best of these three features was certainly Finding Nemo, Freaky Friday comes in as a close second. In spite of the fact that the story -- which wasn't very original to begin with -- had already been filmed twice (once in 1976 with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris, and again in 1995 as a made-for-TV movie starring Gaby Hoffman and Shelley Long), director Mark S. Waters manages to keep it fresh. Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Annabell (Lindsay Lohan) have the typical modern mother-daughter relationship: they can't stand each other. So when they go out for Chinese one night to celebrate Tess's engagement to Ryan (Mark Harmon), the owner of the restaurant casts a spell on them. When they wake up the next morning, they discover that they have switched bodies. But let's move past the cheesy premise of the movie; the charm of Freaky Friday lies in watching these two characters act out their opinions about each other. You would think that we'd have seen it enough times to not find it amusing anymore, but this is perhaps the first time it's actually done well. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as the mother-turned-daughter. She accomplishes that rarest of acting feats, which is to have genuine fun with her role. And although I am not familiar with Lohan, she does a fine job herself. Heather Hach's screenplay (her first) is certainly over-ambitious, but it hits most of the right notes and has just enough insight to remain interesting for 97 minutes. Hach's only misstep was her inclusion of the characters of the annoying little brother and the annoying senile grandfather; not only are they entirely superfluous to the plot, but they're written very unevenly. The grandfather (played by the overly-devoted Harold Gould) is forgetful and ignorant one minute, and the next he's making jokes about thongs. As for the little brother, he fulfills his purpose almost TOO well, being unbearably irritating. The script does resort to comedic cliches more than once, but I'm willing to forgive her this considering how -- compared to most summer movies -- they're relatively minute. Although I would like to warn White Stripes fans that there is some brief Stripe-bashing in one scene (which is redeemed by the soundtrack's surprising inclusion of Joey Ramone's cover of "What a Wonderful World"). The other thing that makes Freaky Friday worthwhile is Stephen Tobolowsky's supporting role as Annabell's overly critical English teacher (when will this man finally be cast as a principal character?). In the end, the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts; but there are enough good parts to make this one of the year's few movies that can be enjoyed by just about anyone.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Freaky Friday is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan as the mum and daughter who switch bodies after an encounter with a Chinese lady at a restuarant gives them a fortune cookie each, after they are seen arguing about each others "perfect" lives.The film flows along quite nicely, never too boring at any point with constant laughs, and a nice easy watch at around 90 minutes. I suppose it is generally aimed at kids but I found myself(18)and my dad(who is over 50)regulary laughing at the characters antics especially the young girls brother and her grandfather who were terrific.Youngster Lindsay Lohan turns in a very mature performance, along with Curtis and because of this, you truly believe that they are in each other bodies.Even though Freaky Friday's story isn't groundbreaking stuff but what you get is a more fun movie than you will have expected and certainly this is one for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would have thought a remake of a family comedy would actually elicit some really nice performances? In Freaky Friday, the two leads, Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, shine in the dual roles they play. At first, the two actresses fit nicely, and somewhat predictably, as the bickering mother and daughter. The real fun comes when they switch bodies. Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely hysterical when she becomes her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan is actually very believable and very likeable as she plays her mom.The story is also very nice as the two slowly learn of the hardships they each face. The final scenes where they bond and help each other out are quite touching. Freaky Friday has only a few minor drawbacks. The little brother was stereotypically annoying, but there's a nice scene featuring him later in the movie. I also kind of doubt that some of the references made in the movie (The Hives, The White Stripes) will really be remembered years from now. Also, the gag of the switched bodies seemed to drag on a little long, but I think it was resolved soon enough, and it all wrapped up nicely.I read recently in Entertainment Weekly that Jamie Lee Curtis said she wouldn't be upset if she didn't work in another movie; that Freaky Friday was the perfect movie to end on a high note. I think I speak with many people, and hopefully the Academy, that we hope this doesn't happen, but I agree that Freaky Friday is a wonderful and touching film that will live on for quite some time. People from many generations to come will enjoy Ms. Curtis's performance, as well as Lindsay Lohan's performance. Kudos to all that contributed to this great movie!My IMDb Rating: 9/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)</fullReview>

It had a slow start but did not take long at all to take off once the places were changed. The acting was quite good for this type of film and of course Curtis performed great as usual. This is a film I would suggest for most families and will probably buy myself. Check this out as soon as you can it just released recently on DVD.</fullReview>

It bobs along merrily with a typical mother and argumentative teenage daughter (maybe slightly overacted, but hey, it's for kids) Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic, Lindsay Lohan is practically the same as she was in 'The Parent Trap'. There are quite a few laughs (once you've got into a 10-year old's state of mind) and it's an entertaining enough hour &amp; 1/2.

		<fullReview>Any movie with Jamie Lee Curtis is going to be an okay movie no matter how bad it is. Annabell Coleman playing her daughter was really good too. I thought she was really cute.But this movie wasn't bad. It was kind of a "formula" type movie with a silly plot and then funny stuff happening as a result but it did have some interesting acting. How many actresses could have successfully played someone 30 years younger than themselves? Or someone 30 years older? I liked the way this movie didn't seem "perfect" as in everything so well thought out in advance but this was more like real life where things happen haphazardly and they eventually get thought out. Good family movie, kid friendly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit it! I am absolutely obsessed with Chad Murray's career. I follow his work, and adore him. I think he is so fun and cute. Chad added a great element to the movie. His character was bouncing back and forth throughout the movie, and I really felt for him. I actually found myself feeling sorry for his character, at one point. Jamie Lee Curtis was absolutely wonderful in this movie. She was fun, cute and incredibly talented. I disliked her character in the beginning, but by the end of the movie I really liked her, and wanted her and Anna (Lindsay Lohan) to continue with their close relationship they had developed. The part of the movie that I was most impressed with was the part where Anna and her mother began to understand each other, and they gave the ultimate sacrifice for each other. This version of the movie is definitely very different from the original, but I found myself enjoying this one more than the original. This movie was funny, sweet, romantic, and had a great group of actors. I would recommend this movie to any mother and daughter going through a rough time, as well as any teenage girl with a crush on Chad Murray. Truthfully, I would recommend it to anyone. I loved this movie! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie thinking Lindsay Lohan is no Jodie Foster but she is still pretty talented. However, I was sadly disappointed. This remake wasn't nearly as good as the first movie. Lindsay is entirely over dramatic and not a very fun character to watch. The only thing I really liked about her was that she played in a garage band. But the girl wasn't as developed as I would have liked. She isn't a rebel or a goodie two shoes, she just is. I believe the producers have utterly failed to capture a realistic teenage character (Evan Rachel Woods would have been better).Jamie Lee Curtis, the mom, is a psychologist. I think a lot of her scenes with her patients could have been spiced up a bit. Also, when she is trying to psycho analyze her children, she could have played this up a bit more to add some comedy that the movie is lacking.In all, the movie took itself far too seriously. This kind of movie should been more comedy than melodrama. I feel like if the rating had been moved up, the movie would have had more room for humor and drama. I think poor Walt may have rolled over in his grave.</fullReview>

And that I can say to pretty much anyone, although it probably is something that would be more appealing to those of the female race. The dynamic between Curtis and Lohan is excellent, Lindsay Lohan especially was excellent as a forty-something mom. Following The Parent Trap, Lohan seems to like these odd roles, which challenge her acting ability rather than fuel her poster selling ability. She was really excellent. For anyone who remembers the song "Take Me Away" by LASH a few years ago will be surprised to see it revisited in the movie, the soundtrack overall adds to the movie's charm. A really nice change of pace from oversexed teen movies, but not too childish either. :)(Insert four stars here)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you do if you're Disney and have rights to a 1975 hit that no one wants to see because it's dated? You do a re-make!Freaky Friday is based on the 1972 novel of the same name by Mary Rogers. The 1975 movie attempted to correct a failing of the book which only focused on the drudgery and effort it took to be a stay-at-home mom, but this results in the movie being firmly set in the mid-70's.Much has changed since then in the lives of both adults and their teenaged daughters. The 2003 re-make attempts to capture these changes. It is a mass-marketed kid's film, so it relies on stereotypical characters that are flat around the edges, but it retains the heart of the story... everyone has a difficult life, so look past the difficulties and express love and appreciation.Mary Rodgers's other book was A Billion for Boris and Boris made an apperance in the Freaky Friday book. In this version, look for him as the delivery guy.</fullReview>

Big Fat Liar(starring Amanda Bynes) What a Girl Wants(again,Amanda). Lizzie Maguire was a huge disappointment(the show outshines the movie by 100 watts or so). I have to give this movie its props,as a jaded 32 year old mother who usually hates these things. Also good:was the soundtrack,featuring a Joey Ramone song(!) as well as some teen-angst grunge rock(most notably: a rock remake of hit Me Baby One More Time by Bowling For Soup).

		<fullReview>This movie is not nice or innocent at all. The change from the original of 25 years ago to now is a loss of integrity. The scene where the audiences manipulated into laughing when the little boy has a pair of underwear pulled tightly over his face and he can't see and is having a rough time breathing is disgusting.This is a film that makes the big sister a hero while she ridicules the little boy. The mother is unlikable with feminist lines like "you do not need a man to complete you." Sexual innuendo and an uneasy plot with the boyfriend having the hots for the mother because the girl is in her body are not enjoyable. It is all humor based on jaded sexual tension which hardly interests the very young audience and is very uncomfortable. The stereotypes of arrogant teens and purple hair and spoiled youth is all presented almost as normal. Only the band final scene playing is worthy of seeing. But all and all this film is way over rated and not in the league of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay but Curtis really p****d me off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't bad, and I would have liked it a lot more had J. L. Curtis not Crapped on the original in an interview released before the film was. She said that the acting in the original was "okay for a '70's film. I mean, come on, Barbara Harris?" For your information, Jamie, Barbara Harris was a better actress at birth than you will ever be. The 1977 original was so much funnier and so much better acted. The music was better too. The "music" in the new one was grating and amateurish at best. I've had enough. Rating: 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a lark! Definitely the best acting I've seen in a body-swap movie. Both hubby and I thought it was very good. It moved right along, the camera work was excellent and acting first rate, especially Curtis who did a spot-on job playing the teenager. As a feel-good movie it is quite satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Summer 2003 film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Freaky Friday" is one film I'm adding to my "Best Films of 2003" list!In this sumer of pointless sequels, big F/X and movies that were forgettable as yesterdays news; "Freaky Friday" was a fresh funny movie.Jamile Lee Curtis has never been funnier or more fun to watch since "A Fish Called Wanda". It's easy to forget how fabulous she is at physical comedy, then you see her in "Freaky Friday" &amp; you see what a great actress she really is. Jamie Lee Curtis steals the film as the confident mother, and then steals it from herself as the befuddled daughter in the mother's body.This is one role that Ms. Curtis should be looked at for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a comedy! I laughed at her performance till my sides hurt. It was wonderfull to see Ms. Curtis in a great comedy, its been too long!As one Critic stated I and have to 100% agree:"Freaky Friday" represents the rarity of Hollywood working on a professional level, delivering superior product and asking us to support it. The movie was made with finesse, with concern for little things like story and character, with considerable wit, with a good idea of the plot's possibilities.Such a fun-for-all matinee delight that it cleansed my palate of the sour taste of every bad movie I've seen this summer.At the film's end, I realized I had completely escaped into the fantasy and comedy laid out before me for 90 minutes. Now, any movie that can do that is doing something very right indeed.It's a solid, funny, human hour-and-a-half of the most pleasant escapism I've seen this summer.Now if only more films that came out this 2003 summer did just that it would have been a better film going summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept of Freaky Friday has been done a few times before. With this time it seems as though some spark went off that made this version separate from the original and it's many attempts. Jamie Lee Curtis is one of the many bright spots in this film. She has very good comic timing and really fits the part. As the uptight mom Tess CURTIS, was right on the ball, then when she turned into the young and typical teen Annabell she gave yet another good performance. Jamie Lee Curtis is one of the best actresses around. She brings beauty and depth to almost every character she plays. Lindsay Lohan who played Annabell is still in the process of showing the world what she is made of did however turn in a very funny performance. While not as experienced as CURTIS, LOHAN really stood her ground. By the looks of this performance she is going to have a long career. A piece of advice to her would be try to do something a little different. Of course FRIDAY and THE PARENT TRAP were good and successful at the box-office I think it is time for her to show the world that she has Varity. FREAKY FRIDAY was one of the better films this summer, while it was a remake it did add a little spice of it's own. While it was not the funniest or the wildest or the most gripping movie out there it's message is pretty big, don't judge a person or what they are going through until you walk in their shoes. It's a feel good movie with some laughs and a way to escape the everyday reality of life. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't one of the best movies I've seen but I really enjoyed it. I wasn't really sure what to expect and during about the first fifteen minutes, I found the movie a bit annoying, but it got much better and it was fun to watch. It was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis again and it was really great to see Lindsay Lohan from The Parent Trap (a really GREAT movie) again and all grown up. Some of the antics that the characters got into were funny and Lindsay's romantic interest in the film (Tristan from Gilmore Girls) was really cute. He sure looks better than he did on Gilmore Girls. I also enjoyed the music and the band aspect of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Freaky Friday puts a modern spin on the classic Jodie Foster movie that accurately reflects the teenage climate of today. In fact, I was struck on how much some of the relationships and situations in the film mirrored the relationships of my kids and their friends.I'm sure you've read some of the other great reviews, but it bears mentioning again that Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely in her element in this film. Reminds me of her roles in A Fish Called Wanda and Trading Spaces.Lindsay Lohan is great as are Mark Harmon and Ryan Malgarini, who plays the little brother, Harry, with relish... but Jamie Lee steals the show.Despite the PG rating, this film is ok for everyone... I was very comfortable with my 9 year old at the film.</fullReview>

The crowd in the theatre was composed mostly of 10 to 13 year olds, but, there was a good amount of middle-aged couples.It wasn't exactly a busy show, but I will say this-- This movie is over all, pretty good. There were a whole bunch (A good percentage) of events/jokes in this movie that only my friends, and the older people in the audience found funny. --Now that I think of it, there were only a small amount of things that the kids seemed to laugh at.In all, I would recommend this movie to people of all ages...

		<shortDescription>A Return to Form for Disney Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many of us know, Disney are great at animated features. The lapse in quality among those is extremely rare. However, the same cannot be said for the company's live-action fare, which has been on a downwards spiral since the great family entertainment released in the '60s.I haven't seen 2002's "Holes" yet (which I've heard is great), but 2001's "The Princess Diaries" showed a glimmer of hope, which, I'm pleased to say, is alive and kicking in "Freaky Friday". I originally hated the idea of this remake, as I didn't think the original was that great anyway. However, this movie is luckily held up by a good script, genuinely hilarious comedy moments (one of the standouts being Jamie Lee Curtis' conversation with the caterers - "Halibut? Eew!") and two terrific performances from the leads.Jamie Lee Curtis simply chews up the scenery as the mother with a teenager inside her, while Lindsay Lohan proves to be one of the few movie teens with charisma and comic timing.Yes, it is predictible in places and yes, there are a couple of schmaltzy moments that threaten to bring down the whole movie, but when you're having such a great time, it's hard to care.What with "Finding Nemo", "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Freaky Friday", it looks like Disney is on a roll this year. All I have to say is, it's about time we got some quality family entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the body switching genre was dead, especially after Dream A Little Dream(1989). But this movie somewhat brings it back. The performances are strong in this delightful remake of the 1976 classic. Jammie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan seem pretty belivable in there roles has mother and daughter who switch bodies. Jammie Lee Curtis is very funny playing a 15 year old girl stuck in a 40 year old womans body. And Lindsay Lohan is pretty delightful has a 40 year old woman stuck in a 15 year old girls body. Mark Harmon is also good has Ryan. Very enjoyable. AHH FREAK OUT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've seen this formula several times over the years. The switcheroo genre type of film depends on chemistry and this one has it. Jamie Lee Curtis isn't `the body' anymore, but she's still darn good actress and works very well with Lindsay Lohan. Mark Harmon, being a former quarterback, understands his role in this flick and plays Curtis's fiancée. He's understated which is what his part calls for and Steven Tobolowsky does what he does so well, play a geek. Don't look for academy awards but look to be entertained for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, she doesn't get along with her mother Tess(Jamie Lee Curtis)too well and often blames her and accuses her of ruining her life. But these two will learn what it feels like to be in each other's shoes, when a magic fortune cookie makes them switch bodies with each other. This was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie for the whole family. I watched it with my mom and we both liked it very much. Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely hilarious in this harmless and fun movie. Lindsay Lohan also does a great job and she has also grown into a very beautiful young girl.

		<fullReview>I just saw Freaky Friday, and while you may now be prepared to gag and skip this review, and the movie as well, you may actually be surprised to learn that is it a very good movie! Critics have been heralding this movie as the biggest surprise of the summer, and the critics are actually right this time. It's a given that everyone knows the plot of this movie in which an typical stiff-minded mom and a typical troubled teenage girl switch places, and while the plot may seem overdone, even cliched, it is surprisingly, indescribably fresh here. The limitless comedy of Jamie Lee Curtis acting like a teenager and Lindsey Lohan acting like an adult will keep you laughing a good deal of the movie. But there are also many other laughs and sight gags that are startling in their unexpected originality. And rest assured, there is also surprisingly effective drama (followed by more rollicking comedy, of course). If someone were to ask me to describe what's so good about this movie, I would probably say the acting and the writing. But truthfully, it's just plain indescribable how this movie works as well as it does, and why it has all the qualities it has. It's one of those movies you can't take someone's word for, it's one of the movies you just have to see to believe.I give it a perfect 10/10. Well recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wide smile from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This very funny movie with established actor Jamie Lee Curtis and newcomer Lindsay Lohan has to be good news to the Disney company, which has had little but negative news recently. In this film, mother and daughter find their personalities have switched bodies after some Asian magic by the owner of the local Chinese restaurant. Mother and daughter must now find a way to switch back, and in the meantime, struggle through their days without revealing what has happened.While Ms. Curtis' character, Tess Coleman, is a psychologist, her daughter Annabelle is a typical teenager in high school. There is simply one gag after another, with one where Ms. Curtis' character (but with her daughter's personality) appears on TV to discuss her latest book, being particularly fine. There are various complicating factors, which only make this film more fun. I found myself wearing a smile from the beginning to the end of this simply delightful comedy. Tess Coleman is also engaged to be married with an engagement party scheduled--while daughter Annabelle is a musician in a band and is scheduled for an audition at the same time as the party. Their solution to this problem is the highlight of the film and an absolute showstopper. What fun! This energetic and hilarious movie must not be missed. At the conclusion of the film, the audience, both adults and children of various ages, burst into spontaneous applause and cheers. I don't normally care for comedies, but this one is worth every moment. Do yourself a favor and go see this outstanding movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a comedy deserve a "9" rating? Does one dare to put it up with the ranks of the truly great classic movies? No, of course, not, but I found that, while most comedy movies are not all that funny, Freaky Friday made me really laugh from the beginning to almost the end (they had to wrap-up the movie somehow!) They got it right. Thus, within the comedy genre, this movie surely deserves a "9".Without spoiling the plot, a certain relationship between the mother and daughter needed to occur and they accomplished this with subtlety and skill. Very well done, very funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie on a date with some trepidation (I'm 48 years old), and was quite pleasantly surprised! I've seen the 1976 version too many times on video with my children, so I went already knowing the plot, but this version was well written and acted, hilariously funny (the slapstick went just far enough and not too far), and even moving. I highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid, Entertaining, Fun Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a delightful, fun, funny comedy that brings laughs and tears. I enjoyed this movie, one of the most satisfying comedies this year. The physical pratfalls are to die for. The acting and switching personalities is insightful and emotively connecting. The only weaknesses in this movie comes in the rock band tryout and the overly simplified teen relationship resolution - both scenes didn't really feel real or complete. But overall this movie is a gem for the summer, an above average, intelligent, substantive, hilarious experience well worth the ticket price. Eight stars out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I attended this movie because my little brother wanted to see it, and it turned out better than I expected. Having seen the other two versions of this movie, I pretty much knew what to expect from the plot. The acting was very well-executed; casting was great. Jamie Lee Curtis really stood out in what I believe to be one of her best roles. I really enjoyed the scenes with the therapy clients and the mother/daughter bickering will hit close to home for girls as well as boys. I recommend this movie, even though it can be chick-flicky at times, for general family viewing---especially pre-teen and teenage girls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the movie starts off horribly with contrived and unbelievable bickering between the two female leads. But after being changed, it settles down into a hysterical family comedy that bridges the gap between the genreations with a heartfelt touch. Jamie Lee Curtis makes a strong comedic comeback in a role that highlights her more outlandish acting specks. It's just your basic role reversal story as a troublesome mother and daughter stumble upon a hapless asian magic wielder working at a chinese restauraunt. The hijinks unfold as they both proceed to live a day in the other persons shoes. The mom being a highly respected psychiatrist whose getting married to her second husband and the daughter whose in a rock band and is being tortued by classmates and teachers while falling for a hot guy. It sounds all cliche ridden and mainly it is. But it's the performances and the ensomble casts chemistry that brings it all together effectively and wholeheartedly. Another one in a recent crop of entertaining family films designed for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as original, maybe better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a die hard fan of the original '76 version. But as the years waned it became more and more droll. I still feel Jody Foster's Annabelle is better, but Jamie Lee Curtis way outshines Barbara Harris, who played the mother in the original. This version is modern and fun. The situations are different and it does not take away from the previous version. There is one situation with the character "Jake" that gets a bit carried away... you will know what I am talking about when you see it. This is the worst thing about this film and it shouldn't have been taken as far as it was.There have been many body/spirit switching movie themes. Freaky Friday is one of the best. And the 2003 Freaky Friday is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dismissed this movie, having not been pleased with any of Disney's latest works (save Pirates of the Caribbean). Rather fortunately, I was persuaded to see it with a friend and I was pleasantly surpised.I knew the storyline and I had seen the very cute version from 1976 with Jodie Foster. While that one has its merits, so does this newest version. The story is brilliantly made modern and is full of wit and charm.Jamie Lee Curtis seems made for this role as does Lindsay Lohan. Both seamlessly blend from teenager to middle-aged as they switch roles. I also enjoyed Chad Michael Murray's role as Lindsay's love interest.Judging by the audience's reaction when I saw it, everyone was loving it; children and adults alike. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting another terrible Disney dribble flick, and I basically cannot take Disney anymore under any circumstances. As I have 3 small kids, it is sometimes a challenge though. I usually love Jamie Lee, she's funny, and bright... a great plain girl actress. I saw the poster and trailer for this film, and I was ready to stay 10 miles away.However, my kids really wanted to see it, and it got tons of good reviews from even the most cynical, non parent, child hating, nasty film culture snobs, that I figured I'd give it a chance. I was stunned. This thing was great. It was no milestone in filmaking, but in a summer full of action movie sequels, and minimal creative products from a panicked studio system that is going through another period of zero originality, this was a blast.Jamie Lee was simply amazing, she WAS the mother/daughter, and Linsday Lohan was great. It was great family fare, and generally fun for everyone. I will even buy the DVD. This was not just another body switching thing. Direction was perfect, not heavy handed. No special effects, great writing, crisp dialogue, just a plain fun movie, like the studios cranked out for decades, before they became what they are today.I would recommend this to anyone with a family, any adult with a sense of irony and humor, and anyone who just wants to get away from all those action sequels (which I admit, I also really like)</fullReview>

The bad boy falling for the mother, who was actually the daughter was the only thin point. What I want to know is: what happens to the cheerleader's test score?I think Jamie Lee Curtis should be nominated for an Oscar. I know that comedies are generally shunned by the Academy because they seem lowbrow, but comedy is harder to pull off.I would recommend this movie to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaky surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest surprise this summer turns out to be the one that everyone rolled their eyes at. Freaky Friday, yet another Disney remake of one of their own films, is a well-acted, well-scripted piece of family fluff. For anyone who doesn't know the story, basically a mother and a daughter who don't understand each other switch bodies for a day.It doesn't matter how they do it because once it happens the film takes off. Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are fantastic playing each other's characters -- especially Curtis. She has a complete loss of inhibition and is playing it for broke. Her outbursts of slang (like when she incredulously yells "Shuut UP!") are hilarious and she brings energy to the screen that hasn't been seen from her for years.Of course it's Disney so you know that everything will end up with nice, sappy, understanding ending, but because of all the early shenanigans I found that I actually liked these two people a lot. This leads to the reconciliation being, well, all right I'll say it... heart-warming. In other words, Freaky Friday is definite guilty-pleasure material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie and over all it's cute. It holds some amusing moments. Jamie Lee Curtis is good at delivering her "hip" lines, and Lindsey with her "adult" one liners. The movie moves pretty fast, almost too fast, and you have to ask yourself, what the hell just happened? The relationship between Anna (Lohan) and Jake (Chad Murray) moves from 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds. Chad, who plays Jake, is giving is first real comical performance and through out it all, it was only Chad and the younger brother who honestly made me laugh. Poor Chad gets tackled, has to scream out "baby one more time" gets slapped, tripped, and dragged. It's a good movie for Chad fans. He's very cute in it, even if his singing skills aren't Steve Perry worthy, its okay b/c its very funny, and actors aren't supposed to be singers, right? In retrospect, Chad's the only one that stands out in my mind at the end of the movie. Freaky Friday is not an oscar winner, but good for a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another entry for the "Unnecessary Remake" file. It's bad enough to remake what some would consider a classic (a dated classic, but classic nonetheless), but to re-remake it? Oy. Instead of this, I think it would have been interesting to see a follow-up to the 1976 original. Get Jodie Foster back as Annabelle Andrews, now a single mom trying -- and failing -- to avoid the same pitfalls with her daughter that she had with her mother. She's also trying to avoid another Friday like she had before, but the plot being what it is... Add the obligitory "Oh, god, not again" scene, and we're good to go. If they had only done it again one time, I'd be fine. But the third-time-around just feels like studio execs trying to avoid having to think up new material. But what's done is done. Whatever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tomboy teenage girl, Annabel (Lohan), and her widowed mother, Ellen (Curtis), who are always arguing with each other, simultaneously wish they could be someone else, they somehow exchange bodies, as they both learn (or in the mother's case, remembers) what it's like to be in the other person's situation. As nice as that might be, the duo faces a deadline, as the mother is due to get married soon, and doesn't want to miss the big event (obviously) or for her daughter to get to know her new stepfather (Harmon) a *lot* better than she had expected... There's also the problem of Annabel finding herself stuck with her mom's job as a medical doctor (but without any of the training to back it up)! Child actress Lindsay Lohan was already an experienced performer when she made her feature debut in the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. Born in New York City, Lohan began modeling at age three. After appearing in numerous TV commercials, Lohan moved to series TV with a role on the daytime serial Another World from 1996 to 1997. Cast as The Parent Trap's scheming twin sisters after a six month search for just the right girl, Lohan succeeded in filling Hayley Mills' shoes, winning over audiences with her pert charm as both the Californian Hallie and the British-raised Annie. She subsequently starred in the Disney TV film Life-Size (2000). ~ Lucia Bozzola that is why i thought the movie was great because she had so much expirience!

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised this evening when I attended a free preview of the updated version of "Freaky Friday". Although Ms Curtis and Ms Lohan aren't reprising the roles of Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster, their performances were believable as mother and daughter, at least to this writer and the three 14 year-olds sitting next to me. The reactions, once the switch takes place, were funny, sometimes touching, sometimes a bit over-the-top, but enjoyable. I only have one piece of advice for Jamie Lee, collagen injections in the lips, but not too much. This is a woman who did the film "Perfect" in the heyday of 80's aerobics sexercise and she still has a great body, (we should all be so lucky), even with a flash of thong showing. Mothers and daughters will always be at odds with one another, it's normal, but I'm happy to report eventually daughters grow-up and become their own women, too. All that advice your mother gave you when you were a teenager, most of it was because they've been there, done that back in the day. Fantasy aside, hopefully, somebody's paying attention. Sort of goofy fun with a great message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing enough, but not brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically an all right movie. Mixed up and distraught teen Anna is at sixes and sevens with her mom, Dr. Tess Coleman. Anna sees that her mom seems to have a perfect an under control life, and she is "ruining" her own life, which is incredibly difficult. Her mom only sees that Anna is seeming to slip at school and is confident that her life is nothing that she couldn't deal with. Neither can see that each other's lives are anything but easy. But a mischeivous Chinese restaurant owner changes all of that when she gives them fortune cookies that switch their minds with their bodies!So that's the basic idea of the movie. If you can get past the ridiculousness of the switch and the fact that instead of taking sick days, mom and daughter decide to take charge of eachother's lives(even though mom is getting MARRIED tomorrow), you'll have fun. This is a cute movie - there were times when everyone in the theatre laughed out loud. It is good to see with kids, but not brilliant. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan(who has proved to be a very good actress in The Parent Trap) are both mostly believable trying to stretch across the years, and the side characters in the movie are amusing but no one is particularly stand-out. As a remake, the challenges presented to mother and daughter are updated for this time period(instead of facing a swim challenge, mom must deal with a rock solo). All in all, this is a decent movie and amusing enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes tend to fall in the same three categories as sequels: they're either better than the original, on the same level, or worse. "Freaky Friday" falls into the former category. Never mind the fact that Friday is the 2nd Disney remake that starred Lindsay Lohan ("Parent Trap" was her first.) There's nothing wrong with that...just a tad bit interesting. I'm sure the reason for any remake (family oriented or otherwise) is to introduce a favorite film to a new generation of fans as wells as entertain the fans of the original. "Freaky Friday" delivers in spades.I went to a screening of the film last night and was surprised to see a representative from Disney Studios there to welcome the audience and take a survey at the end of the film. Most of the feedback were positive. It's always great to see how a story such as "Freaky Friday" would work if it was set in today's society. The clothes, the technology, the music.I have no doubt that it would have been nice and interesting in a role reversal had Jodie Foster played the role of Anna's mother. However, I thought that Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan presented a great mother/daughter dynamic with its own unique style. The soundtrack rocks!! Lindsay Lohan and Christina Vidal lent their vocal talents on 2 tracks: "Ultimate" and "Take Me Away."I'll be sure to watch this movie again when it's released theatrically on August 1. It's a great movie for the family to enjoy...Well, that and Lindsay Lohan and newcomer Haley Hudson (who plays Lindsay's fellow Pinkslip bandmate Peg) are incredibly hot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a sneak preview of FF (2003) last night with my 9 &amp; 10 yr olds. They loved it and I was quite surprised at how well written it was. Also, Lindsey Lohan, who I was not previously familiar with, did a very good job in the harder role of the teen-as-adult. Jamie Lee Curtis, already a proven comedic talent, was fine as the adult turned teen. I also liked the way they used old chestnut 70's songs that turned into updated versions of same by newer bands. There is even one brief thong shot of JLC played for laughs (her young son says, "EWWWW" when he sees her walking away.) All in all, fine for the tween/young teen market and their adults who have to be dragged to the show with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney films strike again, but watch it for Lohan/Curtis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good. I haven't seen the original so I only had this version to go off of. I was pretty impressed by how solid of a film it was. Usually I look at Disney films with a critical eye only, but I had to see what the buzz was about, especially with this cast.Lindsay Lohan plays a girl whose life is surrounded with typical problems growing up. Her mother is remarrying after her father passed away, her brother is as annoying as any other brother, and her mother doesn't understand why she's not opening up to her. Lohan plays the role of the rebellious daughter/rock-n-roll guitarist very well (although her Disney acting skills get a little overacted at points) as she tries to play in a gig at the House of Blues the same day as her mother's marriage rehearsal dinner.The movie was stretching the story a bit when it included a story involving a magical fortune cookie and the powers that dwell within which switches their brains (?) from the daughter's body to the mother's. I guess the movie had to have some selling point, though. And the Disney acting, like a said before, was geared towards the younger crowd who could care less.But Jamie Lee Curtis...she is more spry every time I see her on film. She had more energy than Lohan on this film when it came to acting like her daughter. That was a shocker.I gave the film a 5/10 stars. It was OK for a generic movie to have on, but to critically analyze every little thing would be pointless. People watched this movie for Curtis and Lohan and to see the hijinks between mother and daughter. I'd rent it for my kids if I had some. I don't know about owning it, though.</fullReview>

(Rolls eyes) Come on, people.Gratuitous, cartoonish, caricature of Chinese-Americans mean crappy parts for Asian American performers. Do owners of Chinese restaurants really wear GREEN NAILPOLISH, hello? And before jerking your knees and wailing that I'm being "PC", please consider that these stereotypes date back to the 1920s . In 2003, Disney of all studios, who made bank on Mulan (1998), and garnered plenty criticism for its use of racial stereotypes in Song of the South (1946), they definitely knew better, and apparently thought nobody would notice.Otherwise, it's a very watchable movie with some genuine LOL moments. Ryan cherub cheeks Malgarini should have gotten some kind of award for Freaky Friday...it takes some talent to steal scenes from Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. 7/10. They could have left that "Asian voodoo" crapola out and made it a 9. Two points for Tess' uncontrolled electronic gadgetry. Be sure to check out the "Freaky Bloopers" on the DVD. Very funny.</fullReview>

Till one night while at a chinesse restrauant a magical spell is cast on them both. Then the next day they both wake up in each other's body. Now they both have to find a way to dissolve the matter without ruining each other's lives. This movie is right up there with Lizzie McGwire.

		<shortDescription>Fine comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The young Lindsay Lohan and the older Jamie Lee Curtis have so much fun in 'Freaky Friday' that we are able to feel that and kind of have the same amount of fun. Like Lohan's 'Mean Girls' (2004) this film could have gone wrong many times but actually never does. It is funny, sometimes moving and teaches parents and teenagers things that they secretly already know. Of course it does things in an exaggerated way but a comedy needs laughs. That things are not annoyingly exaggerated is a big plus for 'Freaky Friday'.Lohan is Anna, a pretty nice teenage girl in a rockband. Her mother does not seem to understand her, or even listen to her, and she is always in a fight with her brother. She also like a guy named Jake (Chad Michael Murray). Sounds familiar. Jamie Lee Curtis is the mother, Tess, who is a therapist, occasionally tries to analyze her daughter, is about to get married with Ryan (Mar Harmon), three years after her first husband, father of Anna, died. Again, sounds pretty familiar. Anna and Tess get in an argument in a Chinese restaurant and the female owner wants to solve the problem; she gives them both a fortune cookie. The next morning Anna finds herself in Tess's body and vice versa. This can only be solved when they understand each other and act selfless.So now Tess in Anna's body has to go to high school, slowly learning that her daughter never really lied. Anna in Tess's body has to work as a therapist, prepare a wedding and slowly she finds out that her mother has a lot going on but means well with especially her children. Of course we already know they will discover things like this, it is how 'Freaky Friday' handles it that makes this film so much fun. The exaggerated things are not in events they will find themselves in, which a lesser film would probably try, but only in the lessons it wants to give.For example it wants to tell that real beauty is in the inside. The exaggeration is that the Jake character falls in love with Anna, but in the time she is in the body of Tess. This seems a little exaggerated, but the situations that bring Jake and the body of Tess together are not implausible at all. Therefore it is easier to take the 'lesson' situation for granted. Besides, the film is simply funny. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan play each other perfectly, we never get mixed up, making us smile in almost every scene. When actors have so much fun with characters it is hard not to like the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>highflying remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Freaky Friday' is a fun, high-spirited remake of the 1976 film of the same name, which served as ground zero for the body-switch movie craze of the 1980's.Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Loman are terrific as the mother and daughter who don't see eye-to-eye on too many things, least of all how the other should be living her life. But when a freak `accident' befalls them, causing each of them to wind up in the other's body, both are forced to see things from the other person's perspective. This sort of one-joke setup could easily have resulted in a mechanical, manufactured comedy, but writers Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon, along with director Mark Waters, have decided to have some real fun with the premise by devising clever scenarios that bend the mind a little and by building a surprising amount of depth into the two lead characters. We learn quite a bit about how each generation views the other in the course of all the highflying antics.This film is a real tour de force for the two actresses, especially Curtis, who never falters for a moment in her characterization of a bratty teenager trapped in a middle-aged woman's body. Loman has the less challenging ? and less fun ? job of portraying her opposite number, but she still delivers a performance of tremendous charm and substance. `Freaky Friday' may not be original, but it provides more laugh-out-loud moments than virtually any comedy released in 2003.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jamie Lee Curtis and her teenage daughter (Lindsay Lohan) swap bodies as a result of an earthquake and a bit of Chinese ?voodoo'. The first half of the film has the audience smirking as the two women just about rise to the challenge of acting each other's personalities, but the real boost is when they reach an ?understanding' of each other through the body swap and the psychological implications kick home. Simple, but a notch above the average Hollywood comedy and brilliant performances by Curtis and not least by the 17yr old Lohan - who performs brilliantly as a rock chick daughter, really singing in her own kick-ass punk rock group.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acceptable family romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freckly cutie pie Lindsay Lohan strikes again in yet another remake of a much beloved Disney film! Only instead of two adorable twins, she plays both the angry young teen and her mother. Confusing? Let me explain.The plot: Jamie Lee Curtis (her character's name is Tess Coleman, for the record) is an overworked psychiatrist and Lindsay Lohan (character's name: Anna Coleman) is her angst ridden (and I do mean ANGST RIDDEN) teenaged daughter who continually gets into trouble and dreams of rock and foll fame. Curtis and Lohan don't really understand each other, therefore they don't appreciate each other. And with Curtis about to marry for the second time, this time to Mark Harmon, Lohan is more of a pain to her than usual (granted, her little brother doesn't help matters at all). Then an old Chinese woman gives them two fortune cookies that switch them so that Curtis is stuck in Lohan's body and Lohan is stuck in Curtis's body, and the only way out is if they do something nice for each other.Although Curtis seems to be having a good time going over the top as an angry teen stuck in her mother's body, there's something sad about watching the former Scream Queen play an over the top angry teen caricature stuck in her mother's body. But I'm guessing the daughter was made over the top (I've known my share of teen girls and most of them were not that angry) in order to provide as much difference in characterization for the two actresses as possible. Then again, at 45 it must be hard for Curtis to get good parts in good films, so she probably decided to do this one as kind of a lark.Lindsay Lohan (who provides a song for the soundtrack) is a bit much to take at first when she's being Anna, but when she starts playing her mother trapped in her body and starts playing it like she really is an adult, she's actually quite engaging and endearing, and possibly more effective. Lindsay also shows signs of blossoming into a very beautiful young lady so here's hoping we see more of her in the future (loved her in that sharp black dress).The humor here is predictable: pierced navels, disputes over wardrobe, modern music being "noise", and other mistaken identity cliches come up, but what do you expect from a film about body switching. Still, some of it is very fun to watch. Lohan's reaction to her brother's bad behavior and her reaction to being told to mimic Keith Richards are priceless, and Curtis has a few good cynical remarks.On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this a 7 1/2. Nothing special but enjoyable none the less.</fullReview>

Then, through a magic fortune cookie (don't ask), they switch personalities and discover each others problems and complications.Disney remaking another one of its older movies. I never saw the original so I can't say which one is better. On its own, this one is pretty OK. It's colorful and pleasant to look at and Lohan plays a teenage girl to perfection. Also Ryan Malgarini is right on target as her annoying little brother. But the script just isn't there.It's amusing--but that's about it. It was never hilarious or particularly inspired (all the jokes are pretty predictable). Lohan was very good acting like she has Curtis' personality in her body...but Curtis steals the show. She plays a teenage girl trapped in a woman's body to perfection--she's very clearly enjoying herself and it rubs off on the audience. It's just that the script lets her down. Also Mark Harmon and Harold Gould are pretty bad in their roles.So it's worth seeing for Curtis and some bright, eye-catching photography. Otherwise it's just so-so. Teenage girls might get a big kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FREAKY FRIDAY (2003) *** Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan, Mark Harmon, Harold Gould, Chad Murray, Christina Vidal, Ryan Malgarini, Stephen Tobolowsky, Willie Garson, Haley Hudson, Rosalind Chow, Lucille Soong, Dina Spybey, Julie Gonzalo, Marc McClure. Pretty decent remake of the Jodie Foster/Barbara Harris Disney comedy farce in which a quarrelsome daughter and mother undergo a mystical act of exchanging one another's identities into each other's bodies with wackiness ensuing.Smartly the screenwriters Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon eschew the slapstick for more nuanced character development and situational outcomes instead with Curtis and Lohan as the mom and teen who are at odds with each other and find themselves as themselves after some 'Chinese voodoo' occurs with a a fateful fortune cookie. Frequently funny and surprisingly touching family fare with inspired physical comedy by the lead actresses (Curtis gives the third best embodied-by-another turn next to Tom Hanks in 'Big' and Steve Martin in 'All of Me'; she clearly should be doing more comedies!) Director Mark S. Waters smartly lets his lady leads flex their comic skills to full-tilt family fare. One of the year's pleasant surprises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the Lindsay Lohan version, not the Jodie Foster version which I haven't seen in about 10 years. I was in the mood for a light movie when I watched this, I also enjoyed the original movie. Furthermore I had never seen a Lindsay Lohan film so I was interested to see what all the fuss was about. The film was actually very entertaining. Lohan could have been any teen but she still held my interest. It was amusing to see Jamie Lee Curtis paying herself out ("I look like the crypt keeper"). This was pretty predictable really, they both learnt a lesson that it is hard to be a teenager/middle-aged woman and that they love each other very much. However, the journey was entertaining nonetheless. Lohan of course was in a band in the film to remind us that she is a singer too. Ah the crossover artist. Very much a throwaway film but good if you are in the mood for something of that sort. Nice family fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies of which you immediately know, from the beginning on, how it's going to end. Still the movies is nicely made and the ending is build up well towards the predictable and sappy but yet suitable ending.Basically this is nicely made teenage-no-worries comedy, with a totally ridicules and not even original story but with a warm feeling and characters. What makes the movie better than most other movies from the genre is that this movie features Jamie Lee Curtis. She was the highlight of the movie and acts truly superb as teenage girl in a grown-up body. She rightfully received a Golden Globe nomination for her role in this movie. I probably will never become a Lindsay Lohan fan but so be it...she does her job well and acts like a true professional on the job. The movie is filled with some fun other characters that probably are better and more interesting than the two main characters.The movie works well, as a light hearted comedy and has some fun moments in it. It's not really a movie that makes you laugh out loud but it is a movie that makes you feel good and happy.Probably best recommendable if you are a teenage-girl but everyone else should also still be able to appreciate this formulaic but nicely made movie, as I did as well.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Freaky Friday', other than having one preposterous can't-get-past-it flaw, is a fairly enjoyable film. Compared to most teenage angst flicks (and what could be more horrifying to a teenager than being a grown-up?) we have a veritable winner, actually. Terrific acting, some great lines, good looking stars, decent music, what's not to like? Well, let's talk about that flaw.Any movie operating under the premise of magic is tainted, nay contemptuous. This is the cop-out of the artist, be it writing or celluloid. The message: we can think of no other way to get ourselves out of the corner we've been painted into, so let's contrive a trick to change the situation. So the 'Lord of the Rings' malarkey and Harry Potter connections are guilty by association, and cannot be great films. Magic is boring. You've never seen it and neither have we; imagination requires the use of tangible, or at least scientifically reasonable, platforms for all that has been and will be, period. So why is 'Freaky Friday' acceptable? Simply because of the simplicity of the situation; teen/parent conflict is funny in any time and in any place. Restated, we can identify with all elements of this film, current context going a long ways toward grounding us, even allowing some latitude in the how two people are able to swap identities.And that is indeed what happens as Jamie Lee Curtis (as Dr. Tess Coleman) and Lindsay Lohan (as her daughter Anna) have a spell cast upon them in a Chinese restaurant. What ensues is that each must carry out some semblance of normalcy in their, and others, lives. Thus the teenage band member must appear to be just that whereas the professional adult and mother needs to comport herself in kind.The choice of Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect (Annette Benning apparently turned down the role). Curtis has the comedic energy to pull this off. In her own words, 'Clearly I am of the emotional variety of the immature teenage girl versus the adult?' And director Mark Waters (credits include 'Head Over Heels' and 'Mean Girls' - more importantly he had a hand in the phenomenal 'Requiem for a Dream') does do a great job of capturing the inherent zaniness of the entire cast. But Lindsay Lohan is the real up-and-comer here.Lohan has had some very successful films, including this one and 'The Parent Trap' (1998), enabling her to land no less than four projects for 2005. 'Fashionistas', 'Gossip Girl', 'Dramarama' and 'Herbie: Fully Loaded' have been announced or are in pre-production. Her winningly pleasant demeanor makes her one to watch; if teen movies must be made, they may as well have the laughs and hipness that should be a requisite of the type. And in this case ticket sales do reflect at least in part overall quality; teens will not flock to films of the genre that are not contemporarily on target - at least not after more than one weekend. Rating: 2-1/2 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, this movie is just oh so cute and yes Jamie Lee Curtis is getting interviewed on all of the talk shows and yes we are so happy that she now has her life back together and yes we are happy she is content with her 44 year old body, yes, yes, yes! And yes, this is a sloppy remake that with a little effort could have offered so much more. Lindsay Lohan ("Parent Trap" remake) holds her own, but needs to be careful of her next couple of projects or she will never be taken seriously as an actress. Ms. Curtis is flat out over the top in almost every scene. She seems hopped up on whatever it is she is taking these days to be so happy in real life. Mark Harmon is given nothing to work with other than a few arched eyebrows here and there. What guy wouldn't have sat her down and said "I am NOT marrying you unless you tell me what is going on"? Veteran actor Harold Gould receives the cruelest treatment and the old grandpa that we must put up with. The great Stephen Tobolowsky has a couple of nice moments with venom in his delivery, but is mostly wasted. Chad Murry ("Dawson's Creek" and "Gilmore Girls") is the high school stud of attention. The scenes between he and Ms. Curtis are almost too painful to watch. Bottom line, a strong director would have demanded some script changes to make this movie relevant to today rather than some 70's schlop remake. Go see "Seabiscuit" and "Pirates of the Caribbean" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful Comedy About Respect and Tolerance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a stressed and busy widow psychiatrist, who is close to her marriage with her fiancé Ryan (Mark Hammon). She has a fifteen years old daughter, Anna Coleman (Lindsay Lohan), and a son, the boy Harry Coleman (Ryan Malgarini). Tess and her teenager daughter have problems in their relationship and they do not understand each other. Anna plays guitar in a garage band and is very informal, while her mother hates rock-and-roll and is very conservative. In a Thursday's noon, the family goes to a Chinese restaurant for lunching, and Tess and Anna have a serious altercation. The old Chinese lady (Lucille Soong), owner of the restaurant, gives them two Chinese fortune cookies with the same message. At midnight, their souls change bodies, and when they wake up on Friday's morning, they have to pretend being the other, and they begin to understand each other's problems. This movie was a great surprise for me. I thought it would be another imbecile teenager movie, because of the Brazilian title. When I saw IMDb User Rating, I decided to take a chance and see "Freaky Friday". I found a delightful tale of respect and tolerance, with a great moral in the end, and I loved it. I laughed a lot with the funny situations, and in the end I felt myself lighten. Jamie Lee Curtis certainly is one of the best comedians in Hollywood and is perfect in the role of Dr. Tess Coleman. I was also very impressed with the beauty of Lindsay Lohan, the gorgeous actress who plays the twin sisters in "Parent Trap". The chemistry between Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan is amazing. The soundtrack is spectacular, beginning with "The Turtles", and ending with a great rock sang by Lindsay Lohan herself. This feel-good family entertainment movie is highly recommended for any audience. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): " Sexta-Feira Muito Louca" ("Very Crazy Friday")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Vice Versa" meets "Big" meets "Like Father, Like Son" meets "The Hot Chick" meets "18 Again" meets "Freaky Friday" (1976) meets "Freaky Frida</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The teenage years are hard. Countless films have been made about that era in every person's life, including this year's controversial "13." And the biggest surprise may be the way Disney handles the subject in "Freaky Friday," not toning down premises as they have before, but rather allowing all to flow freely and still making it a clean, moralistic family film.Oh, and adulthood is hard, too."Freaky Friday" was originally released in 1976. The film starred Jodie Foster, and was never exactly the Disney family classic it meant to be (obviously copying "The Parent Trap's" style). It spawned a lot of copies, including a made-for-TV remake in 1995 with Shelley Long, not to mention a string of late-80s films, such as "Like Father, Like Son"; "18 Again"; and "Vice Versa." All were different variations on the basic premise of adults switching places with their offspring or younger relations, and the two then coming to appreciate their differences.Now the formula is seeing a steady increase in popularity once again. 2002's "The Hot Chick" (one of the worst of that year) was about a teenage girl who swapped places with a petty criminal. Now Disney is cashing in on something they made some 20 odd years ago, and no one -- myself included -- expected the film to be any good. Surprise, surprise.Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a widowed psychiatrist with two kids, including Anna (Lindsay Lohan), a 15-year-old highschooler with aspirations of punk rock status -- she and her friends get together in the garage of her house and "jam." (I play guitar and, for the first time since "Back to the Future," it looks as if the filmmakers put some effort to make the guitar players look like they are really playing the darn thing)."You're ruining my life!" Anna constantly yells. Tess' engaged boyfriend, Ryan (Mark Harmon), isn't sure what's going on between the two, but his attempts at being nice to the kids often backfires. (After Tess removes Anna's bedroom door due to low grades, Harmon tells Anna that it's under the staircase in an effort to make peace with her. "Like I didn't figure that out already," she says.)When mother and daughter visit a Chinese restaurant and eat some magical fortune cookies, they wake up the next day as always -- expect they're in each other's bodies. And so here come the jokes. One bets that they can make it in school, the other at work. Tess, in Anna's body, acts like a mature adult. Meanwhile, Anna, in Tess' body, acts like a teenager -- she even gets a makeover.But there're problems. There's a wedding and a rock band audition, and since they're in each other's bodies, it presents a major dilemma. But if they want to switch back before their big days, then they'll have to learn to appreciate each other's differences.What a delightful little family film this is! Sweet, gentle, funny, and just plain enjoyable. It doesn't try to be anything it isn't, and in the process becomes a lot more. It has streaks of "Big" and "Vice Versa." I've always enjoyed "Vice Versa" the most out of the many, many body-switching 80s films released simultaneously, and now I've found another worthy addition to the genre.Annette Bening was originally cast as Tess Coleman, but then Jamie Lee Curtis stepped in. And I'm glad she did. I'm not a very big fan of Curtis, but she can occasionally be quite surprising, and this is one of those cases. Meanwhile, Lindsay Lohan, the little girl from 1998's remake of "The Parent Trap," evokes the same great method of adult channeling as little Fred Savage did in "Vice Versa." As many of my readers probably know, my main problem with "Big" is that Tom Hanks did not act like a 13-year-old, but rather like a 6-year-old. Lohan successfully acts like both an irritating teenager and a mature adult. The two gals' performances really make the movie.This is one of the most enjoyable treats of the year. Kids will get a kick out of it, and so will parents, and that is precisely the definition of great family filmmaking -- because, let's face it, Disney lost sight of that a few years ago. Looks like they're finally getting back on their feet after a long dry spot.4/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest movie I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all starts off with a mother (Jamie Lee Curtis) and a daughter (Lindsay Lohan) who have nothing in common. Anna likes loud rock music and is in a rock band. Her mother is a psychologist who has lots of cell phones and pagers that go off all the time. One day, they go to a Chinese restruant. They receive a fortune cookie with a message that says:A journey soon begins, it's prize reflected in another's eyes. What you see is what you lack then selfless love will change you back.There is an earthquake! Then that night, something just freaky happens...They switched bodies! Now all the freaky fun begins. Anna has an audition, and her mom Tess has a wedding rehearsal! Talk about Freaky. What I like about this movie is it's a funny comedy, but a happy story. I like all the funny quotes such as: "It's easy to be you, I'll just suck the fun out of everything." "I do not suck the fun out of everything." "Fun sucker.""Yo. $10,000 dollars? For what? Halibut eeew! No I'm not gonna pay for it. Fine don't show up see if I care. Yeah well same to you dude."Your family looking for a "freaky movie?" Try this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The members of family need communication of each other. Otherwise, parent doesn??t know what children??s thought and need. Children also need to understand their parents. It is important to communication with each other.Freaky Friday is a good family movie about a mother and a daughter. I like this film. The music is also wonderful. I like it very much. The story is about the conflicting relationship between Dr.Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her daughter Anna Coleman (Lindsay Lohan). They were lack of communication with each other. When they were in other??s body, they began to understand each other because they had to face their new life temporarily. Lindsay Lohan, who also starred another Disney remake, The Parent Trap, does a very good job in the role of Anna Coleman and shows that she is really maturing in her style of acting. In this movie, she shows not only her acting talent, but also her singing talent. Looking forward to her better performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It didn't suck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'It didn't suck' is generally the appraisal I give to a film that I expected to hate, but in reality, didn't exactly like, but didn't feel like committing mass murder after seeing it. 'Freaky Friday', directed by Mark S. Waters is one of those films. I actually happen to be a fan of the original film, but while Lindsey Lohan (the ingénue in this version) can't even compare to the great Jodie Foster, her acting wasn't as terrible as it could have been, and the film was bolstered by a fine acting job by Jamie Lee Curtis as her mother. The whole 'switched identity' thing isn't anything new; in fact, it has been virtually run into the ground, but as light-hearted fare with a decent moral lesson, 'Freaky Friday', while not being fine art by any stretch of the imagination is a passable film. I'm certainly not going to rush to see this film again in the next twenty years, but it was fine for what it was meant to be ? a mindless and harmless family comedy.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another remake, with Disney milking an old Jodie Foster vehicle for some adolescent bucks at the boxoffice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could do worse than this Disney rehash of one of their better older movies. It's well cast and relative in quality to a good TV sitcom, but hardly worth investing in for a night out at the movies. It's no better than the Jodie Foster/Barbara Harris original, and more of a reflection of the lack of imagination now permeating Micheal Eisner's Disney Corporation. Curtis is a talented comedienne, and should be seen more often, but Lohan and the younger players are perky and cute in the worse sense of the word. The teenage episodes are annoying and dim, and there's a dreadful rock-band premise to bring the whole thing to a screeching halt. Unnerving, but good for an adolescent laugh or two.</fullReview>

He was so patient with Jamie Lee Curtis when Jamie Lee became a kid again.Jake was kind of annoying. I didn't like the way Jake kept showing up in every scene.

		<fullReview>A fastidious, overworked mother and her alienated teenage daughter don't exactly see eye to eye. Not only that, but they're locked in bitter dispute and both feel that one has it much easier than the other. One ordinary Friday morning, they magically switch bodies and have to adapt to living each other's lifestyles despite their obvious differences. Another case of a film taking a familiar formula and making it worthwhile, as the film boasts a sweet, meaningful central theme and consistent laughs. Film's greatest virtue is without a doubt the likable performances of its two charming leads, Curtis wildly over-the-top, Lohan poised and grounded. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent modernized remake of an old Disney classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the HORRID Made for TV remake of Freaky Friday starring (get this) Shelly Long (!?!?), I had believed we had just about seen the end of Disney's Family Films. Let's face it, they lost sight of the target years ago, and even their animations are getting worse and worse, except for a few. The sequels to these animations are about the worst things I've ever seen, of late, with no attention whatsoever to detail, or scenery, background, or character development.When this movie was originally made, it was with Jodie Foster as the daughter, and while it was a fun Disney Family Film, it lacked something. Having been made following the formula of "The Parent Trap," you would think it would have fared better, but honestly, Freaky Friday just was not that kind of movie.In this endeavor, they actually pulled it off. It is difficult being a teenager these days. It is nothing like it was when we were young and in school. There is so much pressure now, whereas before, it was much easier to get through the school years. But it is also more difficult being an adult. Every moment of our time is spent and accounted for, scheduled and planned and even the simplest mishap can throw off the entire day, and thereby affect the next and the next. All this is captured without spoiling the fun of the film.I found Jamie Lee Curtis to be delightful. I have never seen a single portrayal by this consummate actress that I did not enjoy, and this film is no exception. I found Lindsay Lohan to be an absolute joy, and look forward to her upcoming 3 movies.Regardless of the many movies of this type to spring up in the last decade or so (Dream a Little Dream, Hot Chick, Like Father Like Son, and so on), Disney was the first (and only) company to get it right. I adore this remake and will add it straight into my very selective Disney collection.It rates a 7.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Question: What do James T. Kirk, Dudley Moore, Buffy Summers, George Burns and Dick Dastardly have in common?Answer: They've all spent time in someone else's body.You can probably guess that "Freaky Friday" isn't operating from the most original of premises (especially since this is the third time the House of Mouse has filmed the Mary Rodgers novel), and you can also guess what happens next when you learn the bare bones - mother Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) both think the other's life is a lot easier than their own, and when circumstances lead them to switch bodies they learn more about each other, etc., etc... so it isn't what happens as how it happens that makes or breaks the movie.Happily, director Mark Waters and writers Heather Hoch and Leslie Dixon have Curtis and Lohan in their corner; the two are so believable as mother and daughter, and vice versa, that they paper over most of the cracks in the storyline and also seem to be having a total ball to boot - especially Curtis - and the fun spills out to the audience. It's all pretty predictable stuff, with few if any surprises, but it's genuinely warm-hearted throughout without overdoing its family messages, and the leads and supporting cast (especially Stephen Tobolowsky as Anna's teacher and Harold Gould as her grandfather) put it over. Even Mark Harmon is at his best since "Reasonable Doubts."With the likes of Simple Plan and Ashlee Simpson on the soundtrack and its contemporary references to the likes of the White Stripes and Wango Tango (a real event, for non-Americans), most of the trappings of "Freaky Friday" 3.0 will be as dated in 2030 as the first movie's do now - it's doubtful that Anna would have been playing guitar in a predominantly female rock band in a Disney movie had this been in the '70s, alas - but that's in the future, this is now; and anyway, it's not supposed to be a historical document. It's supposed to be a family movie that's several cuts above average, and it is; is that really such a bad thing? Plus this is a Disney family movie that at least seems like a MOVIE instead of a big-screen TV show, which is definitely not a bad thing."I look like Stevie Nicks." "Who's he?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Freaky Friday (2003)Freaky Friday was a great comedy about Tess Coleman and her daughter, Anna. Anna is convinced that her mom is ruining her life, but when they magically switch bodies they learn a little bit more about each other in the other's perspective. This movie had some good acting, a fun story (remade from Freaky Friday, both 1984 and 1995 versions), and had lots of fun scenes. I give Freaky Friday a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When do you become an adult? Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie had the potential to show both the beauties of youth and age, and demonstrate the struggle every person has making the transition from child to adult, it ended up completely missing the point.Basically the movie centered around Mom (Jamie Lee Curtis) not understanding daughter (Lindsay Lohan). There is a scene where daughter tells Mom something to the affect "You could never be a teenager, you could never be me," when in reality every mother has done that. Every mother was once a teenager. Just try finding a Mom who never suffered from the pressures caused by test-taking, boyfriends, or catty girls.The movie would have been much more interesting had it focused on the daughter taking on her Mother's responsibilities and becoming more adult in the process. Instead she goofed off in her Mother's body, enjoying the freedom of age with out the responsibility, which made for some jokes but not any real quality.This movie is fine for laughs, but the over all message was not one worth remembering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let this movie fool you into watching! I had the opportunity to see this in the theaters with my old bf and, at the time, really really wanted to see this movie. it held some sort of potential that had me hooked for a minute or two. but after the movie starts, and used all that i did see on tv, i was bored. me and the boyfriend fell asleep and was awoken by the credits at the end. i paid 7.50 to sleep on a rather uncomfortable chair and heard crummy music and tacky lovey dovey lines that put us to sleep. as always, i was astonished how the movie got such hype that makes us go and waste an hour that we cant get back. the movie was better with the original, much much better. jamie lee curtis had a hard time acting as a punky teen, who wants to start a band and be a rebel. growing up in upper middle class must have been very hard on her. i feel her pain. (rolling eyes) but i guess that the guy that played lindsay's interest was a cutie patootie, in the words of rosie o'donnell. and that was all. what is with the movies that feel that they can get away with using a new coming actor bursting with attractiveness to cover up the crummy storyline?

		<fullReview>Let's just get this out of the way. I do not like Lindsay Lohan. I think that, when it comes to singing or acting, she has no talent. The worst thing is, every movie she plays in seems to suck. Including this one. Freaky Friday is about a self-centered teenager played by, who else, Lindsay Lohan. The story is Lindsay and her mom continually has arguments. One day a woman in a Chinese restaurant sees them arguing. So, how does she fix it? She gives them magic fortune cookies that switch their bodies.The sad thing is, this movie had promise. The plot of mother and daughter switching bodies is open for some very funny moments. I was wrong, there are about no funny parts in this movie. Not even memorable ones. Nothing more than solid boring stupidity for 90 minutes, give or take. In fact, this movie is so pointless, I've probably made the review for it far too long. I'll end it now. I give this waste of time two fortune cookies out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to imagine why they felt they need to do it, but this is a remake of a Disney film done in the 70s, and adapted after an seemingly successful book. I admit not to be a fan of the so-called family films, and I am among these who think that Disney should have stayed in the cartoon business. 'Freaky Friday' has nothing special to make me change my mind. The gag of the body exchange between different ages characters was already used several times, and all is much too expected in this film where Jaime Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan exchange their mother and daughter bodies for one long day (for the viewers). The generations conflict is reduced to a boring clichee, and the real comic situations (there are a few) are lost in a too much predictable and moralistic story line. Jodie Foster played the daughter (well, daughter body) in the original film, but Lindsay Lohan is no Jodie Foster and she is quite stiff and boring in this film. Jaime Lee Curtis seems to have most of the fun in the body-of-the-mother role, but the Disney norms prevents her to develop the character in what could have been a juicy performance. The rest of the cast is not above the average TV comedy stuff, and so is the whole movie. 6/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, here's the rundown. My 12 year old daughter loved the movie. I did not. I guess that's okay, since it was geared for the younger crowd anyhow. Jamie Lee Curtis does a pretty good job acting as a teenager, her performance was nearly believable. There is some comedy here, however with all the other "switching bodies" movies that have been made, it is all old hat, and it lacks originality. I would imagine that since the young crowd probably hasn't seen all those 80's films that had this same plot, they would find this movie enjoyable.The thing I find most memorable about this movie is something I should never have seen in the first place. Microphones!!!!! It seems that in every other scene, a boom microphone finds its way into the picture. At first I found this funny, but after the first half dozen times or so, it became very annoying and almost painful to watch. It was impossible to imagine the characters being a real family in a real situation, when you see a big michrophone come out of nowhere and nearly bop them in the head. It was very obvious that the members of the "rock band" were not reaaly playing the instruments, but that is to be expected-however they could have done better with it than they did. But the microphones were impossible to ignore, and I'm surprised I haven't read about it here already. I'm not sure who you would blame for this, the boom operator, the camera operator, the director, or the post production crew, but thhe production of this film is not the quality I would expect from Disney. I would expect that many of those who worked on the production of this film may not work again, and will probably not put this on their resume. YEECHHHH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, atypical teenage bodyswapping movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been lots of movies and tv shows that have dealt with the story of two people swapping bodies. Cartoons have frankly in my opinion dealt with the story better than any movie. You know Disney is desperate when they can't even come up with a fresh idea for a film. The idea of two people swapping bodies is so cliched that it makes me sick to think about it. Jamie Lee Curtis dresses up like a stupid punk with no taste, then of course, she switches bodies with her daughter, but I kid of course. Jamie and her daughter do very stupid-ass things to try and get back into their own bodies, such as body slamming each other... ha ha. And the little boy looks on and his facial expressions are supposed to pass as comedy... ha ha ha. Nothing in this damn, worthless, putrid, vile, pathetic film passes for anything remotely resembling comedy. Quite possibly because hiring REAL writers would have blown the budget since Disney is now having to settle lawsuits with poor people who get injured or killed in their deathtrap theme parks. Disney of course like I said earlier is too stupid and too dependent on stale, better movies to try and use them as a basis for their newer, crappier movies. In all honesty, "Freaky Friday" sucks the big one! Jamie Curtis has just sold out entirely because like Disney, she is a greedy idiot who will do anything to try and satisfy a lackwit humorless public.</fullReview>
