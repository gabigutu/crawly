		<shortDescription>Barbara Harris is da bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the remake with Curtis and Lohan was good and Hollywood smooth with better production values (so what), the main difference is in the lead actors. I mean you know Jodie Foster can act circles around Lindsay Lohan (who couldn't) but the main difference is in the moms. Jaime Lee Curtis is a savvy pro who has her own take on the role but it's pretty flat in comparison. Barbara Harris I didn't remember from her small roles in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and Peggy Sue Got Married but now that my memory has been jogged, she did a fine job. This movie, though, is her tour-de-force. What a fantastic performance. She is flawless and incredibly funny in this role. As fine a comedic turn as anyone has ever done; the nuances of voice, the facial expressions, the slapstick - all spot on.Jodie Foster is no slouch either. Her teenage roles have showed maturity beyond her years and a thorough understanding of her roles. She shines in this one. The supporting cast is well chosen and they're all good too.I can see why they remade it, though. Todays kids don't usually get into old movies so with a box office cinch like Lohan, why not? I like a lot of the 60's and 70's movies since that is my generation and subsequently have trouble enjoying the 30's and 40's movies. But a good movie is a good movie no matter when it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, unlike the two so called remakes actually follows the book. My kids have all loved this movie and had no trouble at all relating to the incidents.Sure they have typing class instead of computer class but so what? So what if the Mom stays home and the Dad works. Many families do that today. The brother appears to be in half day kindergarten because he is picked up from school before lunch. Maybe Mom will go back to work next year. It may be a bit dated but that doesn't detract from the movie at all. Unlike many modern movies the kids are not smart mouthed brats who get away with such behavior. There are no gross jokes or rude, stupid humor. This is a fun movie for families, especially mothers and daughters to watch together. I would recommend this over the other two because it's how the author intended the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back when we were grown-ups.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is no secret, that, back when we were grown ups, Disney made films that were as delightful as the next Sidney Lumet film. "Freaky Friday" is one of those many films. When young Annabelle Andrews, and her mother Ellen Andrews switch bodies on Friday the 13th, one heck of a journey is on the rise! This great tale of learning and growing up has been mocked, or copied twice, in vain. There are many reasons why this film should have only been seen the way the company originally produced it. First off, the message is quite easy to figure, and keeping it simple, but meaningful was the great way to spread it. The age-old story of two people walking a mile in each others shoes. A funny mother-daughter story that never gets old, this one has just as much a tender side as it does a comic side.About the film, the script is fresh and original, producing interesting narration by a game Foster. What makes this one almost a word for word act of the novel is because the author of the novel also wrote the screenplay. Some times, when the author also helps with the script, the outcome is less than amusing, but in this case, it was the best thing they could do. Mary Rodgers delivers the goods with this one, and the rich element of comedy is never wasted. The situations are almost too much. The incidents are made in ways to which an adult can laugh as much as a child can. In fact, most of the funny moments reflect more adult humor, such as Mrs. Schmauss and the liquor. Other moments such as typewriters going crazy, and one of the most hysterical ski sequences ever seem to be too much for children in todays times. Ergo, they remade this film twice. Once in '95 that was slow and dull, despite a good director and good cameos. And recently in '03 with a forced script. The two latter versions were made with more simple jokes to appeal more for kids.Such subject matter was also toned down. The situation with Annabelle and Ben. Why does Annabelle hate him so much? Because there is nothing more annoying than a perfect kid with no messy qualities. Later, same question, but answer goes as "his sister doesn't "hate" him. he bugs her". What is wrong with the normal sibling rivalry using the word 'hate'? The film also shows how much better times were back then. As thirteen year-old teens were taught to be a whiz on the typewriter, and speak very well of American history. Those times are just not here anymore, not much anyhow. IN any case, this film is a great joy of a film. Modern film-making at it's best, and of course, Disney made films good back then. Not like the senseless contrived mush we see today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Funny Disney Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The teenager Annabel (Jodie Foster) has friction with her mother Mrs. Andrews (Barbara Harris) and her younger brother Ben. One Friday morning, the both wish to be the other for one day at the same time and their wishes come true and they swap bodies. Meanwhile, Mr. Andrews (John Astin), who is the PR of a company, is preparing a party to promote a real estate, and he counts on the support of his wife and daughter. Along the day, Annabel and Mrs. Andrews learn the problems of each other and understand the difficulties of the other. The original "Freaky Friday" is a very funny Disney movie even thirty-six years after its release. Barbara Harris steals the film and together with the teenager Jodie Foster, they are responsible for hilarious situations. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Se Eu Fosse a Minha M?e" ("If I Were My Mother")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney at it's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the very best of Disney's many comedies. Perhaps it's the great writing from Mary Rodgers, author of the book, or the spectacular acting from the entire cast, especially a young Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris.The film is incredibly funny, without being stupid, and it feels very real and authentic, an element that is gone from almost every other Disney film of the era. Although it includes the typical Disney chase scene, the rest of Disney's usual cliches are dropped so that the focus is on the characters and the believable and hilarious situations that they get into.A definite 10/10! Go rent it! Be sure that you get the 1977 version, though, not the 1995 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is truly one of a kind, and it disgusts me that remakes are the order of the evening with this one! As a young girl, (Foster) and her mother (Harris) are at the edge of their sanity together, the unthinkable happens!!! The switching of the minds into seperate bodies! "Id like to be you for a day" The opening song suggest, and they weren't kidding! With a terrific cast of main roles,(ie- Harris, Foster, and Astin) Not to mention an even more funny cast of co-stars! (ie-Marc McClure, Patsy Kelly, and Charlene Tilton) This film gets away with the most funny of jokes, involving washing machines, and cars, and cop chases! only the best films could do all this and still hold entertainment for adults and kids, and the fact that this film was remade 2 times in insulting to me! I did find Melanie Mayron's version humorous, it was not nessasary! Still, true classics prevail!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't 100% perfect, but it did entertain me. I will say I also enjoyed the 2003 remake as it was fresh and funny. That said, this is definitely worth seeing. It does start off very briskly, but it loses its way just towards the end, and one or two of the gags were lacking. That said, the script does have its humorous and touching parts, the film is nice to watch visually with nice cinematography, scenery and costumes, the music was nice and upbeat and the premise intrigued me. The direction was also assured, but what made the film was the two sterling lead performances of Barbara Harris and especially Jodie Foster as the mother and daughter who swap bodies for a day. The supporting performances while not as effervescent were also effective. Overall, I liked it, it wasn't perfect, but there are certainly worse movies out there. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodie was AMAZING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never particularly loved this movie but it is lifted above the usual Disney fare by Jodie Foster, who was just totally incredible in this. You watch her and she nails the part - her performances in her movies are always better than great but to have been this good as a kid is kinda spooky, she delivers her lines so well. She is just about one of the finest actresses working in movies today along with Meryl Streep. It is so rare for a child to be as mature in performance as Jodie was. I guess the nearest child star in terms of performance is Haley Joel Osment. I have seen the remake with LL and JC but they just do not make such a good job of the parts as Jodie and Barbara (who seems to have disappeared from the movie scene-curse of the older actress).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good family fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FREAKY FRIDAY was one of several vehicles Disney crafted for future star Jodie Foster, when the precocious teen actress was under that company's tutelage. Her adult demeanor serves her well, playing a thirteen year old inhabited by her mother's personality. The real joy in this slapsticky farce is Barbara Harris, whose brand of humor is gainfully employed as the irrepressible Annabelle, stuck in her mother's body. This and FAMILY PLOT are probably Harris' most readily available films. Too bad Harris didn't make more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At 8:15 am. one Friday the 13th.......................................................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freaky Friday brings us to the home of John Astin and Barbara Harris with their children Jodie Foster and Sparky Marcus. Harris and Foster are constantly fighting, Foster is going through teen angst saying Mom doesn't understand her, Harris's life is not being made easy by having her first child going through the teen years.But on a fateful day where legend has it strange things do occur, one morning as the family is starting their day, the souls of Harris and Foster exchange bodies. After a lot of yelling and screaming the two decide to live each other's day as their new outward appearance dictates.The responsibilities of adulthood thrown on Foster's shoulders just overwhelm her. As for Harris it's not easy being a teen. It all adds up to some pretty funny moments. Best being Foster/Harris making a botch of a field hockey match and Harris/Foster on water skis. I've always liked the way the Disney Studio always gave a lot of old time players the character roles that they used to get in the old days. In particular here is Patsy Kelly in one of her last appearances as a maid who liked a cocktail every now and then.Freaky Friday proved to be one of the Magic Kingdom's most popular products. The recent remake with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis was as fresh as the original, though that one offered some kind of explanation for the strange occurrence.This version just let the magic speak for itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun early performance from Jodie Foster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this film in the cinema over thirty years ago and I don't think I'd seen it since so when I saw it was going to be on television I thought it was time to watch it again; apart from the basic premise I couldn't remember much about it so wasn't sure what to expect. The plot is fairly simple; thirteen year old Annabel Andrews and her mother have an argument one Friday morning and start think about how the other one doesn't understand how hard their lives are compared the easy life they lead? the next thing that happens is the wish they could spend a day in the others body and suddenly that happens! Annabel is back home in her mother's body and Mrs Andrews is with Annabel's friends in her body. Inevitably each of them discovers that the other's life is much more difficult than they realised; they also learn a few facts about themselves along the way. Things get more stressful later in the day when Annabel's father asks her to supply a buffet for a business event when she can't cook? it could be worse though; his wife is going to have to put on a water-skiing display! At this point the two women wish they could be back in their own bodies; they get this but not quite how they wanted it.Watching this again I was surprised how much I enjoyed it; several moments were laugh out loud funny and the acting from leading ladies, Barbara Harris as the mother and Jodie Foster as Annabel was great; looking at this early performance it isn't that surprising that Jodie Foster went onto become one of the best actresses of her generation. The film isn't without its flaws; the worst being the special effects and green screen shot; they may have been passable in 1976 but they looked very dated now, thankfully there weren't too many such shots. As the film progresses towards the end it does get a bit silly but that doesn't matter as it was pretty funny; I'm sure these scenes will be the favourite for younger viewers. Being a Disney film there is nothing to offend and is suitable for viewers of all ages; a proper family film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goofy, but fun (now) period comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, only those who live under a rock have escaped seeing some type of movie that involves the switching of a child into an adult's body or vice versa. This was one of the earlier endeavors of the genre (which hit an especially prolific peak in 1988 and which resurfaced in the early 2000's.) Foster plays an athletically-inclined 13 year-old who dislikes her younger brother, can't keep her room clean, subsists on junk food and is the star player on her field hockey team. Harris is her mother, a domestic goddess who cooks, cleans and manages the home while longing for the freedom and lack of responsibility that youth entails. One momentous Friday (the 13th, which is really the only explanation given for the events!), the ladies wish that, for one day, they could be each other and, magically, they find themselves inhabiting the other's body! So Foster has the brain of Harris and confounds her giddy schoolmates with her newfound knowledge and attitude. Harris has the brain of Foster and can barely handle doing a load of laundry or face relatively simple tasks like writing a check or fixing breakfast. It happens that this is a big day for the women since Foster is meant to star in a water-skiing show as part of her father Astin's promotional gig and Harris is supposed to make food for 25 people! The film documents the struggles and calamities that befall these two as they walk in each others' shoes for the day. It all comes to a head at the marina when Harris/Foster is forced to drive a car and Foster/Harris is shoved onto the water in a pair of skis. The film is surprisingly low-key and charming in spots (until the ending) when compared to a lot of the loud, hyped-up and overdone comedies of today. Featuring an energetic and quirky performance by Harris and an assured and knowing one from Foster, it's an engaging and amusing piece of entertainment. Harris gives her role a lot, physically, as she embodies the habits and idiosyncrasies of a teen. On the flip side, Foster has to show restraint as she must display the mature personality of her mother. The movie has more than a few sitcom level gags and is obviously dated in many respects, but it retains a simple charm and an innocence that would never occur today. Astin comes off as rather sexist in his role as the breadwinner, but it's balanced with affection for his family. Impish Marcus is hilarious as Foster's diminutive kid brother whose cleanliness is counterpoint to her sloppiness. The film is littered with many familiar and welcome faces from TV and films. These solid supporting performers give the film a comfortable and nostalgic feel. The big chase at the end is corny and preposterous, but manages to entertain in spite of itself! The sight gags and general ridicularity of it all somehow still comes off as funny, partly due to the archaic special effects and the absence of computer generation. There's also some amusing 70's clothes and coiffures. Check out that hairdo that Foster winds up with near the end! Not much time is spent philosophizing. It's just a charming and silly romp with a few memorable moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Switching over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bright and breezy Disney comedy that works because of the performances by Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris. Teenage Annabel Andrews (Foster) switches bodies with her mother Ellen (Harris) on Friday the 13th.Annabel realises that managing a home is not easy with cooking, cleaning, managing various workmen, doing various chores. Ellen finds out that being a high school kid is no fun. She messes up at the typewriter class, causes chaos at the photography darkroom and the hockey game leaves her bruised.It is a case of understanding each other's lives. Foster does well as the grown up mom inhibits her body, likewise with Harris playing the teenager all at sea at being domesticated.It is all amiable and easygoing which the kids would like then the film steps up a gear with a crazy finish as Annabel gets involved in a batty police chase through the city and Ellen gets involved in a barmy ski sequence.Some of the roles might be too conservative for today's tastes. The mother being the dutiful housewife for example but this was Disney of the 1970s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodie Foster great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Annabel Andrews (Jodie Foster) is a teen slob, field hockey jock, academically challenged, and fighting with her mother (Barbara Harris). They both think the other has it easy. They both wish to switch places for just one day at the same time and that's exactly what happens. They both struggle with their day culminating in Annabel water-skiing in the Aquacad for her PR executive father Bill (John Astin).This classic Disney kids movie marks a transition year for child star Jodie Foster. It's the same year as Taxi Driver. She is great at transitioning from self-obsessed teen to a mature mom personality. Barbara Harris is little inconsistent. It doesn't help that a lot of the wife duties seem overly manufactured. Even as a kid, I thought the scene where she's overwhelmed by everybody at the house is too silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original 'Freaky Friday'; Funny even till this day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Freaky Friday', the original switcheroo movie. A mom and daughter getting their bodies exchanged (on Friday the 13th) is rife with possibilities, but considering this is a Disney production, it's a commendable adaptation. It's hilarious from beginning to end, especially because of the two talented leads, Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster, who assume each other's characters with terrific ease. Supporting actors like Marc McClure (Boris), Sparky Marcus (Ben) and John Astin (Bill) are noteworthy too.There are so many laugh-out-funny and memorable sequences in the film, from the sports scenes (baseball and hockey) to car chases to stunts (water-skiing), but my favourite scene is the one with the father's (Bill's) secretary - after listening to Annabel's comments, she keeps entering the office, making herself modest with each entrance; it's just unbearably rib-tickling."I wish I could switch places with her for just one day." - I wonder, how many people must have tried using this line.Even one likes, be sure to check out the 2003' updated adaptation as well; it's as hilarious and intriguing.</fullReview>

I thought this was cute and not bad. All of the fancy characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was good enough.

		<fullReview>This has got to be a top pick for original ideas ever put on film! The movie is very cute - quite comical - and very unique in film (or book) concepts.I've always wanted to do something like this in my life: trade places with someone - even my own mom!! What a great way to find out what the other is really going through everyday of their life. The film also shows as path to self-discovery in a way that is different.The self-discovery aspect of the movie is not quite obvious to some viewers - but it is there. What I mean is, if you really could trade places/bodies with someone like depicted in the film and you find out what the other is going through you will also start to question your own actions and beliefs before the body trade took place (self-discovery)! Example: "Ah now I understand what my mom was saying about this and I acted this way about it - now I have discovered a new way of viewing the situation because I understand my mom's point of view now that I have to be her!" The film also shows how sometimes we think we want to be so-n-so and if you live their life you may not want to be that person at all! Learn to at least like who you are and change what you don't like about yourself instead of wishing you could be someone else.Yes there is actually some pretty good life lessons in this film if you pay close attention to it - while enjoying the comedy in it! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God It's Freaky Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster make Freaky Friday very good wholesome family fun. Foster and Harris are the whole entertaining show. I really love Freaky Friday as it's so plainly enjoyable. Annabel is one of Foster's many great roles. Preteen Jodie is terrific as Annabel. Young Foster is so good as Annabel, she darn near makes Freaky Friday more than just a free flowing comedy by craftily emplacing dramatic depth through her characterization. Freaky Friday takes on a higher meaning than its fun and simply good story. There's no discernible plot and it's a good thing! It shows sort as a series of kind moments, I really appreciate it for that. Barbara Harris is excellent as Mrs. Andrews. She really nails the feel of the movie with her performance. Barbara Harris IS soooo gorgeous. Freaky Friday has an easily enjoyable premise. The mother becoming the daughter and going back to school and the daughter becoming the mother and going off to work is a great movie formula. The Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan Freaky Friday isn't nearly as good as this one, but I still like that one too. This movie is massively popular. Freaky Friday is beyond great, its greatness isn't restrained by its technical rating. Freaky Friday is a friendly, fun, fine film.</fullReview>

She and and mother seem argue a lot and they both seem to watch swap places with each other and this happens at the same but in not in same room. I wasn't keen with the effect of switch, it did bother me a little but got over cause rest of the movie was hoot, out of 3 freaky Friday movies this one had me laughing the most. I didn't really find first half hour of movie funny but when the switch happens and movies keeps you laughing at every turn and some of jokes are really silly at times but those are mainly for kids not saying adult won't like, there a plenty of good jokes for the whole family to enjoy.

		<fullReview>Parents and children are usually at odds in matters of responsibility and what is expected of them. Parents do not have it easy because there are times when they feel they want to step back from their stressed lives in exchange for what they perceive is an easy life their children are living. In turn, children would change places with a parent in that it would give them the freedom to do things their elders are denying them.Basically, that is the premise for this Walt Disney film that is based on the Mary Rodgers novel. Directed by Gary Nelson, the 1976 film pales in comparison to the much better revision of 2003 directed by Marc Waters resulting in a much entertaining film. The problem for this film lays in the fact it is not as funny as the much superior remake that came out almost thirty years later.The only thing going in this version is the wonderful performance by Barbara Harris, an actress that has not been seen much lately, but who always delivered either in her stage work, or in films. It is our loss. Ms. Harris is equally matched by Jodie Foster as the grown up trapped in a young body. John Astin, the wonderful Patsy Kelly playing a housekeeper from hell, Kay Ballard and Ruth Buzzi do their best to save the comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First And The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the original 'Freaky Friday' without a doubt proves that remakes are often botch jobs and pointless. for one thing, if you think the original material is good, why believe in all this so-called improvement.people who never get the original 'Friday' versus the remake, never understand the fundamental reasons for why the original is superior. first of all, the original is not only more like the book, it's a really dumb idea to make Annabel a seventeen year old like Lohan rather than a thirteen year old kid. hello. the role is written for a kid and not a older teen ager. the thought of a older, more mature seventeen year old acting like a spoiled young kid that doesn't understand adults is moronic. if you are seventeen and don't know something of what your parents are going through then you are developmentally challenged and need help. to make the character of Annabel as older defeats the whole message of the story. if you aren't somewhat mature by seventeen you need therapy. the story simply makes more sense when it's about a kid rather than a young adult.not to mention that Barbra Harris and Jodie Foster give much better performances than the slow witted, uninspired pseudo-nuttiness of Curtis and Lohan in the remake. the dialogue is also better and funnier in the original and lacks the pretentious restraint of the remake.a lot of people are often critical of the usual Disney "Donald Duck", cartoonish, final scenes in the original. the typical Disney "Donald Duck" slapstick endings can seem fairly routine in older Disney films, but hey, it was their signature trait, and it did help to identify them more as children's films than their contemporary counterparts that attempt to appeal to a more mature audience. besides, a lot of the goofy slapstick in the original film is hilarious. especially the scenes where they p-off the cops.some parents today might be a little put off by the fact that the mother smokes a cigarette and the house keeper accuses Annabel of smoking dope, these were unusual references for a Disney film of that time period, but the film actually takes a anti-smoking stance and the dope reference is made disapprovingly. otherwise there is little or nothing to take offense to.the original 'Freaky Friday' is one of classic Disney's best comedy/fantasy films and has obviously been remembered if not fully appreciated for what it created. a whole genre of switcheroo films like 'Big' and 'Like Father, Like Son'. can't say that's necessarily a great contribution to culture, but the original 'FF' is a funny and winning little film and deserves more respect as a original achievement than it is usually given credit for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this film has a simplistic plot, it is a real treat to watch. This is due to Barbara Harris's incredible performance. She is hilarious playing a mother with a teenager inside her body. Her physicalization is realistic and ridiculous all at once. I saw this film as a child and loved it, then just watched it again with a 10- year old who thought it was excellent. Although the film is a little long by today's standards, it is a worthwhile rental for a "pre" pre-teen audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies of all time. I feel in love with it from the first time I saw it, and now that I own the video I take the time to watch it usually on rainy nights. It's the perfect movie for the occasion.(mild spoilers)Annabel Andrews and her mother Ellen don't exactly get along. Annabel's a total slob with a free will to match, and her straightlaced mother has plenty to say about it. So after wishing they could trade places at the same time, it happens! And surely enough, mayhem follows. Annabel becomes overwhelmed when having to get the washing machine fixed, deal with the nasty maid, and making a whole banquet for her Dad's water show the coming evening. Meanwhile, Ellen rediscovers that school is more than a zoo, and Annabel's friends become rather intrigued by her sudden change.I'd suggest this movie to just about anyone. It's witty, intelligent, and a hoot! All in all, one of the best films of the '70s, and the best live action Disney film you can come across.</fullReview>

There are three actors I seen in this film, Al Molinaro (The Odd Couple, Happy Days), Marvin Kaplan (Alice), and the late Sorrell Booke (Dukes of Hazzard), and seems to be an all star film.I give it a ballooned 100!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good family fun in the old Disney style, but much older than that!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may interest some readers to know that this story of a parent/child identity swap originates with the British comic author F Anstey's novel Vice Versa, published in 1882, and there have been at least 10 film and TV versions of it (probably more), going back as far as 1916, under various titles. It's a pretty decent time-passer for a Sunday afternoon, and suitable for all the family to watch together, but I think Jodie Foster's role was slightly too sexualised. To be fair, back in 1976 we weren't quite as sensitive to that kind of thing as we are today. For example, Foster's 1978 film Pretty Baby would, quite rightly, never get a release today. However, Freaky Friday is generally good, old-fashioned family fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awwwwww FREAK OUT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why, but when 'Freaky Friday' first came out (or was it a rerelease) I saw the film instead of going to a birthday party where bowling was the fun activity of choice. Miles away in California, my future friend Marshall was aching to see the film, only to be dragged to a free presentation of 'The Donna Shore Show', with his parents. This scared him deeply. I helped to heal this scar by letting him finally watch the film he avoided for so many years because of Donna Shore. After he finally he got to watch just a little of it, he concluded that he really didn't miss all that much.Is my friend right? I want to point out a few of the flaws of the film and compare them to the 2003 remake as best as I can remember it. There was also a 1995 remake with Shelly Long I never saw and will leave alone. First there is the way in which the Freaky Friday switch happens. In the remake, there is some magic charm from some fortune teller that causes mother and daughter to switch places. In the original it happens because the script says it does. Fantasy Phenomenon does not always need an explanation especially when the film is more or less a parable, but the film makes more sense in the remake.The second thing is there is no real interaction on screen between the mother and the daughter. You would think if something weird happened like switching bodies with someone you would want to talk about it with other person, but this never happens. It does happen in the remake which is very logical and believable. I always have a hard time accepting the actors in a body switching movie. I usually can't buy a adult playing a kid and vice versa. 13 going on 30 seemed to be the most successful attempt I have seen at it. I also usually feel this way when men try to discuses themselves as women. As funny as it is, it is still Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams in drag and I can tell. Charlie Chaplin actually did make a very convincing woman.This brings me to the last major flaw which is the believability of some of the action. I find it hard to believe that a 13 year old wouldn't know how to run a washer and that a grown women wouldn't' know how to run an electric typewriter especially when other adults know how to do the same thing. The lack of believability usually kills a film but not this one. There is a logical explanation for every action in the film. Every thing that happens in the film happens simply for yucks. And by some stroke of Disney magic it works. Towards the end of the film, one character remarks, "Your whole family is a bunch of comedians." That seems to ring through in this film. The wacky silliness works much the same way a Marx Bros. film works. The crazy things that happen are so odd, unusual, and well timed that their funny. A funny scene has the daughter at home in the mom's body thinking she will just watch TV and eat snacks, only to have every Tom, Dick, and Harriot come to the house for some reason or other. Rugs, Groceries, House Cleaning est. The ending chase scene would make Buster Keaton proud. It's also neat to see how 70's everything is.If you want even a half way decent thinking comic fantasy, this is not your film. There are plenty of other films with the same fantasy element that covers that category. If you want a nice family friendly no brainer wacky comedy that will entertain the kids this is your film. It's worth a place in the family library right along side your Marx Bros. comedies. In reality this does not compare to the genius of their work, but it's fun to watch and so are the Marx's and you should introduce your kids to them at some point like my did to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mary Rodgers' fantastic tale runs out of gas early because it can't be bothered with fantasy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you changed personalities with your kid--actually found yourself in his or her body--would you spend the rest of the day in school? If you found yourself in your mother's body, would you bother cooking a meal for your husband's corporate buffet? Disney's "Freaky Friday", adapted by Mary Rodgers from her popular young adult novel, doesn't quite work; there's no awe in the circumstance involved--just lessons to be learned. Mom Barbara Harris earns points for daughter Jodie Foster at school, while Foster (in Harris' body) gets closer to the guy next door. Both leads are very good however, and Harris is wonderful calling her husband "Daddy" (with a quick switch to "Bill, Dear") and later playing a hot game of softball with a group of boys (while chewing bubblegum AND smoking a cigarette). Foster has some funny outbursts but generally has less to work with (she screws up a typing class, a photography class, band practice and field hockey, but does great in social studies). The movie is far too long, with inertia setting in right about the time Harris is called to the principal's office to discuss her daughter's schoolwork. The slapstick finale, a painful "Love Bug" flashback, is pure juvenalia (complete with a magic twist that makes no sense--not even in this movie's universe), yet the picture was a blockbuster anyway. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still freaky after thirty years - and far more fun than its remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Freaky Friday" is a classic Disney comedy that required no remake. As a 'coming of age' film it sincerely examines the trials and tribulations of both parents and children without ever allowing either perspective to become condescendingly smug. After the hysteria that was Haley Mills had cooled in the late sixties the Disney studio began searching for a teenage successor that could ensure box office success in the 1970s. They found their heir apparent in the embodiment of tomboyish, Jodie Foster.In "Freaky Friday" Foster plays Annabelle, the belligerent teenager who can't wait to grow up. She envisions that her mother, Ellen (Barbara Harris) lives a life of elegance and luxury, and, as such, Annabelle longs for just one chance to revel in what she perceives to be the pampered existence of adulthood. Likewise, Ellen can't understand why her teenager daughter complains so much about being a teenager. Both women get a reality check when a 'freak' accident transposes their brains into each other's bodies thus affording them the opportunity to experience each other's lifestyle for one catastrophically hilarious day. John Astin, Dick Van Patten and Ruth Buzzi costar.TRANSFER: A very nice, very clean looking, anamorphically enhanced presentation. Colors are rich, vibrant and bold. Age related artifacts are a rarity. Rear projection and special effects photography appears worse for the wear than the rest of film, but is only marginally distracting. Contrast and black levels are solid. Overall, the picture has a very smooth characteristic that is easy on the eyes. The audio is mono and somewhat strident but, at a moderate listening level, quite acceptable.EXTRAS: Disney doesn't give us much to go on except the ramblings of Jodie Foster - who is strangely awkward when asked to talk about herself.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have the opportunity to rent this movie, stay home and watch it instead of the recent remake. It is much more faithful to the book, and the performances are superior to the re-make.Ms. Foster shines in this film, as she did in all her Disney work, and I would disagree with the previous post referring to her working with sub-par talent. David Niven, Barbara Harris, Helen Hayes, Leo Mckern, Michael Douglas, Will Geer--not sub-par by any means. And perhaps working with these actors, most of them seasoned veterans, taught the young actress a thing or two about acting. And Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the remake of Freaky Friday first before I ever saw this Freaky Friday, and you might hate me when I say, I didn't know until a year ago that it was a remake, not to mention that it starred an unknown little actress, Jodie Foster. But when I heard, I got excited and wanted to see it immediately since I loved the remake, but I could never find the original at the video store, but finally I came across it yesterday at Hollywood Video. I just watched it this morning and while I enjoyed it, I found the remake to be a little more entertaining, I'll explain in just a minute.Ellen is a house maker and a mom who is constantly on the go and taken for granted, Annabelle is her sloppy disorganized daughter, and they just can't seem to understand each other. But when they are both talking about each other, they say the magic words "I wish she could just be in my shoes for one day", and their bodies switch! Now Ellen has to learn what it is like to be her tomboy sports loving daughter and Annabelle has to learn what a complicated life her mom has with chores, babysitting, cooking, and being in charge of the house with a husband who takes her for granted constantly.Freaky Friday has some good humor and some light laughs here and there, but I think the reason why I enjoyed the remake with Jamie Lee Curtis a little better was because of the times. Today's world is constantly on the go, not to mention I think that kids are a little more rebellious, so the mom and daughter had more to learn from each other in that film. But I would never say shy away from this Freaky Friday because it is a classic and has some good laughs and a good ending.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fluffy Disney comedy from the '70s has a pubescent JODIE FOSTER and mom BARBARA HARRIS wishing they could trade places--so they do, for a day, a wildly slapstick day that is totally absurd but hits the funny bone on more than one occasion. Jodie is the sloppy daughter and Harris the fussy housewife who finds fault with her daughter's every move.Mary Rodgers wrote the screenplay from her novel and Gary Nelson directed, but it has no more substance than a half-hour situation comedy stretched to the limits. Kids are the primary target audience, but adults will find the foolishness a bit forced and too much at times.In brief roles as soccer coaches, RUTH BUZZI and KAYE BALLARD do their broad comedy routines with finesse. The final chase on a wild auto ride and a water ski competition gone wild gives the film a good lift, but the script is nothing special and the situations are only funny enough to warrant an amused chuckle or two.Summing up: Lacks the wit and charm of a first-rate comedy, but gets by on the lead performances. The good premise must have looked better on paper than it does when executed on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a life with a mother and a daughter?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FREAKY FRIDAY is about a mother and a daughter who have conflicts with one another. This movie brings out the realism of parent and child roles. Annabel (Jodie Foster) and Tess (Barbara Harris) put their relationships on the edge by wishing, they could switch places (or bodies as it goes) with one another. This film grasps how stresses of everyday life effects Tess as a wife ,mother, and keeper of the house and how Annabel copes with her stresses as a teenager and how she deals with her mother's control. Everything goes out of control when Tess's husband calls home to have Tess plan and prepare a grand party at the harbor to impress his bosses. As the stress of everyday life escalates out of control for Tess, Annabel's stress with her life escalates out of control too. It gets so bad for Annabel and Tess that they wish they could be each other for a day. Then at the precise moment they wished, POOF!!! They were in each other's bodies. They learn very valuable lessons special and unique to mother and daughter. Life was harder then when the husband always relyed heavily on the wifely duties to impress clients, but when Annabel and Tess switched places for a day things went haywire. Everyone wondered why they were acting strange. Annabel's mother learns what it is to be a teenager again while Annabel learns what her mother goes through with secretaries hitting on or picking up her husband and going to school meetings and cooking and cleaning for a family that expects their mother to do certain chores. All goes out the window when Annabel in Tess's body is racing around cooking and delivering the overcooked food to the harbor by car. With Tess in Annabel's body, Bill is already planning a kind of Cypress Gardens Water skiing event for his clients. As Annabel (in Tess's body) races to the harbor and Tess in Annabel's body skiing for Bill's clients, they wish to have their own bodies back. They switched this time, having Tess to fend for herself on waterskis and Annabel racing to the harbor in the car without a license, while Tess's husband entertained his client. Both Annabel and Tess learn that each other's lives are special and unduplicated. Annabel learns being a parent has responsibilities beyond her years. Lessons are learned. Be careful what you wish for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the new version of this film, I was expecting this one to be better, as in 'The Parent Trap' and other remade movies, but actually with this I thin the original is better. Although the storyline is crazier, the mother/daughter 'hate' relationship is much more believable in the remake. However, comparisons aside, this is an OK movie, but nothing more. the acting is mediocre and it isn't particularly funny (though this is partly because it's dated.) Another downfall is Jodie Foster. She's a fabulous actress, but she never really comes across as a child. The moral they are trying to tell is not clearly shown, as in other kiddy-type films. A good one for the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophical and Spiritual Issues raised by this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! Spoilers and Pseudo-Intellectual Claptrap follow:On the surface it may seem like just an insensate piece of 70's Disney fluff, but the questions that this film raises are perhaps some of the most pertinent to understanding the nature of humanity itself.For instance: When asked to write out a check to the mechanic, Annabel, in the body of her mother, opts to try to find cash instead, so as not to go to prison for forgery. But is this a rational fear? What are the legal precedents on matters of this nature? What is it that signs a check, the body or the mind? And, an even more intriguing question: Whose signature would Annabel have while occupying her mother's body? Her own, or her mother's? After awhile, the signing of one's own name becomes a reflex, which does not require a conscious effort on the part of the brain, other than to set the pen in motion. And so it follows that Annabel would have her mother's signature while occupying her mother's body. And so, if it is Ellen Andrews' signature on the check, but Annabel Andrews who set the pen in motion to provide that signature... is that considered forgery, or not?Another question: What, exactly, is it that has been switched? Their minds, of course. But what is the mind? It is the sum total of all one's knowledge and experience, which combines to form the basis of one's personality. However, genetics also play a part in the building blocks of personality, and each has found herself with a new genetic makeup which, though similar to one another, are not identical. What affect should this have on their respective personalities? Could it partly account for the sympathy that each acquires for the other's plight? And what about ingrained habits? It is established that Ellen smokes menthols, whereas Annabel dislikes being even in the vicinity of cigarettes. While in her mother's body, wouldn't Annabel experience that body's cigarette cravings? However, would Annabel's mind, the mind of a non-smoker, even be able to recognize those cravings for what they are?There is good evidence, however, that it is not their minds that switch places at all. The shot that communicates what has happened takes a split screen, with Annabel on one side and Ellen on the other, and freezes it. Then, pale silhouettes of each rise up and switch places with one another. This would seem to imply that it is, in fact, their souls that have traded places, and not their minds. This opens up a whole new batch of questions: What IS the soul, and how does it differ from the mind? Is there something more that makes a person who they are than just genetics plus experiences? To what degree does the soul govern the body, and to what degree does the mind govern it? Do the two cooperate, or are they at odds? And then there is the question of physical abilities. Ellen is most likely not much of a sports person, and yet, in her body, Annabel is able to ride a skateboard and play baseball, presumably approximately as well as she did in her own body. But at the same time, Ellen, once she gets past her own mental blocks, is able to play field hockey nearly as well as Annabel in Annabel's body. Which is more important to success in a sport?: The body, conditioned to play the sport, or the mind, trained to understand the game?This is where the soul comes into play. It is the determination of Ellen's soul that frees Annabel's body to begin playing actual hockey (rather than merely ducking the blows of the other team), even though Ellen's mind still does not really understand the game. And it is the longing of Annabel's soul for familiarity in a strange and relentless world that allows here to play baseball with her own abilities, even though Ellen's body would probably ordinarily not be up to the challenge.The philosophy becomes even more mind-bending with the climactic switch back: Wherein rather than their souls returning again to their respective bodies, their bodies transcend the space time continuum to reunite with their rightful souls. It is as if to say that the body and soul are so fundamentally intertwined that, when separated, the need for reunification is so great that it allows even for the transposition of corporeal flesh.Not to mention the Freudian issues involved in having a daughter married to her father, thus bringing the deep-seated Electra complex to glaring fruition.And so, in conclusion, I believe that the viewing of this movie can help us answer some of the questions asked by man since the beginning of time. If John Hinkley had chosen this film, rather than Taxi Driver, to be the fodder of his obsession with Ms. Jodie Foster, he would have been inspired to write an intelligent philosophical dissertation in order to impress her, rather than shoot Ronald Reagan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually liked this one. I think there were a few parts that were supposed to be humorous that weren't. The part of the movie where the mother, in her daughter's body, saw the secretary liked her husband was a little funny but not as funny but kind of bad. It would have been funnier if she would have retaliated. I thought the part where Anna's friend liked Anna's mother was a little gross. They showed that in the 2003 on but at least in that one he was older. Of course the 2003 one does have more funny parts but I still like this one better. The funniest is the 80s movie "Visa Versa" which is kind of copying Freaky Friday. I thought the mother was a little nicer this 76 version than in the 2003 version. Unlike in the book, both mother and daughter envied one another. In the book, the mother switched them to teach the daughter a lesson, which I found to be a little silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for kids, not adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Jodie Foster have three things in common: they both have two Oscars, have directed films, and both have been in soul-transference movies.Foster, one of the all-time greats, when not making serious films like "Taxi Driver", would make films for Disney and even at the tender age of 12, would dominate her films (of course, she was working with subpar talent).Based on the Mary Rodgers' novel (which I read as a kid), the movie is about a "Freaky Friday" when Annabelle Andrews (Foster) trades bodies with her mother Ellen (Barbara Harris), and the ensuing chaos that follows. This whole incident leads to a chain of improbable events.Foster, as always, delivers a superb performance, playing a 35-year old woman in a child's body. Harris is the surprise here. She delivers a Sandy Dennis-type performance, and you can't help but sympathize with her. I, too, will admit that Ms. Harris is absolutely gorgeous. Even when she's all dirty or soaked, she still is beautiful. She's definitely on my Top 10 Most Beautiful List of All-Time. list. A true knockout. I wonder why she didn't do more?The rest of the cast is filled with then-current or future T.V. stars. Marvin Kaplan (Henry on Alice), Al Molinaro (Al from Happy Days), John Astin (Patty Duke Show), Charlene Tilton (Lucy on Dallas), Dick Van Patten (Eight Is Enough), Alan Oppenheimer (various), Fritz Feld (The famous "POP Man", and of course, Sorrell Booke (Boss Hogg on The Dukes of Hazzard), among others.The movie isn't perfect. The acting of some of the secondary characters is annoying, the logic in some scenes is a bit negligible, and the action scenes are mostly of the actors obviously doing their thing in front of a screen. Still, children in the mid-to late single digits will find this amusing, but everyone else should avoid this one at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney Live action film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best Disney live action film. The next best are Watcher in the woods, and Candleshoe. But this takes the pick. The film has a whole lotta heart and intellect. Dealing with a mother and daughter switching bodies(or is it minds?) the mother must go through the day in her daughters body at school, while her daughter goes through the hardships of being an adult in her mothers body. The charm in this comes not only from family dynamics, but from true characters and morals. Harris is especially funny as the stern but well meaning mother, while Foster is a hoot as the fun and fancy free daughter. John Astin is great as the misunderstood father and Patsy Kelly rocks as the drunkard Mrs. Schmouss! The film also deals with adult situations like alchohol, booze, dope, and "kissing games". As most Disney films did, this had family values that went beyond just brother/sister slapping around, and mothers yelling at their kids. Great acting from all, and the supporting cast is equally fine. Really enjoyable is the cameo by "Laugh in" star Ruth Buzzie as an opposing coach in the scene which Annabelles mother-in Annabelle's body-plays field hockey and wins the other teams points! The Chase in the finale is well rounded and brings the story to a truly classical endgame! Don't miss this film, if you can possibly help it. Also recommended: Watcher in the Woods; Candleshoe; Escape/Return to Witch Mountain, etc. ***** out of *****!!</fullReview>

Basically Annabel Andrews (young Golden Globe nominated Jodie Foster) feels hassled by her mother, and her mother Ellen (Family Plot's Golden Globe nominated Barbara Harris) is annoyed with her daughter, they both feel like each other live an easy life. One Friday both wish they could be each other just for one day, so Annabel goes into the body Ellen, and vice versa. For a little while there are a few good points to having each other's bodies, but it soon becomes apparent that the lives they thought were easy actually aren't. In the end, both come to a point where they have to wish themselves back to their own bodies, and it does happen, but both bodies swap places, so Annabel is in the car, and Ellen on eater skis. Also starring John Astin as William Waring Andrews, Patsy Kelly as maid Mrs. Schmauss, Dick Van Patten as Harold Jennings, Vicki Schreck as Virginia and Sorrell Booke as Principal Charles Dilk. Young Foster proves herself a growing (literally) talent, and Harris is good at being youthful, there are some giggles to be had, but I preferred the remake really showing comedic complexities of each other's lives, but you may as well see it for Foster and Harris. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for "I'd Like to Be You for a Day". Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodie "foster"ed a few laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The same year that Jodie Foster starred in "Taxi Driver", she also starred in "Freaky Friday", about as far from the former as you can get. She plays Annabel Andrews, who inadvertently switches bodies/brains with her mother Ellen (Barbara Harris) after wishing to be someone else. The two of them go through the rest of the day getting into embarrassing situations.Obviously, Disney movies are overall pretty worthless. But this one isn't bad. Maybe it is the sort of thing that can only appeal to little children, but if we accept it as only that, it's kinda interesting. Still, Jodie Foster's later movies had a lot more to show for themselves, and Barbara Harris was more interesting in "Who is Harry Kellerman and Why is He Saying All Those Terrible Things About Me?", "Nashville", and "Family Plot". Also starring John Astin (aka Gomez Addams) and Marc McClure (of "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and "Superman" fame).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 10 year old son liked it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what it's worth, my ten year old son liked it, maybe even more than the recent remake. The plot's not exactly the same at all except for the role reversal. Special affects aren't as great as the newer version of course, but the movie isn't as 'slick' as the new one easier and somehow I think the younger audiences appreciate the more straight foward simpler style of the older original film. Barbara Harris in the mom role, in one of her few onscreen performances is great as she always was. It's a shame this actressnever made more films!! Jodi Foster as the kid is all butch tomboy. Interesting.........hehehehehe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Cute Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in the 80's, so I didn't appreciate this film as much as a 70's teen would have but overall it was a very cute film. The plot was adorable, the different characters were memorable, and the sibling rivalry was awesome! Score 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well...It was good for the time being.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm... I must say this is one of those movies that sort of has aged over the years being this movie was made in the 70's Nothing wrong with that but the movie is kind of boring for the younger viewers.A young Jodie Foster plays a Preteen tomboy who gets into a lot of trouble with her family and social life. Till one day in some unexplained turn of events her and her mom Switch bodies.What kinda gets to me is that they never explained how it happen. Was it in the food in the restaurant? I WANT TO KNOW!!! D:Now to be fair it has its share of funny scenes. Like when the Mom is water skiing and such.This is the very few instances where I prefer the remake to the original.So overall, The movie is kind of outdated, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, Jodie Foster did have fun making this film so I should give credit for that. If you feel like taking a trip down memory lane this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Disney films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say enough about "Freaky Friday." Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris portray their reversed roles flawlessly, and the excellent screenplay by Mary Rodgers cannot be beaten. Unlike many Disney movies, this one deals with real-life family issues, that amazingly, are still relevant today. Even with some poor editing and the inevitable Disney chase, the great writing(filled with "grownup" innuendo) and the top-notch casting make this a perennial classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A child has to be childish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playing a prostitute in `Taxi Driver', Jodie Foster became a star in 1976, so I suppose she was forced to do a bunch of commercially interesting children's films afterwards in order to restore the American routine: a child has to be childish. I believe, that's how this completely unnecessary movie arose. The plot synopsis implies a moral message: Mother and daughter suddenly change bodies on Friday 13th by wishing at the same time to become the other one.I read that in the TV guide and prepared for a little sentimental comedy to tell me how equally hard school-work and housework are. Surprisingly, the moral aspect was there, but so badly presented that it won't make a single child think about what it has seen! Well, and without the message there is nothing left but a screenplay so jerky that it could have been written by a child but so uninspired that it must have been written by a third-class Hollwood writer; also an ashamingly bad actress called Barbara Harris, a boring, predictable plot and a sitcom-like camera ? unfortunately there are less funny moments than in a 20-minutes sitcom.I'm a great fan of Jodie Foster and this film is her very worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip this, watch the superior 2003 remake (skip the 1995 one, too).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Body swap movies must be fun to make. Fred Savage and Judge Reinhold must have had a lot of fun in "Vice Versa" (1988). Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan must have in "Freaky Friday" (2003), too. The original "Freaky Friday," though, doesn't seem very fun at all, and I'd be surprised to find that the two lead actresses -- Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster -- had any fun whatsoever making it.Foster is on cruise control as Annabel, a tomboy youth growing up in suburban America during the mid-70s. I expected to see the Brady Bunch next door, walking outside and waving at Annabelle as she got ready to go to school.Annabel's mother (Harris) is a stay-at-home mom with a lazy husband. She's envys her daughter, who in turn envys her, and as the two simultaneously wish to swap places, a freak accident occurs and they do, in fact, swap places. Now they have to learn to appreciate each other's differences before they can swap back again.It won't be easy. Annabel (in her mother's body) makes moves on the next door neighbor, a school kid her age who is attracted to Annabel's mother. The love interest is never given anything other than minimal attention, and unlike the 2003 remake, there aren't many funny scenes involving him and the mother at all.This movie is dull, lifeless, routine, and downright painful to sit through. It sparked the national curiosity of the body switch comedies, inspiring "Like Father Like Son," "18 Again," "Vice Versa" (the superior version of the formula), and even "Big." The genre has been over-used and misused many times, and "Vice Versa" and the 2003 version are the only two that actually offer anything funny and actually come off as fresh.Otherwise this is boooooring! I saw "Freaky Friday" (2003) last night at a screening and it was ten times better than this. I also saw the TV version with Shelley Long and that, too, was even better than the 1976 version, which is so sickly cheery and low budget it almost pains the viewer.Foster was fresh off the success of "Taxi Driver," released the same year, which is at least 1,000,000 times better than this film. She displays little acting skill, however, muttering her lines in voice-over narrative like she's reading off the back of a piece of paper -- which no doubt she was, anyhow.Barbara Harris, in the role of Ellen, offers little other than dumb expressions and cute lines. The film even resorts to an awful climatic finale involving a cop car chase -- a sure sign that a film is in trouble.The director, Gary Nelson, seems to have a knack for making absolutely nothing funny appear out of the given material. Looking back in retrospect, this was the first film of the body swatch genre, and seeing how mediocre this cheery little dud is, I can't understand why anyone would have offered to remake the material for years to come.Here are words of advice: Skip this. Watch the 2003 remake. It's much, much better, and much, much funnier. Oh, and it has better acting, directing, and scriptwriting. Am I being cruel to this film? I don't think so. After all, it spawned an unfortunate series of awful body swap movies, and for that it deserves to die a truly painful death.2/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I nearly busted a gut with this one. Barbara Harris is an especial treat, especially in the climatic waterskiing nail-biter! I wish I could be *her*...just for a day! It has interesting feminist implications and the heavily hinted-at subplot involving teen alcoholism is compellingly unexplained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This, and the remake are good; no 2003 version for me, please!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has this movie released in 1976, and the name of it? "Freaky Friday!!!!!" This is a very original film from the good folks at Disney. Here, for one day, two people happen to switch places!!!!! And thanks to this, many shows (mostly from the Disney properties) often follow the same format on at least one episode!!!!! (such as "8 Simple Rules," etc.)What I like about this movie: It's fun! I mean, with a name like "Freaky Friday," why wouldn't this movie be fun, huh????? Also, I recall seeing this on the old Disney Channel back in 1997, and I've seen the remake on ABC in 1995 (I think), and both movies are great! However, even though I've seen the 2003 edition, that is NOTHING like the 1976 and 1995 versions that Disney has released."Freaky Friday" is a fun classic. Hey, I've written this on a Friday, too! How ironic!!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Quite dreary, watch the 2003 remake instead"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the 2003 version of 'Freaky Friday' and I loved it. Then I watched theoriginal version and it was now where near as funny or dramatic as the remake. In the original version the mother and daughter are only having very minorarguments. They don't even yell. While in the remake the mother and daughterare having really big arguments! Really huge disputes! With the daughtersaying things like "Mum! You're ruining my life!" Also in the original movie version the daughter is only having minor disputes with her younger brother. While in the remake the daughter really hates herbrother. She insults him! She chases him! She is even close to attacking him! This original movie version is also less dramatic when the mother and daughter swap bodies. In this version they find themselves puzzled and confused. While in the remake they find themselves totally shocked and totally freaked out! And best of all when they first look in a mirror they scream!! The remake is also better because the daughter is a teenager, instead of a twelve year old. Which I think gives the film a wider audience.While the original movie of 'Freaky Friday' made me fall asleep, the remakemade me laugh my head off! So I don't recommend the original to anyone, but I highly recommend the 2003 remake!</fullReview>
