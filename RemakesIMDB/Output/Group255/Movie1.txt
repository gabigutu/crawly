		<shortDescription>This is one of those movies that you watch again and again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is very traditional Southern Slice of Life piece. It's also a love story. Not usually my cup of tea, but done so well, it's worth the 3 hours. It moves slow, so if you're not up for a long, slow, southern drawl don't go here. The movie opens with what is clearly a hot afternoon (no, i don't know how, but the cinematography is only one of the many things done right in this movie) that's about to slide into night. We watch a man light a cigarette, pick up a can of something, walk over to a barn, poor it at the foundation, and light it. All this is interspersed with pictures of a horse in its paddock and the sun thinking about setting. The next thing we see is our lead, Ben Quick, walkin' along the road/through a field somewhere in rural U.S.A. This is a slow moving, slow telling, slow building story. There is never any question that we're in the South, from the accents (not always perfect, but never jarring at least to a westerner's ear), to the race interactions (again, perhaps this is from a westerner's perspective), to the big plantation houses. This cast is an interesting collection of folks. From Jason Robards in the role of Will Varner, old style boss of the town who owns everything, controls everything and designs all -- that is, except his children who are huge disappointments to him to Don Johnson as Ben Quick, the out of towner, drifter, and general trouble maker who decides that this just might be the place to settle down, to Judith Ivey as Miss Noel the "old maid" older sister who is educated, more than a little uptight and not-quite-engaged to a gentleman that is as flat and uninspiring as Alan Stewart can make him to William Russ as Jodi Varner, the son that never quite measured up to the overbearing father to Cybil Shepphard's Eula, the sex crazed, manipulative southern belle with a good heart for those who really can't keep up (the town "dim-with" for instance), the performances manage to exceed "stereotype" and become "archetype". Ava Gardener (Minnie Littlejohn), Stephan Davies (Alan Stewart), and Albert Hall (Armistad Howlett) all add depth to this production in beautifully played character parts. William Forsythe, as Isaac the town dim-wit, is a beautiful piece of casting. One of the many unexpected bonuses is James Gammon in the role of Billy Quick, Ben's no-account, shiftless, bad news dad.That they're using William Faulkner's works as the basis for their scripts has, I suspect, a lot to do with that. He's been able to describe the South for the rest of us for most of the 20th century. He can describe a moment in time like very few others and the director, Stuart Cooper, managed to capture Faulkner's ability to paint pictures with the camera. You almost begin to sweat with the first shots of this movie the scenes are so beautifully shot.It's not long before you forget it's a movie and you start to think you're listening on the veranda as Don Johnson and Jason Robards meet, speak, plan and plot. As you watch the interplay between William Russ and James Robards, between Don Johnson and William Russ, you feel like you're watching a great plantation house collapse under the weight of years of neglect. Frenchman's House, a great old plantation home, is used as an excellent allegory for the condition of the Varner Family.But in all of this, lest you forget, it's really also, at it's heart, a love story. Ben pings to Miss Noel right off. She's a challenge, she's reserved, she's sharp as a tack and Ben is attracted to all these qualities and more. It's apparent that he sparks to her long before Will Varner "buys him" as "stud for his daughter". It's no surprise that in the end, Ben gets his girl and Jodi grows up -- how that is accomplished over the course of the 3 hours is what's worth the ride.Don as Ben is, by turns, deliciously mischievous, honest to the point of brutally blunt, mysterious, genteelly caring, willing to run roughshod over folks &amp; their feelings, exceptionally tender and more. This is a stellar performance for Don and he matches up to Robards (also in a very strong performance) with no trouble at all. Judith Ivey, whose work I'm not familiar with, makes a great opposing match for Don. She isn't the beauty or care-free soul that Shepphard's Eula is, but then that's part of the attraction for Ben. She's a puzzle, a nut to be cracked, a woman to be loved. That Daddy is willing to pay him to go there is a bonus and that he loves her anyway and aside from that becomes very clear. Don is strong &amp; sexy &amp; romantic &amp; adventurous &amp; dangerous and makes Ben Quick as Agent of Change very believable and very real. This movie also has what is possibly one of the most intense &amp; sizzling romantic love scenes I've seen anywhere. This isn't about wham, bam, thank you ma'm and it's not about nudity. It's about discovering what 2 adults can find in each other if they let themselves and it's got all the more impact for that.This movie is a joy to watch. That you know where it's going is unimportant. The point is the journey and this cast makes it a very satisfying journey indeed. The only thing I can name as "getting in the way" of my total immersion was the unfortunate 80's almost-farrah-fawcett 'do they put on Miss Ivey. If the worst you can say about a movie is that one of the women had a bad hair style, you're doing pretty well.It shows up on cable every now and then, but as it's still only on VHS, Netflix doesn't have it yet. Which is a REAL shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie. I had only seen small parts of the original movie which I did not like. This remake was much better. The emotional performance that Don Johnson gave was outstanding! I feel that all the cast members fit their parts except Judith Ivey. I'm not sure who could have done it better, but she just did not seem to fit. Cybil Shepeard and Don Johnson stole the show with their performances. I can not imagine anyone else playing those parts. This movie has something for everyone; romance, mystery, murder, comedy, and excitement. The love scene with Don and Judith is one of the best love scenes I've ever seen where no one has to say a word to get their point across. This movie is one of my favorites!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had always claimed, that Don Johnson was not for me. He was not even a good actor. So I was persuaded to watch this film, and I was so facinated. I could not get it out of my head after I saw it. It was brilliant, and Don Johnson played really well. The story was also good. I even wrote to our local TV station, to get them to show it again, but in vain. Please let it come out on DVD so I can buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not without flaws, but Don Johnson isn't one of them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently re-discovered this movie after not having seen it since the original airing on TV. I was in my early 20s back in 1985, and thought like many other women that Don Johnson was the sexiest man alive (he was indisputably the most popular actor in America, on one of the most popular TV shows), so it's interesting to watch the movie 23 years removed and with a fresh perspective. One of the first things that surprised me is that once you get past the sheer gorgeousness of the man (and he really was breathtaking - one of those rare few people for whom there were no bad camera angles), Don Johnson is in fact a very good and smart actor with quite a wide emotional range (for an excellent example, watch the scene where Noel and Ben are sharing the box lunch). Another surprise was the depth of the love scene between Ben and Noel. Anyone who ever adored Don Johnson knows that the man knew how to play a love scene like few others, and play it appropriately to the material. He could be hotter than hot but still tender, or loving and gentle but still hot. I remember being disappointed in the love scene initially, but looking at it now as an adult, I see how young and silly I was. As other posters have suggested, it manages to be a very intense, tender, sexy, emotional, and revealing few minutes without really showing anything at all. That's due entirely to the abilities of both Don, who clearly understood exactly the effect of every look, gesture, touch and kiss in that scene, and the always wonderful Judith Ivey's portrayal of Noel as a capable, strong, and intelligent grown woman whose lukewarm kisses with the milquetoasty (gay?) Alan have in no way prepared her for Ben's confident and relentless heat. The levels of fear, shock, desire and surrender that cross her face in those few short minutes are testament to her talent.So once you get past all the heat that Don Johnson generates (it does get to be amusing how frequently he was directed to take his shirt off, but funny in a GOOD way, if you know what I mean), all the other leads are very well cast and turn in great performances. I agree that Jason Robards doesn't quite equal Orson Welles' over-the-topness in the original, but who would? He nevertheless manages no small amount of bluster and rage as the small-town-rich family patriarch. I thought Cybill Shepherd (also one of the most popular actors in America at the time) was a perfect choice for the restless, sexy, spoiled and eternally unsatisfied Eula, as was William Russ (who coincidentally starred in a very highly rated "Miami Vice" episode that same season) for the tortured and complex Jody Varner.The movie is not without flaws; you can see the plot coming a mile away, and the crowd scenes contain some laughably bad acting and dialogue. The 1980s were sort of the "golden age" of the miniseries, and "The Long Hot Summer managed to be a worthy entry in a crowded field, an enjoyable slice of small-town Southern life, considerably improved by the megawatt star power of its cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent acting, story, Directing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this version better than the movie version with Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Lee Remick, Anthony Franciosa and Orson Welles. Jason Robards version of Will Varner was more subtle than Welles in his facial expressions. Robards was the actor's actor. What a brilliant portrayal of Will Varner. Excellent performances from the leads, and I was particularly impressed by William Russ' portrayal of Jody Varner. Judith Ivey was excellent as the daughter of Will Varner that Ben Quick tries to seduce. Cybill Shepherd was very good as Eula, using her beauty and sexuality to entice every man she can. Ava Gardner had a small role. A beautiful older woman and paramour of Will Varner. Just looking at her you are reminded that not one actress in Hollywood back in Gardner's time could hold a candle to her beauty. Rent the 1951 version of Showboat if you want to drool over Ava Gardner. In the closing scene of that movie, when she brings her fingers to her lips to gently blow a kiss toward the Cotton Blossom, I tear up every time. Don Johnson made an excellent Ben Quick. His lean, toned body is shown off several times throughout the movie in various levels of undress. The scene where he and Noel finally do it is really hot. He met the challenge of this role. The young man who played Miss Minnie's helper was extremely talented. Kudos to all the supporting actors. If you haven't seen this, go do so right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It gets better each time I watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this as the mini series in 1985; I have watched it three or four times since then, most recently tonight. It is not consistently the greatest TV movie ever made, but the combination of Judith Ivey, Jason Robards and Don Johnson is wonderful. Cybill Shepherd is somewhat wasted as Eula, and the part of Jody is a pretty difficult one, but William Russ is perfect as the weaselly son of a powerful father. I enjoy this more every time I watch it, the locations, the soundtrack, the love story between Noelle Varner (Ivey) and Ben Quick (Johnson) as two strong willed people, one running from his past, the other hoping for a future. It's definitely worth a look-or two or three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not as good as the original, but the storyline has been changed some so that helps. This is an excellent movie for Don Johnson fans. He has the cocky attitude, with a deep sensitiveness underneath that fits the character, as Paul Newman did. Only when he parrots the same dialogue does he seem out of place. Judith Ivey is lovely as she is allowed to wear her hair down instead of in a severe bun. Jason Robards tries his best, but in spite of being an excellent actor, he doesn't have the bombastic spirit that made Orson Welles so right for the role. The clothes are modern as most fashion borrows from many years. Accents don't bother me. (How about Germans speaking broken English in war movies?) I liked it better the second time I watched it, so try it twice if you are uncertain. It's worth it; and watch the actors' faces throughout as they do their best with roles that were strongly created in the first movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this version as much as the 1958 version. I wish they would release the 1985 version on DVD. I though Don Johnson did a great job and I have always enjoyed Jason Robards acting. The realism of the film reminds me of the southern USA I grew up in. I remember the fears of farmers as related to barn burners and names associated with them. The director and cast did a wonderful job in my opinion with this version bringing out southern life as it really exists and family feuds. I could feel the hot, humid summer nights and almost smell the swamps and wetlands with their unique scent. Cybil Sheppard did a very nice job portraying a young southern woman questioning her marriage then realizing what she could lose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time when I was about 11 years old. Of course, I then had a crush on Don Johnson in "Miami Vice". I am 32 years old now and am still swept away by this movie. I recorded it off regular TV, back in the day. As I have grown older, I love it even more. I don't play it often now as it is completely recorded verbatim in my memory. (plus my vcr recording is wearing thin!) I am not the romantic type, but this movie makes me feel like the romanticized fantasy of a hero of a man pursuing a woman. In this movie there is treachery, scheming, seduction, suspicion, heroism, compassion, and improbable luck. The plot is very basic; people believing their morals are better than the other. White is better than black. Rich is better than poor. I object! The strenght of the oppressed stereotype, rich and race, is exploded all over the screen! Give it a try! It is 3 hours long, but well worth the fantasy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'What's your name son?''Quick; Ben Quick.'The film is a hoary old hoot. I watched this with my cousin when this first came on, we were both teenagers and only interested in this mini series because we liked Miami Vice and Moonlighting and for weeks we were reciting the bad lines in a southern drawl.Don Johnson plays the barn burner who drifts into a southern plantation town run tightly by a patriarch who is unhappy with his brood. A weaselly son, an uptight daughter and a restless, sexy one played by Cybill Sheperd. Jason Robards as the sly father who sees in Quick, a real man and in effect hires him as a stud to melt his uptight daughter.This is a teleplay with scheming, treachery, seduction and suspicion leading to melodramatics and passion, southern style. Johnson displays an easy style mixed with angst and romantic heat. Robards turns it up a notch or two to remind the audience that he is a two time Oscar winner.Yet the acting with its mish mash of southern accents does have an unintentional hilarious script as well as some dicey acting like many other 1980s mini series but yet it is all very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flawed it may be, but I love this version of the original film. From the opening credits the director uses evocative blues and magnificent ante-bellum mansions to convey the decadent lifestyle, revealing to viewers a privileged, class-driven world. Don Johnson's casting and acting is effective, and it was pleasing to see him trying to extend his range. I particularly like films which show an actor trying to break out of a previous genre or character mould e.g. Robin Williams in 'Dead Poet's Society' or Jim Carrey in 'The Truman Show'. Jason Robard's recent death is saddening, especially when I look at this film and also his remake of 'Inherit the Wind'. Above all, the film appeals to me because it focuses on the desperate if sublimated desire of many females to escape from rigid social expectations dictated by class and education, in order to fulfil their potential. Johnson's role as the catalyst reveals a powerful portrait of an unlikely hero who wins against the odds. Both the music score and the casting of the minor characters (malevolent father and townspeople) help to build the atmosphere. Some might say they were stereotypical, but as a viewer from another country, with little knowledge of Faulkner's original stories, it provides satisfying and refreshing viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Liked It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why "Anonymous" from Atlanta hated the 1985 version so much. I saw both the 1958 version and the 1985 version, and I thought both were good in their respective ways, although I admit that I liked the 1958 version better. William Russ (Jody Varner) appeared with Don Johnson (Ben Quick) in Miami Vice, and James Gammon (Billy Quick) appeared with Johnson in Nash Bridges. The casting choice that I liked least was Cybill Shepherd (Eula Varner). She played the part well enough, but I'm just not a Cybill Shepherd fan. The closest I ever came to liking her was in her role as Maddie Hayes opposite Bruce Willis as David Addison in the TV series Moonlighting. I admit to having been a Miami Vice (1984-1989) fan. That's probably why I thought this 1985 version with Johnson in the lead was fairly good. He's a good enough actor that he gets the job done, and I wish I looked like him, that is, when he was still relatively young. It wasn't fun watching him age in the final season of Nash Bridges (1996-2001). Wrinkles are OK, but when the hairline and the waistline start to go, it's time to start avoiding the camera. What he absolutely had to have was hair replacement and a trainer to get him back into shape, but at 51 years of age, he didn't get either one, so the series wasn't renewed for a seventh season (the first season was comprised of 8 episodes in the spring of 1996, seasons 2-6 extending from the fall of 1996 to the spring of 2001). Anyway, I thought that the 1985 version of The Long Hot Summer was a lot better than what "Anonymous" from Atlanta indicated. I never saw the 1965 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, the Paul Newman version has been one of my absolute favorites for most of my life. That said...For my money, only Don Johnson and Cybill Shepherd were right for their roles. As Ben Quick, Johnson had many of the qualities that Paul Newman exhibited in the same role more than 20 years before. And Cybill Shepherd was a worthy successor to Lee Remick. However Jason Robards was horribly mis-cast as the overbearing and intimidating patriarch of this clan and Judith Ivey was simply too light for her role as the woman to whom Ben Quick was drawn. And I felt no sympathy for William Russ in the part of the son. This is where everything collapses for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forgive me, but I am writing under false pretenses. I have not seen "Long Hot Summer." Yet I still feel I can base my opinion solely on the cast and other factors. It seems like the producer got a bunch of box office names together, adapted works by William Faulkner for effect, made one film of three different works (I assume they are "Barn Burning", The Pony", and "The Hamlet")-I guess he couldn't afford three separate films-and called the whole thing by a Tennessee Williams play. How pretentious. And how many of those who appeared in it have ever even read a Faulkner book? If even one has (I am not God) I will spare them. Those who may have enjoyed the film probably saw nothing wrong with Yul Brynner as Jason Compson. (Please, no reflection on Yul.) I empathise with "anonymous" of Atlanta. I hope to one day watch it to fortify my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taped this from a recent commercial-ridden broadcast recently and had the opportunity to compare it with the 20th-Century Fox film starring Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman, shown tonight on AMC (not letterboxed, darn it!) This TV film suffered from some rather prodigious miscasting, in my view, and certainly seemed tedious and drawn out, compared to Martin Ritt's brisk direction of the CinemaScope mounting. I felt that Judith Ivey and Jason Robards, Jr., especially, were unconvincing and Don Johnson's oily charm, or lack of it, made Paul Newman's turn as Ben Quick look like Olivier's finest hour. Only Cybill Shepherd was given the chance to approximate Lee Remick's verve and sass as Eula Varner. And why did they bother to say that Ava Gardner was a part of the cast? She seems to be seen only in a few long shots, or did they edit out her few scenes to make room for all those advertisers? A disappointment, compared to the theatrical film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Godawful Adaptation of Anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie on the Romance channel. What a complete waste of broadcasting time! This adaptation cut anything of value out of the original. The casting was incredibly bad. Who would ever believe that Don Johnson's character would be interested in the character playing his supposed "love interest". The acting was quite bad as well, complete with bad southern accents. Now, for the wardrobe and hair, what the hell was going on? There was a mix of 1930's and 80's style clothes and haircuts that was just plain rediculous. Cybil Shepard was dressed in 80's sunglasses and dresses while Don Johnson kept dressing up in 30's/40's clothes. Of course, once in a while he'd have the Miami Vice outfit on as well. We kept wondering what time period the movie was set in. Even down to the cars - mixtures of cars from the 40's all the way up to 80-something GMC pickups. The general store had ladies boots (and everything else) that looked like they were borrowed from the Little House on the Prarie set. Then you would see Igloo coolers on a shelf. The thing I really don't get is, if it WAS set in the 80's, then why the hell didn't they use air conditioning?Stupid, stupid, waste of time and space piece of garbage. Makes me mad to think about it!</fullReview>
