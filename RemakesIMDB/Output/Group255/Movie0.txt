		<shortDescription>Long and hot all right, with a tremendous cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman stars with Joanne Woodward, Orson Welles, Lee Remick, Anthony Franciosca, Richard Anderson and Angela Lansbury in "The Long, Hot Summer," based on stories by William Faulkner. It's a lushly produced film about a drifter, Ben Quick (Newman), who comes to town. His reputation precedes him, and he soon upsets the status quo in the wealthy Varner family, headed by Orson Welles with a fake nose that kept melting off and an even faker southern accent. There's the weak, insecure son (Franciosa) married to a sex kitten (Remick) and an unmarried daughter (Woodward) saving herself for a momma's boy (Anderson). In town, there's also Varner Sr.'s mistress, played by Angela Lansbury. Ben sets his sights on Clara Varner and puts himself in direct competition with nervous son Jody for papa's approval. But Quick ultimately needs to reach underneath his swagger and bravura and confront his cut and run philosophy.This is a fantastic cast that delivers sparkling dialogue and an interesting story that has mostly well-drawn characters. The exception would probably be Remick, who has a small but showy role. She doesn't get to do much except show off her figure and sexiness. Welles is a riot - a marvelous technician, he knew how to externalize a character perfectly, and he is here the epitome of a Big Daddy type. His southern drawl is outrageous, and why he decided he needed a new nose (which he had in other roles as well) is beyond me. Woodward gives a touching performance as a young woman who has been living on hope and can't quite cope with her attraction to the overtly sexual Quick. Franciosa is excellent as a tortured young man unable to win his father's love.But as any film that stars Paul Newman, the movie belongs to him, one of the greatest actors to ever hit the screen. Macho, sexy and handsome, his Ben Quick is angry, determined, manipulative, and disturbing, with a hidden vulnerability. His scenes with Woodward sizzle, and you can see her character blossom under his attention. They're a great couple, both on and off the screen.Highly recommended, as is any film that stars Paul Newman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman's ingenious acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Long, Hot Summer," the first of six films he made for director Martin Ritt and the first of seven co-starring Joanne Woodward, is based on two short stories and part of a novel by Faulkner, provided him with his best role to that time? Ben Quick (Newman), a foolhardy, opportunistic young wanderer, drifts into a Mississippi town owned and run by the huge, powerful Will Varner (Orson Welles), who also dominates his daughter Clara (Woodward), a 23-year-o1d unmarried schoolteacher? Despite Quick's reputation as a "barnburner," he is hired by Varner, and rapid1y works his way up to a partnership in the general store and a room in the main house? Varner, like Big Daddy in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," wants strong descendants, and since his son is a weakling, he decides that Clara will marry Quick, whose aggressive masculinity he admires (he calls Quick a "big stud horse"). Clara, offended by Quick's very self-satisfaction and vulgar manner, and by both men's treating her as property, resists?Like Billy the Kid, Quick is an outcast, isolated from humanity because of his notorious reputation? But in temperament he's the opposite, an extreme extrovert? From the very beginning, Newman, hat down low over his forehead, eyes gleaming with ambition, projects an overwhelming confidence, self-satisfaction and, above all, electrifying virility? Cynical, arrogant, crude and unwilling to allow anything to interfere with his drive, he resembles Larry Maddux of "The Helen Morgan Story." But now the portrayal is more than one-dimensional: behind Quick's hard blue eyes, barely hidden sneer and devilish smile there's enough intelligence, humor, charm, and downright attractiveness to force our involvement in his quest for power?This is due entirely to Newman's ingenious acting, because as written the character reveals no positive traits until near the end, when he breaks down and tells Clara the truth about himself? It's a powerful scene: his voice breaking, eyes filling slow1y with tears, Newman effectively depicts a man whose carefully formed cold shell is finally cracking to reveal the vulnerable soul within? The confession gives him a bond of equality with Clara that enables him to stand up decisively to Varner? But even earlier, Quick was never completely dominated by the old man? Of all the father-figures in Newman's films, Varner seems the most imposing, but Quick, unlike the weakling sons in "The Rack" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," isn't passive enough to be stepped upon?William Faulkner's characters are perfect foils: Newman is sexually sure, and seemingly devoid of vulnerability and humanity; Woodward is a virgin, extremely vulnerable, and longing to express her humanity? She teaches him humility and the value of an individual; he helps her discover her sexuality?Two scenes are among the best in their careers, partly because of the sharp dialog by the screenwriters? In the first, Clara comes to see Ben in the store at night? After much childish verbal attacks and a few unperceptive truths, the two have pierced beneath the surface and have found the nerve endings of each other's weaknesses? Later, in the film's finest scene, Clara expresses herself more maturely, asserting that he has the wrong idea about her: she is no "trembling little rabbit, full of smoldering unsatisfied desires," but a full-grown, intelligent woman, who will not be bought and sold? She says he's too much like her father: "I gave up on him when I was nine years old, and I gave up on you the first time I ever looked into those cold blue eyes."With his firm and fresh manner Quick sums up his honest, hard, purely sexual appraisal of life: "Well, I can see you don't like me, but you're gonna have me. It's gonna be you and me? "</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About the best literary adaptation you could ever hope for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Long, Hot Summer is an adaptation of William Faulkner's novel The Hamlet. Now, I just happen to be one of the world's biggest Faulkner fanatics, having read all but five of his novels. I have read The Hamlet, and it is a somewhat lesser work than his grand masterpieces (The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom!, A Light in August, and Go Down Moses; I would also add, though they are lesser known than those five, If I Forget Thee Jerusalem and Pylon). It is more or less a novel made up of a bunch of various stories about the Snopes' family invasion into Yoknapatawpha County in the early part of the 20th Century (1920s, if I remember right; it's been a while since I've read that novel), and as such, it is quite poorly constructed. Faulkner's miraculous writing is intact, but the structure is convoluted.The Long, Hot Summer changes most of what happens in The Hamlet, but it still ends up feeling very Faulknerian (if a little Hollywoodized, especially around the ending). The Hamlet contains a cast of several dozen townfolk and the Snopes family, a Northern family of carpetbaggers who have their eyes set on the hamlet of Frenchman's Bend. The main character in the novel is Flem Snopes. His name is changed in the film to Ben Quick, who was himself one of the original townspeople in the novel (in fact, the Quick family, although they never play a major role in any novel or even short story, pops up constantly in Faulkner's mythology). Quick is played impeccably by Paul Newman. If Flem Snopes had remained as he was written by Faulkner, Paul Newman would have been way too handsome to play him. Instead, the screenwriters,Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., have made him more likable without losing his complexities. They do it by making Ben Quick the little boy who runs away from his barn burning father ( from the short story, one of Faulkner's most anthologized, Barn Burning). That little boy disappears without a trace in Faulkner's writings. Flem Snopes, a teenager during Barn Burning, stays by his father's side afterwards.Will Varner remains fairly intact in the film, the most enterprising of any person in the community. He may actually have a more complex character in the film than in the novel. The literary character is more or less an opponent who is forced to deal with Flem Snopes and his family. Here, Will Varner meets a man who reminds him too much of himself in Ben Quick. The filmic Varner has a rather selfish desire to have grandchildren before he dies, and he tries desperately to get his two children to reproduce for him. In the novel, Will Varner has 16 children. With Orson Welles, we should expect nothing more than the best, and we get another one of his masterful performances here. Will Varner is a lot like Hank Quinlan from Touch of Evil (which was released the same year), and the complexities that Welles communicates here are equal to his Charles Foster Kane or Harry Lime.All the other characters are basically completely changed from the novel. Eula Varner is still a sexpot, but she is no longer Will Varner's youngest daughter, but his dauther-in-law (Flem Snopes originally married her). I don't remember Jody Varner too much from the novel, but I'm pretty sure the insecurities he feels towards Ben Quick were created by the screenwriters (Will Varner never got chummy with Flem Snopes in the novel, so there would be less of a reason for the hatred of Jody). I believe Clara Varner either didn't exist in the novel, or she was much less important. She certainly wasn't the school teacher, since he fell in love with Eula Varner at 13 and ultimately had to resign because of his lust, and then one of the Snopeses taught, I think I.O.The part of this film that really gives it power is the amazing dialogue. I'm pretty sure that no direct dialogue, or at least very little, was taken from the novel. It was all created by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. It is absolutely poetic. I don't think that there is much dialogue in the novel. Faulkner rather likes to tell his stories silent for the most part. Also, if you are a Faulkner fan, or a fan of this novel in particular, keep your eyes open for echoes of other novels or of things that have dropped out here. There is the sewing machine salesman crack when Ben Quick is approaching Varner's mansion (a joke about the salesman Ratliffe, who provides a majority of The Hamlet's point of view), the hint at Absalom, Absalom! (when one of Varner's horses foals near the end), and the hint at A Light in August (the fire in the distance, the townspeople moving towards it). All in all, The Long, Hot Summer is a masterpiece. It is a beautiful, passionate, and intelligent film, and the best literary adaptation of which I am aware, or maybe only second to The Unbearable Lightness of Being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now even better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films which is now even better, as it nears a half-century since its original release.The characters and performances are just as enjoyable to view today - the young Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, vintage Orson Welles - and Tony Franciosa and Lee Remick (along with Orson, both now gone).The other actors' performances were also excellent, and the characters remain as interesting today as in times past.Newman's "Ben Quick" fuses the characteristics of both "hero" and "anti-hero" into one role as profoundly as virtually any other film or stage character you're apt to see.The nostalgia of a work such as this, now seen anew after so many years since production, is something added which only the requisite passage of time enables one to view and enjoy.In the company of other authors in this genre, such as Caldwell, Steinbeck, Williams, et al, Faulkner's works were among the best, and this is clearly revealed in this fine film.If I were required to find an area to criticize, it would be the same as I noticed in one of the comments on this site: namely, the somewhat overly-quick and brief "resolution" of the estrangement between Welles and Franciosa, the impatient patriarch and his older child/son. I realize this brevity may have been due to neither Newman nor Woodward being involved - but the writers and director could still have made it a bit more detailed and intricate, with only, say, another two minutes of film. But this aside, this is a superb motion picture - both then and now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great talent wasted in butchered version of Faulkner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great cast, a fine director, and an opulent production cannot save this movie from its preposterous script. The veteran writing team of Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank must have been under tremendous pressure to soften some of Faulkner's themes, because it looks as if they threw his novel "The Hamlet" into a blender and then reassembled the pieces, adding Hollywood clichés by the handful to thoroughly re-familiarize the story. Thus we have the addition of the schoolteacher daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward)with hair in a tight bun who melts when Paul Newman kisses her. There's the contrast between the crude stud (Newman) and his sickly aristocratic rival, Richard Anderson, a motif that hearkens back to Bogart and Leslie Howard in "The Petrified Forest." The casting here is a little strange since Anderson is 6'4" to Newman's 5'9". Then there's the two rivals bidding on Clara's box lunch, a scene that borrows so heavily on "Oklahoma!" that you feel you've somehow stumbled into another movie. But what the hell, Oklahoma's not too far from Mississippi. They do that sort of thing all the time down there, don't they? All of this pales alongside the grimly happy endings that are slapped onto all the dark, Southern-Gothic story lines. Newman sheds tears remembering his terrible childhood, which softens Woodward's heart, and suddenly they are deliriously in love and ready to give Papa Varner the grandchildren he craves. After sadistically taunting and belittling his son Jody throughout the movie, Orson Welles as patriarch Will Varner suddenly forgives and embraces him because he set a fire and tried to burn his father alive! And Will finally gives in and agrees to marry his ditsy mistress Angela Lansbury, uttering the memorable final line, "I like life! I think I may just live forever." Which, I suppose, is what the Hollywood guardians of the national psyche imagined we all needed to hear back there in the last years of the Eisenhower era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great guilty pleasure movies. Orson Welles, Paul Newman, and Joanne Woodward are all wonderful, and the supporting cast is just fine. The plot is delightfully incoherent, and everyone gets a chance to chew on the scenery. As a big fan of Faulkner, I find the way the screenwriters have jumbled together characters, themes and episodes from various books especially entertaining (although the sensibilities of the characters are more Tennessee Williams, or Tennessee Tuxedo even, than Faulkner, which just adds to the pleasure).The producer was Jerry Wald, and this has the look and feel that is (at least to me) characteristic of his movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Debut for legendary screen team</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Long Hot Summer is chiefly noted for the fact that Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward made their joint cinematic debut in this film. One of Hollywood's best personal and professional partnerships, Joanne had won a Best Actress Oscar for The Three Faces of Eve the year before and it took Paul thirty more years to match it for their mantelpiece in The Color of Money.Based on some William Faulkner short stories, The Long Hot Summer commences when Joanne Woodward and Lee Remick, daughter and daughter-in-law of local patriarch Orson Welles give drifter Paul Newman a lift into town. Woodward's a repressed school teacher and Welles despairs of her finding a suitable match.Because he started dirt poor and worked his way up to the top, Welles takes a liking to Newman and pushes, a little too hard for Newman and Woodward to team up. That's not sitting real well with Anthony Franciosa who is Welles's son and sees Newman displacing him in the family pecking order.In fact my favorite in the film is Franciosa, he usually is in any film he's in. When he's on the screen, you don't pay attention to anyone else, not even Orson Welles.Welles borrows a bit from Tennessee Williams's Big Daddy Pollitt from the Paul Newman film the year before, Cat On a Hot Tin Roof. His Will Varner though is a bit softer around the edges, also lends itself more easily to caricature. I think the creators of The Dukes of Hazzard used Welles in The Long Hot Summer as their model for Boss Hogg.In fact it's interesting to see the contrast in The Long Hot Summer and Cat On a Hot Tin Roof. It's obvious to me that William Faulkner liked the people of Mississippi a whole lot more than the southerners that are in Tennessee Williams's work. Almost fifty years later, The Long Hot Summer is still enjoyable viewing and still may be the best of Paul and Joanne's joint ventures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faulkner hell! We're in Williams country...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and loving it! This movie takes the best of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, SUMMER AND SMOKE, throws in more than a dollop of William Inge's PICNIC, borrows the basket auctioning bit from OKLAHOMA! and the digging-for-treasure-by-the-old-collapsing-house subplot from GOD'S LITTLE ACRE - hell, we even get a variation on the cotton gin burning from BABY DOLL - and somehow delivers an original and unforgettable entertainment, the kind of movie they truly don't make any more. Every member of the cast is superb, with Woodward being a standout and Lee Remmick being gorgeous. How audiences must have swooned in 1958! How many people left the theater thinking they had seen something truly naughty and adult! This film has great dialog, atmosphere to spare, stunning yet understated costumes by Adele Palmer, and gorgeous cinematography. This is all tied together by another fine Alex North score. Check out the scene - lasting no more that 45 seconds - when Newman and Woodward cross a small bridge to share a picnic lunch. This music cue is magical. Jerry Wald produced many high-class soap operas at Fox during the late 1950's, but this one is by far the best. Lansbury shines, Welles hams, and Newman takes his shirt off - what more could an audience ask for? A dreamy title tune crooned over the credits? You got it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film again last night at an old-time movie palace, in an audience of about 2,000 people. The film, which I had seen before, was even more enjoyable then the previous times I had seen it on TV. For one thing, it has some very lovely and well executed uses of the CinemaScope frame. It shows both the dry openness of the landscape, as well as the lush extravagance of the plantation estate which belongs to Orson Welles' character. I'm not too familiar with Faulkner's stories, but the plot elements of this film flow together rather nicely, and there isn't really a dull moment in the whole picture. The only part which is still difficult for me to take, is the resolution of the conflict between Welles' and Franciosa's characters. That scene builds up to something in a matter of minutes, and then suddenly it's over. I could hear disappointment in some audience members in the theater as well, including one person who shouted "What the heck was that about?". This aside, it's still a worthwhile film to see, and the acting of Newman, Woodward, and Welles are standouts. There are also plenty of (probably unintentional) laughs to be had as well. One of the better soap opera-type films to come out of the late 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sympathetic Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the cast and the fine Faulkner story, I was expecting wonderful things from this movie, maybe another Splendor in the Grass, but I felt badly let down.The script was, in a word, wretched. There were unmotivated strong emotions, stilted dialog, not helped by poorly faked Southern accents from players who are not not native Southerners, loaded with plot holes and murky relationships that seemed to go up and down like the stock market.The cast that looked so good on paper didn't cut it. Anthony Franciosa looked like high school senior play. Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, who went on to Academy Award performances later, were just over the top and struggling with bad dialog in this one. I thought Orson Welles and Angela Lansbury were was excellent playing off each other, but their relationship in a subplot was undefined and didn't advance the story at all.My family, with different generations, watched the movie at home on DVD with me and their reaction was similar to mine: a sympathetic disappointment in the work of some of our favorite players.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor sister to Lillian Hellman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this film. It's not the movie's fault that the author (William Faulkner and others) seem to like to provide shades of Lillian Hellman.But, the biggest issue I have here with the acting is Orson Welles. In some scenes, his characterization seems right on target. In other scenes he seems to he hamming it up to the point of creating a cliché of the character. His makeup doesn't help any. That's not to say I didn't enjoy him here. I'm fat, and always feel better when I see someone who is about twice as fat as me. ;-) I never really saw the attraction with Paul Newman. Not a bad actor, nor a great actor. It depended a lot on the quality of the film he was in. I felt pretty much the same about Joanne Woodward. They're both "good" here.Anthony Franciosa is another actor I never cared much for, but with him I'm not neutral. To me he's on the negative side of things, and this film didn't change my mind. Although I will say that the role of a spoiled young man fit him well.On the other hand,I've always felt Lee Remick was a fine actress, and I wish her part here had been more involved.So the plot goes like this: tyrannical Southern father (Welles) tries to control everything and everyone. A drifter type (Newman) comes to town and weaves his way into the family with lust and a thirst for power. He pushes aside a son (Franciosa) through his scheming.The problem with the concept of this film -- at least for me -- is that the presence of a "senior scoundrel" (Welles) doesn't make me root anymore for the "junior scoundrel" (Newman). About all it shows me is that there's almost no major character here who is very likable and to root for. All the men here are ne'er-do-well. It's not a very pretty picture, so to speak.This film is not so much a long, hot summer as a long, plodding tepid slog. And at the end of the slog, somehow all these low class people live happily ever after. Appalling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman as a drifter stud, Joanne Woodward as a 23-year-old spinster (!), and Orson Welles as a rich blow-hard are the main treats of this adaptation of two William Faulkner short stories concerning boyish troublemaker who arrives in small river-front town and immediately moves up the ladder to success (he ain't named Ben Quick for nothing!). Newman attempts to woo "old maid" Woodward while working for her wealthy father, who has the entire town under his thumb. Welles, looking like Jackie Gleason and enjoyably hamming it up, is a lot of fun, yet the most interesting relationship in the film is between Newman and Welles' son, Anthony Franciosa, who feels his position in the family is being usurped by an outsider (it is!). Some of the writing is unnecessarily flowery, particularly with Lee Remick in the beginning, but the characters do become stronger in the second act, although the plot never thickens beyond your standard radio play of the day. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mythic South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Long, Hot Summer is what movies are all about. Newman is so sexy it's no wonder that Agnes pleads with her friend Clara not to send this handsome stranger away too fast, even if he's a sewing machine salesman. Joanne Newman as Clara looks beautiful with her blonde hair pulled back tight and a little half twist to her hips when she walks.Although some reviewers have said this film is more Tennesse Williams than Faulkner, Clara does not resemble Williams' tragic heroines who are mired in the past. She is mightily tempted by Newman's Ben Quick, the "modern man," who advises her than the world is ruled by the meat-eaters. It is Clara who makes their first tryst possible and though it ends with angry words, it is obvious these two are meant for each other.Will Varner, played over-the-top by Orson Welles, is Clara's father. He owns everything in town and figures his holdings extend to his daughter. He wants sons to carry on his name and Ben Quick looks like the man for his Clara.The movie creates a town that feels as though it will live on after the film is over and people who relate to each other as if there was no camera present. Granted it's not the real South but the mythic South. Sex goes hand in hand with the dust and the heat. Aristocratic blood is running thin. A handsome "bull" of a stranger appears to liven things up. Newman swings his battered old suitcase with the confidence of a man who knows he'll soon be sleeping on satin sheets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Footprint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Long, Hot Summer ? Big Footprint Not to be mistaken for Wet Hot American Summer (a markedly different romp?), The Long, Hot Summer seems to be a largely forgotten entry into the canon of sweltering 1950s melodramas, mostly historically noteworthy as the project which united Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, and generally overshadowed by higher profile ballads of illicit love and family angst in the deep south. However, rather than being clouded by a haze of 'Big Daddy's odour of mendacity,' Martin Ritt's film easily has enough merit to stand on its own accord, blending a collection of William Faulkner shorts into a tale of love, lust, and lineage, just clamoring for the qualifier 'steamy'.Although the plot is definitely familiar territory, and the script errs fairly strongly on the affected style customary to the post-Actors Studio era, the story resonates truthfully and remains engaging throughout, while the alluring undercurrent of barely-bridled sexuality keeps the proceedings energetic and urgent. Ritt's direction is taut but unfussy, allowing the inherent claustrophobia and tension of the film's small-town setting to speak for itself, and the sumptuous Technicolor cinematography is so crisp you can practically smell the marsh and sweat from the Mississippi bayou (and I'm not even just talking about Orson Welles). Although the climax feels like a somewhat forced attempt to escalate the stakes simmering throughout, with an overly hasty resolution to boot, the buildup is calm and confident enough to make the viewing experience worth its while without having to fight to engage its audience.Naturally, like the majority of its contemporaries, the story ultimately exists as a vehicle to foreground the performances of the cast, who are what ultimately make the film worthwhile. Paul Newman, cementing his iconic identity as the shrewd, laconic, effortlessly cool drifter, crackles with charisma as accused arsonist Ben Quick, magnetic throughout even before his surprisingly racy shirtless scene. Joanne Woodward gives arguably the film's strongest performance as the controversially unmarried Clara Varner, practically vibrating in place from a lifetime of feeling discounted and under-appreciated. Rather than playing up her predicament, however, Woodward embodies Clara with a steely confidence, which is altogether more effective and appealing. In contrast, Orson Welles delivers the film's most legendarily outlandish performance as the resident belligerent patriarch. Notoriously mocking the Actors' Studio by mumbling almost incomprehensibly through his cartoonish southern drawl, the vociferous Welles is skilled enough to steal scenes in his sleep (which he may well have been during certain scenes), outrageously fun when hamming it up, with occasional pockets of surprising solemnity and depth, as if coming up for air from his customary grunting and snorting. Anthony Franciosa is also a sturdy presence, even if he does occasionally overindulge in Method hand-wringing and hysteria, while a cameo from the delightful Angela Lansbury as Welles' cheerily aggressive suitor adds a dash of comedic perfection.While it may fall short of the acerbic intensity of similar fare such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Long, Hot Summer still serves a healthy slice of all the smouldering, robustly acted 1950s melodrama you could ask for. If only for the incandescent interplay between Newman and Woodward, with the added pleasure of cartoon-character Welles, the film is easily worth sinking into, on a dozy, hot summer evening or otherwise.-7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one where Orson Welles tries to upstage everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite near the quality of other Jerry Wald productions, but The Long Hot Summer does have its moments.The story comes to life thanks to the real chemistry of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, who blend passion and artistic talents. But they are terribly overshadowed by a costar who can't stop chewing the scenery.Yes, the whole sumptuous affair tends to get bogged down by Orson Welles' kitschy performance as Will Varner, the southern patriarch who presides over the town and its inhabitants. Welles seems to be punching his scenes up so much that a few of the younger performers, like Tony Franciosa and Richard Anderson, seem to have a hard time keeping their composure. Welles is able to get away with the camp he exudes in a sinister film noir like The Stranger or Touch of Evil, but here it seems somewhat miscast and out of place.On a TCM 'Essentials' broadcast, Alec Baldwin slammed Welles' hammy acting. Baldwin made the comment that on the call sheets Welles was listed fourth or fifth, and clearly desperate to be regarded as the star, he pulled out all the stops in a supporting role. It's a dreadful characterization, matched only by the dreadful hair, make-up and endless Porky Pig sweat running down his face.I need a cool drink of water every time I watch Welles in this film. On second thought, make that a nice tall glass of lemonade on the veranda, honey chile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Summertime, and the livin' is easy" Or The Long, Hot Summer with Young Hot Paul Newman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the time when they called him a young new star and it was his breakthrough to stardom, fame, and success. The moment Paul Newman's Ben Quick, rebellious and irresistible drifter enters a rural Mississippi town of Frenchman's Bend to stir up its women, puzzle its men and to catch the interest of Big Daddy Varner (Orson Welles, the ferocious force of nature seemed to have fun playing Will Varner and experimenting with make-up) the town richest and most powerful redneck who perhaps sees in Ben a lot of himself, the screen legend was born."The Long, Hot Summer" (1958) is based on five short stories and a novel by one of the America's greatest novelists and storytellers, the expert of Southern life, William Faulkner, and the film is a steamy, moving, often funny (perhaps, unintentionally) tale of lust, greed, jealousy, and larger than life personalities and their clashes. I guess I need to read more Faulkner's stories because I was surprised to see the film that is based on the works of the writer known for his heavy use of such sophisticated literary techniques as symbolism, allegory, and especially stream of consciousness, the film which linear narrative is easy to follow from the third person point-of-view.Besides Paul Newman who was as talented as he was hot, his off- screen wife-to-be Joanna Woodward shines as Clara Varner, Will's intelligent, thinking daughter, the teacher in a local school whom her father wants to see married (and not just wants but takes certain steps that Clara does not like and feels offended by). The film was the first of many Newman's and Woodward's collaboration and it is not easy to recall the greater chemistry between two leads. Orson Welles dominates the screen in his every scene as expected. 21-years-old Lee Remick (Eula, Varner's daughter-in-law, sexy and innocent woman-child), Anthony Franciosa (Jody, Varner's overlooked and jealous son), and Angela Lansbury (Minnie, the woman who has her own plans about future that include a widower Varner in them) all add to the sizzling fun that "The Long Hot Summer" is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't get much more 1950s than this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: A dangerous drifter becomes friends with the richest family in a town in Mississippi More of a play than a film, this garish monstrosity combines most of the worst features of 1950s American film-making. There is simply too much music, too much make-up, too much studio shooting, too many static shots, too much of everything. Orson Welles in particular doesn't so much as chew the carpet as eat the whole darned house, in a dementedly florid performance. The two genres that age worst tend to be teen rebel and sex films, because what is provocative to one generation is tepid to another; which is exactly what happens here. The film also makes the mistake of thinking itself positively Shakespearian because it has broad Southern accents. It isn't. It's a fairly run of the mill family melodrama as daddy tries to arrange his brood to provide him with grand-kids, whilst the nice school teacher rejects Paul Newman's tough drifter in such a way that you know that they will inevitably end up together. As indeed they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well cast film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great and very balanced cast. Orson Wells made a great red-neck. Newman and Woodward played two people who were attracted to each other, but couldn't acknowledge it due to their obvious differences, and played them well.Tony Franciosa was great as the ultimate adolescent male. Angela Lansbury usually played evil bitches back in those days, but Minnie Littlejohn isn't one of them. A minor character, present in too few scenes, Minnie is given a poise and dignity by Lansbury that makes her a believable character and a subtle protagonist. She humanizes Will. Eula offered Lee Remick, even fewer opportunities, but Remick made every line count, which in acting separates the men from the boys (or the girls from the women). Eula's relationship with the family comes by way of Jody. Her relationship with him, specifically, is superficial but important to his ego and when that changes Jody directs his aggression elsewhere.The plot is a melodrama, and much of it is over the top, but it is a great melodrama and the actors make it too appealing to ignore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the first time...and walked out of the screening. Orson Welles was indeed unintelligible. Paul Newman did a nice job on the not-quite-James-Dean character. But the plot was ridiculous.I really wondered whether either Faulkner or the writers had spent any time on this planet and had any insight into how men, women, or families actually function.Also, maybe it was a really big shock in 1958 to have a school marm allow as how she wanted to have sex, but it's pretty ho-hum news nowadays, and it's not enough to carry a whole movie.I kept finding myself wishing that Lee Remick would appear more, since the other scenes were so deadly.</fullReview>

Joanne Woodward playing a spinster schoolteacher -- Woodward's a fine actress, but doesn't exactly ooze sex appeal.This turgid melodrama is loosely based on a William Faulkner story -- "loosely," because Faulkner never wrote anything so silly as this. Everything starts out promisingly enough with strong acting and a stultifying atmosphere provided by director Martin Ritt that matches the subject matter perfectly. But the plot collapses into hysteria toward the film's end, and the climax is one overheated blur.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Goodwill. Ain't nothing in the world like it".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched a pair of Paul Newman movies from 1958, and they couldn't have been more polar opposite from each other. Fortunately, his performance in "The Long, Hot Summer" is enough to make you forget he ever appeared in anything as farcical as "Rally 'Round The Flag, Boys". Future wife Joanne Woodward appeared in both films as well, and similarly acquits herself to better advantage in the William Faulkner inspired drama. Since these are the only two films I've seen Woodward in, I'm not prepared to say that I care for her all that much; I found her to be rather bland in both pictures.Orson Welles on the other hand is thoroughly over - overweight, over blown, and definitely over the top as the hell bent for leather patriarch of the Varner clan. If you need a definition for polecat, just follow Welles throughout this picture. You won't find a more condescending, self important character in film, someone who tells his own son to have the family servant dig him up some worms so he can go fishing, since that's about all he's good for. Jody Varner's (Anthony Franciosa) very existence is threatened by the appearance of the itinerant interloper Ben Quick (Newman), who quickly moves in on the family fortune.Other notable cast members include Lee Remick as Mrs. Jody Varner, playing it for all the eye candy glory one could ask for while still maintaining Southern gentility. I'd never known Angela Lansbury to sport an attractive figure until seeing her here; I guess that comes from watching too many episodes of "Murder, She Wrote" in which she appeared a few decades later. One never gets to fully understand the lack of motivation in Richard Anderson's character Alan Stewart, Miss Clara's (Woodward) erstwhile suitor who never commits. Not exactly a mama's boy, but still rather pathetic; I'd like to know what he was really thinking about.The film's title is an appropriate one, the story exudes a smoldering tension, bookended by barn burning sequences that provide Ben Quick an identity that he must contend with throughout the story. It's not until the closing scene that we understand the full import of his comment to Miss Clara right after she and Eula first picked him up on the road - "I go as far as you go ma'am".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although a Faulkner story,this movie is closer to Tennesse Williams ' dramas,without the playwright's madness and poetry.The patriarch played by an outrageously made up Orson Welles is not unlike Grandpa Pollitt in "cat on a hot tin roof":both they came back from the hospital -but Pollitt 's terminally ill,although he ignores it at the beginning of the play-,both have two sons -we can say ,that ,as soon as Welles sees Ben Quick (Newman),he knows he's the one.He's longing for immortality and he's already 61,so he wants her daughter (Woodward) to marry,no matter the lucky chosen one.Alan is a williamsian character,under his mother's thumb ,but unfortunately his old lady's got only one scene,with trite lines at that.Ben Quick,once a pariah,has become a go-getter who knows that his "brother" -played by Anthony Franciosa in the pure actor's studio tradition is a wash-out.one must notice that a large part of the cast comes from this school :Newman,Woodward,Remick..This movie has no center of gravity ,no climax;the happy end is unconvincing ,mainly the scene when Franciosa "redeems himself".I sincerely believe that Martin Ritt is better with social issues which he tackled in " no down payment" "Conrack" "Norma Rae" and even "Stanley and Iris".And Paul Newman's part,too predictable, is finally disappointing,Ritt will give him a much better job in "Hud".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long And Very-Very B-O-R-I-N-G Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1958 Drama literally reeked, from start to finish, of the movie Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (which was released in the very same year). This flick was almost like a continuation of that story.One of the only real differences in this story was that instead of being a drunken, closeted homosexual, and a rich-boy, the Paul Newman character was on the other end of the social scale, being a smart-ass, bad-boy drifter, as well as a suspected "barn-burner".There was almost no action in this movie at all.What this film's story mainly consisted of was the bitching, the complaining and the whining of some insatiable rich brats who held a deep, bitter resentment towards their wealthy, over-bearing father, a man who literally owned half the town.Anyways - One long, hot, summer day Paul Newman's drifting character steps into the middle of all of this vicious family drama and does his intrusive best to upset the whole dysfunctional apple-cart.Set in a small Mississippi town, this decidedly stuffy melodrama seemed to have a lot more going against it, than it did have going for it.I'd say that Orson Welles (who played the "Big Daddy" character, Will Varner) was one of this picture's biggest (and fattest) deficits. Every chance he got this bloated, temperamental slob chewed up the scenery to literal shreds.I think it's interesting to note that Welles and director Martin Ritt ran into some major conflicts with each other during the production of this picture.It seems that the pompous, self-loving Welles refused to learn his lines and requested that they be dubbed in later during the film's editing. This naturally angered Ritt who decided to ignore Welles and just film the scenes around him.When Welles realized that he was being ignored his vanity couldn't take the blow. And, so, somewhat reluctantly, he did finally begin to participate in this film's production like a good boy.All-in-all - I found The Long, Hot Summer to be a less than satisfying movie-experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under The Orson Wells' Sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This southern, William Faulkner tale relies heavily on so many south of the Mason-Dixon line clichés and atmospherics that one almost has to laugh out loud at most of them. Yet it is still enjoyable to watch Orson Wells as Will Varner, the perspiring, cigar chomping Mississippi kingpin desperate to have a grandson before he dies--at whatever the cost. Wells blusters and bulls his way through the entire movie disgusted with his wimpish son Jody played convincingly by Tony Franciosa. Varner watches disconsolately as Jody spends his time chasing his wife Lee Remick around the house instead of settling down and making babies and taking control of his marriage. Lee Remick, for all her talents, is little more than a sexpot curio for Franciosa. As for Joann Woodward, Varner's unmarried, strong-willed daughter Clara, she is determined not to settle for second-best with long-time beau Richard Anderson who's wealthy, available, and a MaMa's boy. Both of Varner's offspring are grave disappointments to the wealthy patriarch who knows time is running out on him as his two childless children waste their days on the Mississippi plantation.LONG HOT SUMMER is actually based on a classic Faulkner short story, BARN BURNING, the tale of a pyromaniac whose son runs off and gets blamed for setting fires in other towns. Newman is excellent as Ben Quick, the drifter who stumbles into the Will Varner universe and stays there once he gets a load of Joann Woodward. And Angela Landsbury as Varner's companion, Minnie? It is possibly Landsbury's most wooden role since her forgettable 1940's musical days. She pales without substance under the colossal Orson Wells sun. For Wells mushrooms larger than life in every scene he's in latching on to Newman as a viable candidate for his daughter who'll give him a grandson. The younger Varner explodes in fury and jealousy and tries to kill his father and frame Ben Quick--before coming to his senses.One of the best scenes in the movie is when Newman convinces Franciosa that a treasure is hidden on the plantation. Franciosa, overcome with excitement that it might just be the trick to secure his father's approval, digs furiously six feet down, finds a bag of old coins, and rushes them to Varner only to have his father laugh in his face and tell him they are worthless old pieces of fool's gold. Always a pleasure to watch Newman and Woodward together, LONG HOT SUMMER was supposedly the first movie the couple made after they were married. Which they still are---a Hollywood novelty for sure. Trivia: LONG HOT SUMMER contains many filmed errors that made the final cut. Some of Orson Wells' scenes are hilarious to watch for the great actor's robust, absolutely incomprehensible southern drawl. Watch, listen carefully, and you'll roar!Dennis Caracciolo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Cast Set the Screen on Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Long, Hot Summer (1958)*** (out of 4) Con man Ben Quick (Paul Newman) is accused of burning down a barn so he's forced to hit the road where he winds up on the farm of the Varner family. While trying to woo the daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) Ben also strikes up a partnership with her father (Orson Welles), which doesn't sit well with the son (Anthony Franciosa) who can't ever seem to do anything right.THE LONG, HOT SUMMER was the first collaboration between Newman and Woodward who would be married shortly after this film wrapped production. The film is known for that but it's also known for the heated on-set battles between Welles and director Martin Ritt. These two things usually take a lot of the spotlight away from the film itself and that's really too bad because it's a pretty good soap opera from Fox.The term "soap opera" will be seen by some of a criticism but it's certainly not meant to be. There were countless movies made during this era that likes to be over-dramatic at times with a strong sexuality and a blazing music score going in the background. This film here has the benefit of some great locations, a pretty good story and of course some legendary actors doing great work. I will admit that the one really weak thing is the music score, which is constantly blaring at the wrong time and taking away from the actors and their magic.As for the cast, the heat that Newman and Woodward were feeling off the set certainly burned on screen because the two have some wonderful chemistry here. There's no doubt that they bring a lot of smoke to the screen and the two manage to capture the sexuality of the story as well as the dramatic nature of the love story. Welles is also excellent in his part as the fiery father. Again, Welles had various issues on the set but I thought he was very believable in the part. Franciosa, Lee Remick, Angela Lansbury and Richard Anderson are all very good as well.THE LONG, HOT SUMMER features some terrific cinematography and director Ritt certainly knows how to milk all the sexuality from the story. There are certainly some flaws throughout the movie but the star power alone makes it a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie In a Little Context</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wealthy local tyrant in the deep South runs roughshod over his son and daughter until an equally sharp stranger drifts into town. For better or worse, this 2-hour movie has about all the earmarks of a 1950's A-production. Consider the following: wide-screen Technicolor, (no little b&amp;w TV here); strong acting, (the New York Method has invaded Hollywood); a sex suffused plot, (just don't go beyond kissing); a contrived happy ending, (send the audience home feeling good); and no thought-provoking politics (there's a Cold War going on). All of these are present in spades in this slick production, marking results very much a creature of the time.I can see why the devilish Ben Quick amounts to Newman's breakout part. I expect girls were swooning in the aisles. That combination of manly chest, deep blue eyes, and tricky smile must have struck deep from Maine to California. I like the way the screenplay builds Ben's battle of wits with old man Varner (Welles) into mutual respect. They're like two circling foxes that may not like each other, but a mutual shrewdness commands respect. On the other hand, Woodward's Clara presents an apt contrast to both Dad and Ben. Woodward's excellent as the proudly self-contained Varner daughter. The actress makes her resistance to the assured Ben not only believable but compelling. Considering what must have been going on off-camera between the soon-to-be-marrieds, makes Woodward's on-camera distance a real accomplishment. All in all, Clara's may not a glamorous role, but it is a pivotal one.Then there's Welles as the obnoxious paterfamilias and local tyrant. To say he over-does his role would understate the result. But, according to IMDb's trivia, he's not about to let this bevy of Method graduates overshadow the great man. (Contrast his version of a big daddy with Burl Ives' calibrated version in the thematically similar Cat on a Hot Tin Roof {1958}). Frankly, I thought Franciosa miscast as the weakling son, Jody. The actor's natural forte is a strong personality. To me, his efforts here strike a sometimes hollow note. There's no really cohesive plot. Instead the narrative is more like an album of how a dysfunctional family finally comes together. The production does a good job of providing authentic southern background, filming extensively in Louisiana. Those dirt roads the horses escape on are both revealing and atmospheric. Then there's Richard Anderson's enigmatic Alan Stewart. His stiffly proper bearing remains an interesting wild card in the mix. It's not clear, to say the least, why he rejects marriage to the willing Clara (Woodward) and life on easy street. The screenplay sort of implies he's a mama's boy, but that doesn't come through in the dramatics. My guess is that he's, oh my gosh, gay, a topic that 50's Hollywood could not safely broach, but would explain his behavior with Clara. On the other side of the coin, is Lee Remick's wanton little Eula. With her low-cut frocks, I was hoping director Ritt would find more reasons for her to lean over before the camera. Oh well, the teasing titillation is also very much indicative of the time.Anyway, the movie's generally over-heated but still entertaining, with colorful characters, and sometimes sharp dialog. Maybe most importantly, it's the first of Newman's rascally characters that he would later raise to a near art form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summertime, and the living's easy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Martin Ritt and actor Paul Newman worked together on "Hud" and "Hombre", two masterpieces. Their work on 1958's "The Long, Hot Summer", in contrast, is mostly overcooked trash.A raging rip-off of the works of Tennessee Williams and the films of Elia Kazan (despite being based on several William Faulkner stories), "The Long, Hot Summer" abounds with Southern Gothic and Southern Literature clichés. There's its sweltering hot, antebellum landscapes, its old slave homes, its fat, wealthy land barons, its disgruntled proletariat, the baron's bickering sons, its sexy, ultra masculine drifter and of course a cast of Southern women, some of whom are docile, some fiercely independent, some sexually frustrated, some promiscuous, some in need of being tamed.The film's plot is irrelevant. Better to instead focus on the film's few scenes featuring actor Orson Welles, who plays Will Verner, a hilariously bombastic family patriarch who also owns most of his small, Louisianan town. Newton is superb as well, always slick with sweat and dressed in sexy white vests. The film sports some great dialogue, and is actually well written in parts, but simply can't escape its many clichés.6/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "This Property is Comdemened".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was young, I read The Sound and the Fury and a couple of novellas (Old Man, The Bear) by Faulkner. I conceived a dislike of this man's writing that has stayed with me until this day. His tortured prose makes that of late Henry James a pleasure to read in comparison. Faulkner writes as though he were telling Homeric legends, but without the clarity and simplicity of Homer. The script fashioned by Ravetch and Frank out of various stories has the great benefit of humor and a kind of easy sexuality that is very enjoyable to watch.The Jody Varner character makes no sense--how can he be virile with Eula and impotent with his father? Franciosa seems very unsure of himself in every scene. Ben Quick and Clara have such a great time together: Newman and Woodward are establishing a rapport that would last 50 years. The story needed a convincing patriarch, and there was no-one better than Orson Welles to play Varner. I don't care if his make up was shoddy or his accent virtually incomprehensible, he is wonderful. I could have given it 10, had there not been inconsistencies of plot and characterization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tennessee Williams vs. William Faulkner - who stole?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1958 was certainly the year for Paul Newman and southern drama. He appeared in both THE LONG HOT SUMMER, adapted from Faulkner short stories and one novel, and Williams' CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF. The coincidences don't end there.SPOILERS FOLLOW IN ANALYZING THE PLOTS:Both works have an overweight "boss" - Will Varner in the first, Big Daddy in the second. Both have returned from a hospital visit. Although Big Daddywill have a terminal diagnosis, Varner has seemingly none at all, although we expect any moment to learn otherwise, as Varner seems pushed to get his first daughter married and pregnant, which would seem to indicate he is aware of his mortality.Varner has an ineffectual son, Jody, who can do nothing right. Big Daddy has a son who can do nothing right, Gooper. Both Varner and Big Daddy have a fondness for the characters played by Newman, Ben Quick and Brick. There is a strong, defiant woman in each, Clara Varner and Maggie.Switching to Williams' SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, Newman plays a drifter, Chance Wayne. In THE LONG HOT SUMMER, Newman plays a drifter, Ben Quick. In THE LONG HOT SUMMER, Varner has a local mistress, Minnie. In SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, the Big Daddy character, Boss Finley, has a local mistress, Miss Lucy.So you can see someone stole from someone. Since the names of the Faulkner stories are not given credits, unless one is a Faulkner scholar, one can't look up the publishing dates. These could be applied to the dates both of Williams' plays premiered on Broadway. I tend to think there is a good chance that it was Williams who stole these plot ideas from Faulkner. It might be an interesting topic for a school or college paper.As far as the film THE LONG HOT SUMMER goes, it is compelling, constantly interesting, superbly directed by Martin Ritt, and universally both well cast and well played. The heat between Newman and Woodward off screen leaks convincingly on screen, helping the performances of both. Welles steals the film as the patriarchal tyrant, Will Varner - I would have given him an Oscar nomination for this performance. Lansbury is wasted in a small role as Varner's mistress, as is Remick as Varner's vapid second daughter. Franciosa is excellent as the unloved son, his pain and frustration constantly evident. However, it is Woodward who shines best. Her character is level-headed, sensible, but passionate beneath. She is as much a cat on a hot tin roof as is Williams' Maggie, seething beneath the surface with sexual passion, but unable to fulfill it.Playing CAT and SUMMER as a double bill would be an interesting event for a college level class with discussion following.SUMMER is an excellent film, well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a sultry and self-pleasing melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Pride and Prejudice love story sited in Mississippi in the 1940s, can only cover half of this film's hub, directed by the famous "Orson tamer" Martin Ritt (MURPHY'S ROMANCE, 7/10), the other half is about a rough-diamond father's eagerness to marry off his maiden daughter and give an impetus to his incompetent son. The story impresses with a contingent proposition of provincial male chauvinism and women's self-liberated modern viewing, but a gratifying finale dents its eloquence and leaves a sour taste of bathos. First of all, it is the first-collaboration of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward couple, crowned a BEST ACTOR trophy for Newman in Cannes and the follow-up to Woodward Oscar-winning role in THE THREE FACES OF EVE (1957, 7/10), thus, a chief delightfulness hinges on their chemistry in their battle of wits as a charming but reckless suitor Ben Quick (Newman), an infamous barn- burner, and the demure but strong-mined rich lass Clara Varner (Woodard), and as we expected, the sparkle is tantalizingly ignited through their first scene together, Clara is driving with her sister-in-law Eula (the young and chirpy Lee Remick), who is talking to the hitchhiker Ben in quick fire ebullience, yet, Ben's focus is solely on Clara, whose dismissive attitude intrigues him and for men in a motion picture, this is the one worth conquering. Soon here comes the local big enchilada, Will Varner (Clara's father, a port Orson Welles) is back from hospital, resolves to find a suitor for Clara, he shapes a proxy father-and-son relationship with Ben, which instigate the rancor from his own son Jody (Franciosa), Will is a leading role for certain (strangely Welles is fourth billed), at the age of 43, Welles has to act out an old man of 61, with a little help from a senior makeup, a fake nose and his authentic stoutness, anyhow, it is a convincing job, although one should be prepared not to be shocked during his first entrance. Adapted from William Faulkner's novel, The Hamlet amalgamating with his stories Barn Burning and The Spotted Horses, the film at its best when spinning out a poor-boy-rich-girl romance with perky momentum, and at its worst, when the patriarchal arrogance pervading with its stale stench of prejudices diminish women's worth without any hint of redemption. It might be a rural leaning reflecting the reality then, but take the example of the excruciatingly designed role of Minnie Littlejojn (Lansbury), it is an agony of miscast and a smug snide on the gender-biased gold-diggers, not a sign for its future audience. Moreover, a more mystifying evasion is the ambiguity belies the true color of the mommy boy Alan Stewart (Anderson), for whom a wishful-thinking Clara falls for 6 years. Lastly, the set piece where Ben dupes Jody into digging ancient coins is a far-fetched plot device never rings plausible under any circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great psychological drama of a dysfunction family before the term was invented.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is another trip to "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" territory. Orson Welles is Will Varner, William Faulkner's version of Big Daddy, but this time, he has the rather frigid Joanne Woodward as his daughter, and Paul Newman (here much more sexually alive as Ben Quick than he was as Brick in that Tennessee Williams classic). Secondary couple Anthony Franciosa and Lee Remick play the Jack Carson/Madeline Sherwood parts, but are MUCH more likable. Drifter Newman arrives in town, having been accused of burning a barn nearby. Already, his name is known. He takes on Welles, who actually seems to like him in spite of his mistrust. Welles is desperate for a grandchild, and Newman seems to be a better studly match for Woodward than mama's boy Richard Anderson. There seems to be some homosexual undertones for Anderson's character who still lives with the seemingly overbearing Mabel Albertson (yes, Darrin's "Bewitched" mother, oh, those sick headaches). Of course, in 1958, it is not mentioned outright (as it wasn't as well in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"), but it's fairly obvious that there's something the handsome but closeted Anderson isn't revealing. While there isn't great chemistry on screen here consistently between Woodward and Newman (married in real life, and partners in quite a few films), they do heat up in a few moments. It is much more interesting to see the work between Newman and Welles. The heavyset patriarch seems at first that he'd never like someone like Ben Quick, but when Quick immediately stands up to him, he begins to consider him like the son he wish he had instead of weak Anthony Franciosa. Quick is soon working in his store, then moves into the Varner house, and finally is ordered by Will to marry his daughter. It seems that this Southern patriarch has no class dividers; He thinks that a studly man like Newman would keep his daughter satisfied and under his thumb as long as babies are being born. What he doesn't count on are two thing's: Franciosa's sudden twist of hate, and Newman's determination not to be controlled by a man he does admire, but would never let dominate him in the way he so obviously wants to. That makes for great drama.Unfortunately, the beautiful Angela Lansbury is wasted as Welles' gal pal; She has a few nice scenes in which she is excellent as always. She is also quite beautiful here, not the harpy of some of her MGM films and certainly not the monster mama of "Manchurian Candidate". Eight years later, she would win Broadway immortality as "Mame", and there are some hints of what she would do in that part here. The beautiful Joanne Woodward had come off her Oscar Winning work in "The Three Faces of Eve", and does fine, but her screen presence as a romantic heroine wasn't established yet. She seems to be one of those actresses more comfortable on stage than screen. She is also one of the few who seemed to get more beautiful as she got older, but it appears that she was being bred to be a new Grace Kelly since that actress had gone and left Hollywood to live with a man of some means in Monaco. When Woodward got films like "Rachel, Rachel" and "Summer Wishes, Summer Dreams", where she could really show her acting chops and not just be another beautiful Ice Princess, she was fantastic. She would have to wait until the studio years were fully done in Hollywood before she could command such roles.Newman, Welles, and Lee Remick get the most outstanding parts. Remick is another one who seemed to be another Grace Kelly on the rise, but here, she gets to be flirtatious even though married to Franciosa, who can't seem to tame her. A scene where local boys call for Remick while her entire family is present is very revealing of what this family is all about. The film is beautifully photographed and a lush musical score (including a lovely title song) adds to the luster of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is No Southern Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wealthy but repulsive curmudgeon named Will Varner (Orson Welles) lords over a small Southern town, spouting out orders and expectations to everyone in his orbit, especially his two grown children: Clara (Joanne Woodward) and Jody (Anthony Franciosa), neither of whom have any kids. Thing is ... papa Varner wants grandchildren, to carry forth the Varner empire.One day a drifter named Ben Quick (Paul Newman) wonders into papa Varner's orbit. Quick has developed a reputation among the locals as a no-good drifter. But he's handsome, and he's ambitious, self-assured, bold, and swaggering, just what Will Varner is looking for in a future son-in-law. And therein lies the basis for conflict among the various characters.I didn't much like this film. The plot is cliché-ridden, with clearly a trend toward pasteurized outcomes, wrought by paternalistic Hollywood script writers. Further, all the characters seem fake. Will Varner is highly stereotyped, and so is Ben Quick. Clara is aloof and unapproachable. Jody exists only as a convenient foil for his overbearing father. In short, the script seems watered-down, sanitized from what it could have been.Casting is poor. Most of the actors are not convincing as small town Southerners. Orson Welles tries too hard. And his overdone makeup makes him look grotesque. His character comes across as an aging Charles Foster Kane with a garbled Southern accent.The wide-screen Cinema-Scope projection is annoying. Color photography is too bright. Visuals look stagy, artificial. The overall tone of the film is way too spry, vibrant, pastoral. At times, it's almost like a musical. I kept waiting for Ben Quick to burst into a rendition of "Oh What A Beautiful Mornin'". I could have wished for a darker, more foreboding tone, suggestive of dripping, smoldering Southern Gothic."The Long, Hot Summer" makes a good cinematic vehicle for Paul Newman. And the story's underlying concept is okay, despite its lack of originality. But a dreadfully bland script, poor casting, and an unfortunate visual style sabotaged what could have been a really fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has as much to do with Faulkner as pigs have to do with flying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Faulkner must have cringed if he got to view this Hollywood concoction presumably "based" on some of his stories. The silly and mish-mash plot has little or nothing to do with Faulkner other than a snippet here and there from many of his disparate and distinct novels and short stories, thrown together willy-nilly and then left to devolve into a story only Hollywood could dream up.Please don't blame Faulkner for the silly story and plot, and if you've never read Faulkner, I'll let you know right now that this movie is the very antithesis of his writings.That said, let's look at what makes the movie worth watching: Paul Newman. Newman's rebellious persona, steely gaze, gritty backbone, undeniable charm, gorgeous blue eyes, and disarming smile are all put to exquisite use here, and he's simply a pleasure to watch, from start to finish. Joanne Woodward plays opposite him in what must seem in retrospect an inside joke for the both of them, as they were finally able to be married right after filming the movie. Woodward plays an attractive but uptight yet strong-minded schoolteacher, and holds her own with Newman, and occasionally breaks out of her mold to dress and look quite appealing. All in all, the two of them make the movie watchable, even enjoyable.The rest of the cast and characters (and the aforementioned plot) are pretty off-putting, though. Even Orson Welles is fairly uninteresting and is not his usually handsome magnetic self. Perhaps he should have dispensed with the huge fake nose he wore.Do watch the movie, though, for Newman -- for Newman and Woodward. They really make a fine pair, and Newman is stupendous.</fullReview>

Newman stars as Ben Quick, a drifter who infiltrates the family of Mississippi patriarch Will Varner (Orson Welles, quite corpulent, and looking similar to his character in Touch of Evil), his son Jody and wife Eula (Anthony Franciosa and a smoldering Lee Remick) and umarried daughter (Woodward).

		<fullReview>I loved this film in the 60s and read most of Faulkner because of it. I was delighted--it held up well!!! Of course, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward have a magical, real chemistry--they are so beautiful together. What was surprising to me (seeing it after all these years) was Orson Welles (deliciously alive and crude as Will Varner) and the rich performances of the secondary characters. William Walker (Lucius) has particular dignity and gravity. Beautiful young Lee Remick (Eula Varner) and Sarah Marshall (Agnes Stuart) are also very appealing. The film was a visual treat, lush in colors and spirit. I feasted on the setting--the rural south of 40+ years ago (no McDonalds or Walmarts, no plastic, no A/C.) The plot is creaky--the film's weakest element--but the dialogue was lively and clever. It was fascinating to revisit the world that existed before feminism and the civil rights movement--that feature of the film is an education in itself. Overall, I greatly enjoyed seeing it again.</fullReview>

The dialog is superb, in a class with such greats as "His gal Friday and 'All about Eve". Paul Neuman and Joanne Woodward are magical together. I don't think I have every seen a couple with such chemistry on the screen together. The supporting cast is also wonderful. Lee Remick is in the flower of her youth and beauty. Orson Well is crude and delicious, you may have to put on the dialog mode when he speaks. Tony Franciosa is pathetic in crying out for his fathers love. Some of the structure is a little dated and hollywoodish, but it is the script deliver by Neuman and Woodward that carries the show. It should be required viewing for all wantabe writers, or maybe not. The movie might just discourage them from pursuing that kind of a career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good looking street smart drifter of tainted provenance attaches himself to rich family. Read some of the other reviews on how the script cut mangled and Hollywoodized Faulkner--they are interesting won't repeat them. Books made into movies are often a disappointment--they have to be massively condensed or the script won't fit into 2 hours--rarely do a good job.This movie actually aged fairly well for 50s star stuff. The themes are dark enough to avoid the terminal corniness that is so often present and downright painful to watch in movies from that era.A few observations...Why is Orson Well's make-up so heavy dark and unconvincing? Why are the Southern accents so fake sounding in a high end movie like this? Was it hard to find speech tutors back then? Little is more authentic Americana than an authentic deep South accent-- -unconvincing ones are distracting and irritating and give an amateurish feel. I got sort of bored about an hour into the thing...but overall it holds your interest surprisingly well....RECOMMEND</fullReview>

Newman is solid as an ambitious worker trying to escape his past. Welles steals the film in a wonderfully hammy performance as a larger-than-life character who rules over not only his two meek children but also the entire town. Franciosa is fine as Welles's wimpy son, but Woodward's performance seems somewhat wooden. Remick is given little to do except look pretty, which she does well. In the first of six films he made with Newman, Ritt creates an atmosphere befitting the title. The plot element concerning fire-starting is rather silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great fun! A really entertaining picture that brought Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward together. It's taken from several stories by William Faulkner, but it's really closer to Tennessee Williams than anything else. Newman is Ben Quick, a smart drifter with big ambitions and a noose already tied around his neck, as a "barn-burner" (but he's never been convicted). He immediately gets under the skin of spinsterish (but she's only 23!) schoolteacher Joannne Woodward. Her character Clara is one of the Varner's, and patriarch Will Varner (Orson Welles) runs the town. He takes turns in emasculating his son (Anthony Franciosca), married to a flirty Lee Remick, and ordering Clara to get married.As the film goes on, it gets hotter and hotter, emotions fly and we have a heck of a firey conclusion! Newman and Woodward have awesome chemistry (well, of course they had to!) and they are just so sexy together, firing great dialogue back and forwards. If I had him, I'd wake up smiling, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a lesson from Turner Classic Movies, AMC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Movie Classics dug through their vault and showed this Twentieth-Century Fox goodie this evening and, as has been their consistent wont these days, did not letterbox it. (Let's not get into all the annoying advertisements and genuinely asinine AMC promotions with which they now interminably interrupt every film they show!) Movies of this era were planned, shot and usually much enhanced with the use of CinemaScope. "Formatting" them to fit the square screen of a TV just ruins the enjoyment, at least for those of us who had the good fortune to see this exceptionally well-cast studio product in a theatre, with stereophonic sound, a DeLuxe Color print that hadn't yet faded (a process which was notorious for doing that in the first years of its use), and so forth. Turner Classic Movies shows films as close as possible to their original width ratio (and without interruption...yes, because it's a subscription channel, I know!) If it was photographed in CinemaScope, Panavision, Technirama, Techniscope, whatever...that's the way their broadcast attempts to reproduce it. I certainly wish AMC would do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Husband and wife team Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward made several movies together and this was the granddaddy of them all.Paul Newman plays Ben Quick, an accused (but never convicted) "barn burner"--i.e., he burned down people's barns out of revenge if they ticked him off! Ben is also a very, very slick operator and in local big-shot, Will Varner (played by Orson Welles), he finds a kindred spirit. Both are very power hungry and not too concerned about how they get it. Will gets the idea of marrying Ben to his daughter, Clara (Joanne Woodward) because he wants to have a rough, tough, he-man for a son-in-law capable of both running his business and producing a whole brood of tough boys! In a way, it sounds like he is looking less for a future husband for Clara and more a big stud mare! Well, Ben is crude and aggressive and in many ways a jerk, but something strange occurs when he begins courting Clara. He begins showing that there are some good attributes as well and a genuine interest unexpectedly results in nice-girl Clara! What happens next as well as how the barn burning comes into play is really something for you to find out yourself.Compared to some other Tennessee Williams plays, this one is a lot less sleazy and the bickering is much more subdued--sort of like "Tennessee Williams Lite". But, we are still left with a very interesting plot, magnificent acting and an exceptional movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Newman's breakthrough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Quick (Paul Newman) is accused of burning down a local farm, so he's kicked out of his town and moves to a local place by the name of Frenchman's Bend in Mississippi.At first everything seems fine for Ben, although a few townsfolk have issues with his attitude and attire - often dressed in an undershirt and pants, no shirt.Will Varner (Orson Welles) is the town's "king," basically, having almost complete control over everything. He hires Ben to work in his store.Will takes a liking to Ben and suggests that he try and date his daughter...however Ben is hesitant and thus forms an interesting romantic triangle."The Long, Hot Summer" has always been, as far as I am concerned, the film that put Paul Newman on the map. I have always heard it referenced to as his breakthrough - so I was surprised to come to IMDb a few months ago and only see about 1,000 votes for the film altogether! That's 1/150th of the amount "Lord of the Rings" has! Obviously "LotR" is far more popular with today's audiences, but still... I expected it to have more of a reputation - hence more votes - on this site.So I bought the film on DVD to see for myself what the deal was...was it a classic or not? I'm happy to report that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Newman is one of my favorite actors so just about anything he stars in is worthwhile in my opinion. However he really does help elevate the material.Orson Welles is of interest as well to any fans of the actor...he gives a good, strong performance here.If you enjoyed "A Streetcar Named Desire" or other "sensual" and "steamy" films of the era, "The Long, Hot Summer" is about as sweltering hot as you can go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Long Hot Summer (1958 Dir. Martin Ritt) The '50s have got to be the most sexually twisted decade this country has ever seen. And Tennessee Williams was there to articulate all the nastiness on everyone's minds. This movie stars Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward shortly before they were married in real life. The action takes place down south in the summer and new town arrival Paul Newman is suspected of being a barn-burner. Lots of action with Newman taking off his shirt and talking to Woodward about how he's gonna pluck her like a flower, and ride her like a philly and squeeze her like a lemon with Woodward standing around getting all flushed in the face.Papa Orson Welles likes Newman too and keeps telling his daughter Woodward that at 22, it's high time she up and married and started breeding him a brood so he has someone to leave the plantation to. Also stars '60s stud Tony Franciosa as a weak-livered, spineless good-for -nothing offspring of Welles whose jealous as hell of Newman coming into town , and just making him seem even more pitiful than usual. Oh, and Angela Landsbury as a horny townswoman banging Orson is thrown in for good measure.</fullReview>

Paul Newman is Ben Quick, an alleged barn-burner, who drifts into a sleepy small town, the whole of which seems to be the property of Will Varner, (Orson Wells, going way over the top), during that long, hot summer of the title.Quick is aptly named as it doesn't take him long to make his mark as the son Varner would rather he had instead of feckless Anthony Franciosa. Joanne Woodward is also on hand as the prim school mistress daughter who has the hots for Quick, (just as Woodward had the hots for Newman, who probably never looked more beautiful on screen). Others on board include Lee Remick as Franciosa's trashy wife and Angela Lansbury as Welles' mistress and they are all good value. Lushly photographed in widescreen by Joseph LaShelle and with a good score by Alex North this remains something of a forgotten treat.</fullReview>

This film resembles "Streetcar" in more than one way. The acting for example is of equal intensity, with Newman in a similar performance as Brando's. And the story, about sexual tension, attraction, repressed feelings,... is also pretty similar, although it's been executed in a entirely different way. But the difference is that this film is far less stagy than "Streetcar", more interesting and eventually more involving. It's a bit too "soapy" at times, especially near the end, but this is certainly one of the better films of the 50's, with excellent performances and portrayals by especially Newman, Woodward, Franciosa and Welles. Only Remick and Lansbury's characters are not really fleshed out. But that doesn't keep this from being a very good film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi, is a town that's never seen much change. Will Varner (Orson Welles) owns everything in town and doesn't allow any competition. But that's all about to change now that Ben Quick (Paul Newman) has arrived in town and has his eye on Will's daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward).From William Faulkner's novel, "The Long, Hot Summer" has several things to look at. The title implies more than air temperature; there's the tension between the various characters. As for the theme of everything suddenly changing, that makes sense; in 1958, America - and the whole world - was going through some major changes.There's just one thing: I read that the studio changed the ending for this movie. Does anyone know anything about that? Because I've never actually read the novel.Oh well. The overall point is that Martin Ritt's first major movie is quite impressive. The three main stars turn in top-notch performances, as do Anthony Franciosa, Lee Remick, and Angela Lansbury. As for the question of whether or not this movie glorifies the South...well, they didn't glorify it the way that "Gone with the Wind" did. You'll probably like it.</fullReview>

Clinton, the football team that we beat in December 1961 for the state football championship. Now I can look at the film, and remember how that place looked back then.Now, 45 years later we see that Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward are still married. They are still working. Lee Remick was lovely in one of her early roles, but she died in 1991. Orson Welles was only 42 years old but looked heavy and old, no where near his slender, striking self 17 years earlier in Citizen Kane. He died in 1985 at the age of 70."The Long Hot Summer" is a classic, for the time, the setting, and the actors.</fullReview>
