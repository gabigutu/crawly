		<fullReview>I think this 62' remake of STATE FAIR doesn't deserve the bad rap it's been getting and has in the past. While it is not a great musical, it certainly has its credits. Yes, the original is better, but let's give credit where credit is due for this re-make. First of all it was great to see Alice Faye back on screen. She did a more than admirable job, as did Tom Ewell as Abel. They are definitely on par with the orginials. Pat Boone is quite wonderful as Wayne, better that Dick Haymes. Bobby Darin was his usual egotistical self which fits the character well, although I like Dana Andrews a bit more. The real standout is Ann-Margret. Not only is her one splashy number great, but she really shows her acting chops, especially in her final scene with Pat Boone. You can certainly see why she became a huge star and has been working for over 40 years and still is. Sorry to see her in her drunken frumpy roles, however. The only real disappointment is Pamela Tiffin. She looks the role but is unlovable as Margy. She looks and acts a bit snooty. Jeanne Crain was terrific in the original. The new songs that were added were good to great. The story changes were also interesting, although it looks like bits and pieces might have landed on the cutting room floor. Interesting that in both versions of the film, the parents never meet or have scenes with the kids boy/girlfriends. Now that this movie is on DVD, it should be a must seeing for all fans of STATE FAIR. Stero sound, wide screen a real fair as opposed to the orginals matte studio sets. A nice commentary by Mr. Boone as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute, if somewhat overdone remake of the '45 musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it, although it is not up to par with it's 1945's predecessor. The 1945 film was absolutely charming, and this one does fall short in some areas. The romances do not seem quite as fulfilling as in the earlier version, yet the musical numbers are something to gawk at.Ann-Margret is stunning at the beginning of her career and practically steals the show. Pamela Tiffin is charming and surprisingly manages a southern accent very well, while the hopelessly miscast Pat Boone is giving it his all to be a Texas farm boy and it just doesn't seem to work out. However Bobby Darin is darling as a self - centered reporter who falls for Tiffin without realizing it. The remake uses all of the songs from the original musical, minus "I Owe Iowa" which was replaced with "The Little Things in Texas" due to the change in setting. Its new songs are very good, and while Margret's jazzy remake of "Isn't it Kinda Fun?" raised a few eyebrows, the musical direction is very well done and fully satisfying.Really the only drawback to this production is in comparison with its two earlier versions. The love stories in the 1945 version were more complete, the acting a little more sincere, and the story more innocent. This 1962 version obviously had a much bigger budget to work with and it comes across in the musical numbers. It is a worthwhile production and a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>State Fair - A Grand Night For Singing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the "updated" version of the original State Fair. The locality of this remake is Texas, not Iowa, as the original version was, which may make it seem "bigger" but not really "better". Alice Faye (who was in the original) is great, and Bobby Darin stole the show as the smooth talking big town guy, while Ann Margaret sparkled as she sang and danced during her production numbers, "Isn't It Kinda Nice". The music is wonderfully done, as always, and I truly wanted to enjoy this film more than I did. Boone was musically at the top of his form in this film and makes a valiant try in the dramatic parts of his role of Wayne, but the dramatic parts were just not as believable as his singing. The musical scenes were very good, and made the movie fun! It's a whimsical look back at a time which probably never was this clean cut. However, I do remember the importance of State Fairs, with its 4-H and farm demonstration, carnivals, family atmosphere, and introduction of young people in domestic and farming activities. To win FIRST in anything at the State Fair is BIG stuff. This part of the film rings very true. The plot is thin, because the music was the important part of the film. A DVD is currently available of both versions of "State Fair" (1942 and 1962 version). Anyone interested in comparing the two should view this DVD. Still "State Fair", whichever version you view does have songs which make it a "grand night for singing". Joyce</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this film received less than favorable reviews at the time of its release, but I have always enjoyed it and watch it at least once or twice a year....there is something about the hominess and wonderful music that draw me to it in this day of mostly special effects in movies.It is a tired old story and as others have stated, it has been filmed several times before, although, I think the array of young stars and their talents are well displayed and it was nice to see a couple of "old timers" like Tom Ewell and Alice Faye liven up the proceedings, which concern a family's adventure at the Texas State Fair; when I do compare it to the 1945 version, both seem very appropriate for the time they were filmed; Vivian Blaine made a wonderful Emily, as Ann-Margret does in the 1962 version, and both are "knockouts." Ann-Margret holds a special place in my heart, as she is originally from the Chicago area, and went to high-school with a good friend of the family; he told us that all eyes would turn when she entered a classroom, as she was such an imposing radiant figure and this was at seventeen or eighteen years of age....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Great State Fair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, I wish everyone would stop comparing remakes with the originals. I will be the first to admit that sometimes a remake doesn't make it such as Bette Midler's version of Gypsy. She once said that she was born to play Madam Rose; Oh No She Wasn't! Bad Choice! So, what about the remake of State Fair? Well, for one thing, the cast was better than the original and there was the look that it was really filmed at a State Fair. I guess we should say that the original movie was good for its time, and the same thing can be said for the remake; that it's good for it's time! Another thing that this remake has going for it is the extra songs that was not in the original: Sweet Hog of Mine, very funny, with Tom Ewell actually doing his own singing; Never Say No To A Man sung by Alice Faye to her daughter Margie played by Pamela Tiffin; Willing and Eager sung by Ann Margaret and Pat Boone; You're Not An Angel sung by Bobby Darin to Pamela Tiffin; and The Little Things In Texas sung by Tom Ewell and Alice Faye as they take a ride on the Merry Go Round at the Fair on the last night of the Fair.Once again, Margie's voice is dubbed, but this time by Anita Gordon and in case anyone is interested, in the original, Jeanne Crains voice was dubbed by Luanne Hogan. Other than that, everyone did their own singing in the remake in which the songs were more energetic than they were in the original. Ann Margaret's version of Isn't It Kinda Fun with David Street, another Cincinnati, Ohio talent, was a lot better than in the original, and That's For Me made more sense when Pat Boone sang it while watching Ann Margaret walk away from him in her sexy walk obviously copied from the Marily Montoe walk that Marilyn was so famous for ever since she filmed Niagra! Having Alice Faye come out of retirement was a good idea for 20th to pull off. She wasn't too happy with the movie and the way it turned out, but who cares? Just seeing her again on the screen and still being able to sing in her throaty style was great to hear, and no one could spit out the line the way she did when she told Pat Boone how she felt about Margie's boyfriend Harry when she claimed that Harry was about exciting as watching grass grow! Great version! Loved it! Much better than the very stage looked first version, and it still proves that Our State Fair Is Still a Great State Fair!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in the 2nd grade at Lakewood Elementary and I can remember a man coming into our classroom and telling us he was going to make a movie at the State Fair and he needed kids to ride the merry-go-round, and who wanted to be in it? We all raised our hands. I ran all the way home from school and ran into the house shouting to my Mom that "I am going to be in a movie". And I was! Our job was to ride the merry-go-round and sing. We sat underneath a tent, while we were taught the words to the song (of course professional child singers were who you heard). I can name almost every one of the kids you see in the move, including me.My Dad had to get me a social security number so I could get paid $25.00 per night for two nights. The cool thing is that my social security number is listed out of California. My Mom took me shopping and let me buy a doll with the money I made.Oh, the memories! Our State Fair is a great State Fair, don't miss it, don't even be late. Its dollars to donuts that our State Fair is the best State Fair in our State! Vicki A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For 45 years or so, this remake of State Fair has been unfairly judged going back to the original reviews. In spite of that, it was a hit then and it should be a hit today. It's a great family film, the kind they don't make anymore, plus morals - something we don't have in movies today!! Jose Ferrer really outdid himself as a director. He keeps his young actors in line and the cute little plot moving along. It's got beautiful photography and wonderful choreography from Nick Castle.For even longer than 45 years, the world has been pretty critical of Pat Boone which has been undeserved. Well, he shines in this one! Those acting lessons from Sandy Meisner really paid off in his scenes with Ann-Margret. He's simply terrific and "in the moment". Not only does he have a great set of pipes, he looks wonderful without his shirt, he does acrobatics and that duet with Ann "Willing and Able" is just about the sexiest... no, the hottest number to come out of a musical from that era. West Side Story didn't have a number like that! Wow-wee! Pat should have been a big movie star based on what I saw in this movie as well as a the great recording artist he was at that time.Ann looks awesome is shorts and her big number, "Isn't it kind of fun" is really well done.All in all, the movie has really aged well and people should check it out with their families and decide for themselves. Don't listen to those grumpy people who don't like this movie (or Pat).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see the reviews, I see the number ratings, I don't understand.In my opinion this is an excellent movie. I'm not a movie critic, I don't have a degree in film arts or even drama. I'm just a retired high school math teacher. That said, I find so many things about this film to be so positive and endearing.Pat Boone is great, Ann Margaret is beautiful and the the rest of the actors were so enjoyable. The songs and music are outstanding and best of all you can understand every word of every song. Yep, you guessed it, I'm an old guy, I'm 63 and I had the pleasure of seeing this film on its first run in the theater in Nashville, Tennessee. I loved it then and I loved it tonight after watching it for the first time in 40 years on the new DVD widescreen Cinemascope release. I still have the LP vinyl 33 1/3 RPM original movie soundtrack. Love it too.Some critics seem to feel that everything is too polite, too sweet, too clean to be realistic, but I'll tell you, that's the way it was where I grew up 40 years ago. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did tonight. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best... just ask the audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, the 1945 version of STATE FAIR has been considered the critics' favorite, while the out-of-print VHS of the 1962 remake sold for large sums in dark corners online. Clearly, the 1962 version has always been the audience favorite, despite any barbs from historians and the R&amp;H organization, which openly dismisses it. There are flaws, to be sure -- notably the lack of chemistry between Bobby Darin and Pamela Tiffin -- but the strengths of the film far outweigh its shortcomings. If something was lost in translation between rural Iowa and urban Texas, the location photography virtually serves as a documentary of 1960s America, a time when technology was just beginning to rear its ugly head in American industry. While the 1945 version had a Technicolored charm to it, the remake's location shooting captures the excitement of the midway in a manner no studio backlot could possibly convey. The CinemaScope lens was invented for a film like this, and the 'you-are-there' sensation is strong as footage from the 1961 Texas and Oklahoma fairs sprawls across the wide screen.The casting is terrific for the most part, though, as aforementioned, Tiffin and Darin are at dramatic odds with each other. Neither was costumed or photographed flatteringly. Director Jose Ferrer manages to conceal Tiffin's ethereal beauty at every turn, while Darin's role suffers from uneven characterization and, surprisingly, the fact that he is given only two opportunities to vocalize. However, the rest of the cast compensates for this. Pat Boone and Ann-Margret convey the culture clash of country boy/city girl more powerfully than actors in either the 1933 or 1945 versions. Tom Ewell is obviously having the time of his life as Abel, and Alice Faye complements his efforts in unexpected ways (from Faye's accent, it's clear that Melissa isn't from Texas originally, that she ended up there as a result of marrying Abel). There is also a maturity in Richard Breen's script that is lacking in the whitewashed 1945 version. Witness the scene toward the end, where Abel (Ewell) comforts his devastated son Wayne (Boone); it is obvious that Wayne has lost his innocence to Emily in the physical sense, something that hadn't been hinted at since the 1933 pre-Code version. Finally, musical director Alfred Newman gives the remake the lush, no-expense-spared orchestration the music demands, on par with the instrumentation Fox lavished on earlier Rodgers and Hammerstein films like CAROUSEL, THE KING AND I and SOUTH PACIFIC. The 1945 version was scored before the Fox studio orchestra was augmented in 1953; stereophonic sound and doubling the amount of musicians gives 1962's STATE FAIR a full, rich sound that finally allows the score to take its rightful place alongside other R&amp;H masterworks. Much has been written about the fact that Richard Rodgers' additional songs weren't up to the six originals, but they are necessary -- the original score contained only one character-driven song, and no love songs at all, so even if they are sub-par, "Willing and Eager" and "This Isn't Heaven" are welcome opportunities to allow the two couples to express themselves in song, and the charm of Faye and Ewell's "It's the Little Things in Texas" compensates somewhat for the loss of "All I Owe Ioway." Moreover, the additional songs transform a mini-musical into a true musical. STATE FAIR is a treat in any of its incarnations, each of which captures the era in which it was made. The 1933 version has a Depression-era sensibility that emphasizes how much that week in Des Moines meant to poor people who spent all year working the land; the 1945 version glows with a colorful, idyllic post-WWII optimism; and the 1962 remake spotlights the clash between rural life and urban gentrification. When it's all said and done, STATE FAIR will be remembered for its glorious words and music, and nowhere are these heard to better advantage than in Alfred Newman's lovingly scored charts for the 1962 remake. It's time that critics and historians embrace the remake. State fairs by nature are garish and gaudy, and so is the film. It is by far the best rendition of this property.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on TV today for the umpteenth time and still enjoy it although it is not as good as the 1945 version; so it must be the talent or direction. Nevertheless, the great Hammerstein music is there "It Might As Well Be Spring", "It's A Grand Night for Singing", plus many more sung by Pat Boone, Anne-Margaret, Tom Ewell, and Alice Faye who came out of retirement of 20 years to do this version. As usual she has always been my favorite. I met her in Santa Barbara one year at the Arlington Theater where she was promoting a product. I have her autographed photograph in my collection. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third and probably the last remake of State Fair is this one which came out in 1962 and starred current pop stars Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Ann-Margret, and Pamela Tiffin. The first three did their own singing, Anita Gordon's voice dubbed Tiffin. That continues a tradition from the second State Fair where Jeanne Crain's voice was also dubbed. The Frake family changes states in this one though. The first two films had them in Iowa, but here they're Texans and they go to the State Fairgounds in Dallas. The change in states also necessitates a new song for the score with the parents played here by Tom Ewell and Alice Faye. The Little Things In Texas is done with grace and style by these two veteran performers. Alice who has aged gracefully into the mother role also has a solo where she gives her daughter Tiffin some sage advice about handling the new man in her life Bobby Darin. Never Say No To A Man, but definitely keep him guessing.The main body of the score that Rodgers&amp;Hammerstein wrote for the 1945 version is kept intact though. Again ironic that the Oscar winning song from the 1945 version is again dubbed. It Might As Well Be Spring comes out of the mouth of Tiffin as it did with Jeanne Crain. Maybe one day someone will sing it for real on screen.My favorite song from the score is It's A Grand Night For Singing which is one of those numbers that just leaves you with a glow. It's sung by the entire cast, both generations who are just celebrating life and love at the State Fair. It's sung by the main players wherever they are at the moment in the case of Bobby Darin and Pamela Tiffin on the Ferris Wheel at the Fair, the same as Dana Andrews and Jeanne Crain did in the 1945 version. Recently I learned that Andrews was a good singer, but kept that fact from 20th Century Fox lest he be cast in silly musicals. So all we get of him is a few lines with Crain and the chorus pretty much drowning him out. However with a real singer in Bobby Darin that necessitated writing one good number for him. Richard Rodgers who did both the music and lyrics as he did for No Strings on Broadway wrote for Darin a rather plaintive ballad This Isn't Heaven which Bobby sings well. With musical tastes changing I doubt we'll see another remake of State Fair. Where are the voices to sing the songs? So I would say take the advice that opening number, it's a great state fair, don't miss it don't even be late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in the theater as a nine-year old and loved it. I saw the film again the other night on DVD and what do you know? I still loved it. The silliest criticism that I saw about this film concerned the location filming at a real Texas State Fair. This criticism offered the theory that the people at Fox couldn't afford to build proper sets for the film due to the financial drain of "Cleopatra", so they had to settle for cheaper location filming! The location filming and the wide-screen sweep of the fairgrounds are what add to the appeal of this film. Also, not one review that I read commented on the exciting auto racing sequences which were certainly well-staged. The five additional songs written by Richard Rodgers were lovely and in the tradition of Rodgers and Hammerstein. The performances were uniformly good, especially Ann-Margaret, whose first movie filmed this was. ("Pocket Full of Miracles" was released first but filmed second.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>partly successful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third film version of 'State Fair' (and the second musical version) is only partly successful, although it is nowhere near as bad as reviews of the time would have you believe.Margy Frake this time round is played by newcomer Pamela Tiffin, who is rather colourless (and has her voice dubbed as Jeanne Crain did 17 years earlier). Her squire at the fair this time round is called Jerry and works for that new-fangled media, the 'tube' or TV. He's played by Bobby Darin who looks far too old to be chasing Tiffin - perhaps that is why a couple of references were added in this version about her age.Pat Boone, in one of his few film appearances, is really rather good as Wayne Frake, who is now a racing driver, and of course he does his own songs and rather well. As the show singer Emily, Ann-Margret is embarrassing and too trashy; I always find her a bit OTT, as she is here.The Frake parents, Tom Ewell and Alice Faye are charming and both have songs created for this version which were not in the '45 film, including a charming duet when they are out on the midway.The new songs, written by Rodgers alone as Hammerstein had died by the time the film was created, are a mixed bunch. 'Never Say No To A Man' is just plain odd, although is a nice number for Faye's voice. 'Sweet Hog of Mine' fits perfectly, although some of the others feel like padding. Now the Sate Fair has relocated to Texas, we have a new song to replace 'All I Owe Ioway', this time it is 'The Little Things In Texas I Love'.Although watchable, the relationship between Jerry and Margy in particular does not have the easy romance we saw in previous versions; while Emily does not gain the audience sympathy her character should.A misfire, then, but a fascinating companion piece to the earlier version and it is useful to see them released together on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this version upon first suburban release in late 1962 at our local Marina Theatre in Rosebery Sydney Australia. At the time, as kids, aged 8 we thought it was great fun. I think we also saw IT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD'S FAIR soon after.....also THE VON TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS and some other Elvis fun. I do remember singing all the way home "our state fair is a great state fair... etc'" so tonight 44 years later it was fun to remember the rest of the song and a few others. But....... STATE FAIR 1962 is really slow and badly filmed. Made during the CLEOPATRA cash drain of '62, the budget constraints are very obvious and Fox's keenness to take advantage of an existing State Fair to avoid set and staging costs can be easily identified. STATE FAIR is just not interesting. To 8 year olds in the 60s it was color and movement and comedy all in a big theater on a big screen. In my 2006 DVD cave by myself (not the intended premium viewing suggestion) it is a tough slog. Some surprises both good and bad: Sluttiness galore from Ann-Margret especially in one of the worst dance numbers of all time to rival both Susan Hayward in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and the glomesh Ganesh opening from GUMNAAM...it's a rag doll kids number that rips itself apart into some devil dance with star trek guys and A-M in some Cher leggy outfit...... and more startling is the shirtless sexy scenes of Pat Boone (no kissing now... but have some nipples). These minor horror amusements lift the film into watchable, but as a musical of farm folk a-la Oklahoma for us city slickers it does not register now as an adult, as very good at all. Wally Cox appears to judge the brandy laden mince... and eek! Tom Ewell and his beer belly serenade a hog. How did this man ever get a role? He was awful and unappealing in every film he made including The 7 Year Itch and The Girl Can't Help it. Alice Faye just looks like she wishes it was 1945 again. So did I. ...you might too even if like me, you weren't born then. Interesting to see Bobby Darin certain to ride a Vespa scooter after his star turn in Come September. Fox wanted to include that imagery in the trailer for sure. Sorry STATE FAIR lovers. Ann-Margret's legs and Pat's pecs get the gold stars. The fab 60s neons of the time and the Jetson's style fair rides are particularly interesting design of the time. I starting hearing other R&amp;H songs in the background (Iam sixteen... etc) recycled into theme music for this. Have a listen in some drama scenes with theme music. Those lilting riffs do come from other R&amp;H pix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1945 version of this is a nice, down-home slice of hokum with some good songs and winning performances, but the 62 remake is more of a mixed bag. It's like the director couldn't decide quite how to pitch the film - to go for the older audience, nice and cosy like the earlier film, or a bit harder-edged, with the jazz and rock n' roll influence to the fore for the teenagers? It all seems a bit uneasy, somehow. It's the music that saves it. Many of the original songs survive and there is a handful of new ones thrown in the mix too - the best of which (for me) are 'Willing &amp; Eager', the instrumental linking piece and the truly beautiful 'This isn't Heaven'. But the one that sends me away grinning and happy is 'The Little Things in Texas', a duet with Tom Ewell and Alice Faye (doesn't she have a comely voice?) clearly enjoying themselves with this slightly saucy song. I could listen to this song over and over, it cheers up my day no end. I'll take the 45 version please, but the 62 one has much to recommend it despite its patchiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the novel on which several Hollywood movies are set tells the story of a farm family headed for the state fair. Dad is a dreamer and mom an overenergetic worrier. Sis is anxious to escape her home town and does so the minute a city boy offers her the spontaneous, unplanned opportunity. Bro looks eagerly forward to soon taking his over dad's farm but is temporarily distracted by an honest, brazen showgirl who shows him a good time but in the end advises him to stick to his chickens and hometown girl. The six leads are this time crooner Tom Ewell married to crooner Alice Faye. Sis is crooner Pamela Tiffen enticed by city boy crooner Bobby Darren. Bro is crooner Pat Boone enticed by brash showgirl Ann Margret. The familiar songs work but the new songs don't the upgated setting to a different American era shows the same principle works for every generation. I like it because grandma had this adventure around the time the original black and white movie was filmed and mom had this adventure around the time this musical was filmed. As generic nostalgic Americana it works. As a cinema extravaganza it pleases but not wows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why the critics hate this film so much is beyond me. I found it to be a decent remake of the 1945 motion picture. This movie stars Tom Ewell, Alice Faye, Pat Boone; in great singing voice, Bobby Darin, the fantastic Ann-Margret and Pamela Tiffin. The makers up-dated the story to Texas and made changes here and there. I like the 1945 version better, but that doesn't make this film any less enjoyable to watch. The critics go on and on how they hate this movie. Why? What is so bad about it? The singing is great as are the production values. If you want to see a truly horrible remake look no further than the T.V. version of SOUTH PACIFIC or THE MUSIC MAN. Don't listen to the critics and just watch and enjoy this wonderful version of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's STATE FAIR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you really enjoy musicals then this is fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are an aficionado of the 1945 version then perhaps you will be disappointed in this 1962 version, but for everyone else this is a big budget, star studded, Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with all the attributes that presents. This may not be the best Rodgers and Hammerstein musical but if you like the genre then this is, if nothing else, a charming bit of 60s Technicolor nostalgia with a lot of songs, pretty scenery, Pat Boone looking and sounding great in his prime and a gorgeous Ann Margaret delivering a knockout version of "Isn't It Kind of Fun?" To me that number alone make this a must see.I can understand the criticisms that I've read here on IMDb but I think the point of watching old musicals is to escape reality for a while and have joy. By that standard State Fair delivers. If you like musicals and you haven't seen this one by all means see it. There really are precious few films in this genre so don't allow the naysayers to deprive you at a chance to escape to a simpler time and place and have some fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Things In Texas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>State Fair was a novel by Iowan by Phil Stong. So far, three films were made from it. Two were musicals. This musical is a remake of the earlier one from 1945. The book is excellent and was made into a reasonable faithful movie in 1933. Keep in mind it's about an average farm family going to a Midwestern fair in the middle of the Depression. The daughter asks her brother if he ever felt like raising a little hell. They both proceed to raise a little, then come back to the farm considerably changed by the experience, as do the parents, who have their own adventures. The 1945 film sanitized the story somewhat, brightened everything up with Technicolor, and added songs by the great Broadway team of Rodgers and Hammerstein (their only musical written expressly for the screen). 1962 saw Hollywood going even farther, literally, taking the story out of Iowa altogether and relocating it to the massive Texas state fair - retaining the R&amp;H songs and a lot of the plot - and throwing in some of the plot of the 1933 version as well (Wayne - Pat Boone- having an adult affair). Well now you have a product that maybe has too many compromises and changes to really be successful. New songs have to be written because the parents can no longer sing "I Know All I Owe I Owe Ioway". But Hammerstein is dead so Rodgers writes some new tunes by himself. And the little - but effective, serious - story about farmers going to the state fair has become a bit larger. And now it seems not to be so organic. When Ann Margret sings "Isn't It Kind Of Fun" and it's turned into a bump and grind kind of number on a set suggesting the flames of hell...well, Toto, we aren't in Iowa any more. While the highlight of this version is probably the location shooting at the actual Texas State Fair, I have to question how you can take a story about Midwesterners and just transplant it without further ado other than a few new songs and references. It seems a bit off all the way through.To accommodate the setting, or maybe just to be different, the old songs were forced into places they weren't meant for, originally. "That's For Me" (well sung by Pat Boone, in a lovely arrangement) was originally sung by Vivian Blaine as a dance-band number. It worked, in that setting, but doesn't really work here, performed as a "book number" at a race track. Boone has just met sexy Ann-Margret, and as he watches her walk away across the fairgrounds, he bursts into song. Improbably.It's one of several times the remake goofs in splicing a song from the former film into a new place. And "It's A Grand Night For Singing," so wonderful in the '45 film, is just thrown way. Why?It does help to have a spirited Margie, and both Gaynor, and the lovely Jeanne Crain, from 1945, had spirit. Pamela Tiffin is lovely but very subdued and seemingly shy, which unfortunately works against the energy of a movie about a girl excited to be at the state fair and away from the dullness of the farm. I kind of liked her, though, since she's one of the few people in the film who manages to seem real, and who keeps her dignity. The cast is really pretty good but they seem to be doing things they'd rather not.Jose Ferrer had directed a few very good pictures in the '50's, including The Shrike, and The Great Man, but he seemed to fail in the '60's with this musical and the sequel to Peyton Place. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why they should never make remakes of classic films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STATE FAIR--the 1962 version--is barely watchable. If it weren't for the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein songs, it would be a complete misfire. As it is, it just makes you yearn for the simple charm of the 1945 version that starred JEANNE CRAIN, DANA ANDREWS, DICK HAYMES and VIVIAN BLAINE in the roles occupied here by PAMELA TIFFIN, BOBBY DARIN, PAT BOONE and ANN-MARGRET.Jose Ferrer really struck out with this one, eliminating all the charm of the Technicolored version starring Crain as Margy, the girl who meets a newspaper man and falls hard. Then too, FAY BAINTER was ideal as the homespun mother worried about her chance of winning the prize at the fair for her jam, while here it's an ill-used ALICE FAYE making a sentimental return to Fox after years of retirement from the big screen.The songs are done only adequately, no more, and ANN-MARGRET cheapens the story with her interpretation of the singer at the fair. And even ALICE FAYE's throaty way with a song seems diminished by time.Summing up: Completely tasteless, boring version of the "American as apple pie" musical that first surfaced in 1945.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty sad "State"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having enjoyed life as a novel, then as a 1932 straight film, followed in 1945 by a buoyant, Technicolor musical version, this time out (a musical update) the charm has almost been wrung completely out of the property. Resetting it in Texas instead of Iowa (in order to utilize the sizable, real-life Texas State Fair) wasn't automatically fatal. Draining as much joy, texture and flavor out of it as possible is what pretty much kills it. The Frake family is gearing up for the annual State Fair and each member longs for it for a different reason. Father Ewell is eager to show off his prize hog Blue Boy, mother Faye is entering the pickles and mincemeat competitions, son Boone wants to exact revenge against a former foe in the car races and daughter Tiffin awaits any kind of stimulation, having felt bored and restless in the face of her dull future. They set out for the big event and soon Boone is canoodling with performing dynamo Margret and Tiffin has caught the eye of TV reporter Darin, who's covering the fair in all its glory. As the big celebration continues, each of the Frakes must sink or swim in their respective fields, the younger ones hoping to hang on to their sudden romances. Ewell runs hot and cold. Sometimes he's amusing and sometimes he looks quite blank, though he does have one nice scene with Boone when Boone gets drunk for the first time. His solo, lying in the sawdust and singing off-key into a pig's face is the low point of the film (and quite a comedown from Marilyn Monroe, his costar in "The Seven Year Itch" of several years prior!) Faye famously ended a 15-year, self-imposed retirement to come back for this. She was reportedly lured back in order to work with director Walter Lang (who had directed her in her previous career and had been slated to direct her in the 1945 version of this story in Vivian Blaine's role) and to star opposite Don Ameche. Unfortunately for her, both Lang and Ameche ended up nowhere in sight. She's slender and attractive, but alternates between looking bored, disappointed and distracted. She isn't helped by having a role that is just above a prune-faced doormat. Unlike Fay Bainter, who spun it into a memorable characterization, her heart just wasn't in it and it shows. Her singing is adequate, but smoking had affected its warmth and tone by this time. Boone is well-cast in his role and sings very nicely. He's appropriately wholesome and handsome and naive. Tiffin, apart from a reasonably expressive lip-synching session in her first moments, barely bothers to move her facial muscles thereafter and gives a very wooden, one-note performance. The less said about her attempted accent the better. She is quite curvy and attractive nonetheless. Darin has zero chemistry with her and his hotshot schtick wears thin very quickly. There is no reason why Tiffin would fall for him other than the fact that the script dictates it. At least Margret's appeal is more than obvious. She trots around in skin tight and abbreviated outfits that show her young body off to its best advantage. The camp highlight of the film, though, is her way, WAY out version of "Isn't it Kind of Fun?" What was originally a lilting, cozy ballad is here transformed into a phantasmagorically awful production number with Margret and some creepy performers in rag doll wigs and costumes that are eventually tossed off to reveal beatnik, goateed dancers in tight red pants as A-M grunts the song through her throat and gyrates all over the stage! Hilarious! The makers seemed to be bent on bleeding anything from the script that resembled the simple origins of the story (and thus gave the story it's appeal!) For example, instead of the mother going up against an old, fussbudgety adversary in the food judging, now it's a corporate company. The mincemeat judge gets tipsy, but nothing ever comes of it but some hiccups. Instead of the son trying to win back money in the carnival games, now he's a racer. Instead of a newspaper man, the reporter now works in TV which makes for a lot of dated and dull trappings. There's nothing of drama in Boone and A-M's relationship such as another love interest or even her character's big revelation from the 1945 version. She goes into a tizzy over one overheard comment and that's it. Tiffin's boyfriend back home is now a scooter-driving egomaniac instead of the plastic-obsessed nerd he was prior. The added songs only demonstrate how instrumental Hammerstein was to the pair's success, though they aren't exactly horrible. The show's most famous number "A Grand Night For Singing" is practically thrown away rather than becoming the unifying and rousing tune it should have been. Enough of a seed of the plot line exists for a certain amount of interest to remain, but it all comes off as badly recycled. An otherwise unintentionally hilarious DVD commentary by Boone does include the comment, "...our State Fair is the best State Fair in our state... Think that one over!", which is truly funny when one analyzes it! He can go on all he wants about the integrity of his character and the family values of the film, but the fact remains that a) his character bedded down a showgirl without the benefit of marriage and b) his character would rather run a fellow race car driver off the track, risking both their lives, than win the race or let the other man win, solely in the name of revenge! Not exactly the moral fiber he revels in evangelizing about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pat Boone to Ann-Margret: "Are you a...bad girl?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Third film-version of Phil Strong's book, and the second to include a song-score by Rodgers and Hammerstein, has been "updated" for young audiences circa 1962. Squeaky-clean Bobby Darin, Pat Boone and Pamela Tiffin are all wholesomely attractive, but these current names are merely used to service a still-corny and old-fashioned story (it hasn't dawned on the filmmakers that 1962 is nearly two generations removed from 1945). On the other hand, Ann-Margret manages to energize the sterile scenario with her titian hair swinging, hips grinding and puckered mouth pouting. Texas fair attracts local farm family, with smitten Boone falling for showgirl A-M, who doesn't exactly want to become a hausfrau on the range (who could blame her?). Awkward and curiously lethargic, with Tom Ewell singing to a pig and Alice Faye (out of retirement) looking sadly uneasy in front of the camera. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, José. You blew it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the 1962 version wanting to like it, loving Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein as much as I do. It starts off weak but watchable, then gradually descends from mediocrity into a stinking mess. The 1945 version had magic in its light touch and simplicity. There was gentle humor that made me laugh out loud. Each scene generated a different shade of emotion. It all added up to a delightful, happy experience. The 1962 version is dead as lead. The only emotion it generated in me was a queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach, and its awkward scenes made me groan out loud. The two young romances start out with clashing encounters that should have been the end of it, yet for no apparent reason they quickly turn into torrid affairs. There is zero chemistry. As things progress without any plausibility, you want to turn away from this train wreck. The dialogue gradually gets worse, until it sounds like it was written by a hack. I did get one laugh from Wally Cox judging the mincemeat, but they omitted the pickle judging, which was the real highlight. No subtlety here. The acting is good enough, but the Bobby Darrin character is way overwritten and, as a result, overplayed. What does Margy see in such a jerk? Conversely, what does Ann-Margaret, playing a super hot chick from NJ, see in a dime a dozen Texas hick? Yeah, like she's gonna live out on the Texas plains. Oscar Hammerstein, who wrote the lyrics and screenplay for the 45 version, had died in 1960. The Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein class and polish is missing here. Richard Rodgers was still alive and wrote some new music, including the lyrics. It's nothing special, sadly. Even the old numbers just don't seem to fit in with the story line. As I watch this, I see pretty pictures on the screen, swelling music in the background, and feel no emotion. And believe me, I tried. Why José Ferrer was chosen to direct is a complete mystery. He had no great hits as a director, and was an inconsistent and generally over- rated second string star. I don't think he understood humor, and he doesn't seem to understand emotion, either. Hammerstein wrote the screenplay for the 1945 version. Of the names on the writing credits from the original, the only one still alive was Paul Green, but he was 68 years. Richard L. Breen wrote the screenplay for the 62 version, and left only a handful of lines from the original. This is the wrong way to remake a successful movie. Many of the lines, especially in the second half, seem to have been tossed off, as though they were for a first draft, and sometimes seem disconnected to the action, as with the father's comment after the race. Comparing the two versions leads me to believe that musicals should not be portrayed too realistically. A reviewer complained about the 45 version, that it was obvious the makers had never been to the real Iowa State Fair, which misses the point completely. In the 62 version, they did, and it flopped. Musicals are not about reality, but an alternate reality, a fantasy; after all, people in the real world do not suddenly break into song and start dancing. But they should still have some plausibility and continuity. The concept of State Fair is eternal: hick boy meets city girl, city boy meets hick girl, they kill some time together at the fair and end up falling in love. This doesn't work when you turn them into caricatures who fall in love when you throw a switch.It is obvious that by the 60s, a 1945 musical with poor sound was dated; and it was natural to want to remake it in stereo and widescreen. They could have kept as much of the original script as possible and updated it as necessary. This might have worked much better. This more radical approach could have worked if it had had better writing and directing. The problem is they didn't understand the concept of the original, why it was so successful, namely the gentle humor, the understanding of human nature, and a happy story line. The 62 version still might have worked if the romances had been developed effectively. But when all three of these key elements are missing, there's not much left. What's left are some big name but ephemeral stars of the day: Bobby Darrin and Pat Boone. Trouble is, few people really care about Darrin and Boone these days; the newcomer Ann-Margaret is still hot, though, and became a fine actress. The acting is not bad, on the face of it, but when you look closely, they don't seem to be interacting, even when they sing duets. The other element that's left is the early 1960s culture scene. However, this short period is a tired replay of the 1950s, and lacks the pizazz of the sizzling Sixties to come. Spoiler alert:The last 20 minutes are painful, so pour yourself a stiff drink first. The song about Texas is unbearably bad (not your fault, kids). And the ending was changed. The bottom line: I'd like to see someone like Steven Spielberg dust off the original 1945 script and do a really fine remake. Don't let this one put you off watching the magical 1945 musical.Footnotes: I know of at least one large state that has two state fairs in different regions, so the title song actually makes sense. If you look up recipes for mincemeat and brandy, you can find several references to the movie. I wonder if the judges at state and county fairs have caught on?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaden and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I am very fond of the 1945 film, I was eager to see this remake. By all means I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the 1945 film, but at least to be watchable. This 1962 State Fair has its moments, but overall I found it very disappointing. For starters I found the pace very stodgy and Jose Ferrer's direction leaden, also Ann-Margret's dance number was torrid and overdone. The story was not a strong point of the original, but it was still charming and had plenty of cute scenes. The plot here however was dull and flimsy on the whole, and the characters aren't likable, Emily and Wayne particularly are under-developed. Of the cast, Ann-Margret and Bobby Darin for me were the only ones that stood out, Pat Boone is miscast and Alice Faye looks bored and sounds tired. Her song was seemingly a showpiece for her, but was just odd both in how it was placed and some of the lyrics. I will say the film does look very nice and the songs mostly are wonderful, though a few of the new songs are just serviceable. All in all, a leaden disappointment. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word: AWFUL. BARELY recognizable as the same movie from 1945. Trying to draw parallels between the elegant Vivian Blaine and Ann-Margaret who comes off as trashy is just pathetic. And Pat Boone, though I usually enjoy him, was not at all good enough to fill Dick Haymes' shoes. Furthermore, Bobby Darrin is not fit to CLEAN Dana Andrews' shoes. What was the point in completely moving the setting to Texas? Aren't they conceited enough down there? There was no real plot, the development of love between the two couples was completely unbelievable, the reworking of what original scored remained was horrendous, and half the cast sounded like bullfrogs when they sang. Now I know why I got it for free when I bought the original. Save yourself the misery and waste of time and if you get the two-disk DVD set like I did, then you've got yourself a free coaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have, to be honest, not seen State Fair, but finds it very interesting that legendary rock'n roll pioneer Gene Vincent played the role of a crippled singer in State Fair. But unfortunately his part was cut out in the clipping room. Back in 1962 Gene Vincent, the hit recorder of such classics as "Be-Bop-A-Lula", "Blue Jean Bop", "Lotta Lovin'" and "Dance To The Bop" hadn't had a hit in US for nearly five years but in Europe it was something else and he was called "The King Of The Ball-Rooms". Gee, how I wish a DVD release would feature Gene's part of the movie too. It sure would make thousands of rock'n roll enthusiasts -to whom Gene Vincent is God- wanna buy the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall once seeing an "In Production" ad in an early '60's film yearly announcing 20th Century Fox's remake of "State Fair" starring ARTHUR GODFREY!!!(the only star billed in the ad). I'm glad it didn't happen, but I think it explains "More Than Just A Friend" and "It's The Little Things In Texas". If the role of the father was being built up for the remake, the placement of two additional songs for the character makes sense, and could even have been Hammerstein's idea, although he didn't live long enough to write the songs. And these two songs almost sound as if Rodgers was keeping Arthur Godfrey's "folksy" persona in mind. With Godfrey no longer involved, the story (and billing) again focused on the two young couples, but the song spots for the father remained. My guess is time restraints curtailed further script development. Arthur Godfrey-star billing, Tom Ewell-fifth billing. Go figure. (Do I like this film? No.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the 1945 and 1962 versions of "State Fair" back to back. My aim was to heckle them like the characters on "Mystery Science Theater 3000" do to crummy movies. I did so with the first one (namely during the taste-testing scene when I said that someone had put LSD in the punch). I did so to a lesser extent with the second one, just since I'm not inclined to heckle Ann-Margret. I should have heckled the movie a whole lot more given the presence of Pat Boone.* Basically, both versions are totally hokey. Bobby Darin probably spent the last decade of his life regretting that he starred in this. The one good thing about the movie is that Ann-Margret looks really fine in some of those outfits. But that's it. Quentin Tarantino should make his own version.*When Boone appeared in "Roger &amp; Me", he praised GM CEO Roger Smith (even after Smith had ruined the livelihoods of everyone in Flint). After a movement to overturn the infamous Prop 8 arose, Boone equated it with the terrorists who took over a hotel in Mumbai. More recently, he's wedded himself to the Birther movement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anyone actually follows commentators around from site to site, I remarked somewhere else that R&amp;H musicals tend to be problematic in their film realizations. I mentioned as exceptions The King And I and State Fair. In retrospect, TKAI has the eternal problem of non-native casting (who cares?--you tell me you knew Rita Moreno was Top-Tim the first time you saw it), while Oklahoma is probably as great a movie musical as has ever been filmed.Anyway, to the point regarding State Fair. When I complimented it, I was referring to the cute little entertainment filmed in 1945. This remake is fatally flawed by making the situation between Pat Boone and Anne-Margaret so steamy (way out of character for the time and the genre), and by the re-working of that innocent and tuneful number "Isn't It Kind of Fun," which makes it almost not G-rateable.It is inconceivable that R&amp;H had any artistic control over this movie, or they never would have allowed such a travesty.</fullReview>
