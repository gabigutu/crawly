		<shortDescription>great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not like the other R&amp;H musicals - its ten years older, for a start. It has Jeanne Crain, young and pretty and as fluffy and fun as she was in Margie - and a more perfect fit for the other roles you would not find (Vivian Blaine in another great film musical role to rival Miss Adelaide, Dana Andrews (an odd choice but who else could you imagine?), Dick Haymes in great voice, Fay Bainter and her mincemeat, Charles Winniger and his prize pig). It is a gooey pleasure something similar to eating chocs when you know you really shouldn't ... highly recommended - great tunes. And avoid the remake with Pat Boone and Ann-Margret. No comparison. This is the one to watch - 56 and still fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesser Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, and corny, too - but FUN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the 1933 film version of this; I wish I could say the same about the 1962 mistake, the one with that Black Hole of movies, Pat Boone, a man so bland, he sucks the color from anything he's near. THIS version, however, while certainly not up to what many would probably consider Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein 'standards' (MGM, desperate to release a Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical, but stymied by the continuing run of "Oklahoma!", quickly made this new version of "State Fair", according to information on the DVD), is gloriously corny, old fashioned, innocent, warm, romantic, those-were-the-golden-days fun, with at least two songs that have truly entered the realm of 'classic': the Oscar-winning "It Might As Well Be Spring" and "It's A Grand Night For Singing". The story is simplicity personified: a mid-western farm family heads to the State Fair. The parents have their eyes and ears on winning their respective competitions (he, for his prize pig, Blue Boy; she, for her pickles and mincemeat), while the children, both young adults, find love and heartache along the way. As the parents, Fay Bainter, born to play mothers, is her reliably warm self, while Charles Winninger brings solid humor to every scene. Dick Haymes plays the son, and gets to sing a few tunes, quite capably, and has a bittersweet romance with Vivian Blaine. (Alas, their union is the only unsatisfactory note in the entire movie: it is established Haymes' character has a sweetheart he's hooked on but when she cannot accompany him to the Fair, he almost immediately falls for Blaine and is straight-away promising his undying love for her, seemingly forgetting about his love back home...until the final moments, when he suddenly has her in his arms. It's a false, almost jarring note.) But Jeanne Crain, despite this being an ensemble piece, easily steals the show, and though it's a shame she didn't do her own singing, she still manages to ably give the impression of a restless young woman yearning for something 'more'. Her romance, perhaps the real core of this film, with Dana Andrews, seems much more real than that between Dick Haymes and Vivian Blaine, and they have definite chemistry, which makes the required "happy ending" a delight. Do I wish it had more weight, more heft, to it, like "Oklahoma!" or "The King &amp; I"? Well, the movie is what it is: a light, airy, corny piece of Americana. Were R &amp; H pandering to the tastes of the common man with this movie? Sure they were! But what's wrong with feeling good? Who exactly is harmed by classic songs, winning performers, a simple story line, and a happy ending? If you're looking for weightier or darker fare, there are any number of musicals to whet your appetite; however, if you're looking for pure fun - and for great tunes that'll stick in your head all day long - look no further: here it is! You'll have a terrific time at THIS "Fair".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful slice of Americana-Nothing more, nothing less!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful look at an America we will never see again-tuneful, romantic and a Happy Ending! State Fair never claims to be the end all and be all, just a sweet look at the tradition of the State Fair put to music. This movie (and the ensuing Broadway Musical) stand on their own next to Oklahoma, Carousel, South Pacific, King and I, Sound of Music, etc.Jeanie Crain and Dana Andrews play their scenes so effortlessly, you forget its just a 3 day romance. Dick Haymes and the eternal Vivian Blaine have a chemistry that works much better then the Pat Boone version.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a break from the tired old action/violence/cheesy comedies of today-it's as much an image of summer as cotton candy and candy apples!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in 1945, when I was completing 5 years in the Royal Navy. I was stationed in Kure , Japan, (5 miles from Hiroshima). We were the first British naval personnel to land in the area after the end of WW2, and services and accommodation were very primitive. When things started improving, we got our first film, "State Fair" with the gorgeous Jeanne Crain 'singing the Oscar winning song "It might as well be spring" The wonderful Rodgers and Hammerstein also provides opportunities for Dick Haymes and Vivian Blaine to exercise their tonsils.This happy film never flags; if its the mincemeat or Hampshire Boar competitions, the family have a ball.Look out for a wonderful cameo performance from Donald Meek as the aforementioned @mincemeat' judge. I have watched this film at least a dozen times, the last time last week on DVD and it never bores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, simple, charming technicolor musical...better than the 1962 remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"State Fair" continues the trend of films that wanted the songs to be integrated into the plot without stopping the action--much the way Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein did when they produced "Oklahoma" on Broadway. So they start the picture with "Our State Fair" sung by various characters and it goes on from there. Trouble is, there is almost no plot to speak of--the only suspense being, who will win the top prizes at the Fair and we all know the answer to that anyway. And who will end up with who at the finish--another easy one.Despite the lackluster plot, it does give us a chance to view the young and gorgeous Jeanne Crain (then at the height of her popularity), Dana Andrews, Vivian Blaine and Dick Haymes--a pleasant enough foursome to carry any picture. And, of course, there are a couple of splendid songs by the famous songwriting team--including "It Might As Well Be Spring", dubbed for Jeanne Crain by Annette Warren (I believe), and "It's A Grand Night For Singing". Vivian Blaine gets a chance to sing "That's For Me" and is charming as the girl singer Dick Haymes takes a shine to. To complete the "American as apple pie" image of the story, we have Fay Bainter being motherly in the kitchen and fussing about her jams and Charles Winninger for comic relief.No matter what anyone says, it's a pleasant film to watch, beautifully photographed in the rich Fox color of the mid-40s--and, after all, it does contain the Oscar winning song, "It Might As Well Be Spring."Much better than the awful 1962 remake--and easier to take than the earlier 1930s version with Janet Gaynor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This trip to the "State Fair" is a fun-filled vacation. It's all there: mother's mince meat pie, father's prize winning hog, and the children's bouts of romances, all wrapped in a tuneful Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein score and tied with a Technicolor bow. The cast is excellent, the songs great, and the direction and production values high. What can one say? They sure don't make 'em like this any more.

		<shortDescription>See It For Jeanne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first, let's get the unimportant things out of the way. The 1945 musical remake of "State Fair" is indeed as corny as one might imagine (appropriate, perhaps, considering that Iowa, where the film transpires, is, according to the state song, "where the tall corn grows"). But it also features a cute story, concerning a farm family's visit to the eponymous fair; some sweet and unfailingly catchy tunes by Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein; gorgeous, supersaturated Technicolor filming; and some amusing characters and situations. Now, then, for the important stuff: Jeanne Crain. Oh my gosh, IMDb viewers, you cannot believe how incredibly beautiful Ms. Crain is in this movie; truly, the idealized representation of the all-American girl, and the quintessence of pulchritudinous muliebrity. Her Margie Frake character just might be the prettiest gal I've ever seen in a movie, and she makes this musical, for me, something very special. That same year, Crain appeared in the Gene Tierney vehicle "Leave Her to Heaven," and managed the near-impossible task of even looking better than Tierney at her best. Why our GI's during WW2 hung up pictures of the comparatively dowdy Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth in their lockers, instead of Jeanne Crain, is a mystery to me. Anyway, if you think I'm going overboard here, rent out "State Fair" one night and put it to the test. If you don't find yourself freezing the images of Jeanne Crain a half dozen times to admire her remarkable looks, I would suggest a visit to your local doctor, as you might be half dead...</fullReview>

I love to watch this movie over and over again, sing the songs, experience the love, and enjoy the fair! Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews did a wonderful job portraying two people in love, Fay Bainter did a wonderful job with her cooking (I could almost taste it!), and Charles Winninger did a fabulous job at being a hog obsessed farmer. It's a movie for every girl who has dreamed of meeting a handsome stranger and falling in love! This movie will make you laugh, sigh, and dream of the things you wish you could have, but only can have through this movie. Roger's and Hammerstein did an excellent job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only made for the movies Rodgers and Hammerstein score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shown tonight on the Turner Classic Film Network, the 1945 version (second of three versions) is the one that most viewers feel is the best of the versions. It happens to be the first musical version (Will Rogers version was actually just a straight film), and is better than the 1962 version with Bobby Darin and Alice Faye. It is a nice score with two (possibly three) standards: "It Might As Well Be Spring", "It's a Grand Night For Singing", and the title song of "State Fair". But there are actually about seven numbers, and they include a ballad sung by Viviane Blaine, and a duet Blaine sings with Dick Haymes (a later song, somewhat reminiscent of "Oklahoma" but about "Iowa" had Charles Winninger, Faye Bainter, and even Donald Meek sing with Blaine and William Marshall). Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein were at the beginning of their fantastic Broadway musical career, OKLAHOMA having first been produced in 1943. Most people do not realize this but Oscar Hammerstein was more than just a lyricist (like his predecessor with Rodgers, Lorenz Hart), but also wrote the scripts for the shows. This was to help insure that the songs pushed the story along. Rodgers had long wanted to integrate music and dialog. In the early 1930s, when he and Hart came to Hollywood and worked at Paramount, they had whole sequences in their best work (HALLALUJAH, I'M A BUM, LOVE ME TONIGHT, THE PHANTOM PRESIDENT) that did just that. But this was the total script, not just sections of singing dialog.It is late August 1945, and the Frake family are preparing to attend the Iowa State Fair. The father (Winninger) has been grooming his great boar "Blue Bell" for the best boar prize, and the mother (Bainter) has been grooming her sweet and sour pickles and her mince meat for the best prizes. Their son (Dick Haymes) is determined to get back at a crooked barker at the fair (Harry - then Henry - Morgan), besides enjoying it with his girlfriend. But she can't attend, due to her mother's illness. The Frake daughter (Jeanne Crain) has a boring boy-friend, a future farmer who wants to build a modernistic farm (Crain tries to be interested but isn't). Winninger is quite happy to be going, but his friend and feed merchant (Percy Kilbride - who also does a little singing at the start of the film) is a "Gloomy Gus" type, and insists that there may be serious problems ahead. He and Winninger set up a bet (of $5.00 - but this film is set in 1945 after all!) to see if it really turns out to be a totally happy experience for the four members of the family.The family goes off, and we watch the results of the weekend. This includes the two romances that occur between Haymes and a singer at the fair (Blaine) and Crain with a reporter (Dana Andrews). We watch these adventures, and how the romances bloom, as well as how the parents do with their contests.Among other things we see Donald Meek as a contest judge who gets the D.T.s and enjoys it. We see Frank McHugh as a song plugger, who turns out to be a decent fellow. We see how Blaine teaches Morgan a lesson. We learn that even big fat boars like "Blue Bell" have sex drives. And we see if Winninger or Kilbride will win that $5.00.The cast given on this thread is not complete. John Dehner has a small role as a contest announcer, and Emory Parnell is a Congressman addressing the state fair, and Will Wright is one of the judges at the boar contest. The film is a feel good film - a worthy cinematic follow-up to OKLAHOMA, and worthy of preceding the next stage musical triumph CAROUSEL. As such it is fully deserving of the 10 out of 10 I have given it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Grand Film For Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've no doubt that on the strength of the blockbuster hit that Richard Rodgers&amp;Oscar Hammerstein had with Oklahoma which was still running on Broadway as this film was being made, that Darryl F. Zanuck offered the team the chance to contribute the songs for a remake of State Fair. Oklahoma in fact was a rural setting and so was Iowa for this second telling of the adventures of the Frake family at the Iowa State Fair.What today's audiences don't appreciate was that in 1946 the Iowa state centennial was being celebrated. Some bright individual at 20th Century Fox must have realized that and a nice musical technicolor remake of the Will Rogers classic State Fair would be a can't miss at the box office. Providing of course Mr. Zanuck could assemble the talent.Though the 1933 cast boasted people like Louise Dresser, Lew Ayres, and Janet Gaynor in support of Will Rogers, the accent there was very much on Rogers as it was HIS picture. Here the accent is on the younger generation. Charles Winninger and Fay Bainter play the older Frakes taking their prize hog, Bainter's mince pie, and children Dick Haymes and Jeanne Crain to the Iowa State Fair. Haymes and Crain, together with Dana Andrews and Vivian Blaine as the respective romantic partners carry the film here.Rodgers and Hammerstein had a lot on their plate back in the day. Besides Oklahoma, Hammerstein was involved in creating a musical version of Bizet's Carmen which became Carmen Jones as we all know. He and Rodgers had another musical open in 1945 that was Carousel and became another American classic. When 20th Century Fox signed them for State Fair, according to a recent biography of Dick Rodgers, they never went west. Rodgers did his music from his estate in Connecticut and Hammerstein wrote the lyrics from his Doylestown, Pennsylvania farm. I guess they met in New York and express mailed the songs to Zanuck in Hollywood.They put together a real nice score, one song It Might As Well Be Spring won the Oscar for Best Original Song from a film. The rest of the score ain't too shabby either with Isn't It Kind of Fun and That's For Me also sung beautifully. My favorite however is It's a Grand Night for Singing, a song so absolutely infectious you will be singing it yourself for days after watching State Fair.Andrews and Crain were dubbed by other singers, but Dick Haymes and Vivian Blaine were seasoned musical performers. Haymes recorded all four of the songs above in an album for Decca that sold very well. Haymes had a smooth, but strong baritone and if scandal hadn't blown his career up a few years later, who knows to what heights he might have risen.Every version of State Fair has something to recommend it. There was even a pilot done in the middle Seventies for a television series based on the time honored Frake family saga. For me however this one cops the prize.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best "State Fair" of 'em all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to the ongoing success of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!" on Broadway, a film version of that musical couldn't yet be produced (the makers not wanting to rob themselves of potential ticket income that was still flowing briskly.) So R &amp; H were commissioned to musicalize "State Fair" which began as a novel and then was a highly successful straight dramatic film in 1932. The result is a candy box of a musical; a bright, pleasant, cheerful, tuneful tale that exists in its own featherweight atmosphere. It's not for the cynical, but for audiences who just want an hour and a half or so of escapism, it's practically perfect. The film revolves around the Frake family and the upcoming title event at which each family member has a stake. Father Winninger has his hopes pinned on his prize hog Blue Boy, mother Bainter is entering the pickles and mincemeat competitions, son Haymes is gearing up to win back some of the loot he lost to a carnival barker the year before and daughter Crain is just hoping that something, anything, will take her by storm. At the fair, they take turns tackling their respective tasks with Haymes chasing glamorous girl singer Blaine and Crain meeting up with ace reporter Andrews. These couples enjoy whirlwind romances that are in serious danger of deflating by the time the tents are pulled down and the litter is swept away for good. The entire film is bathed in careful lighting and vivid color. Not a moment of it seems particularly true to life, but in war time, it was just what audiences needed. Some audiences are still quite receptive to its charms. Winninger and Bainter present a delightful, loving, but gently bantering, couple. Crain has one of her finest showcases. She isn't the one singing, but most people would have trouble guessing it, so exceptional is the marriage of actress and voice double. All of her outfits lean towards the preposterous, but it only adds to the overriding delicate beauty of the movie. Haymes is too mature and sophisticated for his character (and seems to favor one facial expression above all others: that of someone who just walked by the elephant house at the zoo!), but his singing is warm and wonderful. Blaine sings nicely and gets to wear some lovely evening gowns. Andrews is given fairly little to do, but he and Crain share a nice chemistry together. Some of the vignettes and gags have, by now, become classics (as they were in the original film as well) such as the mincemeat recipe and Blue Boy's affection for a fellow pig. However, the stunning color photography and the addition of a few really pretty songs have elevated this version of the story to the highest rung. This was (rather crudely) remade in 1962 and eventually made it's way to Broadway in the 1990's. The new 2-disc DVD set is exceptional and only disappoints in two ways. One oversight is the failure to include the deleted scene of Haymes reprising one of his songs while showering. It was shown on a special "Rodgers and Hammerstein: The Sound of Their Music", but, sadly, is left out here which is a shame since so many other things are featured. Additionally, in what has become a horrible trend for classic films on DVD, the commentary is handled by two "experts" who frequently overlook key aspects of the material or else have no idea what they are talking about. One extended sequence has them going on and on about the color balancing demands of Technicolor which must have required a group of men to all have to wear similarly colored jackets when anyone with a set of eyes can see that the jackets were the BAND'S UNIFORMS. Still, the presentation of the film is exquisite and its delights are not tarnished to any degree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming, delightful musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying this film is not meant to make you think long and hard about the problems of the world. It is a 'feel-good film'in the best sense of the phrase. The songs are, perhaps, not as instantly memorable as those from other Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, such as Oklahoma or The Sound Of Music, but they are wonderful in their own right. "It Might As Well Be Spring" won a well-deserved Oscar and "It's A Grand Night For Singing" will have you humming right along. Jeanne Crain, lovelier than ever, gives a top performance as the restless daughter, wanting something 'more' though with no idea what 'more' is. Dick Haymes tackles the role of the son handily, with some very fine singing to go with it. Fay Bainter, all warmth and kindliness in another of her patented mother roles makes you wish she were your mother. Charles Winninger, surely one of the best character actors ever, brings the necessary comic ability to the role of the father, completely preoccupied with his prize hog. Vivian Blaine plays the band singer who catches the son's attentions at the Fair and does some nice singing on her own and in a couple of duets. Dana Andrews, something of a shock in a musical plays Jeanne Crain's love interest and shares tremendous chemistry with her, making their love story believable. This film is a pretty Technicolor musical that will leave you with a song in your heart and a happy feeling to go with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Tunes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first movies I saw as a child was this great musical. As I see it again from time to time, I remember well all the great tunes, and especially the singing voice of Dick Haymes when he was at his height. To my mind only Bing Crosby of all the best male big band singers of their day equaled Haymes in either vocal quality or style. It was a shame his personal life was such a mess.The story, centered as it was on Iowa, is very Middle America in more ways than one. When "The Music Man" came out some years later, it brought to mind this precursor of sorts. I confess I found the 1962 version of "State Fair" much less appealing, apart from Alice Faye's more or less cameo appearance as the mother. Then there is the unfortunate substitution of Texas for Iowa. And Pat Boone could never even come close to singing like Dick Haymes. Choose this one instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two love stories set in Iowa State Fair in 1945.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came out the year I was born. It was filmed in color and looks beautiful. It fairly depicts state or county fairs of that period and at least into the 1950s, the rides, the games, the livestock judging, the cooking and crafts judging. This isn't a very deep story, sister and brother from the farm are both good looking and wonderful singers, but have not yet found true love. At the State Fair they meet people who might, or might not, fill that void. Good looking movie with good looking actors and plenty of singing, very enjoyable for anyone who likes this kind of movie. Jeanne Crain is very pretty, as always, but I was particularly struck by the gorgeous redhead, Vivian Blaine.SPOILERS IN REMAINING COMMENTS. Margy (Jeanne Crain) has a boyfriend, Harry, who has been planning his life with Margy in mind since he was a little boy. However, he is dull, and Margy doesn't really feel anything for him. At the fair, quite accidentally, she gets seated next to Pat (Dana Andrews) on the scary roller coaster ride, afterwards she is reluctant to stay with this stranger, but he says "Let's give it 5 minutes, what do you say?" They do, and a romance starts.Margy's brother Wayne (Dick Haymes, famous baritone) is at a ring toss game, the barker (Harry Morgan) is giving him a hard time for winning too much, and pretty Emily (Vivian Blain, beautiful redhead) approaches, helps set the barker straight, befriends Wayne who falls for her. On the dance floor, they sing together.In the end Pat, who is set to go to Chicago and leave Margy behind, realizes that he loves her and they stay together. Wayne wants Emily to stay with him, but finds out she is married. Disappointed, he remembers a cute blonde from his high school days, and we see them together. Wayne and Margy both end up happy.The movie contains some cute diversions. Marge's dad has a sick pig, but just in time he gets up to win the grand champion prize. Marge's mom is competing in the food judging, her sour pickles win, and her mince meat wins, one judge likes it so much he eats too much and gets drunk from the brandy in the mince meat.</fullReview>

Dick Haymes sings beautifully and you can melt just listening to him. The story was a good one really shows how things were so kind of innocent back then and the colors were so bright in clothes and curtains.

		<fullReview>State Fair was the first musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein to be made into a movie. For this reason, possibly, it receives far too little credit and is not one of their best loved works. Personally, I think State Fair should rank up there with The Sound of Music. It has a tremendous musical score and great acting by the wonderful Jeanne Crain. More people should view this movie as a masterpiece instead of Rodgers and Hammerstein's first attempt at making a movie.</fullReview>

The extras compared the 1933, 1945, and the 1962 movie to the book, why and how the songs came to be made, the background of the actors, and so on. I appreciated the movie on a different level after watching the extras! (This is why DVDs are better than the big screen.)The story and the movie itself are straightforward: boy and girl (and parents and pig) go to fair; boy meets girl, girl meets boy, pig meets pig, and parents re-meet each other. Boy loses girl, girl loses boy, pig loses pig, and parents work hard. Boy . . . well, I won't spoil it, but all comes out pretty well in the end.Good music (but not Oscar material), acceptable acting, and a beautifully put together DVD. Well worth investigating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great music, Great Cast. Good in Family Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people love to see a good old fashion movie. State Fair 1945 is that movie. The themes and sounds are so great. 20 Century Fox really found a great movie to keep people happy and to the great family values of the 40's. This movie starring Jeanne Crain, Dana Andrews, Dick Haymes, and Fay Bainter. Is a great story of family going to the State Fair. Displaying there fine cooking and farm skills. Jeanne Crain is excellent in singing and acting. Dick Haymes displays his great voice and good acting skills. Dana Andrews proves why he was one the leading actors of the 40's. The movie has a smooth feel to it. The songs and lyrics are beautiful. Rogers and Hammersteins music is what makes this movie so special. The supporting cast of Frank McHugh and Vivian Blaine turn in a great performance. In all a great movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not an academy award movie; BUT, one of my favorites. The characters are good, real country people of the time. So don't judge them against the 2003 world. There are many humerous parts, and as in most movies of that era,it ends with everyone happy and settled. Two of my favorites are Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews. They went on to have long, and very successful movie careers. All in all, a very good, entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice American film...Compare this to...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1962 version. This one is so much better.Jeanne Crain, Dana Andrews, Dick Haymes, Vivian Blaine, Harry Morgan, Fay Bainter, and a few quirky characters and animals.Given the subject matter, a state fair where everyone is going to accomplish something for the summer. Fay Bainter as Mom, with her mincemeat pie competition; Dad and his prize hog: Blue Boy. And of course the siblings, who want only to find love. Agreed some of the Rogers and Hammerstein lyrics are a bit hard to swallow "Dollars to Donuts"" etc., but the surroundings give that sense of rural America and Iowa.Another good song is "I owe Iowa"...has a nice feel to it. Dana Andrews and Jeanne Crain make an unlikely but pleasant couple. The visuals of the fair in the evening are effective and somewhat reminiscent of a dream sequence.All's well that ends well. It is a nice story and gives us a slice of Americana that is hard to find these days, although it still can be found in parts of the mid-south, and middle America if you look. Very good film for children and families. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a grand night for singing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philip Strong's book about annual Iowa State Fair attracting a good-hearted farming family was previously filmed in 1933, but this version added a musical score by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II (Hammerstein also penned the screenplay) and, despite some lags, is a wholesome entertainment with colorful Leon Shamroy cinematography. Fay Bainter looks a little old to be the mother of two post-pubescent youngsters (and she acts more like their grandmother anyhow), but Jeanne Crain is lovely as the moony-eyed lass who falls for newspaperman Dana Andrews. Best sequence involves Henry Morgan as a dishonest carnival barker--it's really only the scene that has an edge to it--but the direction and the pacing are tight and the musical numbers well-enough staged (the songs themselves are an iffy lot, with a large reliance on old-fashioned phrases like "it's dollars to doughnuts" that make one's teeth ache). Remade again in 1962, with Pamela Tiffin in Crain's role (the best sequence in that version--the mincemeat contest--is done much more smoothly and slyly here). **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe there has been three movie versions of "State Fair", and I have seen the last two, and the 1945 version is so far in advance of the latest one, one can really understand how bad that one is!! This is as corny as you can get, with the major part of the plot being whether the pig gets well enough to win the Blue Ribbon (I am going to spoil it for you - he does!). Having said that, I enjoyed the film for what it is - very light entertainment with some good songs delivered by Dick Haymes and Vivian Blaine. Jeanne Crain is very pretty, while Dana Andrews really had nothing to do. The best in it were Charles Winninger (he owns the pig!) and Fay Bainter who wins the cook-off. There is a small cameo role by Donald Meek, who always used to be good for a laugh. Watch it if you want some light-hearted corn, and the colours are pretty, BUT do not bother with the Alice Faye/Tom Ewell version, as it is sooooo bad!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our Ohio State Fair is a great state fair. During the gloomy winter months (like now), I can picture our own state fair beginning next July (only 7 months away!) and think of this movie at the same time. I like this movie better than the 1962 version, because I feel that this 1945 version is warmer, homier and more nostalgic than the later version. Blue Boy is the star. He is a main reason for going. So is mother's canned pickle. The drunk judge is hilarious. Winninger and Bainter fabulous. "Grand Night for Singing". In my childhood, there were the Silver Airplanes (I called them that) in an amusement park. I think they were really early spaceship models. I love this song. Fifteen seconds of Dana Andrews and Jeanne Crain (dubbing?) singing this song in those silver airplanes have forever melted in my memory ever since I first saw them in this movie. The other characters sing verses of this song, but IMO Dana's and Jeanne's part is way more memorable. I like the singing hayseed red-bearded Ioway men. This is also a memorable scene, and to this day I still find it snappy and memorable -- also not too hokey (or hokey-pokey, as S.Z. Sakall would say). Coloration still excellent. Costumes and hair colors show up very well. Movie a little draggy in places, however. I still give it high marks. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This light, fluffy "State Fair" has the outstanding songs you'd expect from Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people think of the word "musical", one of the first few names that usually come to mind are songwriters Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. The most famous musical they've written was also one of the highest grossing movie musicals of all time, "The Sound of Music" (1965). While I won't address the impact that film has made to American culture, I will instead recommend the fans of that movie to take a look at the first movie musical that the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein brought to the screen, "State Fair" (1945). While this film probably won't please those who detest the musical genre altogether, it has plenty of things that musical fans including myself will like. The story to "State Fair" is pretty straightforward. The Frake family is getting ready to head to the Iowa State Fair with each family member having their own dreams about the fair. For instance, Margy (Jeanne Crain) is eager to take a break from the same old routine so that she can feel a little less gloomy. Her brother Wayne (Dick Haymes) is looking forward to the fair even though his current girlfriend can't go with him. Their father Abel (Charles Winninger) is prepping his pig Blue Boy to win at the fair and bets his neighbor five bucks that nothing will go wrong during the trip. Their mother Melissa (Fay Bainter) is preparing pickles and mincemeat for the cooking competition. When they all get to the fair, Margy finds love with news reporter Pat (Dana Andrews) while Wayne also finds romance with band singer Emily Edwards (Vivian Blaine). Will their new relationships go well? Will their mom and dad win at the fair? This story won't be everyone's cup of tea especially if you're not into musicals or love stories, and if you're looking for intense conflicts along with a complex plot and characters. But if you go into this film with the mindset that this is meant to be a light and fluffy musical, then I think you'll like it fine. Though I thought the story certainly wasn't much and there were some odd elements in the narrative (namely the ability of the pigs to "talk" to each other), the four main leads do at least have some sort of likability to them. The chemistry between Haymes and Blaine in particular is the strongest element of the script. Not only does it feel like the most realistic and natural part of the narrative, but they also have a certain charisma on screen together. But as most of us know, the real selling point of almost any Rodgers and Hammerstein movie musical, such as "The Sound of Music" (1965), are the songs themselves. Luckily for "State Fair", it does not disappoint in this category. Though it's been said that her singing voice was dubbed by Louanne Hogan, Jeanne Crain truly owns it when selling the lovely, Oscar-winning tune "It Might As Well Be Spring". The same can be said for Vivian Blaine for singing the exceptional "That's for Me", save for the dubbing since she sings it herself. Blaine and Haymes bounce off of each other very well in the fun musical number "Isn't It Kinda Fun". In terms of its musical soundtrack, "State Fair" is truly a winner. The film was shot in Technicolor when it was being made during the end of World War II. And in a time when U.S. citizens were worried about the status of their loved ones fighting the war overseas, films like "State Fair" seemed to be made at the right place at the right time. It has some wonderful music, bright Technicolor cinematography, nice costumes, and at least two charming leads to bring it all together. Regardless of what criticisms modern audiences might have against it, no one can deny that this picture does what it was made to do: provide pure escapism. And on that level, "State Fair" is a nice and pleasant trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average, pleasant musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a number of people have pointed, this is not one of the GREAT Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein...and it was originally produced for the film, as opposed to their other musicals that were first produced for Broadway and then later moved to the big screen. But while not great, it's darned good in an old-fashioned sort of way.The story revolves around a rural family who is getting ready to go to the State Fair. Mother will put her mincemeat and dill pickles up for judging. Father his prize hog. The son will go looking for a new love, and the daughter for her first real love. One will find what they are looking for, another will settle for the love back home.Jeanne Crain was almost always a delight on the big screen, and is no less so here. Will she find her first real love? Incidentally, Crain's singing performance here is dubbed, and in my view, by a not very good singer. Dana Andrews is decent as the sophisticated reporter she sets her sights on. Dick Haymes plays the brother, and he displays his very nice singing voice. Vivian Blaine is who he falls in love with. I like Blaine, but here her red hair just didn't look real. Charles Winninger is adorable as the father. Fay Bainter wonderful as the mother...although she certainly had better roles. Donald Meek plays the tipsy mincemeat judge. Frank McHugh has a crucial role with little screen time. Percy Kilbride plays a character not unlike most that he played in his career. Harry Morgan has a brief role as a carnival barker.In terms of songs, "Our State Fair" is catchy, as is "Isn't It Kind of Fun?". But the two standouts are "It Might as Well Be Spring" and "It's A Grand Night For Singing".It's all very pleasant, though not spectacular. Certainly worth a watch, and the DVD set I have also has the later remake with Ann-Margaret and Pat Boone (which is less successful, although I love the song "Sweet Hog Of Mine" with Tom Ewell). If you like musicals, it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outside of The Sound of Music, this is my favorite Rodgers and Hammerstein film. I probably don't have much to add to the many reviews already posted about this film. But I wanted to impress on you, the reader, that, if you haven't seen this already, then you really need to see this story of an average all-American family on the way to their state fair, with games and rides, cotton candy and candied apples, contests for baking, livestock, etc., and a lot of fun and angst too. The music is just great, including the Oscar-winning song, "It Might As Well Be Spring" sung by Jeanne Crain, who made many a man's heart go a-twitter. At the fair, she meets Dana Andrews. Dick Haymes is her brother who meets singer Vivian Blaine, and Charles Winninger and Fay Bainter are their parents. The film feels like home to me. That's just about the best compliment a film can get, and they don't come any better than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Starry-eyed and vaguely discontented"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is some testament to the growing stature of the movie musical in the 1940s that Rodgers and Hammerstein, then revitalising the stage musical in a way not seen since the death of Ziegfeld, decided to turn their hands to a piece for the screen. State Fair had been a popular non-musical movie back in 1933, a simple yet touching love story that Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt with very few changes in what looked like a simple case of "add songs, create hit".Individually both members of the duo had worked in film before, so the format was not unfamiliar, and they are prepared to make concessions to it. Of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein pictures produced by Fox State Fair is the shortest by a considerable margin. The epic musical that would appear in the mid-50s (boosted primarily by the adaptations of Rodgers and Hammerstein's big stage works) was still an unknown concept. Nevertheless, they seem keen to make the most of the cinema's possibilities. At one point, a snatch of singing becomes an internal monologue, something that doesn't really work on stage (although having said that it never really caught on in the movies either). Apart from this, all the usual Rodgers and Hammerstein touches are there, with songs that move the story along emotionally and tonally rather than semantically. "It Might as Well Be Spring" is integrated into the background scoring and becomes an illustration of Jeanne Crain's confused dissatisfaction.This is also one of the earliest musicals in which non-singing actors would be dubbed by professional vocalists. In later years this would be done a lot because the studio wanted the right performer for each role more than they wanted someone who could sing. Strangely though there is nothing special about Jeanne Crain or Dana Andrews, both of whom were dubbed here. The best player is surely Fay Bainter, the archetypal mother figure in numerous 40s movies. She is full of endearing, twitchy mannerisms, as in her hesitation over adding more liquor to the mincemeat. There's also a nice little supporting part from sweet old man Donald Meek as one of the judges.State Fair is undoubtedly a nice-looking picture. At this point Technicolor was still quite a special thing, but it was beginning to become standard for musicals. The colours here are rich and vibrant without being garish, the screen filled with subtle pinks, blues and natural greens. Director Walter Lang handles the scenes with poise and delicacy. His staging of "It Might as Well Be Spring" is simple yet beautiful, slowly closing the camera in on Jeanne Crain as the shadow of the trees teases across the image. His arranging of the crowds is excellent too, often keeping people moving rhythmically but realistically, and forming careful patterns to draw our attention to the stars in the foreground.Good as it looks and sounds, State Fair is ultimately a rather flat experience. Apart from the fact that this version has songs, its 1933 counterpart was better in almost every aspect. The earlier movie was certainly far more intensely romantic. Even the songs in State Fair are far from Rodgers and Hammerstein's best, the delicate charm of "It Might as Well Be Spring" being the only example up to their usual standard. The movie's one real asset can be summed up in Craine's sudden anger that the ultra-modern farmhouse proposed by her bespectacled suitor would have "nothing useless". In other words, she yearns for the purely decorative things in life. State Fair, with its fragile beauty and quaint frippery wrapped around a rather mundane slice of Americana, is a purely decorative movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the best Rodgers and Hammerstein movie musical, however State Fair is still a truly lovely film. The plot is rather fluffy and lacklustre, but the characters are charming and the R&amp;H tunes while not among their best are still wonderful. State Fair looks beautiful, with the photography lavish and Crain especially looking absolutely stunning in her costumes. The film is lovingly directed, has a corny but appealing script and it moves sprightly too. Nothing to complain about the performances either, Jeanne Crain is breathtaking and Dana Andrews is a more than dashing and competent leading man. As much as I loved Harry Morgan, Dick Haymes and Vivian Blaine, my favourite support performance is Charles Winninger who steals every scene he's in. Overall, a lovely movie and well worth watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>state fair is much more than just fair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've lost track of how often I've seen this beautiful, corny gem but the last time won't be the last time."State Fair" has none of the complexities of most of R and H's work, but it still has excellent songs and lovable characters. Where to start? First of all, Dick Haymes was one of the best singers of his era. (His brother, Bob, made a few records, for Decca, I believe under the name of Hayme and eggs. Oh well).Back to the matter at hand. Jeanne Crain was a) beautiful b) gorgeous. She makes most of todays actresses look like mud. Vivian Blaine is lovely and talented, never getting the Hollywood recognition she deserved. Dana Andrews, who graces every third 20th Century Fox picture, proves charming and winning. The characters are unbeatable - Fay Bainter, Charles Winninger, Harry Morgan, Donald Meek, and Frank McHugh as a lovable songplugger (a contradiction in terms).The hog hogged its scenes (I had to say that). Nowadays, he would probably have lines rather than settling for snorting.One word that comes to mind about this movie is charming. I lived in Iowa for several years, but never made it to the state fair. The movie was second best.It is state great not just state fair.P.S. I loved the scene where Andrews, a reporter who doesn't take too many notes, comes to the end of a roller coaster ride and, when told to get off, flashes a press pass. My wife said something like how unethical. I've been a reporter for a major newspaper for 30 years (still writing free-lance) and I had to remind her of nice, free days we enjoyed at a major theme park whenever a new attraction was announced).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Does Iowa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So where else does snooty Hollywood celebrate a hog judging contest, of all things. Then too, I'll bet the movie made it onto the Farmer John list of favorites. Actually, the musical is more sweet than bouncy, an overdue tribute to rural America and one of the so-called "pig- pen" musicals of the time. The fair itself is brightly rendered by TCF's expert photographer Leon Shamroy, along with an attractive cast. And what a sweet paragon of innocence is the sparkling Jeanne Crain. I can imagine hundreds of guys leaving for Iowa after seeing her. Haymes too projects a pleasant boyishness and a fine singing voice. But it's really Winninger who steals the film with his addled comedic touch. Then there's that really suspenseful moment in the hog show, that is, until the enchanting Esmeralda comes to the lovelorn Blue Boy's rescue, surely one of Hollywood's more delightful romances.Of Course, there're also the great R&amp;H's tunes. That massed rendition of It's a Grand Night for Singing is a show-stopper and wonderfully captures the carefree spirit of the fair. Add to that some nice light-hearted character touches, such as the perennially grouchy Percy Kilbride and the mincemeat freak Donald Meek. However, note that the script has one of the two siblings, but not both, abandon the farm for an urban fast life. After all, having both leave would reflect negatively on the movie's main theme. Note too, director Lang's unusually deliberate pacing for a musical, to bring out the story values, I guess.Anyway, it's a highly pleasant musical diversion with a fine cast, lots of color, and at least two first-rate tunes. The 100-minutes may lack bounce, but they do entertain, even 60-years later.</fullReview>

I say that because the second time it wasn't so hot, and I didn't even finish it on the third look, trading my DVD to someone for something else. By then, the movie was so sappy, so corny I couldn't watch it anymore.I have no complaints looking at the wholesome, pretty women: Jeanne Craine, Vivian Blaine and Fay Bainter make a nice threesome. Craine never looked better, looking like a classic beauty, the ultimate girl-next-door that men would desire. The film as a whole is pretty; with some really nice-looking Technicolor.However, as wholesome and nice as the people in here are, and as rich as the colors are, the dialog and thinking is so stupid, it's embarrassing to watch at times. Yes, we get the typical Hollywood romance in which everyone falls in love on their date and instantly wants to get married!! This was just one of many stupid angles and lines by the characters. They were just plain dumb!Anyway, I rarely knock a wholesome story. I'm a sucker for nice people, but this is too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The boar wins and the bore loses, in this fun, lesser remembered , R&amp;H musical romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed only 2 years after the stage version of "Oklahoma" opened, this was the earliest R&amp;H film by a decade! It was the only one of the 6 R&amp;H films that wasn't preceded by a play version. It was released the same year that R&amp;H composed the play "Carousel", which was their main focus at this time. Both included a substantial carnival atmosphere.Like "Oklahoma", it paints a largely idyllic picture of a rural Midwestern community, lacking ethnic minorities. It's mostly based on the prior very popular non-musical film of the same name, starring Will Rogers. Again, the lead young woman has to deal with two suitors, one clearly not being to her liking. But, in place of the menacing Jed, in "Oklahoma", her 'problem' suitor is a nerdy ambitious farmer, who just doesn't excite her romantically. Unlike "Oklahoma" and "Carousel", there are is no memorable ballet dance scene. It's shorter by half an hour to more than 1 hour, than the other R&amp;H films. However, very surprisingly, it includes the only Oscar-winning R&amp;H song!"Oklahoma" began with Gordon MacRae singing about the theme of the movie: an optimistic future for him as a farmer/rancher and, by extension, the US as a whole. Similarly, this film begins with bucolic Percy Kilbride singing "Our State Fair": introducing us to the main setting of the film. Charles Winninger, another convincing-looking old farmer, picks up the song for a spell, followed by his prize boar Blue Boy(as best he can), and finally by his wife, played by Fay Banter. Very soon after, daughter Marge(the beautiful Jeanne Crane) starts into the most remembered song in the film "It Might as Well Be Spring"(It was late summer). Marge is expressing her impatience to start a new life somewhere else more exiting to her, with a more exiting, handsome, prospective husband than ambitious, but nerdy, Harry. Marge is literally starry-eyed, expressing her ambition to snare a man who reminds her of her favorite movie stars and singers....I feel sorry for Harry, who seems sincere in his plans to build a modern farm operation and house, to create a much easier, more profitable, life than what his parents have. Marge couldn't be more blunt in expressing her disinterest in such a life and in Harry, no matter what he proposes. She doesn't want a life that's all planned out, and predictable.Marge has a brother(Dick Haymes, as Wayne,) probably a little older, also unmarried, with a girlfriend: Eleanor, he doesn't seem all that excited about. Now, it happens that both Eleanor and Harry have excuses why they can't go to the state fair. This gives Marge and Wayne an opportunity to wander around the fair and meet someone who might better meet their criteria for an ideal mate. Who should Wayne bump into but flaming redhead Vivian Blaine, who had been recently costarring in "B' musicals for Fox, and would later costar in "Guys and Dolls". He falls for her immediately, after she helps him get out of a scene with a carnival side showman. Whereas the singing of Jeanne and Dana Andrews, who she meets at the fair, was dubbed, Haymes and Vivian, of course, did their own singing. Ironically, Andrews had training as an opera singer, but neglected to tell the studio about this!These instantaneous flirtations appear to be on the rocks near the end. Marge is sure that Pat(Andrews) is the man for her. But, he basically says that, as a lady's man, he doesn't think he could be tied to one woman, even one as sweet and beautiful as Marge. But, in the end, he gives in. Meanwhile, after a bit of romancing and singing together, Pat is told that Vivian is returning to Chicago and is married, if unhappily. Thus, in the hurried finale, we see Haynes driving his car with his, presumably, uncomplicated country girl sweetheart Eleanor beside him, instead of the sophisticated, fun, but conflicted and married Vivian.There are 6 songs. Of these, "It's a Grand Night for Singing" ranks up there with "It Might as Well Be Spring", as a memorable classic. But, there's nothing wrong with the others, except the lyrics to "Our State Fair" are trite. True, the film doesn't open with a knock-you -out -of -your -seat musical number, like most R&amp;H films do. The long song and dance production near the end , to "All I Owe to Ioway" is functionally equivalent to the singing of "Oklahoma" near the end, in that former creation, if not nearly as memorable as a song.Comedy is more emphasized here than in the euphoric 'Oklahoma" or the darker-themed "Carousel". Wayne's determination to get even with that carnival barker is one example. Henry Morgan is great as his barker nemesis. Kildridge, who later costarred in the Ma and Pa Kettle series, provides some early humor as a perennial doomsday worrier. Of course, Winninger's obsession with his hog Blue Boy winning the grand prize, and his sneaking some brandy into wife's mincemeat, to hopefully make it win the prize, are other examples. Donald Meek, as a food and drink tasting judge, is also funny.Director Walter Lang had directed many of the early '40s Fox musicals, and would continue through the '50s, including the R&amp;H "The King and I".Well folks, I'm going to have to give this a 10: equal to that of Oklahoma, as a total experience, despite a few quibbles. I liked all the principal players, although Jeanne came across as an icy beauty at times, and Haymes and Vivian came across as refugees from an urban life. With all the activity relating to the fair and the hurried romances, there was little time for character development, if that is important to you. I won't bother comparing it with the longer '62 remake, with additional songs. You decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh the Farmer and the Carny should be friends....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For their second venture together, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II headed from the plains of Oklahoma to the farmland of Iowa where country folk prepare for the state fair, pop Charles Winninger certain that his prize hog will be top dog, mom Fay Bainter certain that her mince meat is certain to make the judges' eyebrows raise, and their children (Jeanne Crain and Dick Haymes) hope that under the carnival night lights, they'll find romance. "It Might as Well Be Spring", the pretty Ms. Crain sings, and through this Oscar winning song, you see her hopes and dreams, and along with her, you long for her to find them. This, of course, is an adaption of the Philip Stong novel and a remake of a very popular 1933 film which starred the Fox studios sweetheart Janet Gaynor and Will Rogers, the most popular man in America at the time. There would be a third version of the tale, still with Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs attached, in the 1960's, but this middle version is probably the most remembered.Like their previous teaming, Richard and Oscar wrote a tribute song to the state they were praising, and "All I Owe Ioway" is a rip-rousing tribute to one of the gateways to the west. They also contributed a wonderful song celebrating young and old love, with the entire cast singing the merriment of the state fair in "It's a Grand Night For Singing". Of course, the non-singing Crain and Dana Andrews (as the city slicker reporter Crain falls for) are dubbed, but you do get to hear the remainder of the cast's real voices, including Vivian Blaine who would go onto Broadway legendary status with her nasally Adelaide in "Guys and Dolls", here playing the fair's leading lady in a musical show whom Haymes gets to romance.There's also a nice homage to Rodgers and Hammerstein's next Broadway show, "Carousel", as carnival and amusement park rides of all kinds are utilized as part of the action. There's also humor in watching the preparation of ma's mincemeat and judge Donald Meek's reaction to it, which is priceless. Every moment of this home-spun musical is pure joy, and it will be difficult for repeat viewers not to sing along. It's unfortunate that a Broadway version of this show didn't have a long life, but fortunately a recording of that show (utilizing a few songs from lesser known Rodgers and Hammerstein shows) was made. Animal lovers will delight in the sequence where two hogs involved in the contest begin having a conversation here, and you can just imagine the one hog saying to the other, "Lord, what fools these mortals be...."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to underestimate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this musical several times before and enjoyed it well enough, but it never really impressed me. Until this time. I put on the 1962 version, watched about 10 minutes, and decided to switch to the 1945 original. Within five minutes it had introduced the theme and had me hooked, and by 10 minutes it had me laughing at some of the same scenes that left me cold with the remake.While I am a great fan of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, I hadn't paid much attention to State Fair before. I had always considered Oklahoma! the beginning, and it is, as far as Broadway goes with a debut of 1943, but the film didn't come out until 1955. Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein wrote mostly musicals with an edgy social commentary and included some tears, which are missing from State Fair, which looks weak by comparison. When viewed as their first film, and second musical, the perspective changes. And I'm not so often in the mood for an emotionally stressful musical. State Fair is Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's most cheerful musical, and their only light comedy, though there is some comedy in all their works. I think in the old broadcast TV rerun movie days, we took this genre for granted, and when I saw State Fair, I basically said, nice movie, and promptly forgot about it. Now I appreciate how delicately and effectively the director Walter Lang worked in the comedy, as well as developed the heart-warming romantic subplots, which modern movies so often flub. I really laughed and chuckled at many scenes, especially the pickle contest tasting, and I genuinely cared about the characters. All the acting was on the mark, even the minor parts, and every scene generated the appropriate emotion, without feeling manipulated. You have to remember when this was made, near the end of WWII, and when it was released, Aug. 30, 1945, shortly after the surrender of Japan. With such timing, Americans must have rejoiced at the return to normalcy State Fair embodied. An edgy, violent musical like Oklahoma! would been wrong for the time. I was just re-watching the Harvey Girls, which came out in January 1946, and it, too, was a light Americana musical. What you see in these two is the birth of the modern film musical, with singing and dancing and a strong plot, but without the crutch of having the leading actors play professional musicians or dancers, as in the 1930s Astaire musicals. The Wizard of Oz in 1939 was actually ahead of these two movie musicals, though it was aimed at children. There is a tip of the hat in State Fair to an even earlier musical, also for children, Disney's enormously successful, but enormously risky, Snow White, the first full-length color animated movie in 1937. Listen to the orchestration and style of the music as Mrs. Frake prepares the mincemeat in the kitchen, particularly as she is grating something -- it matches the style as Snow White is cleaning the kitchen of the seven dwarfs. Their song My State Fair even seems similar to the chords and pace of Disney's Whistle While You Work. I bet audiences in 1945 caught the reference. I guess Rodgers and Hammerstein are giving credit to Snow White as a great musical, and the first to so fully integrate music and plot, as well as including some edgy conflict from the evil queen, perhaps influencing their own approach. The orchestration style reappears briefly near the end of the movie. When I finished watching State Fair, I felt good. This is one of a handful of films that I think you can count on to cheer you up if you are feeling bad, including Princess Bride and Dave. I came away with a new appreciation for the craftsmanship of director Walter Lang, whose credits include The King and I, and No Business Like Show Business.I was also surprised to find that the same Vivian Blaine who plays Emily Edwards also played Miss Adelaide in Guys and Dolls in 1955. Now that's acting. As a footnote, the philosophizing by Dave Miller was a reference to Ralph Waldo Emerson's great essay, Compensation. This is the underlying theme of the story, and the bet establishes a certain tension that carries through the film. But we see that bad does not have to balance good, if we choose happiness. With its focus on bringing a pig to the state fair, this is an obvious companion to Charlotte's Web; another is Friendly Persuasion. All are fine family movies. I think it is safe to say the original is the best. But this is not to put down the 1962 remake. Actually, I think it would be a fine thing to remake State Fair every couple of decades, setting the story in a new generation. State fairs are in at least their third century now. The fundamentals haven't changed much. I think this is a tradition Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein would have approved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Wait for it to Be Spring ***1/2 for State Fair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderful film of 1945 gave us the Oscar winning song "It Might As Well Be Spring," written so beautifully by Rodgers and Hammerstein and sung utterly well by Jeanne Crain, our film's heroine.Basically, a story of rural life with the annual state fair in the urban locale, the picture provided some very comical time for our pigs Esmeralda and Blue Boy. We have love blossoming between the animals as a backdrop to the love by the Crain character and Dana Andrews, a reporter at the fair. While I loved the film, let's not kid ourselves. Andrews were terribly miscast. Musicals were not his forte. The following year he gave a superlative performance in the Oscar-winning "The Best Years of Our Lives," and was Oscar ignored.Faye Bainter and Pa Kettle's Percy Kilbride gave ample support in this delightful film.You'll know that spring has sprung when you see this endearing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iowa farmer's daughter Jeanne Crain (as Margy Frake) and her singing brother Dick Haymes (as Wayne Frake) go to an annual "State Fair" and find romantic partners. She attracts older "Des Moines Register" reporter Dana Andrews (as Pat Gilbert) and he finds singer Vivian Blaine (as Emily Edwards) attractive. Only one of the couples can marry. A lengthy rural supporting cast is headed by mincemeat-making mother Fay Bainter (as Melissa Frake) and hog-minding father Charles Winninger (as Abel Frake)."It Might as Well Be Spring" / "That's for Me" was a big double-sided top ten hit recording for Mr. Haymes, but you won't hear him sing it here. Everything about this film is pretty and colorful, but the overall impression is simply that it's all fluff. "State Fair" really comes across as an average diversion. The Rodgers and Hammerstein soundtrack songs, while certainly not bad, seem like half a collection; when compared to the duo's other musicals, the songs don't advance musical art in their customary way.***** State Fair (8/29/45) Walter Lang ~ Jeanne Crain, Dick Haymes, Dana Andrews, Vivian Blaine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining film by R/H</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few admissions first off -- I haven't seen the later or earlier versions, and I'm a bigger fan of Rodgers' work with Lorenz Hart than I am of the Hammerstein stuff, though I do appreciate it for what it is I guess. This is not a movie that you should try to read too hard into, after all. It's not quite as complex as some of his earlier work like "Oklahoma!" and "Show Boat." But it has some very nice songs, appealing actors playing wholesome characters, very saturated 30s technicolor photography, so basically some people are going to know they hate it within 5 minutes and everyone else will have a good time. I'm one of the people who likes it.The story is very simple -- it's about a family going to the Iowa State Fair (in a time that feels like a strange mix of past and 30s present), where the mom (Fay Bainter) and dad (Charles Winninger) are trying to win prizes and son (Dick Haymes) and daughter (Jeanne Crain) find dubious love. Crain is paired with a newsman played by Dana Andrews and Haymes with a band-singer played by Vivian Blaine.A first look at the scenario tells you that it's a sort of culture-clash -- big city folks falling for country guy and gal. There's a confrontation between the son and a male band-singer (Percy Kilbride, I believe) where all this tension comes to a head, and his relationship with the lady singer cannot continue because of the melodramatic intervention of a previous marriage. However the probable marriage of the Andrews and Crain characters at the end implies the possibility of reconciling the country/town old/new dichotomy.The score isn't really their best as some have noted, but taken on its own it is better than most movie soundtracks. R/H didn't have a whole lot of time to write this one, they basically did it I think in between "Oklahoma!" and "Carousel" because "OK" was a Theater Guild show and they didn't make much money off it at the time, they only made money when the production closed up and the film was made. Crain's character is very much like Laurey in "Oklahoma!" and the elimination of the negative social element of the already married woman aligns in a softer way with the death of Judd Fry in that play or the self-sacrifice of Julie in "Show Boat." This is one of the only parts of the play that probably rings false for modern audiences, because it was obviously designed to fit a certain type of melodrama and these days we would hardly consider a previous marriage a total roadblock to a new marriage. By our standards the son could be criticized for abandoning her, but I guess in the morals of his time it would have been dishonorable for him to pursue a married woman.This film fits very comfortably into the Americana of Oscar Hammerstein, less serious than "Show Boat" and "Carousel" but more convincing than his European adventure with "Sound of Music" or his Siamese "The King and I." I know Hammerstein wanted to stretch out, and definitely Rodgers did some of his best music for "King", but this is the type of story that I think he's best at.As far as the performances, they're pretty much all great. Winninger in particular made me laugh in a lot of his scenes, and Fay Bainter is just wonderful too. Great chemistry between them makes their casting perfect. Winninger's scene where he weeps tears of joy over his pig being victorious reminded me of his famous scene in "Show Boat." Crain was lovely and suitably innocent on screen. Andrews and she have pretty good chemistry, a lot more than Haymes and Blaine. Perhaps that's intentional -- you could even argue that Hammerstein wanted us to feel that the characters were too similar to each other for their romance to work in the long term. They're both phenomenal singers, they're both very willful and confident. Crain's character on the other hand is a bit of a shrinking violet by today's standards I guess, she's "vulnerable." And Andrews is very good at playing a protective type of male, you get the feeling that he could give her more direction while she could organize his life. That sounds sexist but I think it's possibly what Hammerstein was trying to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still In A Fair State</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rodgers and Hammerstein were nothing if not shrewd and though they have often been spoken of as innovators they were not averse from 'borrowing' from other sources. In 1944, one year BEFORE State Fair, MGM released 'Meet Me In St Louis' a wonderful 'family' oriented movie which starts by introducing the cast as they sing the title song; a little later there is a scene in which most of the family 'taste' a soup being prepared by mother (Mary Astor) and pass comments on it. So: in this movie we begin by introducing neighbour Percy Kilbride as he drives along singing the title song, soon taken up by 'Pa' Charles Winninger; within minutes we have a scene in which mom (Fay Bainter) is seen making the mincemeat she will enter at the State Fair. Pa comes in, tastes it and declares it needs 'flavoring' with brandy. In both cases the State Fair action is truncated possibly to avoid embarrassing comparisons with St Louis but otherwise this remains a charming film, redolent of a lost era with four competent leads - though none, of course, comes even near the magic of Judy Garland - and no less than six excellent and familiar supporting players - in addition to the aforementioned Bainter, Kilbride and Winninger there are Henry Morgan, Donald Meek and Frank McHugh. The story is soap-bubble fragile and the songs for once from this duo are ALMOST schmaltz-free though frustrated poet Hammerstein was unable to resist having a bird 'throwing his heart at the sky'. Dick Haymes has the best voice in the movie by a country mile - with both Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews being dubbed and Vivian Blaine sounding no better and no worse than dozens of other 'band' singers of the time - whilst It Might As Well Be Spring is arguably the best song Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote. All in all it's a very pleasant nostalgic revel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brandy-spiked homemade mincemeat, patent-leather farmhouses, candy apples, cotton candy, roller coasters, budding romances, and stunning technicolor.....all drenched in Rogers and Hammerstein's unmistakable sound........a recipe for success? You didn't have any doubts, did you?? I rate this 1945 classic a solid ten out of ten stars. The awful remake in 1962 is a prime example of why remakes should never be attempted. This movie follows in the tradition of other great 1940's Fox musicals such as Down Argentine Way and Moon Over Miami. Don't you dare listen to any negative reviews of this wonderful movie. One of the reviewers commented that there wasn't much of a plot. Are you kidding me?? The plot is fantastic. Apparently, some people just don't get it. It's intentionally made to be light and fun. Don't over-analyze it. After all, it's a musical for crying out loud. In my opinion, this movie is simply one of the best musicals ever made. I like it more and more every time I see it if that's even possible! It's right up there in quality with The Sound Of Music. Walter Lang, the director, masterfully captures the magic with incredible flair in this innocent, mid-century gem. The songs are infectious and beautiful....some of the best Rogers and Hammerstein have ever written....and that's the truth! The movie will leave you feeling great. Watch it! You'll see what I mean. After all......it's a grand night for singing!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those breezy mid-forties musical romances that would never be made today because it would never find an audience, but which is still loved by a reasonably large core of classic movie/musical fans. Featuring the only original score by the celebrated musical duo of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, the songs are surprisingly nondescript. Even Oscar winner "It Might As Well Be Spring" fades from the memory quickly. What the film does have going for it is its lush use of technicolour, its upbeat tempo, the ravishingly beautiful Jeanne Crain, and a relatively young and problem-free Dana Andrews.The story is pure Americana hokum, nothing more than a convenient totem around which the players sing and dance. Ma (Faye Bainter) and Pa (Charles Winninger), Frake head off to the State Fair to enter their pickles and mincemeat and boars into its competitions while son Wayne (Dick Haymes) and daughter Margy (Crain) tag along and get themselves involved in romantic situations with a singer (Vivian Blaine) and a streetwise reporter (Andrews). Wayne falls in love, Margy falls in love, Ma and Pa are already in love, even the boar falls in love.Dana Andrews sings only a couple of lines in this film, and it's a strange thing to see. Apparently his voice was dubbed even for these few lines, which is ironic, because Andrews was actually a classically trained singer. He and Crain work well together as an odd couple ? city boy and farm girl ? but Crain looks so hot in a big-girl-in-a-little-girl's-dress sort of way that you can understand a city slicker like Pat Gilbert falling for her. With her vivid red lips and cover girl looks, she looks too glamorous to be a farm girl but you get the impression that was the producer's idea. She was the 'wholesome' fantasy while redhead Blaine, who invites Margy's brother back to her apartment after she has chased off the guests at her party, was the more earthy actuality. She's married and she blows him out in the end, resulting in one of mainstream Hollywood musical's more bizarre endings when Wayne simply picks up with the hometown girl he was so willing to dump just a couple of scenes before. How that one got by the censors is a mystery ? it's almost as if a couple of scenes have mistakenly been left on the cutting room floor. Donald Meek makes a humorous appearance, and studio drifter Frank McHugh wanders over from Universal for a welcome visit. In fact, everyone gives a reasonable performance here, which helps make the strictly sentimental nonsense on offer vastly more palatable than it might otherwise have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimaginative but somehow sweetly enjoyable and very simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so earnest that I find it hard to dislike and yet... the feeling persists that Rodgers and Hammerstein were condescending to rural audiences with this one, a sort of "that will do for the sticks, now let's get on with our great stuff for the New York stage". After all, by the time they created State Fair, a) Rodgers had been composing top musicals - and b) Hammerstein came from a family in which top flight musical entertainment had been given - for decades. It's tempting for a modern viewer to think "well, this is the way entertainment used to be: - yet in 1945, Rodgers and Hammerstein were writing in a city that was in the middle of a true golden era of theater - since the end of W.W.I., works by such American playwrights as Clifford Odets, Marc Blitzstein, Eugene O'Neill, Lawrence Stallings, George S. Kaufman, Sidney Kingsley, Moss Hart, Anita Loos, Maxwell Anderson, Elmer Rice, Marc Connelly, Sidney Howard, Dorothy Parker, Edna Ferber, had all been routinely on Broadway - and works by such as Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, William Inge and Edward Albee were all to be on Broadway within the next decade. This movie is SO unimaginative and simple-minded that it's hard to believe Rodgers and Hammerstein gave it their full effort. Aside from the two memorable songs, the story does seem as if it could have been written as a joint project by an 8th grade. All that said, I somehow enjoyed it!! The acting is fine. Dana Andrews is one of the most underrated actors - and the romance between his typically harder-boiled urban character and the breathlessness of beautiful Jeanne Crain seems very real - and affecting (if one allows the movie conceit of everyone falling in love and proposing within three days). This is due almost entirely to the actors' expressions because they aren't really given much by the writing. The other romance (despite the very real musical talent on display) between Vivian Blaine and Dick Haymes (whose voice is a real pleasure to hear) just doesn't work - it's too underwritten and although I like both actors separately, they just don't seem as if they belong together on the screen.I was struck at the pre-feminist view of the relative importance of the competitions entered by the husband and wife. For the husband's hog contest, a Congressman announces the contestants, the judges are grave and serious men, and the audience consists of complete families packing the stands. In the wife's pickles and pies contest, a newspaperman is teased for even being present, only women attend - and they do so standing (apparently there is no spectator interest) = and the judges are comical figures. Granted that there was/is more of a commmercial value to the raising of hogs in Iowa than there in a family's pickling and pie-baking - but the contrast in the significance the movie gives each contest is still noticeable to a 21st century viewer.There are too few dramas -= and even fewer romances - set in rural America. I would actually like to see this one re-worked. If the characters could be made more singular, and the conflicts could be made more pressing, the movie would vastly improve. **** SPOILERS **** As just one example, what are we to think when Dick Haymes abandons his love interest from the farm within 5 minutes of arrival at the fair and proposes to THIS woman within three days - even though we aren't aware of any problem with his existing girlfriend - then we see them back together within an hour of arriving home?).**** SPOILERS END **** You may like this movie despite its poverty of imagination and the inanity of almost all the songs (e.g., the lyrics to "I Owe Ioway" make no sense) -if you do, it will be because of Andrews and Crain - their romance looks real and grabs you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is difficult to like in some ways and very easy to like in others. It is an oxymoron of a film. You dislike it because it coasts on it's songs and has very little plot to speak of. You like it because those songs are so good and the simple plot is endearing even if it is predictable. The direction by Walter Lang is typical of the period. While it doesn't take away from the movie it does not add to it either.The screenplay by Oscar Hammerstein is very simple yet charming. In this version the script is essentially a springboard for Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs. However the songs are not to shabby. My favorites are "Isn't It Kinda Fun?", "All I Owe Ioway" and of course the Oscar winning "It Might as Well Be Spring".The cast is also fairly charming but nothing particularly special. Charles Winninger and Fay Bainter are good as the Mom and Dad. Dick Haymes and Vivian Blaine are good and their "courtship" is more interesting than the sister's. Jeanne Crain is probably the best actor in the movie but her romance is ruined by Dana Andrews. I disliked Dana Andrews in the movie and thought he was miscast. If it had been a different actor in that part and a little tighter script this may have gotten a six or seven instead of five.However the movie is still endearing because it's simple innocent script is very charming with a couple of excellent songs. However Rodgers and Hammerstein were headed for better things in Hollywood and outside of the horrible film "South Pacific" this is their weakest Hollywood movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This R&amp;H isn't shown very often, and I can see why. It has two lovely (and several other minor) songs, some good performances but just isn't in the same class as South Pacific, Oklahoma, or any of the other R&amp;H movies for that matter. Not unpleasant viewing by any means, but disappointing. It lacks the dramatic punch of the duo's other movies, and reminds me a bit more of the fluffy 1930s musicals that Rodgers used to write with Hart.On the plus side are two great numbers: It Might as Well be Spring and It's a Grand Night for Singing. The latter is one of the best R&amp;H waltzes. Another huge plus is Dick Haymes, who made far too few films.The two romantic subplots (Haymes-Blaine and Andrews-Crain) are weak. Haymes is unconvincing as a farm boy who dumps his hometown sweetheart in favor of a singer who turns out to be married (I said there was a spoiler here.... ) At the end, in a two-second scene, he is back with his old flame. It just isn't a particularly believable or satisfying resolution. Andrews plays an ambitious newspaper man who has some kind of job opportunity out in Chicago. His romance with Crain is more believable, but not by much. At least Andrews is cast well as the newspaperman, which is more than I can say for Haymes. I did like the cute comic subplots with the pig and the home-cooking competition, which really capture the atmosphere of country fairs. Donald Meek is funny as hell as a tipsy food-taster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet and wonderful--the sort of film Hollywood did best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been filmed many times (there's also a Will Rogers and a later Pat Boone version?and probably several others) and it's the Rogers and Hammerstein musical version of the story. My reason for watching it was simple?it had Dana Andrews in it. He's a wonderful and mostly underrated actor and I try to see everything in which he appears. He is assisted by a fine cast including Jean Crain (who is simply radiant), Dick Haymes, Vivian Blaine, Frank McHugh, Percy Kilbride, Charles Winninger, Harry Morgan, Donald Meek and Fay Bainter.The film is about the adventures of a nice farm family, the Frakes, going to a fair in the Midwest United States. Each has a story that is explored in the film. Dad (Winninger) has a sow who he thinks can take the grand prize. Mom hopes to win the prize for her homemade recipes. The son (Haymes) wants to get back at a carnie but ends up finding a beautiful girl (Blaine). And the apparent star, Crain, is vaguely disaffected with her farm life and her fianc. When she meets the newspaper man from the big city (Andrews), he offers the prospect of excitement?which is wonderful and a bit scary at the same time.Some might find the old fashion story and music a bit corny, but I felt it actually had a lot of charm. It's the sort of nice old fashioned tale that Hollywood did so well in the old days?and the sort of picture they just don't make any more. I think it's all very sweet and a slice of pure Americana?and first-rate all the way. This is a bit of a surprise for me, actually, as I am not usually a fan of musicals. I think some of the reason I liked it is that the songs are secondary to the wonderful plot. And, secondly, you really, really care about the characters?they are well-written and charming.Although the music in this film is nice, the lyrics frankly sometimes made no sense at all. Clearly this is not among the best by the famed duo of Rogers and Hammerstein, though a few songs were lovely (such as "Falling in Love" and "Maybe"). Here are a couple excerpts from their dopier songs--"I feel so gay in a melancholy way" and "Our state fair is the very best state fair in the state". If this makes sense to you, please let me know what they meant!! Fun songs?occasionally insane lyrics! In fact, had it not been for these sometimes weird lyrics, I might have even given this song a 10?it was that enjoyable.</fullReview>

I always was curious about it, but winning it on eBay for a low cost made it worth the look. I was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't as awful as I had been led to believe. But it is easy to see why it didn't make it reconstituted as a Broadway show. Much of the charm comes from the goings-on at the state fair, and that is impossible to re-create within the confines of a stage. With a couple of well-known exceptions, the score is weak, but even without the music the show would be simple mindless fun. Still, "State Fair' is a must for R&amp;H lovers.</fullReview>

Years later, "State Fair" WAS re-adapted into a Broadway musical, and promptly flopped. Maybe it was the way it was adapted, but the 1945 film is still a great disappointment, especially in comparison to Rodgers and Hammerstein's great classics. There is a good reason for this. The composer-authors of a musical generally have less creative control over a film musical than over a stage one, a notable exception being "Gigi", over which Lerner and Loewe had almost total control. Film musicals of the 1940's were generally treated like assembly-line products, and the composer and lyricist/librettist merely like expendable hired hands who could easily be replaced. It was the studio which often suggested the subject matter of a musical, and studios nearly always played it safe. Rodgers and Hammerstein had total creative control over their shows on Broadway, and the same applies to the film versions of their shows, but they did not have total control over this film. That is why "State Fair" feels more like a typical sappy musical of the 1940's than a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, and why it does not use all of the stage techniques they were so famous for, although Hammerstein did write the screenplay. The storyline is blah, the characters are sickeningly wholesome stereotypes, not all the songs are integrated into the story, and instead of there being eighteen or nineteen songs, there are only six, because the film runs only slightly more than ninety minutes. (The cast, with the hilarious exception of Donald Meek as a pie-tasting judge, is just as bland as everything else; several of them have been much better in other films.) The songs are nice, but that is all they are, just nice, not beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, 2 wonderful tunes, rest of music tired!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of the tremendous tunes "It Might as Well be Spring" and "It's a Grand Night for Singing," the movie's music is the weakest of any of the Rodgers and Hammerstein movies. Add to this that the movie is introduced by non-singers singing a non-song (OUR STATE FAIR IS A GREAT STATE FAIR....ad nauseum) and the movie lacks the punch and drive of the holy 5--Carousel, Oklahoma, Sound of Music, South Pacific, and King and I. Interesting that this is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein show to get TWO filmed versions (and the less said about the 1960's version the better).The other BIG shows deal in BIG issues--Nazism, Race, Freedom, etc. "State Fair," however, presents simply a small love story.The movie is well cast, well filmed (aside from some unfortunate matte work), and pretty; it is NOT up to the standards we expect from its originators.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"state" of inanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read my reviews of musicals, then you know that I watch most of them only so that I can heckle them like Mike, Servo and Crow do to the crummy movies that Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank send them on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". One of my cracks to the arch-hokey "State Fair" was during the taste-testing scene: I said that one of the characters had put LSD in the punch. I heckled the equally hokey 1962 version to a lesser extent, just since I'm not tempted to heckle Ann-Margret.Yes, you probably think that I'm some sort of curmudgeon. Look, these big pompous movies set themselves up to get mocked. If we can make fun of famous people, then why not the movies in which they star? And no, you can't give me any of this "Golden Age of Cinema" mumbo-jumbo; there were just as many bad movies back then as there are now. It's just that we only remember the good movies. The point is that this is just the sort of movie that begs to get given a "Weird Al" Yankovic-style treatment. And just to remind you that I'm not playing favorites, I did the same with "My Dream Is Yours", "Show Boat", "Oklahoma!", "The King and I", "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music". "MST3K" would have a field day with all these flicks. As for me, I'd like to see Quentin Tarantino remake them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite "What The--?!" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>State Fair is not a badly done movie, as musical movies go. What raises it above utter pap is the sheer inanity is exudes. There's no actual conflict in this movie. The entire dramatic tension of the film seems focused on the issue of whether the pig will stand up or not. It would be hard to describe the characters without giving away too much of the "plot" (I use the term loosely), but suffice it to say that they may seem fantastically dull, but this is compensated for by their apparent total lack of morals or compassion. Still, worth a look if you're in a mood to gawk at the oddity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie one time, and will probably never want to see it again. I found "State Fair" disappointing with a boring storyline. The actors and actresses were great, and I have to say that Fay Bainter's role as Melissa Frake was a far greater performance than in that 60's version of "The Children's Hour". I didn't care much for this movie because the music wasn't that exceptional and I found that odd. Usually Rodger's and Hammerstein's musicals are the best. The acting was about an 8, the music was a 2, and the story line was -20. I don't recommend this to anybody.</fullReview>
