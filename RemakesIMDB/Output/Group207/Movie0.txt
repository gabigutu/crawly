		<fullReview>A hideous mutant baby is born and escapes from the hospital, now it's scared and killing people. They learn that its on its way home, to find protection from its parents.A pretty decent low-budget exploitation horror film by writer/director Larry Cohan (Q-The winged Serpent), this film takes the abortion issue to another level. A simple plot that's absurdly fun and silly to watch-but it's the cleverness of the script, that never has a dull moment. The make-up effects and the baby puppet was designed and operated by Rick Baker (An American werewolf in London, Men in black, Ed Wood), the design looks decent enough for a low-budget film and one of his first major film designs, but because of Cohen's great direction we see through the eyes of the baby (in double vision) or it's hidden in the shadows and only small snippets of it are shown. We don't see it fully until the end, giving it a much more creepy feel to the film. It centers more on the sound effects than the visuals, so there is more of a presence with it's nerve wracking crying and snarling. That actually helps give the atmosphere a dark and bleak feel of depression.The performances are top notch from Sharon Farrell as the unstable mother Lenore Davies, James Dixon as Lieutenant Perkins and John Ryan as Frank Davis the cold-hearted father who wants his baby killed, his portrayal really does ground the film and brings an emotional element that sucks you in. One the greatest music composers Bernard Herrmann (Citizen Kane, North by North West, Psycho, Taxi Driver, All that money cant buy) comes up with a superb score and a chilling main theme. The cinematography is rather good towards to the feel of hysteria and tension, giving it a nauseating aura and good use of the baby's point of view. The film's pace is excellent and leads up to a fine climax. It's no great feat of its genre, but it deserves merit. A very good film that's helped by it's excellent performances, script, direction and music score. 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Alive" is one of those cult horror films that I had heard a lot of great things about but didn't get around to seeing until just recently. I have to say that I was bored with it throughout most of the film, but started to catch on to its vibe as it got closer toward the end. I truly support what this movie has to say about the somewhat totalitarian world of medicine, and ended up liking "It's Alive" a lot more when I realized that it wasn't just some dumb movie with no real point or scares at all. I still have to admit that the movie didn't scare me at all, but it generated some good, healthy suspense, and the point is such a good one (and is so well done) that I do have to hand this movie some major support. It was more sad than anything else, but it wasn't too bad at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Larry Cohen creates a thoughtful script about the effects of our environment on our reproductive systems in this thoroughly predictable yet immensely entertaining film. A father and a mother expecting rush to the hospital to have their second child. The only snag is that when the baby comes out of the womb it has razor-sharp fangs and claws with which it kills every doctor and nurse in its reach before fleeing the scene. The special effects are nothing too special, particularly by today's standards, but the film is full of insights and revelations as to what may be someday as we abuse our environment and use chemicals to sustain life. The father has a conversation in the waiting room with other expecting fathers. This conversation covers the ill-effects of pesticides, drugs, and other additives we use in our daily lives. The film uses the baby as a means to move action. With a distorted camera lens, we see things in the world through the eyes of this mutated infant. Initially the father wants to kill his beastly progeny. The police want to pump it full of lead. The doctors and drug companies want it destroyed to negate any possible backlash. A university professor wants the carcass for study when captured. Cohen shows us the underbelly of humanity. The people surrounding this infant are often no better than the child. All they want is gain...and it matters not at whose cost. John Ryan plays the introspective dad and does a fine job with this rather difficult role. He plays an ad executive who begins seeing the good in things and then slowly sees only the stark horror of his own life, his family life, his job, and his child. The other actors all do credible jobs. Cohen obviously likes horror as he names the wife Lenore and has the father talk at length about the novel Frankenstein. The production values and budget are minimal, but the film has a lot of heart where it counts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screw the negative reviews! If you're into Larry Cohen movies, you will most certainly enjoy this one. Sure it's cheezy, sure it's unbelievable, but nevertheless, it's fun!What few realize is that this film was intended as a spoof of sorts on Roman Polanski's film, "ROSEMARY'S BABY". You cannot watch this, or either of it's sequels, expecting to take things completely seriously.John P. Ryan, who plays Frank Davis, is great in this. Ryan, in my opinion, is a terrific actor and is always worth watching. Cohen employed the talents of legendary composer, Bernard Herrmann, to score this film. The score, being one of Herrmann's last compositions, is truly tremendous and gives the film it's essential monster movie feel. Rumor has it that Herrmann passed on an opportunity to score William Friedkin's mainstream horror film, "THE EXORCIST", in favor of this independent project.If you're looking for a great exploitation epic from the grand ol' days of '70s cinema, you won't be disappointed. The sequels, "IT LIVES AGAIN" and "IT'S ALIVE III: ISLAND OF THE ALIVE", are also worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Larry Cohen has made a name for himself for producing offbeat horror movies, and this story of a killer deformed baby certainly belongs in his filmography. It's Alive is a huge highlight of the horror genre, and one that doesn't get the praise that it deserves. The film is notable amongst other films of similar plotting because of the way that it fully explores it's premise. Rather than focusing on the monster and the murders, Cohen sees fit to show the audience the effect that the birth of a murderous monster has on the family at the centre of the story, the government, the family friends and various other entities; all of which helps to aid the film in it's bid to be a complete horror thriller. Of course, the film is too silly to be truly touching, but the idea of trying to get the audience to empathise with the characters in this sort of movie is nice, and it adds to kitsch campness of the movie, which does it no end of favours in this kitsch fan's opinion.The acting adheres to the typical, and much loved, B-movie styling and that is another plus point to add to this movie's resume. John P. Ryan in particular is superb as the upset father, and we see him go through a range of emotions in response to the birth of his 'son', which is a treat indeed. The script isn't the greatest work of art ever to be brought to the screen, but it's always inventive enough to ensure that the action stays interesting and It's Alive hardly suffers from becoming trite and boring. The creature effects aren't the best ever seen, but Larry Cohen hides this fact by never completely showing the creature. This hampers the movie in a way, as it will no doubt get on many viewers' nerves as seeing the monster is normally a highlight of this type of movie; but on the other hand, seeing the monster usually results in disappointment - so at least Cohen's film stays away from that! On the whole, while this film will do nothing for fans of serious art movies; horror fans, particularly very B-horror fans, will be in heaven. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something just isn't right about the Davies' baby. It has a huge head, fangs, and starts killing people.Larry Cohen is good at low budget drive-in horror movies. It's Alive is no exception. Some of the elements that work good here is that you never get a great view of the Davies' baby. You get a close up of the fangs or a quick body shot, but Cohen does a good job of not showing you the baby. If they show the puppet too much, you will get less terrified because the puppet isn't that scary. It is effective because the puppet's screen time is limited.The acting is good for a B movie. The baby's parents do a pretty good job in their roles. The settings are good. I especially like the storm drain setting at the end. The storyline isn't strong, but it was effective. I thought the father's transformation from hating to loving the baby was a little too quick and not believable. Also, I thought the pacing was uneven. Overall, this is a must see for Cohen fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attack of the killer baby!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this movie features a baby of a different kind...the kind that crawls and kills!!! Yes, a killer baby that for some reason me and my family watched quite a few times when I was a kid. Somewhat creepy and somewhat cheesy at the same time as parts of it are easily made fun of. The movie has a couple of kills in it, but it really is not all that gory compared to an Italian horror movie. The story is okay and it does not try to explain things to much, unlike the later "It's Alive" movies would do. The movie ends in a rather different fashion too as it is somewhat surprising what the man does at the end. Still, the thought of a killer baby is kind of creepy and kind of funny and that is why this movie somewhat works. More gore and such would have made it better and more sewer scenes too, for some reason I find the sewer to be a very good horror backdrop that is used somewhat in movies, but not not enough for my tastes. All in all though this movie is not boring and somewhat fun to watch and in some parts make fun of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Larry Cohen's low-budget gem still remains one of the most outrageous cult treasures from the early seventies. "It's Alive" is original, amusing and surprisingly suspenseful despite of its unlikely and absurd premise. The elaboration of the idea might be a little weak to make this pass for a controversial and/or criticizing parody, still several blackly humorous sequences manage to make you think?and worry! So, pregnant women better beware! Cohen exclusively gives subtle hints on what the cause may be and merely focuses on the terror of a hideously deformed infant that goes on a killing spree straight from the womb. Our director also has a professional eye for the social isolation of the parents by the media, the merciless battue of the police and the hypocrite medical tycoons attempting to keep the possible causes secret. Meanwhile, a subtle subplot about the mother unconditionally loving her breed ? no matter how hideous or evil ? magnificently develops itself through all the other action-packed story lines. This aspect alone proves Larry Cohen's talent as a filmmaker and scriptwriter if you ask me! Tension is efficiently created through a chilling score and an imaginative cinematography (those sewer sequences!!) but the fans of blood and gore aren't ignored, neither. The multiple and highly aggressive attacks of the newborn (it feels so weird to write this) are very nasty and blood-soaked. "It's Alive" is an indestructible horror favorite and an absolute must for cult-lovers.Larry Cohen still is a vastly underrated cult master whose entire repertoire receives my highest possible recommendation. Both sequels to this film are worth checking out as well as his "Q: The Winged Serpent", "Black Caesar" and "The Stuff". Cohen also was responsible for the screenplays of semi-classics such as "Maniac Cop", "Hell up in Harlem" and the more recent "Phone Booth". Personally, I'm still desperately trying to find a decent copy of his "God Told Me To".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pregnant Lenore Davis (Sharon Farrell) tells her husband Frank Davis (John Ryan) that she is in labor to have the baby. They leave their eleven year-old son Chris (Daniel Holzman) with their friend Charley (William Wellman Jr.) and they head to the Community Hospital. Lenore feels that something is wrong and delivers a monster that kills the team in the delivery room and escapes through a skylight. Lieutenant Perkins (James Dixon) comes to the hospital to investigate the murder and the press divulges the identity of the parents of the monster. Frank loses her job of executive in public relationship and accepts the offer of a university that wants to research the corpse of the baby to discover the reason for the mutation. Meanwhile the baby continues to kill people in town. Out of the blue, Frank discovers a dark secret about Lenore and the baby.A couple of days ago I saw the awful remake of "It's Alive" and I decided to watch again the 1974 B-movie of Larry Cohen to reevaluate it in the present days. The original film is better and better than the lame remake of 2010. The analogy of Frank with Dr. Frankenstein is one of the good dialogs of this film. The madness process of Lenore Davis is more plausible than the ridiculous behavior of Lenore Harker of the new version. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Nasce um Monstro" ("A Monster is Born")Note: On 25 March 2016, I saw this film again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IT'S ALIVE (1974) ** John Ryan, Sharon Farrell, James Dixon, William Wellman, Jr., Daniel Holzman, Guy Stockwell, Michael Ansara. Cult horror classic conceived by filmmaker Larry Cohen with his signature low-budget aplomb probes many fears (pregnancy, parenthood, chemically enhanced polutions et al) when a loving family's latest offspring turns out to be a murderous monstrosity. Subjective camera angles and quick interspersed cuts of the 'infant' (created by a young Rick Baker, Future Oscar-winning MonsterMaker!) give a few good chills in this fairly middling, tongue-in-cheek genre flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family is riddled with tragic repercussions when a baby is born a mutated monstrosity with an urge to rip the throats of victims after it escapes the hospital. Starting with the hospital staff in the delivery room, Frank and Lenore's(John P Ryan &amp; Sharon Farrell)monster baby goes on a rampage, attacking citizens in Bevery Hills including a milk man. Frank and Lenore's names are released to the media as the parents with their life taking a turn for the worse. Not only do they have to deal with having such a monster baby, but knowing that it's killing folks in the Beverly Hills area and that people look at them strangely as if they were at fault somehow. There's a killer monster baby out there, somebody's got to take the blame so why not point the accusing finger at the parents, eh? Frank loses his lucrative public relations job(..kind of a sense of irony here, considering Frank's life is a public relations nightmare)and Lenore is slowly growing mad. As the police issue a man hunt, researching scientists wish to study the child, although the pharmaceutical company who created certain pills Lenore was taking during her pregnancy wish for it to be dead..destroyed beyond recognition so that any kind of scientific study would not yield results damaging the precious reputation of the medication issued by any big name company. While their eleven year old son Chris(Daniel Holzman)remains with a friend, Charley(William Wellman, Jr), the couple try to cope somehow with the various traumas put upon them. But, the baby wishes to find mommy and daddy..You know it's been quite a while since I last saw this, but I never remembered Larry Cohen's pinnacle of monster/killer baby flicks(..honestly, when you hear the moniker, "killer baby flick", what's the first movie that pops into your head?)being as depressing and thought-provoking as this viewing turned out to be. A nice little twist at the end pointing out that perhaps a plague was developing across the nation, and questioning whether or not certain medications or radioactive elements cause abnormalities and various deformities to born children, really give this flick a surprising sub-text not often associated with these type of films. The performances, from Ryan and Farrell as the tormented, agonizing parents who didn't ask for the problems forced on them, really won me over. There are scenes where Farrell as Lenore attempts to return to a sense of normalcy that her family's lives had, with those around her(..and us)noticing that she's deteriorating emotionally and psychologically..this burden of not being able to hold a child you carried in your womb for 9 months and the fact that everyone wishes to kill it certainly is displayed to the viewer through Farrell's crumbling demeanor and burdened face, attempting to smile with nothing but sadness behind it. There's one terrific scene for Ryan(..although, he has many when the film pointedly expresses his aching and thoughtless determination to kill the beast which has caused so much pain to his family)where he..in the sewers with the police searching for the baby..is face to face with his monster child realizing, through tear-swelling eyes, that he can not kill what it essentially his son. I think that's another aspect that impressed me..the idea that society looks at the deformed and ugly as inhuman only fit for death, while the parents see a child of theirs with a right to live regardless of how it was born. I felt Cohen did the right thing by hinting at the monster baby without elaborating in great detail what it looks like. Through visual tricks, Cohen keeps the baby from being completely visualized, escaping(..mostly)giggles and chuckles from an audience. I do think, believe it or not, that the film holds it's own thanks in part to the serious tone and interesting subject matter, performed admirably with a straight-face. There's no doubt, though, that the film was made on a cheap budget, but I felt Cohen overcomes that thanks to the performances and script which I think work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grisly, thoughtful and fine early horror from Larry Cohen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These days, Larry Cohen seems to incline more towards the mainstream, given that he wrote the screenplays for the thrillers Phone Booth and Cellular. Back in the 70's though he was accumulating his reputation among horror fans as a fine purveyor of thought provoking and often witty low budget horror, withs serious messages and a lot of verve. Though raw and unrefined in its approach and lacking the vivacity of the like of The Stuff or Q, It's Alive was an early hit and still a fine work today. Its certainly one of the best killer baby films, with a savage little tyke that kills a fair few people. More than just a schlock piece though, this film has brains and heart and is supported by fine performances. The screenplay brings up fears about the environment and fertility treatments as well as casting a baleful eye on the press, the police, science and medicine. The parents are sidelined and exploited by the forces around them, whilst going through their own torments about the infant creature. John P. Ryan gives a fine performance as the father, nervy and serious whilst coming to his own realisation about his situation and a touching emotional arc. Sharon Farrell is equally fine as his wife, thrown off kilter by events. The effects by Rick Baker are crude but effective and the creature is wisely kept in the shadows until the end. There is little gore, mostly little bits of bloodshed or after the event corpses. Good use is made however of the baby's cries, a piercing sound used for some good creepy moments, and its attacks are suitably tense. Excitement is kept rumbling also by Bernard Hermanns score, which was one of his last. The film has its lapses and the themes and characters could have been better explored to make more of an impact, whilst the low budget does show and the suspense sometimes stumbles. All considered though, it may not be that that accomplished, but still holds its own as a memorable, provocative and clever shocker and is recommended for fans of the more thoughtful and oddball horror of the 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After rushing to hospital for the delivery of their second child, a couple are horrified when the new baby turns out to be some kind of mutated killer monster that slays the attending nursing staff and doctor and then disappears. With authorities hunting it down and the father himself determined to kill the monstrosity it can only be a matter of time before the thing is destroyed. Surely.Coming from writer/director Larry Cohen (creator of fun little movies such as Q: The Winged Serpent, God Told Me To and The Stuff, to name just a few), this "killer baby" movie is a cult favourite among many fans but is very much a product of it's time and it's budgetary limitations. There is much talk of radiation and chemicals both before and after the baby is born and I can only suppose that we are to believe these things may have contributed to the mutation - the perils of modern life and all that. The baby itself, wisely, isn't shown all that much. While the effects are not terrible (despite some absurdly bright red paint masquerading as blood when streaked over people lying down pretending to be dead) it's more effective to keep the killer infant in shadow and give us only small, partial reveals. Yes, there are times during the first half of the movie when you glimpse something resembling a Sesame Street puppet gone horribly wrong but the second half of the film redresses the balance and works much better for it.The acting varies between terrible and average although John P. Ryan does better than most people as the father who disassociates himself from the horror and gains a grim determination to deal with something he does not even acknowledge as his own offspring. In fact, acting apart, it is with Sharon Farrell (playing the mother) that we get the more interesting aspects of the movie. Cohen has often layered even his schlockiest outings with subtext and issues and this movie is no exception. We're looking at parental responsibility and how far people will go to protect or look after their children, no matter what they have done. The "It" of the title is the very epitome of a child who has gone off the rails while his parents just want him to get back to normal. It's an interesting take on some wild material that is not recommended for pregnant women.See this if you like: C.H.U.D, Rosemary's Baby, Blessed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Larry Cohen's IT'S ALIVE delivers. How well I remember the ad campaign: a slow, tracking shot moving toward a baby's crib. "There's only one thing wrong with the Davis baby," the announcer says: "It's ALIVE!" On cue, a small claw appears, reaching up to curl around the edge of the crib. I saw this one at the drive-in with my mother (who, when she saw the baby, cooed: "Ain't it CUTE...?"). John P. Ryan, an unfairly underrated actor throughout most of his career (he could, given the chance, play good or bad characters to the proverbial hilt), gives a truly outstanding performance: he begins to visibly wither under the strain as the horrifying story unfolds. I read somewhere that Richard Matheson was an uncredited writer on this one: if so, it explains a great deal; the story unfolds logically, in what I've come to think of as "typical Richard Matheson fashion." The subjective point of view shots from the tot's low-angle perspective, coupled with its inhuman screeching, lend the movie tension-mounting suspense from beginning to end- and the final scene, in a storm drain, is unforgettable. (The twist at the very end is mere icing on the cake.) One of my all-time favorites, IT'S ALIVE warrants a look by anyone interested in truly enjoyable fright films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather overrated thriller from Larry Cohen, High Priest Of The Powerful Premise, that spawned two mildly amusing sequels. A mutant baby springs from his mother's womb and goes on a dull rampage. Father John Ryan pursues the tyke and is finally forced to kill it. Cohen suggests that environmental chemicals may be the cause of the baby's hideous deformities and keeps the baby off-screen for much of the picture.The writer/director's strong suite is characterization, not direction, and in that regard he succeeds. We feel Ryan's pain and allow ourselves to be dragged into his nightmare. Unfortunately, Cohen's flat direction and uneven pacing finally kill our interest.Rick Baker's baby is a nasty little critter, scuttling around like a crab and snarling occasionally at the camera, but Cohen lights him too harshly when he shouldn't be seen and keeps him hidden when a quick glance is essential.A missed opportunity and a possible candidate for a remake.</fullReview>

The story is more than a little stupid, has plot holes big enough for freeway construction and is dull. The acting sucks, the direction is by the numbers and the "special" effects showing the baby are unintentionally hilarious. The baby is almost never seen--for good reason. When they do show it attacking a man at the end it's one of the most uproarious things I've ever seen. It's very hard to sit there with a straight face seeing this tiny little baby JUMP onto a guy and "attack" him. The premise sounds interesting but, even if you suspend disbelief entirely, who is going to seriously believe a just-born baby is able to slaughter four or five doctors and get out of the operating room and wander all around town without being noticed? Come on! For some reason, this film was banned in Finland--my guess is that the censors saw it and banned it for its lack of quality! A total fiasco. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Only One Thing Wrong With the Davis Baby...It's Alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Cohen's 1974 horror movie It's Alive! fizzled at the box office during it's initial run but for it's 1977 re-release it was given a slick new ad campaign which warned; There's only one thing wrong with the Davis baby...It's Alive! and a cult hit was born. The Davis family is expecting a baby but they weren't expecting a mutant beast which slaughtered everyone in it's path at the moment of it's birth or the sensational media coverage painting them as monstrous as their offspring. Cohen fires a low budget shotgun blast hitting targets as diverse as public relations, birth control and environmental pollution in telling his rather engaging, offbeat tale. Rick Baker designed the bloodthirsty ankle biter and famed composer Bernard 'Psycho' Herrman provided the score. Followed by two sequels and a remake.</fullReview>

Only the father can seek out his child and accept it despite its unnatural appearance.I think what I liked most about this movie is towards the end, when the father rescues the child. I didn't appreciate the environmental propaganda message behind the movie, and It's Alive has its flaws, but hey, what low-budget horror movie doesn't? That's what makes them so much fun to watch!

In in the initial stages of the movie, this couple (especially the father) do everything they can to distance themselves from the creature they have created and even participate in the hunt to track and destroy it, but eventually attitudes change.I found this to be better than I expected and very much above the average for a early 70s B-horror movie. I recently wrote a review on another film where I stated that it had failed the "Val Lewton Test" to me. In other words, had you removed the monster's scenes from the movie, what you would have had left was not a very effective movie at all. This movie is almost the polar opposite. What I found was a fairly effective chiller, with some moments of real tension built up, but ultimately I kept being pulled out of the experience by the ridiculousness of a "killer baby" scenario that wasn't helped along any by the awful hokey creature effects on the baby itself. Each time I found myself being absorbed into the movie, I was yanked away by cheap effects and gags that I was never quite sure where being played for laughs, or just the work of a budget not good enough to achieve the desired effect.If you can forgive the bad effects, though, what's left is actually pretty good. John Ryan is excellent as the father struggling with the emotions of this situation he's been thrust in, and the outcasting from society that results. Sharon Farrell shines in the birth scene as a mother facing most parent's worst nightmare of a difficult birth. As the movie progresses, she begins to lose her grip on sanity and comes off a little bit Renfield.The movie has a lot to say about society. We have the boss playing as if he cares about his employee's family turbulence, while secretly shoving him out the door to avoid scandal. In the same manner, then nurse under the guise of caring for the mother, while secretly planning to exploit them for writing material. We see the ways that society shuns those who birth deformities as once upon a time society shunned those who birthed disabled children (maybe not so once upon a time?).Of course, there are doctors who want to examine and study the child. The pharmacy companies want to make it go away to avoid any potential bad publicity. The authorities just want to massacre it, which I found realistically odd. I mean, not to get to technical, but even the worst mass murderers get a trial, right? Then a baby with no knowledge of the evil of what it's doing just gets slaughtered? Perhaps, I'm putting way too much thought into that.In the end, if you like 70s b-horror, then by all means give this one a shot. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expectant parents Frank (John P. Ryan) and Lenore (Sharon Farrell) get the shock of their lives when their new baby turns out to be a hideous mutant, one that kills whenever it feels threatened. Fleeing the hospital, having massacred the entire delivery room staff only seconds after its birth, the savage infant roams Los Angeles, hunted by the police and its own father.Although writer/director Cohen's script flirts with ecological/medical issues, briefly suggesting that either pollution or untested drugs may be the cause of the mutation and questioning the morality of abortion, these interesting plot points are quickly pushed aside in favour of Frank's growing psychological turmoil and the mounting police search for the monstrous child.The former is handled pretty well, John P. Ryan giving a commendable performance as the initially belligerent father who ultimately tries to save his new son, but the pursuit of the creature is very tedious?unimaginative, repetitive, and lacking in general outrageousness and gore, with effects genius Rick Baker's mutant baby frustratingly kept hidden in the shadows for the majority of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's alive is a somewhat underrated movie about a baby being born and killing people. It's the kind of horror movie you either avoid or treasure. For me, it's kinda a tough choice.I liked the movie for the creepy atmosphere and good music. The story build-up is also noteworthy. The acting is okay, although some characters tend to annoy you after awhile.What I really hated about this movie is the large amount of muttering words. It could be my quality of the movie, but I couldn't understand several characters most of the time. For example, the leading woman (who gives birth to the baby) was as clear as day. So either I got a bad copy or something went wrong when they made this movie. It's usually helpful if you can hear what the people are saying. It helps with understanding the story.Okay, so the plot is silly and the effects are kind of hokey, but that doesn't take away the charm of this film.It's Alive is a little horror gem. I can imagine it was (and maybe still is) quite scary for pregnant women.6 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame the last act drags so much, and it takes forever to wrap things up because this might have been quite an effective little shocker. It even manages to successfully pull off the impossible pitch of a killer baby on the loose played for chills, not laughs.John Ryan in the lead seems to have wondered in from the wrong movie. His strangely sweaty performance is far too intense and he never convinces as the troubled, distraught father.Legendary composer Bernard Herrmann does a decent job, but the impact of the music tends to be lost when you notice he ripped much of it off for his stunning Taxi Driver score two years later!The murderous baby is naturally kept off camera for most of the running time, and we never get a good look at it, but it's a just-about-passable model job that only raises a giggle the first time it's glimpsed. One or two of the death scenes are handled well, particularly the genuinely disturbing aftermath of the birth, and the moment where a stream of spilled milk pouring from the van in which a man is being attacked slowly turns pink.Not dreadful, but it suffers from pacing issues and even at 90 minutes it feels too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's Alive" is a curiosity. Obviously a low budget horror feature from Producer/Director Larry Cohen, it misses the mark in my opinion.Frank and Lenore Davies (John Ryan, Sharon Farrell) are about to have their second child. When Lenore informs Frank that "it's time" he rushes her to the hospital. Everything seems to be going along nicely until the actual birth. A mutated monster is born and immediately murders everyone in the delivery room except it's mother and then flees.Lt. Perkins (James Dixon) of the police is assigned the case by his captain (Michael Ansara..sans toupee). "The Doctor" ( Shamus Locke) and Perkins agree that this thing must be destroyed. "The Professor" (Andrew Duggan) wants it to be examined in detail and preserved for science. "The Executive" (Robert Emhart) of a major drug company wants the situation kept out of the public eye.Meanwhile, The Davies' identity has become known to the public and they become the targets of the media. Davies boss Bob Clayton (Guy Stockwell) lets him go from his job. More murders ensue. Davies takes it upon himself to personally destroy his "baby". Then, baby comes home and...................Unfortunately, Cohen leaves many questions unanswered. Things like, where did this mutant come from? why the Davies? why does it kill indiscriminately? The final scene offers s partial explanation but fails to explain the how and the why.Although Duggan, Stockwell, Ansara and Emhart were well known actors at the time, their parts amount to little more than one scene cameos. William Wellman Jr. appears as the Davies first child, Charlie.The best thing about this film is the haunting score by Bernard Herrmann. It must have done well enough though in order to to spawn two sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably expected way too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie about a killer mutant freak child, this is pretty goddamn boring. Though the premise seems very fun and interesting, the execution is about as stale and disappointing as movies get. To me, the most bothersome thing about this horror flick was that there was just no suspense at all. Just, none. Okay, not entirely true, the milkman scene was pretty effective, but that's about one minute of the movie. All the rest is kind of a chore to sit through really, the charm of characters we've barely seen before and barely care about getting killed off-screen kinda escapes me. Even compared with the rather similar and also quite flawed "Basket Case", this just doesn't hold up. At least "Basket Case" had a cool puppet and some hilarious state-of-the-art stop motion effects, this one just has an okayish puppet and no effects. I just couldn't get into this movie at all, though I must admit the climax well, wasn't as bad as the rest I guess. I also liked the lead actor, who's about the only thing that made me keep watching. Good idea, weak movie, that about sums it up for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this film was not really the acting. It was the story and the thing that was suppose to scare the viewers. John P. Ryan plays the lead and for some reason, I really liked his performance. He just had the look and acting to really put the film on edge. His wife is played by Sharon Farrell, who at the right time could act. But sometimes she seemed a little off. The whole story line of this film is ridiculous. Woman gives birth to a baby that is mutated and it kills people. No real back story on how it happened. Maybe it was some drugs she was taking. The baby was suppose to scare you. But how can you be scared by something that reminds you of a small monkey of some sort. Some of the other cast was pretty cheesy including the son of Ryan of Farrell, but he was young and didn't know better. There needed to be more jumping scenes also. But every time one can up, they would trigger it with the baby crying or something moving. So that way you know it was coming. The movie overall was missing a lot, including a good ending. Maybe if they added more gore, it could of been more of a cult following than what it was. But most of the gore scenes were a few deep scratches from the babies strange sloth like nails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Show Me The Monster!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of parents call their children "little monsters," but few of them with more cause than Frank and Lenore Davies in Larry Cohen's 1974 offering "It's Alive." The Davies' 10-lb., mutated bundle of hell has fangs, claws and one helluva temper, you see, and its first act as a newborn is to brutally slay the entire delivery team in the hospital! As compared to filmdom's other famous mutant infant, the one in David Lynch's 1978 "Eraserhead," I'd have to say that the Davies spawn is much worse. Lynch's baby merely looked grotesque and cried incessantly, whereas Cohen's manages to locomote himself all over L.A. and kill anyone he meets up with. Anyway, while this film has some good elements going for it, it remains something of a mixed bag. John Ryan is particularly fine as the father with conflicted feelings, and Bernard Herrmann contributes yet another wonderfully moody score that aids immeasurably in punching the film across. But the picture has one tremendous problem, I feel; namely, that we hardly ever get to see Jr.! What few shots there are are partial glimpses at best, and seen in darkened basements and sewer tunnels or obscured by shrubbery. Yes, we see numerous POV shots via Jr.'s ground-level double vision, but blessed little of mama's little darling himself. This is no Val Lewton "power of suggestion" movie; if you're gonna shove gory killings in my face, Larry, then at least SHOW ME THE MONSTER, or at least one good establishing head shot thereof! A definitive explanation for Jr.'s condition, and how he is able to find his parents' house in all of L.A., would've been nice, too. Still, unsatisfied as I was left, I'm still curious enough to take a look at Parts 2 and 3...</fullReview>

It's Alive was the biggest piece of tosh I have ever been unfortunate enough to watch. The only parts that were remotely frightening we're when the baby showed it's face (even then, cheap 70's props were really crappy and cheezy), WHEN it showed it's face. All the parts in between weren't able to grab my attention, and I mostly fast forwarded through all of them.*SPOILERS MIGHT BE AHEAD*Can someone explain to me why the doctors and parents are so non-chalant after the baby kills 7 or 8 surgeons and then hides on the roof? Is this common place? Is there always man-killing, roof-climbing, fanged babies running about? And why is it so hard for 40 police men to shoot a small and slow target? JEEZ.

		<shortDescription>Very much a product of its era: a grim and creepy '70s horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Cohen's grisly and original take on the monster movie is very much a product of its time. This is a cold, unflinching '70s film, where every camera shot seems to take place on the corner of a regular street, inhabited by regular, hard-working guys, and the cold night air seems to give a chilly, clinical atmosphere to what's taking place on screen. IT'S ALIVE reminds me very much of early Cronenberg: think SHIVERS and RABID. This is a disturbing film that has the atmosphere of a never-ending nightmare: despite some dodgy effects and occasional campiness, for the most part the horror works.The story of a mutant baby crawling around and biting people to death sounds pretty ludicrous on the face of it. There are only so many stalk-and-slash scenarios that the director can work with, although his blurred-eye-vision tracking shots seem to have influenced Carpenter when he made HALLOWEEN. No, Cohen wisely chooses to focus on emotion and characterisation over action, and the central character is the distraught father who runs a gamut of feelings when he discovers that his baby is responsible for a hospital massacre. John P. Ryan, giving one of the all-time-great B-movie performances, excels as the clinically detached dad who discovers his paternal instincts at the film's climax.The special effects are quite poor by today's standard (the baby is played by a regular actor in close-up shots) and Cohen keeps the monster off-screen for the most part, which does help counter the general cheapness. Still, I found the baby quite eerie, thanks mainly to Rick Baker's makeup work, and the fact that it retains some humanity helps to give the film its emotional heart. Despite the low budget, IT'S ALIVE is also blessed with an absolutely fantastic soundtrack thanks to Hitchcock composer Bernard Herrmann, who goes all out to create spooky, evocative and atmospheric music. The presence of these three men (Herrmann, Ryan and Cohen) makes this film a minor classic of the period.</fullReview>

She has gone into labor. After depositing young son Daniel Holzman (as Chris) with family friend William Wellman Jr. (son of renowned director William Wellman, as Charley), Mr. Ryan drives his wife to the hospital. Delivery of the couple's second child is difficult, to say the least. The horrific hospital incident produces a monster who terrifies Ryan's family and community..."It's Alive" is a minor miracle for Larry Cohen, who wrote, produced and directed this low-budget, sleeper classic...After a skillful career in television, Mr. Cohen began dabbling in feature films, with mixed (but interesting) results. Here, as the auteur of his film, Cohen reveals great style and structure; the latter being a big improvement over his previous "Bone" (1972). Like the legendary Alfred Hitchcock, Cohen knows what, when and how much to show. Rick Baker's makeup and special effects look amazing. Cohen gets Hitchcock's notable soundtrack composer Bernard Herrmann to score and gets great help from Ryan, who plays the baby's father to perfection.******** It's Alive (1974-07) Larry Cohen ~ John P.

It kills the delivery team in the hospital leaving mother alive, but shattered beyond belief and not knowing really what's going on. A beautiful Bernard Hermann score is really wasted on a cheap horror exploitation flick that spawned to sequels itself. Although Farrell as the mother should by all accounts be the protective one even though this thing which we never quite see, it is Davis as the father who tries to save it in the end. Even though Davis is only the father in the sense that Joseph is the listed father on the birth certificate in the Nazareth Hall of Records. In fact we're never really sure what caused Farrell to bring this into the world.Fans of gory horror films will love It's Alive, not sure how others will take it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "It's Alive" was a respectable hit at the box office back in 1974, I think that most people who watch it today will be puzzled as to why the movie was so popular at the time. The low budget hurts the movie in a number of ways - the sound is often poorly recorded, the sets and locations often look cheap and unconvincing, and scenes seem to be missing. Such things might have been forgiven had the rest of the movie been stronger, but the movie also suffers from a very slow pace, too much dialogue, and too little in the way of horror (the movie only got a PG rating.) On the positive side, there is some witty dialogue as well as some effective black humor. There is also some good social satire, as well as some surprisingly powerful dramatic sequences. So the movie is not a complete waste. However, I would only recommend it to die hard horror fans as well as those interested in the varied film career of writer/director Larry Cohen. Hopefully things will improve when I watch the two sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the field of schlock-horror Larry Cohen is something of a cult figure and "It's Alive" is very highly thought of amongst aficionados of the genre. In fact it's a crude, exploitative picture and it's atrociously acted but it's also imaginative and creepy and if the central premise of a demon baby that goes on the rampage the minute it comes out of the womb is risible Cohen still knows how to create tension from the most bizarre of situations. He is, of course, greatly helped in this by a terrific Bernard Herrmann score.Whether we can read anything into the film about the plight of handicapped children and society's attitude to the handicapped in general is entirely another matter. Cohen may gear us towards sympathy for the mutant baby but not at the expense of a plethora of guts and gore, so while the ending should move us or at least engage us Cohen bottles it so that it's just plain silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Alive is set in Los Angeles where publicity executive Frank Davies (John Ryan) &amp; his wife Lenore (Sharon Farrell) are expecting their second child, Lenore goes into labour &amp; Frank drives her to the hospital to give birth. While waiting in a hallway outside the delivery room Frank sees a nurse stagger towards him &amp; collapse on the floor, Frank rushes into the delivery room &amp; sees all the doctor's &amp; nurses slaughtered while his wife Lenore is in hysterics. The police are called &amp; it soon becomes obvious that Lenore gave birth to some mutant killer baby that is now on the loose in Los Angeles killing anyone it comes across. Frank is fired from his job &amp; he becomes determined to track the monster baby down &amp; kill it...Written, produced &amp; directed by Larry Cohen this killer baby film was a big international hit at the time of release &amp; Cohen went on to make a strong name for himself in the sci-fi horror genre, a surprisingly deep film It's Alive stands up pretty well &amp; is still moderately effective even now some thirty five years after it was initially released. The script by Cohne is pretty witty &amp; has fairly rich concept's floating about like the idea that contraceptive pills my be responsible for the mutant baby, the part the press plays in hounding the Davis family, the way their friends &amp; workers react to them, the scandal &amp; how it's reported, the police line, the idea that the mutant baby must be killed could be seen as a pro abortion stance but the other theme of contraceptive pills being responsible for the mutant baby suggest otherwise &amp; the whole issue of overriding maternal instinct comes into play at the end. Cohen's script juggles the ideas &amp; themes quite well giving a chance for the character's to breathe, the mutant baby isn't seen that often but despite a 90 minute duration It's Alive maintains ones interest very well. There are some nice speeches, some witty dialogue, good character's &amp; a initially simple sounding plot that does have more going on than you may think. Of course there are moments that don't quite work, the police seem to be far too quick to believe that a mutant baby is going around killing people (no-one even saw it, or at least saw it &amp; lived to talk about it) &amp; I have no idea how a days old baby would know or even goes about finding where it's parents lived or even being able to recognise them.Amazingly It's Alive was given a PG rating in the US when originally released &amp; is pretty strong stuff for such a tame rating, there's a fair amount of blood &amp; death although actual gore is low. The film looks nice enough if a little garish by today's tastes, the opening scenes has what appears to be beams of torch light darting all over the lace which I assume is meant to be sperm. The climax in the sewers is pretty cool with scenes only illuminated with the red flashing police car lights. The mutant baby itself was made by Rick Baker &amp; is barely glimpsed, some may say it's more effective when you don't see that much but one suspects the brief flashes &amp; seldom seen baby is down to a poor looking effect rather than any artistic decision.Shot on a very low budget the photography is a bit random at times, the picture can be very dark &amp; the editing is very choppy in certain scenes but the strong narrative help overcome minor technical inadequacies. Regular Hitchcock composer Bernard Hermann provides a rousing score in what was his last film before he died. The acting is very solid, John Ryan is great as the insanely grinning, gum chewing parent who wants the baby dead because somehow it's part of him rather than concern for the many victims.It's Alive is a well rounded little exploitation film that has a surprisingly deep script, it brings issues up &amp; raises good moral questions it's character's have to answer which we can relate too in certain ways. Followed by two sequels, It Lives Again (1978) &amp; It's Alive III: Island of the Alive (1987) &amp; was remade as It's Alive (2008).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and chilling horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before 'The Omen' and 'The Unborn' cult filmmaker Larry Cohen delivered (No pun intended) one of, if not his best film to an unsuspecting audience. It's a good old fashioned "monster on the loose" movie, but from a time when many horror films had more suspense and atmosphere than blood and guts. 'It's Alive' has a little of both, helping to make it one of the most entertaining and downright creepy killer baby films in recent memory. It may not have aged perfectly, but that hasn't diminished it's ability to frighten.Pros: Fine performances. A powerful and chilling score by the late great Bernard Hermann. Writer/director Cohen does a bang-up job of creating suspense and tension. Scary attacks scenes. Well-paced. Rick Baker did an excellent job on the monster design. If you like blood in your horror movies then you'll find a decent amount of it here. Setting most of the film at night and using little light adds the eeriness of the film.Cons: Some things haven't aged well. Though it's handled well, the idea of a killer baby is pretty silly when you think about it.Final thoughts: I wouldn't put this in my top 10 horror films of the 70s list, but it would still be pretty high up there. If you can get past the silliness of the concept you may find yourself on the edge of your seat and entertained throughout. A true cult classic from one of the masters! My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

Also considerably adding to said creepiness was the score by Bernard Herrmann ( one of his last ). Neat film, hear there's a remake... Larry Cohen's movies were always great, and you can tell that even with obvious budget limitations, his creativity really carries this movie. As a matter of fact, the reason you DON'T see much of the mutant is probably due to those same limitations. The sequels, though somewhat interesting, did not capture the eerie suspense of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a horror film, It's Alive is surprisingly solid. The only aspects that can be safely classified as weak are the baby/monster (who cares) and the some very choppy action. What makes this movie are the actors and the themes. That's a rare claim for a horror film.The lead actors are frankly fantastic, and the themes are go way beyond typical for the genre. Sharon Farrell is the quintessential medicated housewife, rolling together stress, trust, hope, fear, and desperate needs to please both her husband and her baby. John Ryan is equally convincing as the suspicious, angry, but conflicted and loving husband. You really never see this many layers in characterization a horror movie.To top it off, the themes are fascinating. A married couple who hasn't had a baby in 11 years is delighted to finally have a second child. Put aside the fact that the baby is a monster. Assume he's merely deformed or retarded. Mom is guilty and desperate for affirmation. Dad is suspicious of his wife, paranoid of what everyone thinks, and angry at everyone. This movie is being remade. It's a long shot that the acting will be as good and the themes will be anywhere near as interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stars: John P. Ryan.You can't really expect much out of a movie about a killer baby, and if you are watching it for the killer baby, don't. The baby has such little screen time and when people are killed it's mostly off-screen. That's not why I don't particularly like this film. I don't really like it because of it's not so good acting, and it's pacing. The movie is so slow, and it really doesn't lead up to much either. The ending is not one that I thought was very good or necessary, but writer/director Larry Cohen put it in. After watching it once, it's hard to watch it again. With that said, it has it's moments, and it is a competent horror film.My rating: ** out of ****. 90 mins. PG for Language and Violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>where did this come from</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film literally came out of no where. On that blatant and somewhat generic statement, I'll explain what is different about this movie and what made it a unique and random horror hit of the 70s. First of all the premise of this film is based on a murderous baby, incredible and almost unimaginable. It takes the probably most single innocent stage and helplessness of a baby human infant and gives its powers of a murderer. Great movies come on original ideas and this certainly is a one. The film even employs some original film lenses for different character point of views. I recommend this film if your a fan of such movies as Child's Play, Poltergeist, and the Basket Case series. As its a movie pertaining to the horrific children/infant genre. This film and its two sequels Its Alive 2: It Lives Again and Its ALive 3: The Island of The Alive, on a triple feature single DVD, i recommend it as the viewer may find purchasing each not worth the price, its certainly worth ten dollars for all three films. I gave this film a 7 out of 10 because the acting wasn't atrocious, some of the murder scenes were very well, and it had that 70s horror feel that you remember if you grew up watching the horror genre as a child in the 80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must give Larry Cohen credit with this movie. One of his earliest films and one of his best. Cohen proves himself to be a good director with a strong and solid cast. What this movie lacks in special effects it gains in entertainment.The story starts with a couple going to the hospital because the wife is having her baby. Upon delivery, the baby is a mutation and murders everyone in the delivery room except its mother. Now, it is out in the city killing random people and the police are out on a "shoot to kill" mission to stop the terror.The story sounds silly, and when you think about it, it really is. What makes the movie work so well is top notch performances from the baby's Father and Mother (Sharon Ferrell and John Ryan). John Ryan in particular is incredible in his role as in one scene, after being so cold hearted about murdering his own son, actually starts crying. This brings quite a great character twist to the whole story. Look also for James Dixon as a police detective who has been in a whole bunch of other Cohen films.The special effects were decent enough for a low-budget film. You never really get a good look at the mutated baby but this all works to the movies favor. If you are looking for a gory film, this really is not all that gory minus the hospital scene.This is a must see for all Larry Cohen fans and a must see for horror fans in general. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director/Script: Larry Cohen, Cast: John P. Ryan, Sharon Farrell, James Dixon, Andrew Duggan This is a fun, campy little flick from Larry Cohen, director of many offbeat films like this one and writer of many other horror films. This films shows us what could happen if we don't clean up our environment! An expectant father soon discovers that his newborn had just killed several nurses and doctors in the delivery room and escaped the hospital. This appears to be some mutant monster of a baby, the result of radiation or pollution of the environment. Although a little far fetched, the reasoning behind this monstrosity is pretty convincing.At first the father doesn't accept the baby as his (he couldn't have possibly have had a part in creating this!). The government wants the baby destroyed and the father supports them. By the end of the film the father takes to his child and protects him from his assailants. Along the way the monster baby kills out of fear and necessity(he's got to eat!) Cohen never shows us the child up close. When we do see him it is done in quick shots given us only quick glimpses of the baby probably to make it less obvious that the baby is just a doll. This actually add to the mystery of the film. This film is much better than it may seem and is among the classics of the horror/thrillers of the 1970's. It launched two sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>low budget goofy concept actually works; aren't all babies monstrous, in a way?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman gives birth, and all the doctors and nurses in the room are killed. The hospital and police and parents quickly realize that the baby was monstrous and that it was responsible, though they didn't see it. The parents were conflicted about the birth even before it - their last child is eleven, and they are conflicted about this one too. The father primarily wants to deny that it is related at all, as it goes around town killing people.For a low-budget movie with something of a silly premise, it does a fairly good job of avoiding looking too cheap or too silly. At times it does drag a bit. Remarkable to think that there are two sequels, and now possibly a remake on the way! If it convinced any people to never have children, I think that is a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Alive: 5/10: Larry Cohen is a great idea man. Recently, for example, he is behind both Phone Booth and Cellular. And in the horror department he wrote both the underrated Maniac Cop series and the monster movie classic Q. He is however best known for his It's Alive killer baby series. His trademark social commentary and realistic dialog are evidenced in spades in It's alive. Unfortunately his '70's television style direction is also in evidence. On the positive side It's Alive is a true high concept film where the politics of abortion and family intermingle with commentary on everything from environmental threats, uncaring doctors and the nuclear family to the tabloid media. Add in a surprisingly literate script and very strong acting from lead John P Ryan you have the makings of a great 70's social commentary film with bad fashions and 70's kitsch to help the ride immensely.Unfortunately It's Alive is a horror movie and on that front it's atrocious. Now I understand the bad special effects and cheap scares. But why are the characters constantly in the dark? Were there no light switches in the 70's? In one bizarre scene the cops are looking for the killer baby in a school at night. They go room to room with flashlights dying in the process. The main character Ryan searches his house and basement again at night and in the dark. Turn on the damn lights. There is a switch right there behind you. The two most effective scares ironically are both during the day (The operating room and the milk truck) in most of the other scenes it simply is hard to make out who is where and what is going on. The direction is at some points almost obstructionist to the viewer purposely keeping us in the dark (pun intended) to the characters point of view. The pacing is also quite leisurely and the last thirty minutes in particular drags badly. A forgettable string musical score certainly doesn't help the cause either. It's Alive has both shock and camp and is certainly worth a view. As a treat for children of everything seventies It's Alive is a delight. As a horror film however it's an atramentous disappointment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John P. Ryan goes above and beyond acting capabilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Alive is one of those horror movies that deals with controversial subject matter. The director, Larry (Q:The Winged Serpent) Cohen, confronts the issues of new born babies and the polluted world we are living in. As the movie starts off, we see that John P. (Deathwish IV: The Crackdown) Ryan is lying in bed alongside his wife. Moments later, John P.'s wife goes into labor and they race her off to the hospital. Moving on, we see John P. attempts to enter the delivery room. This is brought on by the sound of a scream that he hears. As John P. strolls down the hallway, he soon observes several bloody nurses lying on the floor. Then, John P. enters the actual delivery room and he discovers only his wife to be alive and she is unsure on where her baby is. To recapture, the entire nurse staff is murdered by this monstrosity of a child and thereafter the child is at large. The movie then goes into what the family has to deal with after facing this disappointment and the baby goes on a blood thirsty rampage. Special effects are up to speed, courtesy of Rick (Ghostbusters) Baker. Not to mention, the brilliance of writer/director/producer Larry Cohen. At this time I have yet to see the other two installments of this series. However, based upon my liking to the original, I am going to explore the other films. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Extremely unbelievable even from the box cover. But never-the-less if you are the kind of person who surfs the cheap horror movie isles on a regular basis, you will end up renting this movie sooner or later, guaranteed. "It's Alive!" plays like a college students amateur video, but a good one. It has became a cult-classic over the years. One that spawned 2 sequels. "It's Alive!" is one of those rare cheap horror movies that isn't as stupid as it sounds, and somehow successfully gears itself toward an adult audience. But too often shoots for character emotions when all is desired is pure terror. It does generate a few good eerie memorable scenes, such as the beginning hospital scene and the red lite tunnel scene at the end. Both of which still could have been better. The worse involve an over-dressed-for-the-scene girl in go-go boots getting attacked, and a dreadful milkman scene that veers too close toward stupidity. The biggest praise of the film is not letting the killer-baby be seen up-close often. This of coarse makes the latex doll seem more realistic and scary. It is played off well, even if they never took advantage of a "could have been" absolute gross-out scene near the end that would have sent us jumping out of our seats. This movie is one of those AM-Popcorn-Party movies where you sit crowded around the TV in the dark and make it scarier than it really is. But it is hard to forget that babies horrid ululated screech... even if you try!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Larry Cohen made this excellent movie on the "birth" of splatter movies as we know them today. Later he made cult status on movies like "Q", "The Stuff" and "The Ambulance". This one is quite bloodless if you dont count the murder of milkman. Basic summary of movie is from "nature on the loose" idea like in George A. Romero's "The Crazies".Davis family has new born baby that is size of two babies. He kills everything that is on the sight. Frank and Lenore Davis must balance their lives in this situation. End is quite effective and it is quite shocking. It is interesting that movie had strong message about society and how we deal with abnormal people.Direction was almost perfect. Mr. Cohen had tried movies before, but not anything like this. Acting was great. John Ryan made great work as Frank Davis. He was realistic character and almost made me cry on his situation. He continued in the sequel. Sharon Farrel was equally effective as his wife and the mother of the child. Supporting roles had Andrew Duggan as the doctor and a Cohen regular James Dixon as Lt. Perkins who is hunting the baby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranoia regarding the effects of drugs on an unborn child is touched upon in this horror flick with the conceit that a baby is born in mutated form and kills practically anything in its path! Ryan and Farrell play the parents of an 11 year-old boy who have another one on the way, a baby they weren't 100% sure they should proceed with. Following a particularly difficult delivery, the infant slaughters most of the attending staff and slinks off into the night to find more victims. Ryan struggles with the idea that he could sire such a thing while warding off insensitive journalists and other hostile people while Farrell begins to lose her grip, retreating to her bed in a drug-fueled haze. While police scour the city looking for the bloodthirsty tyke, Ryan decides he needs to be the one to kill it himself, especially after a close encounter with the little beast spells death for one of his relatives. Combining elements of classic 50s sci-fi and 70s splatter, this is a cheap, often schlocky movie, but one with cult appeal and with an interesting cast. Ryan is a severe-looking presence and comes off as very stoic much of the time, but does reveal a tender side every now and then. This was a rare chance for him to assume a leading role. Farrell (who, ironically, had endured a horrific episode in the delivery room in real life prior to this ? involving a stopped heart and considerable amnesia!) is generally effective, though her role is never quite as significant as Ryan's. Perhaps she comes off as a little over-the-top at times due to the frequent underplaying of her costar. Several notable actors pop up, rather briefly, in supporting roles. Stockwell has one good-sized scene as Ryan's faux sympathetic employer, Duggan has a scene as a research physicist who would like to study the "baby" and (startlingly bald) Ansara has a blink-and-miss-it cameo as a police detective. Wellman plays Ryan's brother, one of the most normal and relatable people in the film. Filmed rather darkly, sometimes with rickety hand-held camera-work that may as well have been done by Katharine Hepburn, the stark cheapness of the project actually makes the events a little scarier and more accessible than they might have been otherwise. The decidedly low-rent visuals (and editing via Ginsu knife apparently!) are given a lift by legendary composer Bernard Herrmann's score, though many people questioned why he was associated with such a movie. He and the director struck up a friendship and it led to their working together. Future effects whiz Kenny Baker did the "creature work" here with mixed results. There are instances in which the baby is laughable (none more so, though, than in a scene at the end when what is supposed to be the monster baby wrapped in a coat is briefly revealed to be a white, furry dog! The director left this in deliberately for the purposes of his own amusement.) and moments when suspense is considerable. Almost as scary as the storyline is the cornucopia of eye-assaulting, intensely ugly 70s dcor that marks the residence of Ryan and Farrell. There are some doozies in the way of furniture, wallpaper and so on. Note also how much smoking goes on and where! Times have changed. Film fans will likely enjoy some of the quirky aspects that the creator has inserted (such as Ryan doing a Walter Brennan impersonation to his son for no apparent reason.) Not necessarily a good movie, it is, one way or another, an entertaining one and has a loyal following. It was followed by two sequels and a 2008 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite my love of horror movies and despite my liking for Larry Cohen, I have never felt inclined to watch this, imagining it to be some rip-off of Rosemary's Baby. How wrong could I be? This is really, really scary. OK it may be a little rough around the edges, but I don't mind that, and this is low budget 70's film making, so that's almost par for the course. Sharon Farrell is so good as the concerned mother seemingly going crazy, she makes us even more scared, then John Ryan as the husband/father also goes the same way and we have an almost unique situation where both the leads seem to be making matters worse. We do not get to see much of 'It', which of course helps as we imagine the worst, which is not hard to do given the results of 'It's' ferocity. Really good exploitation movie but very disturbing. Now for the two follow ups AND a full blown remake coming soon?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just try to look beyond the silly premise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this DVD because I remembered this movie scaring the wits out of me when I saw it first in the theater, which must have been back in 1974 or 75. So I intended it to be some funny trip down memory lane and I expected a good laugh. Partly I was right, but partly I was very much surprised (and pleasantly so). It's a pity this movie didn't serve a better cause, for let's face it: the premise (mutant killer newborn infant on the loose) is utterly preposterous and the actual creature (though wisely kept in the shades for most of the movie) turns out to look accordingly silly. But taken those flaws into account, this is really an excellent movie, a fact that I probably didn't notice at all 30 years ago but now can appreciate all the more. To begin with: the direction is really good: very subtle and very effective. At the start of the movie Cohen takes time to picture the scenes and the characters, but succeeds at the same time in creating a mounting feeling of lurking doom. He keeps up this almost reserved approach throughout the whole picture: the actual horror-scenes are remarkable few and never very graphic, neither sprung onto the audience as out-of-the-blue shock-effects. Instead they are built up slowly, so in a Hitchcockian way you can feel it coming and the suspense is in the prolonged wait for it to happen. Look at the chilling scene with the milkman which is absolutely top-notch! There's a remarkable attention for the psychological development of the characters, especially the father, and the acting of both John Ryan and Sharon Farrell is wonderful. Then there's the musical score. It beats my imagination how Bernard Herman (the great composer for Citizan Kane and North by Northwest)could be persuaded into teaming up for what must have looked at the time as a third rate low-budget horror flick, but apparently he gave it his full support and the score takes you right by the throat from the very first seconds of the opening-credits and on many occasions the music seems to fulfill a sinister part of its own, for instance in the scene where the father checks out the baby-room with the cradle, the music responding to the exact moment that he turns on the light. Regrettably the climax of the movie reveals too much of the creature (an early and to my taste rather immature product of the later much renowned Rick Baker) which negatively effects the impression that lasts. And also there are some flaws in the script. Why does the creature kills all these people? Apparently not to feed itself, since the victims only show a bleeding laceration in the throat. And how come the teenage son who apparently all the time continues going to school, can be kept totally unaware of all the horror that is happening to his parents when they're the top news in the media and the whole country seems to know of it. But hey, who's complaining, apart from the silly premise this really is a great movie that deserves it's cult-status. So I rate it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Ryan and Sharon Farrel) are expecting a baby but soon as they arrive at the hospital, sometime goes wrong in the delivery room as the wife gives birth to a fanged red-eyed clawed mutant infant that murders anyone that get in it's way. It could have been a dose of radioactive exposure or some deadly drug the mother of the creature must have taken during her pregnancy, the police are urged to find and kill this little creature from killing more people as the father is determined to destroy it.One of the most influential and interesting horror flicks of the 70's that spawned some rip-offs and a couple of sequels with a remake on the way! this is Larry Cohen's second best movie with "Q" being his best and "The Stuff" being third and "God Told Me To" being fourth, the gory horror thriller is a shocking possibility on how radiation or a deadly drug can affect a developing fetus. Rick Baker's make-up and puppet effects are good for it's day for creating a realistic looking monstrous baby and the acting is good as well.Recommended if your into old school horror flicks or something different.Also recommended: "Basket Case", "The Toxic Avenger", "Q: The Winged Serpent", "C.H.U.D.", "It Lives Again", "It's Alive III: Island of The Alive", "The Unborn", "Bloody Birthday", "Scanners", "The Brood", "Class of Nuke'Em High", "God Told Me To", "Brain Damage", " Re-Animator", "Bride of Re-Animator", "Beyond Re-Animator", "Halloween", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Street Trash", "The Fly ( 1986)", "An American Werewolf in London", and "Possession".</fullReview>

I pleaded for a Solomonic choice to be made, a threat to split the baby in 1/2 and then see if the meddling parents object to giving It up. I begged for the merciful end of the chase, but the cops were about as useful as baby toys - wound up, moving about aimlessly, and eventually chewed to pieces.Nevertheless, I find this movie (like the baby) hard to hate. The editing of the first 20 minutes that seemed to squander the tension of the hospital scene can be forgiven. As can the explanation of major plot holes by character dialog, rather than by filming action. On a shoestring budget, Cohen can be forgiven for a lot. But one thing gnaws at me with great gnashing teeth, and that's the Davis' parenting of their school-age son. For the love of Pete (or Chris, in this case), what the hell are you doing ignoring the boy during family crisis?! Mr. Davis goes to Chris' school when psycho-baby is on the rampage, but wouldn't consider accompanying Chris to go fishing?or even talk to him on the phone?! The Davis' are wack - not kitsch, not cheezy, not clich - they're wack. What's the big diff with a baby out-of-whack, when the parents are just one of many even SCARIER examples of humanity gone wrong!Baby Stewie would have something clever to say right now...or maybe he'd just sport fangs and claws from an It baby costume and embark on a bloody campaign of world domination. If he makes people afraid enough, he might even get elected President. After all, the American people seem to go for petulance and visions of conquest in their leaders...Phooey!</fullReview>

I've never seen any other of Larry Cohen's movies, but if "It's Alive!" is any indication, then he must turn out some neat movies.One more thing: I have to admit that the only cast member whom I recognized was Michael Ansara, who played a cop.

And this ugly thing goes on a murdering spree--not only in the delivery room but throughout the town. At no point, oddly, does anyone ask what the $^## Mrs. Davies had been sleeping with, as the child looks like a demonic batboy-- though the film only gives you glimpses of the killing machine through the course of the picture.While the plot is pretty simple and the film could have just been a stupid horror movie, it's a good bit better for a variety of reasons. Larry Cohen did a good job directing and keeping the tension throughout the film. I also thought that the way folks reacted towards the Davies family after the thing was born made the picture interesting--as well as Mr. and Mrs. Davies' reactions. Not a bad little horror film--and certainly better than the title might suggest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pro-Abortion Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In movies that have a pro-life message, like "Knocked Up" (2007) or "Juno" (2007), a woman gets pregnant and the possibility of abortion is contemplated but ultimately decided against. Then the woman has the baby, and everything turns out for the best. In movies that have a pro- choice message, like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" (1982) or "Obvious Child" (2014), a women gets pregnant, has an abortion, and everything turns out for the best. "It's Alive," however, does not merely have a pro-choice message. It has a pro-abortion message, which is to say the movie is anti-baby. A woman gets pregnant and the possibility of abortion is contemplated but ultimately decided against. Then the woman has the baby, and it is a monster.No sooner does the horrible creature exit the birth canal than it kills every doctor and nurse in the delivery room. It escapes from the hospital and starts killing everyone it meets. At one crime scene, a detective mentions that his wife is upset because she is eight months pregnant, and his being on the case bothers her, especially since she lost their first baby. To this the other detective, who is obviously lacking in tact, says that people who don't have children don't know how lucky they are.Lenore, the woman who has the baby-monster, was taking birth control pills for thirty-one months before she got pregnant, and the suggestion is made that the pills were what caused the baby to develop into a monster. This might seem to be a disconnect. How can the movie be both pro-abortion and anti-birth control at the same time?The answer is that it is not birth control that is evil, but rather it is the pharmaceutical company that manufactured the pill. The company representative is worried about a possible lawsuit, and he convinces Lenore's doctor that he too may be in jeopardy, and therefore it would be better if the baby-monster is killed so that it cannot be studied for medical purposes, which might reveal the company's and the doctor's culpability.Frank, Lenore's husband, comments that when he saw the movie "Frankenstein," he thought the monster's name was Frankenstein, but when he read the book, he realized that was the doctor's name. In other words, it was not the monster of that book who was the cause of all the evil, but the doctor. And that is the case with this movie: the baby may be the monster, but the doctor who created the monster is the villain.The baby-monster instinctively tries to make its way back to its parents. Lenore, and eventually Frank too, come to love the baby-monster, and they want to keep it and raise it. People that are pro-life often argue that pregnant women that decide not to have an abortion and have the baby instead will come to love it, as if love were the ultimate justification. But, as this movie points out, love is not an unqualified good. In fact, sometimes love is just wrong. In such cases, love is something we are better off without. So, the fact that a woman will love the baby if she has it does not mean she would not be better off having an abortion.Anyway, Frank tries to escape with the baby-monster to keep the police from killing it, and then, when surrounded, tries to talk them into letting it live. But when that fails, he throws the baby at the evil doctor. When the police let loose with a fusillade of bullets directed at the baby-monster, they end up killing the doctor too.In the last scene, the police detective gets word that another woman has had a baby-monster. See what happens when you don't get that abortion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Open Parentheses of a Baby's Arms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This piece of schlock appeared in 1974, six years after the phenomenal success of "Rosemary's Baby." "It's Alive" was profitable enough, I suppose, to generate a couple of sequels and a recent remake, all of which is just further evidence that democracy will never work.John P. Ryan is an executive at a public relations firm. His wife gives birth to some sort of mutant -- it looks like a baby but is huge -- that leaps out of the birth canal and slaughters everyone in the room except its mother, Sharon Farrell. Then it escapes from the hospital and is on the loose. After that, the movie turns into another slasher flick with gallons of blood, the screams and shivering feet of the victims, and brief inserts of this ugly infant's mouth with canines longer than Dracula's. There's a moral lesson here. Never trust babies. They know a lot more than they're letting on. As for their grotesque appearance -- those enormous heads and tiny pudgy fingers -- it's not "natural" at all but rather a disease, "childhoodosis", that they eventually remit and grow out of. There are intrigues as the search for the mutant goes on. A cute incident has a representative of the pharmaceutical company that supplied the mother's medication. The professors may want to capture the thing more or less intact for further study, but this huckster whispers to the attending physician that it would be better if the thing were completely destroyed. I mean, we don't want autopsies that might find our medication was responsible. And, by the way, we have an opening on our Board of Directors.The film is too terrible to be worth much scrutiny. There is a shock every five minutes. We get the usual monster's point of view. You can tell it's the monster's point of view because the screen gets a little blurry, as if this infant had periocular issues. But, then again, sometimes the screen goes fuzzy and creeps along the carpet towards someone's legs and it's not the baby at all. It's the victim's wife, who simply taps him on the shoulder from out-of-frame, while the sound track emits a percussive eructation. Bernard Herrmann did the score. He seems to have recycled much of "The Twilight Zone" first episode.That's the kind of cheap shot that covers the movie the way smallpox covers the skin. They're both ugly, but at least smallpox isn't insulting.I can't handle any more of this. Let me just say that one of the best performances is given by Guy Stockwell, Dean Stockwell's brother, as the boss who fires Ryan for bringing bad publicity to the firm. He invests the role with some originality, which no one else seems able to do.Ryan can't accept this freak of nature as his own creation, while his wife and his older son embrace it. The conflict is resolved at the end in such a way as to open the gates for all those sequels and remakes. The producers, anxious to squeeze another nickel out of this format, are now free to carry on with a franchise that should have been stillborn instead of alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The baby's alive even if the movie is half dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that this was a box office hit, it's not particularly good. Larry Cohen wrote, produced and directed this story of a mutant baby born to Sharon Farrell and John P.Ryan. It escapes in the delivery room, kills a bunch of people and then finds its way to its parents' home. We get limited glimpses at the baby (a blobby mass with fangs designed by the great Rick Baker) and a lot of POV shots from it's perspective, but little suspense and even fewer scares. Farrell is great as she descends into madness but Ryan has to be the most tightly wound father in film history. He's so hard-boiled and unappealing that you root for the baby to do him in. The now legendary score by Bernard Herrmann is just OK; overused and at times quite intrusive. It's as if Cohen did not want to waste a single piece of composer's music. The supporting cast includes the durable Andrew Duggan, Guy Stockwell, Michael Ansara and William Wellman's son William Wellman Jr. as "Charley."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superhuman killer baby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be said that superhuman killer babies tend to stretch a film's credibility just a wee tad, which means this film would have to be very, very good to overcome such a daft premise. Sadly, Larry Cohen isn't a good enough writer or director to deliver anything approaching a decent film.The film gets right into the plot with middle-class mum Sharon Farrell ferried to hospital by proud dad John P. Ryan where she delivers a ultra-violent sub-human baby who promptly kills all the delivery staff before scarpering through the hospital's ceiling. Mum and dad come to terms with the fact that they have given birth to a monster with surprising swiftness, while Cohen nods towards the use of chemical and medicines as a reason for their little mutation. The baby then embarks on a murderous rampage between crawling through overlong grass while presumably in search of a decent optician to correct its dodgy vision. Discovering only a milkman, the baby monster promptly shreds him to pieces in the back of his truck.The cheapness of this film gives it the look of a TV movie, and the comparatively tame levels of horror make it seem even older than it is ? it's difficult to believe this was made a year after The Exorcist. Cohen's direction is all over the place at times, and nobody seems to care about continuity, but the glimpses we are given of the little horror are suitably creepy. Cohen might even have imparted some symbolic significance to the way that Ryan, who had previously wanted to kill his mutant child, emerges from a storm tunnel with the frightened child swaddled in his arms, although given the relative amateurishness of the bulk of the screenplay it's probably just coincidence.</fullReview>

This is truly a baby only a parent could love, and they do.I remember Ryan back from Death Wish 4: The Crackdown, as some wacky drug dealer. he is a little more controlled in this film, and it is a fair watch.</fullReview>

The newborn killer goes on a terrifying rampage through L.A. Anyway, this movie should be on a remastered special edition DVD (I have the 1989 VHS and the quality sucks).

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest movies I never saw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie came out. It was terrifying! It gave me nightmares. One of the worst I ever had was where I was following those bizarre, stylized foot prints that were all the rage in the '70's to a bathtub and when I pulled back the shower curtain, baby claws jumped out at me!And at the time, I didn't even see the movie. I wasn't even allowed to watch commercials for horror movies so there was no way my mom would take my nine-year-old butt to this show.But I did see the TV commercial for this movie, and that alone was enough. It started out with Brahms' Lullaby, as played on a music box and a baby carriage on a Lazy Susan rotating from back to side. A voice said "the Davis' just had a baby, but they're not sending out birth notices because...It's Alive!" And by that time, the baby carriage was spun all the way around to reveal the baby claw.I finally did get to see the movie in the mid-eighties and its not as good as what took place in my head. But until my head comes out on VHS or preferably, DVD, this will have to do, I guess, if you want to see monster baby movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was about 8 at the drive in. My mother thought it was ok because there wasn't much blood in it and I loved scary movies. That was a big mistake for her! The movie of course scared the cowboy crap out of me, my brother and sister. A lot of nights we had to get into bed with mommy because we thought that "It's Alive baby" was under the bed. I remember times when the cat would jump onto my bed and I would be so sure it was that damned baby. I was scared that something so small could do so much damage.The special effects were ok. They did the job. In fact, there was little blood except when the milkman got it. I found myself laughing at the milkman scene more than I cringed. I loved how the director gave you a baby's eye view of the world at times. As the youngun' would hop from place to place, you would get his warped view of the world. This was done better than most movies before and after it came out back in 1974. The movie did have some social commentary about fertility drugs and infant feeding techniques. :)If you see this movie as a kid under 13, it will probably scare the crap out of you. If you see this movie as an older "kid" you will probably laugh your ass off, especially at the milkman scene. There were two sequels to this movie, "It Lives Again" and "It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive". "It Lives Again" is ok but skip the third installment it is stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If horror films were judged purely on concept, Larry Cohen would be considered a genius. Unfortunately, he never had the funds to properly realize his innovative ideas, or today we might be speaking of It's Alive in the same breath as The Exorcist or Jaws. That Cohen managed to make a good film at all, let alone a classic with little more than spare change is a tribute to the man's talent. Remember the expression, "Children are such little monsters"? Well, It's Alive takes things to the literal extreme. Sure it looks like a bad TV movie from the seventies. Never mind that the special effects are cheese of the highest rank. This sometimes very creepy, sometimes very funny monster movie may be considered schlock by some, but ignore the naysayers and see for yourself why originality and imagination will carry a film so much farther than the size of its budget.

		<shortDescription>Not the best Horror movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But, it's not the worst.This film is about a husband and wife who give birth to their second child. Unfortunately for them, the baby is a mutant, and they must do all they can to kill it.Simple enough, but there were enough elements in it that kept me interested. For example, throughout most of the film, the baby is kept mostly in the shadows, which I think is a very effective portrait of the baby. It works, and it makes the baby even more creepy when we do see it in full light.Unfortunately, there were some flaws, but the main one that I had was that the acting could have been much better. That being said, it is still better than most acting in horror movies today, where the hot females chicks only say stuff like "Oh my God! Ahhhhhhhhh!" So, it could have been better, but it could have been worse as well.All in all, a decent enough horror film. However, do not go in expecting something like A Nightmare on Elm Street or Jaws, because this is in no way as good as those two, or any other movies along that line. Just go in expecting to be thrilled, and leave your brain at the door. 7/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another reminder of how weird the 1970s really were</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a horror movie, It's Alive is fairly terrible. As a look at environmental and reproductive attitudes in the 1970s, it's somewhat interesting. As an expression of the concept of social norms, it's bewildering.Frank and Lenore Davis (John Ryan and Sharon Farrel) are having a second child. One night, Lenore says "it's time" and they head to the hospital, though they're both so calm and unhurried you'd think they were going for brunch somewhere. Lenore has her baby, who turns out to be a three-fingered killer mutant who slides out of the birth canal and slaughters all the doctors and nurses before escaping from the delivery room. Now, you'd think this would be kind of a big deal, but everyone in this movie acts as though killer mutant babies are an expected though unfortunate occurrence. Watching this film I imagined a conversation like this?"Hey, Frank! You hear about that mutant baby that killed 5 people last week?""Really? That's more than the giant lizard ate last month.""Yeah, but it's not as many people as that gelatinous blob from Mars disintegrated last October."As the cops search for the monster infant, Frank and Lenore return home. Oddly, their biggest concern isn't something being wrong with them or with their other child, Chris (Daniel Holzman). No, they're mostly vexed by the social stigma and personal shame of being the parents of a killer mutant baby. At one point, it's compared to being the parent of a retarded child. Yes, apparently in the 1970s you could compare mentally challenged kids to murderous creatures and no one made a big deal about it.Somehow, the killer mutant baby makes its way back to its parents, where Lenore wants to protect it and Frank feels responsible for destroying it himself as a way to prove to everyone that he and his family are normal. Frank and the cops pursue the monster infant into the storm sewers of Los Angeles, where we find out the sewer tunnels are big enough to drive police cars through. That leads to a conclusion where I think we're supposed to learn something about parental love in the face of societal pressure, but what we really learn is that people are irrational when it comes to their own children.There's very little actual violence in It's Alive. Almost all of it happens off screen or behind a bush or something, where you hear a scream and then see blood or a body. It's probably for the best because this is a really cheap movie and the mutant baby looks like a pretty crappy special effect, even by 1970s standards. The movie is mostly just watching Frank looking stunned and Lenore becoming more and more unbalanced.I remember this film from when I was a kid. I don't know if it was much a hit, but I do recall it made something of an impression. It's Alive is an example of a bad movie that comes out at just the right moment to connect with cultural unease and anxiety. In the wake of Roe v. Wade and the Thalidomide cases of the 50s and 60s, this story did freak people a little bit. It has no cultural resonance today so, unless you enjoy looking at ugly 70s fashions (like wearing a plaid jacket with high-waisted Sansabelt slacks), there's not much to recommend about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made to be dumb, definitely is dumb, and yet somehow a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm all for crazy Horror movies, and I've seen some wild ones. So I was actually kind of looking forward to It's Alive but it was just too dumb for me. The thing is I think they had every intention of it being dumb, campy, crazy, stupid so really any review they get would be exactly what they want out of it. Apparently It's Alive and creator Larry Cohen have become famous in their own right for this film and in fact are working on a remake which sadly I will be right there to see. There is really no plot and they don't even try to put sense to all the things that don't make sense. I mean when you're doing something like this you can potentially fill in the ridiculousness with some sort of an attempt at an explanation but instead they have a practical fetus shooting off Mrs. Davis and immediately slashing throats and leaving a pile of bodies everywhere and even though it's discussed about a possible explanation they don't really give one. Also everyones reaction to this mutant baby and all the bodies is very flippant really. They don't seem to care other than to constantly run from one side of the screen to the other chasing this baby.John P. Ryan as the reluctant and determined father of the mutant is actually terrific. The great thing about his performance is he really does give it his all. He's treating this role like it was Ben Hur to him and not just some crappy B Movie. He really puts it all out there and gives a serious emotional and fun performance. He is a great hero for the story in a strange way. Sharon Farrell is also good and yet incredibly strange which fits the film. She has this break down which really adds to the suspense of the film so she does great and has good chemistry with Ryan. Other than some very small supporting roles nothing else really stands out as worth mentioning in the cast other than big kudos to the creator of the little beast that is the killer baby because it did look awesome considering low budget horror camp.Cleverly I will say that Larry Cohen is very careful about not over utilizing the visuals on the creepy baby making him more of a horror fiend. Cohen has a LONNNNG history of writing and directing B movies so really this should be easy to him and I suppose for those that respect it for what it is then he hit his mark. I just found it way too silly and boring and even predictable as much as a film about a killer newborn could be. Certainly you don't want any pregnant women watching this and I suppose in some ways there are some 'classic' moments including the milk man murder and Mr. Davis finally scooping up his deformed son. Maybe I'm being too hard on it but I would never watch it again on purpose even though I am going to force myself through the two sequels and see how that goes. Overall I just thought it was way too stupid. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weird cult classic that is not to be missed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lenore Davis awakens her husband Frank early one night from sleep, telling him that she feels like she is ready to give birth. While waiting in the waiting room, Frank sees a badly wounded doctor escape &amp; then collapse in the hall. Entering the delivery room, Frank finds the doctors horribly murdered &amp; his child gone. Frank soon comes to learn that his child is responsible for the murders of not only the doctors, but also several others it happens to come across in the city streets, able to make its way through the city unseen via the sewer systems. When he loses his PR job &amp; is forever hounded by the media over the incident, Frank comes to the realization that he may be the only one who has what takes to stop this monstrous predator, but can he kill his own child?IT'S ALIVE has to be without a shadow of a doubt one of filmmaker LARRY COHEN'S best movies! Like most of Cohen's horror films, the film is a straight up witty exercise in down right weirdness, thrills &amp; chills. Cohen is one of the very few film-makers who can take a silly concept, be it a killer infant, or yogurt, a disgruntled dead cop come back to kill the innocent, alien messiah's &amp; Aztec creatures &amp; actually make a fairly entertaining &amp; at times terrifying, witty films. The acting is fairly strong, with each actor giving their all in their well written roles. RICK BAKER'S monster baby is a well done piece of work, an ugly &amp; yet sympathetic creature that Cohen wisely keeps off screen for much of the movie, only showing the creature in quick blink &amp; you'll miss them glances, yet the film is powerful enough to make you think you've seen plenty of the monster infant when you really haven't. For a film that keeps it's monster off screen for the vast majority of the film, that would be tantamount to suicide in a horror film &amp; no doubt in the wrong directors hands that would have been IT'S ALIVE'S eventually fate, but it's not so here. The film is hardly gory, with most of the kills &amp; baby attack sequences taking place off screen. Cohen also adds a mad dash of pitch black humour throughout the movie, with the stand out shot being the monster baby who kills the milkman. Cohen also offers some rather intriguing explanations for why this maybe happening &amp; what caused this monstrosity to take form by pointing out abortion pills, radiation exposures &amp; many other things. In the end none of these questions is ever really answered, by the time the film is over, what caused the creation is kept in the dark. The direction by LARRY COHEN is really good, as he delivers a series of distorted POV shots from the monster infant, as it mills around. If it was just a monster infant run amok movie, that would be one thing, but Cohen actually takes his time to make IT'S ALIVE be more than just a standard monster run amok flick, as he also adds a rather intriguing aspect to the monster, in the simple sense that the creature actually shows some intelligence behind it's blood lust, as it plays with toys, must find it's food &amp; milk on it's own in order to survive &amp; shares an almost psychic link with the Davis family, as it eventually returns to the family home where it's parents lives &amp; at one point sleeps in the room that was made for it. The late JOHN P. RYAN is remarkable in his role as the monster babies father, who at the beginning is set out to stop &amp; kill it, disowning it as his own, only to be moved with compassion at the climax when he sees his own child hiding in fear in the storm drains &amp; then sets out to save it, it's a very emotional scene to watch. The scene where his character mentions how when he was young he thought the name Frankenstein was the name of the monster when it was really the name of the doctor who made him &amp; how just like doctor Frankenstein, the public will no doubt forever get him confused with his monster infant, is a rather intriguing moment. BERNARD HERRMANN'S score is so good &amp; easily one of his best (This would be the last film he would compose music for before passing away shortly thereafter).In the end, IT'S ALIVE is a sadly long forgotten &amp; completely underrated cult classic that deserves more recognition than what it has received over the years, if you're a fan of Cohen's films (&amp; I am) &amp; have seen &amp; loved some of his other films, than you must seek this one out, you won't be disappointed. Beware the truly terrible 2008 remake! the ending leaves a set up for a sequel which came in the form of two sequels, starting with IT LIVES AGAIN.**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I assure you Mrs. Davies, your baby is very much alive."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ Larry Cohen took perhaps the most memorable phrase in horror history and made a minor classic of the genre. Who can forget the moment when Dr. Frankenstein announces the birth of his creation: "It's alive...it's aliiiiiiive!!!" he screams. Well, something else is alive. In Larry Cohen's It's Alive, normal parents give birth to a very destructive and possibly misunderstood baby. Cohen uses the film to touch on many human topics and fears: parenthood, pregnancy, and birth defects being the big three. This movie really is an exaggeration on a very real family topic. Should you love your child any less because he is born different? That's the big theme here. John Ryan plays the father of the monster and is the main character of the story. He really shines in this role and his character arc is something missing from today's horror films. As Frank Davies, he goes from persecuting his own son to, ultimately, loving him. But the tyke does some serious damage before the film's tragic finale. Just look at the scene featuring the milkman's demise. It's one of the standouts of the film, along with the Bernard Herrman score. A clear reason for the child's mutation is never given which helps the movie tremendously. Many reasons are alluded too, but nothing concrete is ever produced. Also helping out are the subjective camera angles used for the baby's POV. Oscar winner Rick Baker handled the creature duties on this film but, thankfully, much of the time the baby is hidden. The sequels failed to capitalize on this device and overuse the creatures which proves to be a great downfall. It's Alive is, without a doubt in my mind, Cohen's best genre effort. I can suggest avoiding the sequels though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cohen's social conscience meets '50s-style cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Alive!" shows veteran low-budget filmmaker Larry Cohen at his most creative and perceptive: under the sheen of what is, at heart, a throwback to 1950s-style 'big bug' pictures (complete with a monster who travels via underground sewer tunnels, just like the ants in "Them!") is a movie with a little more on its mind than the requisite suspense and shocks of the horror genre. Ironically using Colin Clive's famous declaration in "Frankenstein" for the title, Cohen spins the tale of a mother who gives birth to a bloodthirsty mutant and the father who wants it destroyed. By the time the somewhat frustrating climax comes around (what the hell was THAT?), Cohen has delivered ample scares and provided a biting comment on man's selfishness and how the conditions we create (in the form of pesticides, birth control, and a polluted environment) can bite back if so provoked. He also gives an effective portrait of familial conflict and the justification behind the destruction of life (though, with a modest body count, "It's Alive!" could hardly be classified as a pro-life diatribe).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not the kind of person to post online about anything...but this movie moved me in so many ways (normally to the bathroom to be sick but also often to the floor in bouts of tears and laughter!), that I had to share my feelings. This was the single most dire production I have seen in my life (and I have seen Battlefield Earth mind you), the claim that it is 'cult' or 'kitchy' is just a feeble attempt to justify someone's poor taste in movies. The best thing about this movie was that it made me feel so much better about myself, I realized that even the worst, least talented and unimaginative hacks can find funding for anything in Hollywood - maybe my sitcom about the sassy robot isn't so doomed after all....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people (that I personally know) that have seen this film don't like it much. It isn't that bad. Some people comment on the production quality; it isn't that bad either. The story concerns the fictional trials of Santa Monica's Davis Family as they quickly realize that their newborn son--a mutated monstrosity--has quickly dispatched the maternity attendants, and managed to escape to the outside world and cause more deaths. The 'Fathers-to-be' lounge scene is interesting. The scene somewhat indirectly tells us that, apart from fertility drugs, pesticides and other household products are responsible for many 'newborn atrocities' being introduced to our environment... on a daily basis. Who's to say the Davis Baby is not a genetic possibility? I'll see you in the waiting room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baby on a killing spree..!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Larry Cohen, responsible for B-movie classics like "Q" (1982), "Special Effects" (1984), "Maniac Cop" (1988, producer), "The Wicked Stepmother" (1989) or "The Ambulance" (1990) has created another low budget-masterpiece with filming this little but mean shocker! A monstrous baby draws his bloody trail through Los Angeles... For what?!? Just to kill people I suppose... Similar to Spielbergs "Jaws" (1975) you see the creature only very seldom, mostly his appearances are filmed as perspectives out of the eyes of that little monster. Main actor John P. Ryan is great in the role of the torn father. However his motives and actions are quite hard to understand: once he tries to shoot the baby, then he saves his child from the police... But who really cares, its a typical Larry Cohen-film, so dont ask for a greater sense or any demands..! Nevertheless very recommended to people who liked Frank Henenlotters "Basket Case" (1982) or stuff like that!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Larry Cohen's films always seem like they are made over a weekend or something. I'm sure he works very hard on the screenplay, but his films are low budget and sometimes unintentionally funny. I like that he takes simple concepts and turns them into feature length films. If you like good 70's exploitation, you'll enjoy It's Alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snoozy social commentary disguised as a horror film.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you went by posters and TV ads, "It's Alive" would appear to be one of two things: Either a 50's-style monster romp or a chilling slab of dread served up in the usual gritty 70's vein. It's not either; in fact, it's not much of anything.As promised (one of the few kept by advertising), there is indeed a murderous mutant tike on the loose and he's a nasty lookin' little critter. Well, I think he is at least, because he rarely shows up during the movie. Ultra-brief glimpses every 20 or so minutes and a shamefully low body count keep the "horror" at an absolute minimum.OK, so if it's not really a scary film, just what exactly is it? Unfortunately, it's proves to be little more than a snail-paced melodrama that tries to deal with a ridiculous overload of "socially relevant" topics such as parenting and its natural bonds, the effects of pollution and drugs, corporate deceit/government cover-ups, loss of family values and the desensitized nature of modern society to name a few. As you might have surmised, this turns the film into total mess by merely broaching these issues in a rapid-fire, circular succession but never delving in properly or offering any explanations. Matters are certainly not helped by a dull backing cast and having the two main characters (the parents of said monster) coming across with jittery, bug-eyed hokeyness (dad) and incessant whiny babbling (mom).I am usually against the idea of remakes, but in the case of this movie, it makes perfect sense. Give the killer toddler some serious screen time and ample victims while wholly dumping all the supposed "deeper" aspects and there might be some enjoyment to be had, unlike what is presented in the very skippable original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got this one on DVD in Oslo. We gave about 25$ for it... And let me just say that it was NOT worth even 5$ in my book. It was so awful,worst movie ever made. And on the DVD we could see trailers of It's Alive 2 and 3 and they looked even worse... Hehe, I can't even take this movie seriously. Man I hope I never have to see this one again... Man it was bad. How can someone rate this any higher than 1? Is it possible? I really don't get it... One thing is for sure I will not see the two others ever. I wouldn't even see them if someone payed me to see them. Don't think about seeing this awful movie... Now I don't really have anything more to say about this crap of an awful movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was too young to see this when it came out but vividly remember the ads and was very intrigued at the time. I'm so glad it was R-Rated and had to wait to see it. It's one of the worst horror movies ever! The acting was truly awful. The story is pathetic in every way, from the characters, to the plot development and especially the thrill factor. There's zero suspense, very little gore and even the attack scenes didn't raise my pulse one beat. It also completely lacked the proper amount of "cheese" for a good 'B' Film. Don't waste the 91 minutes of your life on this piece of junk. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities about this movie whatsoever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as bad as i expected but still mediocre at best WARNING!!!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as bad as i expected but still mediocre at best it has a decent script but it can get quite uneven at times with both it's pacing and it's script the first 20 minutes are excellent tension filled with lots of blood but the middle seems like a detective story now don't get me wrong i am all for detective story's but it simply didn't work here but the last 20 minutes are great but the ending is a disappointment. and it seemed to abrupt and the baby looks like a rubber puppet bad effects there. now it helps with the strong lead in Jon P Ryan but it isn't quite enough to save it from being mediocre at best. the acting is for the most part good John P Ryan gives an excellent performance here he is TENSE and on the money here and does a great job. Sharon Farrel on the other hand i thought she over acted and i didn't like her all that much because of it. James Dixon is good as the Liutenant but isn't on screen enough. Daniel Holzman does surprisingly okay here but isn't on screen enough and thankfully isn't annoying at all. William Wellman Jr. does good here with his limited screen time and cares about Chris. overall worth a watch i suppose but it's nothing special what so ever ** out of 5 but TONS!!! better then that rotten sequel It Lives Again</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Alive (1974) *** (out of 4) Popular film has a family rushed to the hospital where the mom delivers their second child but this one turns out to be a deformed monster. The monster breaks from from the hospital and soon bodies start to pile up. Only the 70s could feature a film where a baby goes around killing. Nine times out of ten the film would have been a disaster but Larry Cohen is a talented man who works wonders with the story. Sure, it's pretty silly and how the baby becomes a monster is silly but these things just add some charm to the movie. There are a lot of underlined messages, which are handled quite well but for the most part I've always seen this as a cult item, which makes for great viewing at midnight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Larry Cohen's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since there is a re-make of this one in talks, I felt compelled to review it. This is definitely filmmaker Larry Cohen's ("The Stuff" and "Q: The Winged Serpent") best work. Yes it's cheesy but the subject matter is compelling. The "lessons" this film tries to teach are left to the interpretation of the viewer. Is it a film about the dangerous effects of modern technology on unborn infants? Is it a film about a new breed of the human race built to withstand a potential nuclear holocaust? Or is it just good old fashioned horror themed fun! I vote for the latter! The child in the film is not really the viscous monster it is portrayed to be as it seems that the child only kills when it feels threatened. The effects are good,especially the child, and the acting is very well done. The music is scary! Overall, Larry Cohen is quite effective with this one. The sequel It Lives Again is equally as effective but steer clear of It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive as it is less than stellar (Although Karen Black's appearance in the film is worth a one time viewing). All three films are directed by Cohen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cautionary Tale About Poisoning the Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Davis and his wife are about to have a baby. Then they have it, and the entire maternity ward is left drenched in blood with corpses strewn about. What's wrong with the baby? Find out as Frank Davis and the local Los Angeles Police Department track down the infant... To appreciate this film at all you have to prepare yourself in advance and say: "this is a b-movie" -- otherwise you will be thoroughly disappointed. Little gore, no nudity, a decent but not spectacular plot... and rated PG, which is usually a big mistake for a horror film. But if you go in remembering the creators aren't trying to make quality, but rather just throw some sensationalized idea at you, you might come out alright. Personally, I thought the film was decent. Mysteriously, Larry Cohen (Master of the B-Movie) was able to get not just one, but two Oscar-winning people on his crew. Bernard Herrmann, perhaps best known for his work on Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" and Rick Baker, a world-class makeup artist. (For the record, I don't believe Baker had won his Oscar at this point, and the makeup in this film is not the least impressive.)Bernard Herrmann's music is most noticeable during the scene with the milkman (the song being titled "The Milkman Goeth"). This, for me, was probably the best part of the film... something about the way the milkman handles the Davis baby (or barely handles him at all) makes for a classic scene.Now, as I said, with a b-movie the idea isn't to make a great film. In this case, it is to push the idea that chemicals are bad for babies. In an early scene, a group of men in the hospital talk about lead poisoning, bug spray and smog. While they have nothing to do with anything, this part is really the crux of the whole story: what are we ingesting and how will it affect our unborn child?I saw director Cohen in person and he denied that this film was influenced by thalidomide, but was more concerned with the generation gap between parents and children: how the children are so different from their parents, but yet they must be loved. I find this a very hard to swallow motivation, but it comes from the man himself...I think this movie is worth seeing, as long as you don't expect much. Someday I would love to remake this, because if done as a "real" horror movie, the deaths could be really disturbingly graphic. The milkman especially, again. And I would update it so instead of smog or lead, the father has returned from the Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm) and his exposure to depleted uranium has left him with mutated sperm. Iraqi babies are born with flipper arms and missing body parts... it could come here next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young couple gives birth to a deformed baby that kills the hospital staff and then escapes the hospital to continue the carnage out on the streets with the media and police in full tow. Amusing little cult item is perfectly acted and directed and takes full advantage of its gimmicky premise. Even poor special effects &amp; your usual 70's clichs can't hurt this one. This movie is pretty so-so. And the de-formed baby is easily scared. Some scenes are pretty good. But not to mention a good script and ending. Of course, put in this movie and enjoy the evening watching it.Rated PG for Violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>babies and children should not be in horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a pretty liberal person, and i grew up on this genre, but I find something very sick and wrong about a child or baby villains in horror movies. babies/children probably shouldn't be in them at all. I honestly think that this should fall under a child protection act of some sort. As a child I remember a couple of young adults saying in my presence after seeing Rosemary baby "babies are so creepy" and it made me, as a child at the time very frightened, adults easily forget how weak they felt when they were young. some idiots and young people are very influenced by these images, and their counterparts are the most helpless among us. I think the people who make and promote these types of films should be ashamed of themselves. I am glad the genre is not so popular anymore. The fact its popular at all really makes me disappointed in people.</fullReview>
