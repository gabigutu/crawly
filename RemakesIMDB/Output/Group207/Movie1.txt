		<shortDescription>Stupid Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pregnant college student Lenore Harker (Bijou Phillips) leaves the college before the end of the semester to move to the isolated house in Larkspur of her boyfriend, the architect Frank Davis (James Murray). When Lenore is ready to deliver the baby, they drive to the hospital. In the surgery room, the two doctors and the two nurses are found slaughtered and Lenore and the baby are found covered of blood. When Lenore is released, the family returns to Frank's house. Sooner Lenore discovers that her son is a mutant monster hunger for flesh and blood and she protects him hiding his murders. "It's Alive" is a stupid remake of the 1974 movie. The story is too imbecile and predictable without any surprise. There is no fun, no scare, only gore and this film does not deserve spending time writing a review. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Anjo Maldito" ("Damned Angel")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and lifeless update of Larry Cohen's "It's Alive".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this tedious and lifeless remake of Larry Cohen's 1974 campy horror classic pregnant Lenore delivers the baby.During the birth all the doctors and nurses in the operating room are viciously killed by the baby.It seems that her child is thirsty for human and animal blood.This "It's Alive" remake is downright silly and absurd.The film fails to generate even the smallest amount of tension.The killings are mediocre and the CGI effects are cheesy and unconvincing.However I enjoyed the performance of Bijou Philips,because her character has just enough depth to convey at least some of the conflicting emotions between a protective mother and someone frightened for their life.4 out of 10.Watch "Grace" or "Baby Blues" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Alive, but boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what bothered me throughout the film...it's location. We as the audience are supposed to believe this story takes place in New Mexico. Unfortunately, we're tipped off at the beginning of the film that it was shot in Bulgaria (where?)with a Bulgarian crew etc. This is when a film should save it's credits for the end of the movie. A few minutes into the flick, we are told via a caption, that the story takes place in New Mexico. Even if my eyes were shut tight during opening credits--I'd know in a heartbeat that the location isn't New Mexico. Instead, what we see is an Alamo style house on the edge of a Bulgarian forest with tall looming trees behind it. Are they kidding? I can understand saving money by shooting in Bulgaria(where?)but how could they expect us (in the USA) to believe that it was New Mexico? Why not say Oregon or some other geographically similar location? Instead, all we see are gray skies and obviously freezing cold outdoor shots with shivering actors. There are so many gaffes in this straight to DVD movie that it is incredibly distracting. We see shots of a pool at night with a pool cover on it, then, in the next shot, it's off. Steam rising out of this pool (cold in Bulgaria...where?) There were very few shots of the baby in it's monster guise and we as the audience, can't understand why no one can see what's up with this kid. The baby's father is never around and when he is, never seems to have a clue that this kid is a little monster.The entire New Mexico police force consisted of 2 cops, both of which made Inspector Clouseau look like Sherlock Holmes. They never ask for back up (they didn't have shoulder radios) even when being attacked by this 10 lb wunderkind. As a matter of fact these police were wearing generic uniforms with no insignia etc.The acting was OK up until the mommy (played by Bijou Philips)started to think she was actually in a film that may get some notice and began to ham it up to the point of it being embarrassing.I think that everyone associated with the remake of this camp classic should've watched the movie "Grace" if they wanted to see a terrifying movie about a demon child. That was a well done film--great dialog and acting, both subtle and scary to the point of making me squirm in my seat and giving me nightmares. Well, It's Alive gave me nightmares too. I dreamt that I wasted a $1.07 at Red Box.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh...this remake really stinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not hate many remakes because they stain the memory of "classic" (or semi-classic) movies.In fact, I am absolutely open to receive them with all the possible objectivity, and I think I could recognize their hits in the minority of cases something good came from them (like for example, The Thing and Dawn of the Dead).But what definitely upsets me from many remakes is the arrogance to think they can improve an old film with the mere thing of "modernize" it, when generally the value from the original film resides on the historical context it was made, portraying the sensibility and style from a time.A clear example is the cult film It's Alive, written and directed by the underrated Larry Cohen in 1974, which had a naughty style which found suspense and human drama in premises which border on the ridiculous.That also applies to other Cohen's films, such as The Stuff, Q and God Told Me To, which ended up being much more entertaining and interesting than I expected.What I mostly liked from It's Alive is that it endorsed its bizarre story with interesting ideas about paternity, scientific responsibility and the then emergent field of the induced fertility.Now, the atrocious remake of that film tries to "update" those ideas, but without a pinch of the ingenuity and talent Cohen showed in the original film.It's Alive does not fulfill at all with its purpose of creating horror, suspense or even interest.90% of this movie is set on a remote house, something which severely limits the wingspan from the story, and instead of the suburban horror from the original film, we have a simple "slasher" formula, with the disposable characters escaping from the murderer by the dark corridors and basements from the house.And even though the murderer is a baby, that circumstance is never used to try something more innovating or at least shocking.Another big problem is the pathetic performances.Nobody shows even the slightest energy or conviction.And as for direction, Josef Rusnak belongs to the school of filmmakers who simply film the scenes from the screenplay, and they then chronologically edit them...but who do not have a single idea on how to tell a story, or how to work with the actors.I do not have much more to say.It's Alive (2008) is an execrable "horror" movie, and one of those films which truly damage the genre.Instead of watching this atrocity, I recommend you to see the very entertaining original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten Lines? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand IMDb's ten line minimum for posted reviews, but there are times when ten lines are hard to fill. There are even those times when ten words are pretty tough. This terrible remake of Larry Cohen's minor-classic of 1974 is one such occasion. It is pure tripe and little more really needs to be said beyond a sincere admonition to avoid at all costs. But in the service of a minimum line count, I will add that it is typical Millennium fare - shot in Bulgaria with a multinational hodgepodge of cast and crew, working from an amateurish script for a director with no discernible talent. It never ceases to amaze me how so many people can have so little pride in what they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely Breathing Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultrasound won't detect any acting talent in this abysmal re-telling of a film that wasn't very good to begin with. Larry Cohen's original 1974 schlock-fest had gallons of artificial blood, a campy story and one very bad looking baby puppet. This modernized version offers Bulgaria as an unconvincing stand-in for New Mexico, gallons of artificial blood and cheesy looking CGI effects. And does it have to take itself so serious? Strictly for those who consider enduring eighty-three minutes of labor pains any fun. Larry Cohen's movie spawned two sequels (1978, 1987). Whatever is in the works for this afterbirth - let's hope for abortion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This actually could have been good !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Alive" is a remake of the 70's classic by Larry Cohen (which was executive producer on this one). It even spawned 2 more sequels, "It Lives Again" and "Island Of The Alive". I saw those movies once and curious what the remake would be like. Well it is bad, really bad. It starts of great with a massacre during the birth (although it is not actually shown) but the story goes rapidly downhill from than on. It also makes no sense at all, especially the actions of the mother after she discovers that there is something seriously evil about her baby. (the baby kills a pigeon and she acts like the whole thing didn't happen and is supposed to be normal ??) The killings are rather stupid, there is even a laughably CGI effect of the baby's little arm crushing to a victim's head. Very cheaply done. The baby is not really shown (very little budget on special effects). Maybe they tried it but it was so bad that they actually cut it out before theatrical release. I saw the so-called UNRATED version, no idea what had to be cut out for the theatrical version. Could not have been much...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a lot for a movie to make me actually angry. And I don't just mean in a "holy crap, that was awful" kind of way. I mean for it to make me sit there with a face full of scowl for the whole thing. Yet It's Alive has accomplished that. To be fair, I should have known what I was getting into. There are very few homicidal baby movies that have ever been executed to even an acceptable degree.There's really not much going on here. A girl takes a break from college to have a baby and weird stuff starts happening. Now this might be forgivable if...say...mommy and daddy had no clue what was going on. But mom knows damn well and seems totally cool with it. I understand most parents will forgive their children just about anything, but there's got to be a limit. So Bijou Phillips, who needs to pick a new, less ridiculous name, spend the whole movie ignoring the fact that her baby is evil incarnate and even enabling it from time to time. This (sort of) gets explained about 3/4 of the way through, but it's such an awful explanation and the movie so horrible that by that time you won't care.There is nothing redeemable here. The acting is capable but still somehow annoying. The kill scenes are fun in an over the too kind of way, but there's not nearly enough of them to justify the rest of this trash. Ummm...they didn't kill any puppies? Is that something you can applaud a movie for? Seriously, I have trouble thinking of a single good thing to say about this film. I'm not going to whine about it being the worst movie ever, but I absolutely hated it it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bijou Phillips is pregnant about six months but the infant inside is growing at an abnormal rate and must be taken out due to the pain inflicted on the mother. Shortly after its birth via C-section, the entire hospital staff is slaughtered by the baby, but Phillips cannot recollect (or has simply blocked the whole incident out) what happened much to the disappointment of the police who need answers. James Murray is the father, Raphaël Coleman his crippled brother(a car accident which killed their parents, he barely survived), Ty Glaser Phillips' school friend, Owen Teale the police officer(Sgt Perkins who suspects Phillips knows more than she is letting on), and Jack Ellis the psychiatrist( attempting to jar Phillips' memory as to what happened that day in surgery)round out the cast. To be honest, I'm not a Bijou Phillips fan and she once again did little to change my opinion of her. Except at the beginning, before entering the hospital for her son's birth, Phillips remains vacuous and aloof. I do understand that her character is tired and mentally deteriorating due to her baby's ferocious appetite for blood and human flesh(killing people and the difficulties of breastfeeding, not to mention, the constant crying for more cannibalistic nourishment don't help matters), but I had a damn hard time sympathetically aligning myself to her. I do think the point of the first film, the desperate attempts by a mother to protect her beloved child no matter what damage it causes or people it harms, is present in the remake, but a lot of the original's personality is missing from the newer modern take. I enjoyed Larry Cohen's "panic stricken public" and how the killer infant was considered a terror to the city, while this remake localizes the monster baby's antics to Phillips and Murray's New Mexico home. Those who come to talk sense into Phillips usually wind up lunch for the baby who even eats rats and cats. While acknowledging her baby's activities in horror when she comes across the grisly remains of what it has done to people it feeds from, she nevertheless continues to protect it, consequences be damned. We know that eventually protecting the baby will become impossible and she will have to take drastic measures to keep it from killing her husband or his brother. I didn't find IT'S ALIVE particularly satisfying, especially the underwhelming CGI of the baby(it is hardly ever on screen and when it is, the effects are quite noticeable)and the gory attacks are often hard to decipher due to the director's insistence on not showing the murders in elaborate detail. I'd just say stick with the original unless you are just a monster baby movie completist. How the baby can lock its father in the basement, hop around like a squirrel, and create such bloody crime scenes defies common sense. The film's explanation for the abnormalities of the baby derived from pills off the internet which are supposed to cause a miscarriage!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, Joy......Another Moronic Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Abysmal remake of Larry Cohen's '74 genre classic. The original started like a bat out of hell and kept going from there. It had genuine excitement, scares, tension, a logical script, and characters that behaved like rational, real people. In this abortion of a remake we have a film that is painfully slow and unpleasant (for the wrong reasons), like a snail with diarrhea. It even manages to make the delivery room massacre a lifeless non-event....btw, blood is OPAQUE not TRANSPARENT. It looks like the walls have been hosed down with cherry jelly. Every single change from the original is for the worse. Why add Frank's little brother? He serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever in the screenplay. He has no effect on any of the events in the film and just mopes aimlessly....and what purpose does the character being in a wheelchair serve??? Stupid. In the original the baby escapes from the delivery room and both parents are scared shitless of it....like real people would be. Here, the baby.....who now only looks monstrous at the moment of attack....curls up on it's mother's incised belly and goes to sleep. Stupid. The new Lenore knows that the baby is a monster, but wuvs him so vewy, vewy much that she just covers up the killings. Even mother love only goes so far. Stupid. The baby never attacks when his father and young uncle are around to notice anything. Bad writing AND Stupid. Tiny Bijou Phillips is obviously supposed to have been able to lug multiple bodies down the cellar steps and hide them....all by herself. Stupid. Out of nowhere....and for no discernible reason other that that it's the climax of the movie and they wanted the house dark....the baby suddenly knows how to shut off the electricity in the house. How would it possibly know how to do this and why would it logically want to??? Stupid!!! The movie is only 80 mins., but I could continue pointing out tangible stupidities for days. The baby from the original had a great design and you actually got to SEE it. This is not the case here because the 2 second "good look" you get at the little bastard's face at the climax is rendered in such astonishingly horrid CG that if it had been shown earlier the audience would have hyperventilated from hysterical laughter and mercifully missed any more of the movie. Phillips' decent performance and a nice, but derivative score by Nicholas Pike are the only faint bright spots on this celluloid tumor. I am appalled that Larry Cohen so much as dotted an "i" in this screenplay. He should be mortally ashamed. This "It's Alive" was born dead and rotting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad of a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Alive is set in New Mexico where college student Lenore Harker (Bijou Phillips) &amp; her boyfriend Frank Davis (James Murray) are expecting a baby boy, while taking a shower Lenore feels labour pains &amp; know's that she is going to give birth. Frank rushes her to the hospital where Lenore is taken into the delivery room, some time later an orderly enters the delivery room &amp; finds four of the medical team dead having been brutally torn to pieces while Lenore &amp; her baby boy seem unhurt. The cops have no clues &amp; Sergeant Perkins (Owen Teale) has no leads except Lenore who was under anaesthetic at the time, Lenore &amp; Frank with their newborn baby son Daniel are allowed to go home but there's something not quite right with the young baby. Lenore finds Daniel eating dead animals &amp; when she finds a dead body torn to pieces Lenore know's there's only one explanation but how could a young baby boy be a vicious killer...Directed by Josef Rusnak this is a remake of the Larry Cohen written, produced &amp; directed horror film It's Alive (1974) which was a considerable success at the time of release &amp; spawned two sequels of it's own as well as this remake which Cohen himself co-wrote. I personally have no problems with remakes at all, the original film still exists so I don't see any issue whatsoever, while the original It's Alive was a good solid horror film that had a little bit of wit, black humour &amp; intelligence the It's Alive remake is more bland but I did still quite like it for what it was. Predictable to appease to the teen horror film crowd the mother &amp; father in this remake are pretty young teens rather than grown adults as in the original but you could say that the script deals with the pressures &amp; problems of young parents which is a much, much bigger issue now in 2010 than it was back in 1974 so in a way the script has just been adjusted for a new generation &amp; a new society where it's actually very relevant, issues of blind maternal love, abortion, premature birth &amp; the emotional effects of caring for a newborn baby are touched upon but are never gone into with any great depth or intelligence. At only 80 minutes long It's Alive is short, very short &amp; not that much happens really although it does have a few nice moments &amp; the somewhat downbeat choice of ending was surprising although also welcome. The first twenty five minutes follows the original quite closely as a woman gives birth to a mutant baby that kills the medical team but instead of having the baby go on the run &amp; being hunted down the mother tries to protect it &amp; cover up for it's crimes in a decent twist on the original, having said that surely anyone finding their newborn baby eating dead animals &amp; killing people would have a hard time loving it &amp; protecting like Lenore does here.Available in both 'R' rated &amp; 'Unrated' versions I saw the Unrated cut which is gorier than than the original with better effects &amp; attack scenes, slashed dead bodies are seen, severed limbs are shown, someone is ripped in half, there's lots of blood splatter &amp; someone gets a tiny baby claw fist punched through their head. There's a bit of nudity as well, while being breast fed Damien bites his mother's nipple &amp; draw's blood in another glaring sign something was wrong that Lenore chose to ignore. Surprisingly the mutant baby effects are extremely restrained &amp; there's only ever one shot of it during the entire film, strangely there are no scenes of Daniel as a normal baby either as he is kept off screen for virtually the whole film. Don't let anyone tell you the original three It's Alive films are classic either, they are not with It's Alive III: Island of the Alive (1987) easily the worst out of the four films, I should know I have now watched all four It's Alive films in the space of four days (yeah, my head hurts just thinking about it).Filmed in Bulgaria the IMDb says It's Alive had a $10,000,000 budget which I don't believe for a second, there's no way this cost that much &amp; if did have a budget that big it wouldn't have been shot in Bulgaria. The acting varies, the main cast do alright with Bijou Phillips quite good as the mother.It's Alive the remake is a decent little horror film in it's own right actually, don't let anyone fool you that the original is some untouchable classic because it's not although I would still say it's a bit better than this remake overall. A good pace, nicely shot, there's some good gore &amp; virtually no CGI computer effects work means It's Alive the remake actually turned out better than I had expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one baby that you really don't want to wake up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "It's Alive" to be an effective and rather gory tale of a woman who gives birth to a monster of a baby that has an appetite for flesh and blood.I'll admit that I have not seen the 1974 original movie that goes by the same name and was directed by Larry Cohen.Instead, a friend and I watched this remake and we both agree that this was a good horror film.The death scenes of the movie are fast-paced and violent, the baby is a satanic monster, and the mother knows about the baby but refuses to tell anyone.What more could you people want? I mean really, a 3.8? I was not in any way disappointed by this movie.It's no contender for a best picture nomination, but it's good entertainment that only some people don't claim it to be.If I had a problem with the movie, it would be the ending.I thought the ending of "The Stepfather" was bad, but this one was something else.But I am giving a recommendation for "It's Alive" and I hope that the reviews that come in after mine are mostly positive.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better straight to DVD movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this last night and thought it was a decent entry into the monster genre. Bijou Phillips plays a mother who gives birth to some sort of monster baby and realises it is a killer.The acting was hit and miss, for the most part, Bijou was great, aside from some overacting whenever she found that the baby had done something. One thing did make me laugh though, because she is playing an expectant/new mother, she uses a breast double. This must be the first time Ms. Phillips has actually shied away from appearing nude in a film. The rest of the mostly British cast was OK, but some of them (namely Ty Glaser) seemed to be suffering from bad accent syndrome, and there was some slipping back into the natural accents. I thought that Raphael Coleman was quite good as the baby's wheelchair bound relative, considering that this appears to be only his second feature film.The one piece of casting I couldn't buy was the sinister looking Owen Teale as a police officer. Perhaps it is because I last saw him in Torchwood as a cannibal killer, but no one can deny that there is something sinister and decidedly criminal about him, so it seems odd for him to be playing a policeman. Whenever Jack Ellis appeared on screen all I could see was Jim Fenner too (this was also the same when he played Liz McDonald's bit on the side in Coronation Street), so perhaps I've just typecast these actors as being sinister.I think the film would have been better off had it been set in Britain because of all the British actors used. It just seemed odd to me to see them all in this supposedly American setting.I was a bit confused by the main character as well. She is supposed to be a college student, but she appears to be at least 30 years old, so I wasn't sure whether she was supposed to be a mature student or just stupid.The death scenes weren't very well done either, with characters being rushed at by some invisible force and left in a pool of blood. They all seemed to be the same too, which just got boring after a while.This brings us on to the baby. Well, after being teased all the way through the film, we finally catch a glimpse of it near the end when it appears in a bin. The CGI used to animate it is dreadful, and it just ends up looking ridiculous. The only thing that looks worse is the CGI fire that comes around the baby's room near the end.Having said all that, I enjoyed the film. There was a heartbreaking moment just before the baby's reveal where the father agonises over whether to kill his child and it begins to cry like a normal baby. The whole moral dilemma over whether to kill one's own child, especially as it is just a baby is not a nice position to have to be put in.I'd say watch this film, because it is a decent entry into the straight to DVD market, and although it's no masterpiece, it's still worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been aborted?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This rather dumb, I even daresay downright imbecilic, flick is a prototypic example of why people righteously hate horror movie remakes. And yet, I started watching it with a very open mindset and actually hoped for a pleasant surprise. Why? Because, for once, it's not just another redundant remake of a bona fide genre classic that totally doesn't need an update version. Like "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th", for example. Why should they be remade? The original "It's Alive", on the other hand, was an extremely low-budgeted and often clumsily put together obscure cult gem from the early 1970's! That's an ideal film to bring to the attention of wider horror audiences through a remake. Unfortunately, it turned out a total failure of a film, with an insubstantial script, a total lack of tension and atmosphere and embarrassing gore/splatter effects. Bijou Philips gives birth to a baby 'only a mother could love'. The offspring immediately slaughters all the hospital staff in the delivery room and, since it's so exceptionally large and overdeveloped, it also regularly needs extra snacks like psychiatrists, bimbo blond friends and stoner boyfriends. Mommy carefully cleans up the mess junior makes (and doesn't even seem to worry that much) and daddy doesn't seem to have clue of what's going on. The monster baby is mainly kept off-screen, maybe for the best, and all the CGI butchering effects are pathetic. "It's Alive" couldn't even scare an infant. The cute Bijou Philips tries hard to make her character plausible, but the script is simply too idiotic. Larry Cohen, writer/director of the original as well as numerous other cult classics, co-wrote the script of this inferior remake, strangely enough. Perhaps he deliberately sabotaged the whole thing, hoping people would take the effort to check out the original again instead. Good job, Larry, it worked!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'It's Alive'! and you'll wish you weren't after wasting time on this little beauty! Allow me to continue. So, is this New Mexico after a nuclear winter? I live in Oregon and this certainly looked like my home, not New Mexico. No sand, no sun, no people of color. But I digress. As the plot (and I use that word loosely) began to unfold another demented baby movie came to mind, that being "Grace". Drop 'It's Alive' on its head and run out and get that movie. Major creep-out. When shown at Sundance, it was said to have caused two men to faint and projectile vomiting from audience members. Anyhow, why does she keep the bundle of joy? If he is so strong as to take out adults, how is it he reverts to cooing baby when in her arms? How is it that she has breasts left? How is it that her husband hasn't noticed the little freak when he gazes upon him in sheer love? This movie is a mess and not in a laughable, good way. Like others who reviewed, I was drawn in by Ms. Phillips. Curious I guess. She did a good job. Didn't burst out laughing at the absurdities in the story line. Did I really see the tiny hand of the baby grabbing at thin air from inside the mouth of one of the victims? If so, it was worth it for that.</fullReview>

I couldn't stop laughing out of the irony.Actors' performances are awful and most of them are not believable; the screenplay is horrible and sissy; the "Special Effects" seem to be retro but they aren't (just look at the fire in the house of the final scene); and many other characteristics made this movie, one of the worst movies ever made.However, there are good things about this movie: for instance, if you're studying cinematography you should watch "It's Alive", because this film made think about how not to make movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pregnant college student Lenore Harker leaves college before the end of the semester to move to an isolated house with her boyfriend Frank. When Lenore is ready to deliver the baby, they drive to the hospital. In the surgery room, the two doctors and the two nurses are found slaughtered and Lenore and the baby are found covered of blood. When Lenore is released, the family returns to Frank's house....They should have just called this movie killer baby, or something but the fact of the matter is its a poor remake of a poor movie anyway.Characters are uninvolved and look bored, and really, the only fun I gore from this movie was spotting British celebs with their silly faux pas American accents.Special effects are dire, they just consist people running around pretending to be scared of a mutant jelly baby or just over the top scenes of needless gore.It's a bad movie with little in the way of anything positive, but at least the hospital scene is okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mutant baby...a killer baby.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ambitious remake of Larry Cohen's 1974 killer baby classic. An attractive grad student Lenore(Bijou Phillips)puts her education on hold to have a baby with her architect boyfriend Frank(James Murray). Plans of a beautiful life in a secluded country atmosphere is not going to stand a chance when Lenore has her baby by emergency C-section. Not exactly a bundle of joy; but a natural born killer...an abomination craving to be fed. Lenore knows her baby is prone to savage attacks, but just can't tell her husband of their baby's murderous impulses. A few chills and a couple of squirms in store; but you hardly get to see the monster baby...just what is left over from his ravaging appetite . Others in the cast: Owen Teale, Jack Ellis, Ty Glaser and Raphael Coleman. Little baby Daniel is an unholy terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Experiencing a film of a very lousy IMDb rate for the very first time, FAILED! the film was very cheap from every possible side you can ever think of, the directing, the story, the serializing, the everything! no mystery at all, no surprises, no heart-attacking moments, no tension, no attracting, the film was just the kid killing some people, eating some creatures, again and again, and then the same thing repeats itself, waiting for something to happen ? no dear ain't gonna get that ! i am still wondering why did they ever have to make or remake that film, it was some very waste of effort and talent if the people who have worked on it ever had any !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Horror Movie I've ever watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even I have to leave comment regarding this movie. We just sat there with our jaws wide open thinking : "Is this for real or is this a student movie from 1st semester". The story is so retarded.My 3 year old nephew could have written a better story. I mean a disformed baby that eats human and animal flesh.....okay....could work....but not if your CGI looks like you bought it over ebay and the screewriter was so high on drugs he just wrote down anything for his next fix. Seriously......we laughed the whole time and the only time we where scared was whas when we accidentally hit the replay button after the rolling credits. If you want to see the possibly worst horror movie ever produced go and rent " it's alive". And don't forget to watch the director's interview. You will be pissing yourself how he actually sells the movie as one of the best of its genre. OMG. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad, actually...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love It's Alive, it is a favorite of mine. Cheesy 70's killer baby flick, you can't beat that. I am a big fan of Larry Cohen, and his older flicks, so when I heard a remake was being made I was skeptical. I thought if done right, if they went with a less cheesy approach, it could be decent, at least better than some of the other recent remakes. I wasn't sure what was going on with this film until recently I received a screener of the remake at work. I must say, I actually enjoyed it a lot more than expected. It has flaws, including a CGI killer baby this time...but overall, this film is actually a lot of fun. It isn't the spooky, realistic film it could have been, but it is a bloody good time. Though not as much fun as the original, it is a decent watch, with some decent gore. It really has no relation to the original, other than a killing baby, and the same of the family is still Davis. Overall, if you like the original, it is a decent watch, and if you haven't watched the legendary classic, watch that first, then this. I was just sad they didn't recreate the milkman scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Larry Cohen; "It's Beyond Awful!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty bad. Cult film director Larry Cohen who was the mastermind behind It's Alive!, It Lives Again! and It's Alive III: Island of the Alive has gone on record as saying; "It's a terrible picture. Just beyond awful! I would advise anyone who likes my film to cross the street to avoid seeing the new enchilada". A new young mother lives in a state of denial, refusing to believe her newborn is a cannibalistic killer while the bodycount grows proportionately with the murderous tot's taste for human flesh and blood. Fans of the original series will likely be disappointed in this inferior reboot which went straight to disc for obvious reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is nothing wrong with the baby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just the fact that the youngest serial killer. After Lenore born prematurely the baby kills all the doctors in the operating room. Then she moves with her boyfriend who lives with his brother who is immobilized in a wheelchair. Lenore and Frank apparently lead a quiet life until they find that their baby likes to kill animals and has a big appetite for blood. Lenore distances herself even from her best friend who is forced to make them a visit to find out what is happening to her and why does not response to her calls. It will end with her boyfriend in front of this little monster. It seems that neither the police can not do anything and they will be killed because do not think that a small child could do such things and another one is responsible for the murders. Neither his mother does not want her little creature to gets hurt, after seeing her friends were killed she did not take action, instead she cleans up after him to erase any trace. It's a stupid movie with a very bad idea. There's only one thing wrong with this baby, the fact that he should not exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An killer infant? Literally? Surely this was a joke?...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original movie on which this 2008 version is based, so this review is solely based on having seen the 2008 version only.First of all, I must say that I found the story to be laughable at best. Come on, an infant killing animals and full-grown people? It was just so far out there and it was nowhere near making any sense in a logical way at all. And that really brought down the movie a couple of notches for me, because it was so hard to buy into the storyline.That being said, then on the other hand, the movie was quite nicely shot and well put together. So there is a great sense of production value to weigh up for the lousy storyline.And the performances were also helping to carry the movie along, as Bijou Phillips (playing Lenore) and James Murray (playing Frank) were doing good jobs with their characters and helping to bring them to life on the screen.Sadly, though, that wasn't enough to make the movie stay afloat. For a horror movie, there was a horrible lack of frights, scary moments or spooky elements. It was basically just a couple of hints here and there as to the killing and the mayhem, through the usage of visual techniques with the camera and sound effects. You didn't really get to see anything to implicate that it was actually Daniel who was doing it. I am sure that would have worked back in 1974 during the original movie, but not in 2008.So despite it being a nicely shot movie, the storyline really killed the experience for me, and I found the movie to be less than average. Personally, I just found the storyline about an infant that kills too laughable and implausible.I am sure that if you are a fan of either Bijou Phillips or James Murray then you might actually get some worth out of this movie. But if you are watching it with the intent of watching a good horror movie, like I did, you are perhaps better off with something else.I am giving "It's Alive" a 4/10 rating because of the acting and the way the movie was shot and edited. The storyline itself is the anchor that is causing this movie to drown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Cohen writes the screenplay for an updated version of his 1970's classic horror film that spawned two sequels. Here a young grad student discovers she's pregnant and goes to live with the father of her child and his family. Giving birth the baby kills the delivery team leaving a mystery in its wake. It transpires that the baby is a mutant and kills when frightened. Add this to the list of good remakes of 1970's horror films. To be certain its far from perfect (honestly the original wasn't all that great either) but it does manage to generate a certain amount of unease and tension. Helping things along is that we almost never see the baby. We do not really see the attacks as such we see the aftermath which imply more than we are shown. We also do not really see the baby who remains an enigma for most of the films running time and it adds to the unease since we have to let our imagination create the monster(I will say that it is not the misshapen mutant of the original series). I liked the film. There is something about it that made me feel creepy, which is surprising these days when most horror films don't make me feel anything other than bored. Worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'l be very brief. Whoever is responsible for the screenplay of this atrocity should revise everything they know about the art of writing and take a few lessons in psychology (although I doubt that it would help) and all those who agreed to take part (in any sort of way) in the production of this feature are either intellectually challenged in a desperately tragic way or they are simply faced with minimum alternatives, if any altogether (they have my condolences in the latter occasion). This crap (won't even call it a movie) defies human logic and it offends every intellectual progress achieved by the human kind. I simply wish that IMDb executives would implement a system of negative scoring. I believe my comment should be sufficiently emphatic even for the most sceptic reader.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the original might have made this remake doomed from the start for me. Don't get me wrong there were some aspects of the movie that i dug, but for the most part, it was really slow-paced and pointless at times. Unlike the original it totally failed to create any mood or suspense. It was if you were just waiting for something to happen that never does. I'll also agree with other reviews that the location of New Mexico was really hard to believe along with James Murray's American accent. So please don't expect to much it's just another drop in the tidal wave of horror movie remakes. Watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IT'S ALIVE, when it should have stayed dead...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this supposed "remake" of the LARRY COHEN 1974 film of the same name. A newborn baby runs amok, killing cops, doctors, psychiatrists. cats, rats, rabbits, opening doors, lifting &amp; killing adults, pounding skulls in with his baby fists, eating a hole in his father, punching holes in the wall, while the mother slowly goes insane &amp; goes to great lengths to protect the infant from those who try to hurt it, as the sheriff tries to figure out what's going on, (especially following the delivery room slaughter of a group of doctors), &amp; when the lead heroine has no memory of anything from the night her baby was born, a psychiatrist tries to get her to remember the event of the night it took place so they can hopefully get an image of the killer (unfortuantly the mother by this point knows who the killer really is...) she suffers from nightmarish visions (she has a psychic link to her child) her one breast has horrible bite marks on it, her friends are greatly worried about her, especially after the child's birth, since she has cut off all communications with them. She manages for a while to keep the babies unnatural habits a secret, tossing the dead animals away, hiding the mangled bodies in the basement, but as always in these kinds of films, things get out of hand mighty quickly...Having learnt LARRY COHEN was remaking his original IT'S ALIVE, I was half &amp; half, I figured the last thing we need is yet another pointless remake, but at the same time I figured as long as Larry was writing it, it might be fun &amp; who knows, turn out to be a much better movie, I was badly wrong on both counts. IT'S ALIVE is a terrible, boring film, now granted, IT'S ALIVE Parts 1-3 are no masterpieces, far from it, but at least they never took themselves too seriously &amp; were kind of fun to watch in a bad B movie sort of way. IT'S ALIVE 08' attempts to be serious all the way through &amp; as a result of it, it fails bad, really bad...Now I will give the film some points, I loved the scene where the psychiatrist was killed, it was pretty cool &amp; gruesome looking, the direction was actually better &amp; some of the effects weren't to bad &amp; the film did have a couple of jumps that caught me off guard, but as a whole, the film has so much wrong with it I really don't know where to start. The acting is bad, &amp; like in the original, it's never really made clear just why the baby turned into a carnivorous predator, I mean there is a small indication of what might have caused it, with a scene where she explains to her husband she took an experimental drug, but who made the drug, did it have the same effect on other women's babies who took it? etc. is never explained &amp; the film bears almost no resemblance to the earlier film. This one is set in the countryside &amp; not the city &amp; with the exception of the killer baby, the delivery room massacre &amp; the family having the same last name as the family in the original, none of the other events are repeated, in fact, the film seems to be more of a sequel that claims to be a remake, probably done by the producers who figured they would be able to lure more customers into renting something they think is a remake or an entirely new movie rather then renting a movie just called IT'S ALIVE 4. The mother character is also annoying, as she acts as though all these horrible things the baby is doing is normal &amp; seemingly doesn't care as to what is happening to a bunch of innocent people, including her friends. Other area's the film flunks in is with the drab looking cinematogr aphy &amp; the writers have poor knowledge on police procedural, as the cops here allow dogs to run through the hospital looking for a killer (they do that for drug searches or if they have something of the criminal(s) they are looking for &amp; use that for the dogs to pick up their scent, here they have nothing of the supposed unseen killer so how are the dogs going to pick up his scent? &amp; the film also cops out by turning the Davis parents from a middle aged couple who are dealing with a horrible travesty to a couple of college kids in New Mexico &amp; their college friends, with the father of the baby being the older brother of a crippled youngster both of whom lost their parents a year or two prior &amp; the film fails to generate any interest from first frame till last. Already forgotten remake, that thankfully blew up in the faces of the greedy studio heads &amp; was dropped direct to DVD (&amp; even then the film was scantly distributed) &amp; is a prime example of studio greed overcoming any good intentions to produce even a half decent remake, as a result, the film fails in almost every department. It's obvious the studio was aiming this at a younger audience, but it's so bland &amp; uninteresting that even the very few who did see it, laughed at it &amp; called it boring. In short, if you seen one killer foetus movie you've seen them all, I'm tired of them quiet frankly, they are all pretty much boring &amp; none of the current ones have added anything new to the genre, they just cover the same old tired grounds. As in the original film, the baby is barely seen, perhaps that is for the better, since the baby monster effects are quiet poor. *1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise of the movie is really out there. Of course it's supposed to be over the top and even the explanation you get somewhere in the movie, why this is all happening is so crazy, that you can't help yourself but laugh about it.Having said that, the sole and main reason, you are going to watch this, is the "bloody mess" it delivers (no pun intended). And it delivers on that premise, so if you are splatter fan, than you can pretty much enjoy this. Not that much going on in the acting category and or the story department. Based on a Cohen movie (which I haven't seen), it's pretty much everything you can expect from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Alive (2008) ** (out of 4) Remake of Larry Cohen's cult classic has parents Lenore and Frank (Bijou Phillips, James Murray) happy to welcome in a baby boy but there seems to be something wrong. During the C-Section everyone in the delivery room was murdered with the exception of mommy and baby. Soon others start to go missing and you just know it has something to do with the baby. This film, co-written by the original film's director and screenwriter, ended up going straight-to-DVD here in the U.S. and that's pretty understandable because this film is pretty so-so from start to finish. I'd imagine this one here would have been a tough sell as not too many people want to watch a movie about a killer baby and even if they did this film doesn't offer up too much. I think the biggest problem here is the screenplay. For starters, we're suppose to connect with the mother yet the screenplay doesn't do her any favors by making her rather stupid and someone we really can't care for. She begins helping the baby by covering up the murders, which some might say a lot of parents would but at the same time she never stops and thinks about the thing being a killer. Another problem is that all of the violence is kept off screen and we never get to see the baby doing any of the killings. I'm sure this was done so that the film might have a chance of getting released but this makes the film rather bland especially when compared to the original. The screenplay does add a few good touches including keeping the baby normal looking instead of the mutant from the original film. We also get a rather interesting reason as to what's wrong with the kid and why he's doing all the killings. I think it would have helped the film had this been brought up at the start so that we could have known this going through the film and they could have done more with it. I thought both Phillips and Murray were fine in their roles with the supporting players doing fine work as well. No one is going to win an Oscar for their work but it's good enough for this type of film. In the end this movie really doesn't work but it's not a complete failure either. The movie is just here and there's really nothing special or bad about it. I'm not sure who it will appeal to other than those who need to see every horror movie out there or those who just want to compare it to the original.</fullReview>
