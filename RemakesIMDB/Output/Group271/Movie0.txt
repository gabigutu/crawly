		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of visual drama; brilliantly acted by Peter Lorre. **** out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M / (1931) ****  "M" is a cinematic masterpiece of visual drama. The stunning performances define the careers of exceptional actors such as Peter Lorre and Gustaf Grundgens. Director Fritz Lang gives depth and dimension to his production by distinctly capturing the ecstasy of the film's many characters and focusing accurately on individual situations. This is an intriguing journey into the mind of a psychotic child murderer, blending terror, complexity, and malignity in one amazing motion picture. Screenwriters Paul Falkenburg and Adlof Jansen construct the characters of "M" with distinctive personalities and three dimensional emotions. Many lesser filmmakers give their characters no creativity outside the confines of the script. In this movie each individual character has a mind of their own; they are free to roam the landscape of a inviting atmosphere. Fabricating such an impressive atmosphere is some of the best cinematography and lighting effects that I can remember watching. This resplendent component creates the film's terrific moody ambiance. Suspense is one thing "M" contains in full context. The movie's third act is sheer peak-high tension. Shot in black and white, "M" stars Peter Lorre as Peter-Hans Beckert, an extremely disturbed child murderer in the process of wreaking havoc on a neighborhood. Parents everywhere are living in fear of their children being kidnapped and abruptly annihilated.  This picture contains a brilliantly crafted setup. The visual setting creates a strongly developed opening. Every scene works to either complicate the initial problem or propels the story through a firm narrative through line. The film captures the chaos of the town in terror perfectly. "M" is more about the results of a serial killer than an actual serial killer. Never do we directly witness a murder; the violent encounters are implied. This method of film making perhaps makes the movie's impact even greater. With an creative perspective through a third person point of view, the filmmakers repeatedly give us examples of a solid structure through characters and occurrences.  "M" offers a unforgettable, challenging performance by Peter Lorre. This extraordinary actor is tormenting and disturbing without embracing in extreme violent conduct. He perspires with momentum and rapture. This productions closing scenes are so deeply penetrating they entirely captivate the viewer. Isn't this what movies are supposed to do?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moments of menace..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The economy, austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and precise filmmakers... Lang, a master of the German expressionist film, shot his first talkie, a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies... It was a shocking idea for its time, based on the real-life killer Peter Kurten, headlined as the Vampire of Düsseldorf...'M' is about a terrorized city, and a plump little man with wide eyes (often chewing candy) who is a pathological child-killer, unable to control his urge for killing... The film embodies several Lang themes: the duality between justice and revenge, mob hysteria, the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in, and, for probably the first time in the cinema, it adds a new dimension to suspense: pity... For the killer is clearly mentally sick... He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease, and yet, we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal, rather than treated as a sick man... Early in the film, the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from 'In the Hall of the Mountain King'. This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace... And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window, the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there, just out of sight...The Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since 'Casablanca,' 'The Maltese Falcon,' and 'The Mask of Dimitrios.' When the photographs of his victims, all little girls, are shown to him, he jumps back and twitches with horror...With powerful visuals, Lang's motion picture is Lorre's first film... His performance as the corpulent, hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion... Lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes, outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal... He had only twelve lines of dialog...In the most famous of all about a pathological killer - Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre, but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy... 'Psycho' reeked with blood and horror, whereas the suspense of 'M' is subtle... A child's balloon without an owner, a rolling ball, are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed... The audience, trapped in its seats, torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer, watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>60 years old, and still uber-suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection ? A mother preparing dinner for her child, waiting anxiously for her to return from school. Her hope, and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door. While down in the streets of Berlin, her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat. We know what's going to happen, but it's still horrific to watch.Fritz Lang, you cinematic god! A simple story of the underworld, the police, and a single man holding an entire city hostage, and done with such precision and pre-noir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to end.But this movie is not so simple as the police inspectors trying to catch a devious murderer ? it's about the mob, employing its network of beggars and petty thieves also trying to bring the killer to their own brand of justice. Apparently, the police crackdown caused by the murders is bad for business ? so the mob begins to track him down as well.It's not only a great crime story, and perhaps the first physiological thriller (the murderer is schizophrenic) but there's comments to be made here about the nature of justice, and who should best dispense it.In all, not only a trail-blazing classic, but THE trail-blazing classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's (sound) masterpiece- a taut and quintessentially suspenseful story, and Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw M, by Fritz Lang, I almost didn't know what to make of it. I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances, the staging of the scenes, the locations, and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances. Then I saw it again, and a third time, and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany- it's a powerful statement about protecting our children (if you're looking at it as a "message" movie), but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven. Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements, and have such unconventionality of the times. Boiling down to this, M is about a child Killer - the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role - who snatches children when their parents don't watch, and continues on until an investigation goes underway. But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld, they know something is up, that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be, so they join in the hunt. This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thriller.On the first viewing I just went straight for the story, which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy. But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy, and indeed full-on artistry, of Lang's camera. He puts it in unusual places at times, and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene (this is, by the way, a precursor to 'film-noir', which Lang later became an important director in the 40's and 50's). On top of this, there is a very modern sense of style in the editing- I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise. One is where the cops (I think it was the cops) have an argument about the investigation- two of them get into a shouting match, and we get medium close-ups of them going back and forth. This is done quickly, with a kind of intensity that isn't even captured in today's thrillers. There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house, where Lang cuts around constantly, heightening the tension between the predators (the criminals) and the prey (Lorre), until it's almost too much to take.The disturbing aspects of the story, of child abduction and murder, have become benchmarks of a number of today's thrillers, where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows, in cat &amp; mouse style. This doesn't happen here, and because of it by the time we get to the final scene, with Lorre being interrogated and giving his "I can't help it" speech, it becomes something poetic, tragic, frightening. Lang doesn't leave his "message" so simplistically, he makes sure we know Lorre's side too, however twisted it has become, and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these present-day thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two. There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture, ultimately causing the two to never work together again. But nevertheless, out of this comes a towering performance of a small, wild-eyed criminal in the midst of an extremely well-told and unpredictable mystery story. In short, if you don't know what you're in for when you hear that whistle, those several infamous notes, you may not at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all. For a film like this to be made in 1931 is just shocking. Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before. In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers, their complexities and particularly about pathological ones. Yet, M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, Seven and not to mention countless more.The film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around. In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film, compassion for a child killer and rapist. Lorre makes the viewer see, that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion. Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims' eyes. Lorre doesn't do that but rather displays a frightened man, a scared man. One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior. His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear. Something that even today we as a people cannot understand, let alone in 1931.The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities. He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story. This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience. Fritz Lang here, has simply created here a timeless masterpiece. One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M in.I highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions. This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang, Lang's command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth. Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state. M, as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved. This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Influential and unforgettable masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany, where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement, and ended in the United States in 1953 with the production of The Big Heat, a film noir classic. Perhaps his greatest film, M (Germany, 1931) forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir. Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones. Even though M was Lang's (and Germany's) first sound film, many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late 1920's. While most early "talkies" return films to their static, visually monotonous, stage- imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium, M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous, off-screen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue. The film's editing, particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting, also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling. Of course, many of the film's sound effects are also imaginative and memorable, none more so than the compulsive whistling of the film's central character, the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert (magnificently played by Peter Lorre). Sound is also an important contributor to M's rich and influential use of off screen space. One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster, creepily intoning to his next victim, Elsie Beckmann, "You have a very pretty ball." Not only is Beckert's shadow a bow toward Lang's expressionist artistic roots, but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image - that is, among us, the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuous-appearing, albeit monstrous, member. Another example of Lang's use of off-screen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsie's absence from them: an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table, the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsie's mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughter's arrival, the attic play area that awaits Elsie's return from school. Most memorable of all - and most often alluded to visually in other films - is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckert's assault and murder of the innocent child, representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsie's ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame. Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated images.Beyond its technical brilliance, the keys to M's lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckert's twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and "trial." Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer, Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath. Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clear-cut. To be sure, the gut-reaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who, beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry, capture Beckert and bring him to a mock- formal trial whose conclusion is foregone. Like many in America today, Beckert's accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the "monster" in the surest way possible: a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible. Considering the heinousness of Beckert's crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again, this emotional response is hard to resist. Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism - quite the contrary. Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckert's unkempt "court appointed" defense attorney and Beckert's own impassioned monologue, Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others (guilty or not) in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in 1930s Germany. That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks, dresses, and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident. Moreover, the letter "M" chalked on Beckert's back by one of his pursuers not only stands for "murderer" but also alludes to God's marking of Cain. While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil, it in fact represents God's warning to Cain's flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance, but to leave justice in God's hands. Translated into secular terms (and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame), God's hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert "in the name of the Law."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>German Expressionism at its cinematic best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art, I'm naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang. I recently was able to see the restored version of "Metropolis" on the big screen, and was delighted to see "M" on the Sundance channel - especially since it was the uncut version. M follows the trail of a child killer (Peter Lorre), sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation. This film is ground-breaking for many reasons: It is Fritz Lang's first talking picture, it is one of the first in the serial killer genre and it was overtly anti-Nazi. This film was banned in Germany shortly after it premiered, and Fritz Lang and Peter Lorre, both Jews, soon fled the country. It has superb acting (most notably, Peter Lorre's trial scene in the catacombs) and very stark yet at times gritty cinematography. The story is indeed suspenseful and at times, very creepy (what whistling child killer isn't?). The entire movie, however is extremely thought-provoking and challenging, much like the German Expressionist movement itself. This is not a movie for everyone; some may find it boring, some may find it too abstract. It also has one of the most bizarre shots I've ever seen in film - essentially it's a 30 second shot of the police inspector talking on the phone, but you're under his desk and looking up his pants leg. It actually kind of baffled me and made me chuckle for a second, but it was avant garde if anything.To those who appreciate early cinema that truly makes you think, both about the film and the subtext with which it was written and filmed, it is a must-see. --Shelly</fullReview>

If you enjoyed "Silence of the Lambs", you should see this also.Of course you must be patient enough to deal with subtitles, and the fact that this is a very old movie - one of the first "talkies".

The city in which he lives is, of course, panicked by the mysterious child-killings, and both the criminals and the police starts to haunt the man down. I won't reveal more then this, but I will say this: Just because it's an old movie, don't let your guard down.

		<shortDescription>"L" Before "M"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an eerie propagandist fashion, the phrase "in the name of the Law" is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Lang's "M" as a child killer is brought to justice. If "L" represents the State and the Law, then "M" is meant to represent the Individual (who in this case is a Murderer). Lang boldly asked us way back in 1931, whose rights come first: the State or the Individual? A master of his craft, Lang leaves the question open-ended and let's the audience decide."M" is shockingly contemporary in its psychological complexities. It explores the psychology of individualism vs. group think while showcasing how a state of fear can be inflicted upon a populace when a government fails to protect society from a single individual terrorizing the people. The story is fairly straightforward: An elusive citizen begins killing innocent children in a large nameless German city. The media fuels a paranoid frenzy that incites the public. The clueless police begin to raid "the underworld" after the populace is turned into a raving mob because of the failure to capture the killer. "The underworld" comes to a screeching halt as their business is ruined by the police and starts their own manhunt for the killer.Unlike a modern period piece that attempts to evoke a certain place and time, "M" WAS a certain place and time. Lang, in an almost prophetic sense, captured the state of mind of the German people in 1931 as the Weimar Republic was on the brink of collapse and the Nazi Regime was preparing to take over. When individuals live in a state of fear, as they do in "M", society collapses and the Individual is crushed. Only the State, it seems, can bring order."M" is a also a masterpiece for its technical aspects. The way in which Lang uses his camera to move through windows, capture shadows, reflections, empty spaces, and shift points-of-view is staggering even by today's standards. He also played with the new technology of recorded sound with extensive voice-over narration and dialogue used to overlap and transition between scenes. Didn't critics recently praise "Michael Clayton" for utilizing just such a technique as if it was something revolutionary? One can also see a protean style the would eventually birth the Film Noir movement with the creation of tension and suspense in the use of shadows and camera angles.Yet "M" is not perfect. It has some major flaws. There are no real "characters" in the film to speak of in the modern sense. The film is virtually all built around mood and plot. The only time Lang invites us to emotionally connect is in the opening and closing scenes with a mother of one of the victims, and in the classic scene of Peter Lorre giving his writhing and primal "I can't help it!" speech in front of the kangaroo court of criminals. The mother's grief and Lorre's madness are presented so sparsely and in such a raw form that it becomes too painful to want to connect with them. Another flaw that is often overstated about films from this time period is the slow pace of the early police procedural scenes. These inherent flaws combined with the inherent brilliance of Lang's vision make "M" one of the most challenging films a modern viewer could ever sit through.What impressed me most about "M" was the subtlety of the symbolism Lang created with his haunting images. As harrowing as the story is, none of the gruesomeness is shown on screen. It's all transmitted to the viewer through the power of suggestion. Is it any wonder Hitler wanted Fritz Lang for his propaganda machine, which thankfully led to Lang fleeing to America? I'll never forget the wide shots of the kangaroo court (and the looks on those people's faces as the killer is brought down the steps for trial) or the vast expanse of that empty warehouse. The scene of the ball rolling in the grass with no one to catch it, the balloon caught in the telephone wires, and the empty domestic spaces the mother has to inhabit after her child has been murdered are the types of scenes that tape into Jungian archetypes and shared fears. The look on Lorre's face as he confesses, the hand of the Law coming down to save Lorre from being lynched, and the ghastly plea from the mother in the final scene will stick with me for the rest of my life. "M" is a communal nightmare; one that from which we have yet to awake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lesson in Film History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Fritz Lang's M is watching the history of cinema unfold before one's eyes. Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film, this 1931 masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasons.First of all, the use of sound is impeccable. Suffice to say the killer in the movie is caught is through identifying his trademark whistling. But the use of voice-over narration was also new at the time and is used here very well: first when a mother calls, in panic, for her missing child, and her name echoes across several empty walls. Next in a scene in which two detectives elaborate on what they've done to apprehend the killer and everything they say is matched by an image.Secondly, few times has a serial killer been treated with such complexity, compassion and straightforwardness in cinema. Peter Lorre plays a child murder, a man who acts by impulse, possibly a schizophrenic. He simultaneously evokes horror and pity, and he's too distant from the super-cool and erudite serial killers of today. Lorre plays one Hans Beckert, a lonely man with a history of mental illness, an ordinary man without any qualities or amazing traits.Thirdly, it's a powerful meditation on vigilantism and crime. The police is unable to capture the killer, so Berlin's underground decides to capture the criminal. The police raids are putting them out of business and they resent the fact that a child killer is being sought amidst their ranks. The absurdity of bank robbers and card cheaters with a sense of morals is not lost on the filmmakers. In a mock-trial at the end, these same criminals think they have the authority to sentence the child murder to death. But as he tells them, if they wanted, if they got jobs and worked honestly, they could leave their lives of crime; a man who's ordered by voices to kill can't just turn off him impulses.But above all, M is a fascinating, exciting thriller. It's an intelligent crime story, that shows police and criminals working on different sides and with different means to achieve the same purpose. If one can laugh at the idea of a criminal union (realism should never be a criterion for judging art), one can't laugh at the policemen in this movie. Inspector Lohmann, played by Otto Wernicke, is one of most intelligent detectives ever to grace cinema. He's fat, he's cranky, he's an unlikely hero, but he's shrewd, he can read a person's personality at a glance, he's patient. Lang must have liked him too because he used the character (and actor) in his following crime epic, The Testament of Dr. Mabuse, in which Lohmann shows even greater skills.I knew (or at least highly expected) that M would be an amazing movie. But I didn't imagine a 80-year-old movie would hold up so well in terms of cinematography, sound, pacing, acting, structure. Few movies achieve such a synthesis of qualities. There is no doubt on my mind that M deserves the recognition it continues to receive from film historians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for its time - but has many flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this is just an OK film. Except for some little stylistic tricks there is nothing special. The story is OK, how it is told is rather weak, in some parts it's even ridiculous, the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you don't see much of anyway, and the sound quality is horrible (something you can't blame it for, but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words!) but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all (even if some say so) - the opposite is the case, it seems very amateurish. The slow pacing is typical for it's time. And suspense? I don't think so. In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed are:A) Lorre's overacting. Whenever overacting has a purpose it's critically acclaimed. And his acting as a madman is very effective. B) I'd call it "heavy look". The topic seems "heavy" and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important. You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorre's acting. As a justification so to say. I'm sure you like the film for many other reasons too. Some more important reasons maybe. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. It's a film we want to like and where you don't want to look for the flaws. Well, long story short, I don't think the final result is a success. There is too much Average in it and the Great isn't all that great. Metropolis, Nosferatu, Caligari, Sunrise, I think, have all a more stunning look. All silent and all made before "M". Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts, but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has. Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest. Like every time one said: "He doesn't leave any marks...blah, blah" I had to laugh. He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street, he walks along the streets with them, he goes into shops, buys stuff for them, he makes mad gestures in public. And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kind Of Movie You Want To See Everyday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has it all! This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Many people have criticized it because it's from 1931 and I say: Who cares when you have such a great movie? Peter Lorre gives a 4 star performance as the child murderer, and may I say he is very very haunting. Fritz Lang's direction is superb; the cinematography is superb! The kangaroo court scene at the end is my favorite part, and it's brilliantly done. The plot is very well crafted. Even more amazing is the plot focuses around catching the murderer, but it is not boring for one second. Each scene flows beautifully into the next with some amazing chases, raids, and facial expressions. This is also a movie ahead of its time. This is definitely one of the all-time best movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"M" For Murder, "M" For ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Masterpiece" is the word most film buffs and historians probably would use to describe this 1931 Fritz Lange film, based loosely on the events of a real-life serial killer a few years prior to the film. In this movie, the killer is Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre), who lures children to their deaths.Though the story is about a child killer, the theme of "M" centers more on society's obsession with the murders. From kids playing games, to adults going about their everyday lives, everyone is on guard, suspicious, combative, and very vindictive. For selfish reasons, even the petty criminal underworld wants the child killer caught. But the police are ineffective, and a self-righteous mob mentality takes over. The whole film is really a study in the terrifying psychology of "group think".As it turns out, the killer is less monstrous than pathetic and compulsive. Beckert can't help himself. He's a short, squatty, bug-eyed little man who can't control the devil within. Lorre was perfect for the role, and his acting is flawless and mesmerizing. Yes, the killings, all off-screen, are awful. But the militant lynch-mob mentality is just as scary. Beckert is the only individualist in the film.Part silent film and part talkie, the B&amp;W visual style of "M" is wonderfully expressionistic and baroque. There are lots of overhead camera shots. Background sounds, like honking horns and whistles, are precursors of major plot points.What strikes me most about this film is its tone. I can think of very few films that are so harsh, so bitter, so malicious, so punitive. "M" contains not an ounce of humanism. Lang's ex-wife, Thea von Harbou, a Nazi sympathizer, wrote the film, just before the rise of Hitler. The film's angry, militant tone thus foreshadows Hitler's Third Reich, from 1933 until 1945. (Lang himself fled Germany, and ended up in the U.S.)Your own personal preferences in films will determine whether you consider "M" to be a masterpiece, or overrated, or perhaps somewhere in between. But individual preferences aside, there can be no doubt that "M" is an important film, historically. Every person who wishes to be versed in classic films needs to see "M" at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filmed with an eye that was a generation ahead of its time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang has always been one of my favorites and so is his masterpiece M. almost any of Lang's films can be related to M in some way. Here, we have a chance to travel into the mind of a madman and maybe even our own mind, as the title of the film suggests. (murderers among us), something that resonates again in Lang's later films such as Fury (1936)?In M, LANG brilliantly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of menace through the use of sound. There are moments of dead silence which is sometimes broken abruptly, creating a feeling of unease.Lang also shows influence from Murnau (particularly "the last laugh") in terms of camera movements. I never forget a scene in which camera goes up the wall and (then through the window), enters the room in which beggars are being organized? it is interesting that the cooperation between thieves and beggars is effectively organized as each beggar even receives a personnel number?Also unforgettable for me are the shots that show Elsie's absence; an empty chair, empty staircase and finally Elsie' ball moving on the bushes and her balloon that is released from telephone wires?.Definitely a great success for Herr Lang for all its cinematic achievements?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M is quite the film. It shocks you throughout its runtime: the subject matter is scary and mature, the acting isn't over-the-top like its counterparts from the era, and there's swearing. Extreme swearing for the time. To top this all off, it's suspenseful. The entire last half is edge of your seat.Despite being indirectly named after Peter Lorre's character, he isn't directly prevalent in the film, but his presence is always in the air. Right from the start a mother yells at kids for "singing that awful song", a little rhyme about the child murderer. The citizens of Berlin are antsy: anyone could be the killer, and accusations fly. The entire police force is worn down, combing the city for one man. It even interrupts the criminals. So they decide to hunt this monster too, but at the same time while remaining separate from the police, who on any other day are their enemies. This is the dynamic of M, and the stubbornness leads to tension. The first half is informative, organic, but slowly paced. There were many opportunities to advance the plot that weren't taken. But once the ball gets rolling... it stays rolling, and right to the end you're right in the film. Lang makes interesting artistic choices, like the use of silence in suspenseful scenes. Seeing a man run completely scared but without even the noise of his shoes hitting the ground is harrowing. Mirrors also have interesting applications too. I was reading about this film before seeing it and people said how they could sympathize with the murderer. Personally, I would see about checking their heads: the murderer is 100% deranged. The only inner demons he faces are those of his previous exploits. This leads to the final conflict, of how justice should be administered, which is an great debate, but the killer is sick, through and through. M is groundbreaking, going where film had not gone before and doing it supremely anyway. An entertaining 2 hours, though it's not exactly a 'fun' film, and the end, while being powerful, isn't handled to the same standard as the rest of the film. It just... fades to black. Maybe this will grow on me, but after seeing it, it puts the tiniest damper on the end of a genius film. 8.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We see the beginnings of film noir in Germany's first talking picture. It also has some remnants of German Expressionism. But what is most impressive is the story itself.Anyone that has followed cases of missing children know what the police go through, and watching this crime/psychological thriller and the search for a child serial killer is just like watching the 6 o'clock news today.The acting is superb, and the story is compelling. It is not so much about the killer, but about the people's reactions to the fear he has filled them with. Of course, the thieves and prostitutes are too happy either with cops everywhere. It was absolutely hilarious to watch the cops planning how to step up raids while, at the same time across town, the underworld was trying to figure out how to catch the murderer and get back to business.Both the police and the underworld get a break at the same time. But the underworld has him cornered and things are getting really tense. You cannot image what they do to try and find him. This was the most innovative story I have seen.The "trial" was magnificent! The print was absolutely perfect and the lighting was superb. The sound was even OK for the first use.Gustaf Gründgens was superb as the leader of the underworld, Theodor Loos equally so as the head of the police, and Peter Lorre was great as usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M-1931: Where Fritz Lang bares the soul and psychology of the child-killer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, unequivocally, a psychological thriller that all films buffs must see. I've now seen it three times, but I'm certain to see it again.The fictional character of Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) is based upon a real-life serial killer who stalked the streets of Dusseldorf. Fritz Lang, the director, had read an article about that killer and constructed this thrilling story that relates how Beckert is finally brought to justice.The film opens with a sequence that establishes the latest disappearance of a small girl, Elsie Beckmann (Inge Landgut), with her mother (Ellen Widmann) waiting and waiting, and finally calling anxiously for Elsie from her apartment window, set high in the lower-class tenement block. The expected hue and cry ensues at yet another ghastly murder; the citizens are again outraged that the murderer is still loose; the police are stumped for clues; and, most importantly, the well-connected criminal bosses in the city are angry ? because the police step up raids across the city trying to find the killer and, in that process, prevent them from continuing their criminal activities. So, they decide to find the murderer themselves and get rid of him? And, to compound the dramatic irony, Lang has the police launch a massive manhunt, across the county, for all men with a history of mental illness. As a result of that search, the file on Beckert turns up, and so the police set up a stake-out at his apartment when clues there substantiate their suspicions.Hence, both sides of the law are frantically trying to find Beckert, but for very different reasons. The question is: who will get to him first? The narrative then moves on to where Beckert is currying favor with his next little victim, when he is spotted by one of the city's criminal low-life, who then follows him around to make sure it's the killer he's found. Satisfied, the man cleverly marks Beckert on his overcoat, with a large, white M, and then runs off to raise the alarm and get help from the rest of the gang.Thereafter, it's a three-way race: Beckert finds the mark on his back and runs to ground, to hide in a large office block, but not before the criminals see him enter the building; the criminal gangs then assemble a large force that breaks into that block after hours to find him; and the police, alerted by a tripped alarm from the office block, finally rush over to find only one criminal still there, ironically forgotten by his friends.The sequence in the office block, with Beckert trying to stay hidden, while the searchers get closer with each passing minute, is one of the most suspenseful ? and quasi-comedic ? actions ever put to film. Years later, Ray Milland appeared in The Big Clock (1948) with a very similar setting which, in turn, was remade with Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in No Way Out (1987) ? and both of which I'm sure owe much to Lang's superior effort with M.It's a great visual story (reason enough to see it, in my opinion), but it's also Germany's first talking film. And, to say anymore about the narrative would spoil it, if you haven't seen it yet.What's equally great is Lang's filming and direction, using light/dark; high and low angle shots; shot-reverse shot; voice-over narration that matched remote action (a first in cinema); and sequences that tell a story with no words; and all with the consummate originality and skill of a master practitioner. Little wonder that this film constantly ranks within the top 100 of all time.Special mention must also be given to Peter Lorre, an actor unknown to Hollywood at the time of release. His portrayal of a child-killer is flawless. For the first hour, he hardly says a word, his looks and actions doing more than enough to show his character. Only after he is trapped in the office block does he break his silence, and with devastating effect. Lang then does the unthinkable, almost: he shows Beckert's psychology and vulnerability, with exquisite irony, to the extent that the viewer begins to feel sympathy for the worst of the worst. It's an unforgettable narrative achievement. (In contrast, who has ever felt any real sympathy for Norman Bates, the psychopath from Psycho [1960]?) Interestingly, when Lorre did get to Hollywood, he appeared in a film called The Stranger on the third floor (1940), in which he again played the part of a psychopathic killer, this time of women. And, of course, who can forget his droll portrayal as Dr Herman Feinstein in Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)? The rest of the cast for M is more than adequate; in fact, I understand that Lang actually used a number of real criminals during shots of the criminal gangs, and especially during the final act. I was particularly taken with the boss of the criminal gangs, Schränker (Gustaf Grundgens) and the two main policemen of this story, Inspectors Lohmann and Groeber (Otto Wernicke and Theodor Loos, respectively).Some reviewers exhibit frustration with what appears to be an ambiguous end. Considering the times, however, I think there's little doubt about the outcome. You'll have to make your own assessment, obviously.Highest recommendation for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This won't bring back our children"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin' in the Rain were more or less myths, the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere. Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology, films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release. Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywood's first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselves.It's funny how sceptics dismissed sound as a gimmick, because the best early uses of sound were those that treated it as exactly that ? a gimmick. Lang demonstrates in M that a talkie need not be an entirely new kind of motion picture; sound is merely another layer of technique. Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy dialogue scenes, Lang keeps his storytelling primarily visual, and when he needs lots of expository dialogue he intercuts multiple scenes to keep the pace going. This is not to say Lang is trying to ignore sound ? in fact he uses it to enhance the picture, sometimes having dialogue or other noises take place off-screen to focus us on reactions or cause-and-effect. Other times he ironically uses completely silence (something of course you never get with "silent" pictures due to the continuous musical score) giving a dreadful sense of eeriness.And thankfully, the best elements of Lang's method have survived the talkie revolution. His visual style is particularly effective here in provoking a chilling, disturbing atmosphere. Shot compositions with large blank areas give a sense of surreal starkness. Characters often stare intensely straight at the camera, aggressively drawing the audience into the film's world. Several times we are even dumped straight into the point-of-view of the killer himself. The fragmented narrative with its lack of lead characters and impersonal, point-by-point plotting could easily be boring, but Lang holds our interest by keeping a dynamic sense of rhythm and telling the bulk of the tale through pure wordless imagery. Lang's German pictures, in common with typical German cinema of the time, feature highly melodramatic acting and exaggerated, almost comical characters. These figures generally suited the fantasies and comic-book stories of Lang's silent days, but I'm not sure they sit so well with the close-to-home setting of M. Still, these characters are somewhat more effective now that they have voices, probably because most German screen actors of the day were from a stage background. Peter Lorre was a shameless ham, but that's what you need to play a psychopath, and in any case he's a lot better here than in many of his Hollywood roles. Otto Wernicke is also incredibly entertaining in the role of Inspector Karl "Fatty" Lohmann; again a stagy exaggeration but with some absolutely wonderful gestures and comic timing.There isn't a lot else I can say about M ? it is one of those pictures that has been analysed to death ? although I doubt any comment other than mine mentions Singin' in the Rain in the opening line :). While not quite Lang's best picture, I can think of few directors who made such a smooth transition from silents to talkies, and sadly this was his penultimate German picture before the Nazis took over. There's no denying that Lang was wasted in Hollywood. He did his best to understand it, but by and large it never understood him. I say by and large; the renowned Irving Thalberg was reportedly bowled over by M, and screened it to many of his writers and directors as inspirational material. Had that prestigious and influential producer not died in 1936, the same year Lang began working in Hollywood, would things have turned out differently, I wonder?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lorre's Little Secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the elongated opening scene of "M", you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine. The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return, as we, audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle. It is foreboding, it is depressing, it is mesmerizing. It has been a very long time since a film, especially one made 78 years ago, seemed so delicate, so thought provoking, so timeless as "M" does. From these opening shots, Lang let's us know that this isn't going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops, but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window. With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty, Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred, where good and evil are similar, and a man defines his actions as "uncontrollable". This merely scratches the surface of "M", a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offered.What makes "M" shoot ahead of anything modern, anything by cult directors, anything close to popular? It begins with the actors, goes to the man behind the camera, and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story. Each of these elements never lack, never fall behind, and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch. To begin, Peter Lorre. How could you not talk about "M" without mentioning this doe-eyed murderer. From the beginning, we know his role in this film, yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route. We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried, we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic, we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children - and yet, he isn't the only character in this film. Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout. The infamous Inspector Lohmann (not to mention that great floor-up shot) is the perfect example of Lang's impressions on the local German police. The fact that Lohmann whistles, counter productive to what Lorre represents, only solidifies that idea. To add to these already dynamic people, we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence. The "Safecracker" is idealistic of what Germany was to become, the classic SS look, with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law. Each one of these characters provide humor, excitement, and full-blown emotion to the screen, adding to the overall impact to this film. With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion, it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits, angles, and direction doesn't hinder the power of his actors. Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avant-garde film making. I use the words avant-garde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond 1931. Lang incorporates powerful close-ups, amazing track following, and shots nearly unseen at this time. The overhead shots, the ability to make the crowds look ravenous, the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would. If you were impressed by his ability in "Metropolis", "M" is only going to solidify that idea of Lang. A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals. Every shot, every detail is directed with ease, but complexity. It is easy to be in awe of this film, but to take the time to see Lang's ability behind the camera will take "M" to a whole new level. Personally, it is my belief, that he announces himself with this film. A pioneer of the camera, a grandfather of what cinema is today - one cannot watch anything released today and not see Lang's influences. See Fincher's "Zodiac", a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce here.Finally, we have acting and direction, but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original, but for supporting a strong message. The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being 1931, a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry. The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail, that suburbia is always safe, and that the police actually do keep the streets safe. The story of "M" challenges you as a viewer even today, one could argue even more so today than in 1931. With crimes continually on the rise in this country, with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder (or is an easy innocence) the idea of "M", especially that final dialogue seems more important today. The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story - the horror that simple events, kindness even, could turn on anyone in a moment of panic. Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way - a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop. Imagine if this film were made two years later, what a different theme Lang would have tackled.A deeply enticing film, Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field. Not only could he handle Science Fiction, but nearly every other genre imaginable. "M" is no exception to his skill. If you have not seen this film, watch it - experience it - know what it means to be marked like Lorre. Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though it was made in the 1930s this film is actually very good. It is very exciting and even though some parts look rubbish and it is spoken in FOREIGN you will ignore that and enjoy it.I can say with conviction that this is a film all about the cops hunting for a child killer, which is where the film gets its short title. He is a man who kills children (which is horrible), not a killer who is a child. He is so mean that even the local criminals gang up on him and they want to catch him too. But you must feel no sadness for the man, even though he is hated by everyone. It's not that kind of film.This movie has some really cool parts that I didn't even know they could do back in those old times, like nice camera moves and cursing. The killer even screams like a pig at the end! This film is very good and if you see it you will like it without any nefarious reservations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The interesting thing about M is not that it was Lang's first film with sound, but that he was able to use sound so effectively with no prior experience with it. Rather than just adding another layer to the visuals, sound is often completely divorced from the visuals, creating two distinct elements working in concert. Another thing that marks M is its' subject matter, which was many years ahead of it's time and influenced countless other films while making Fritz Lang an enemy of the Nazi party.From the very beginning of the film, characters are heard before they are ever seen. We hear children playing and singing a violent nursery rhyme as they camera tilts down to reveal them on an eerie downward angle. Hearing the voices off screen, and without music makes for a haunting, almost ghostly screen presence that Lang will use again and again throughout the film, particularly with the killer Beckert.Borrowing a technique from opera known as Leitmotif, Lang first introduces Beckert by having us hear his whistling "Hall of the Mountain King" off screen, then representing him as a shadow on a wanted poster. From this moment on we understand that when we hear this tune, the killer is prowling. In fact, this is how the blind balloon seller recognizes Beckert in the end.One particularly memorable scene occurs shortly after the first child is abducted, when the child's frantic mother calls out for her repeatedly, with increased panic as we are shown several dark, empty scenes culminating in a small, childlike balloon figure caught in power lines before coming free and silently floating away.Almost as important as the technique used in this film is it's content. While much of our entertainment today involves psychotics and dark, violent stories, it goes without saying that in the late 20's and early 30's, the subject matter of film was somewhat tamer. M received heavy criticism from the Nazi party not for this however, but for the scenes in which the narrative switches back and forth between the police and the criminal element as they both discuss ways in which to catch the dangerous serial killer. This, along with the fact that the criminals beat the police to Beckert, supposedly degrades law enforcement by showing it as incompetent, although this is debatable, as the police would have caught Beckert soon anyway.There are also undercurrents of socialism in the film, which undoubtedly made the Nazis a little nervous. The criminals talk of pooling their money and using it to support the families of members temporarily incarcerated. At one point a policeman even says, "each individual is responsible for what happens to the poorest child on the streets". At another time someone is heard to lament the effects of fear on a desperate population, " there's no privacy anymore". For a government built on fear after the Reichstag fire, this might have been seen as sly criticism.Impressive films wisely use new technology in ways that push the boundaries of film. Classic films use bedrock principals of good storytelling to keep our interest and stay relevant even many years after their creations. While it's not often that a film can combine both of these elements to create a truly great film, Fritz Lang's M definitely qualifies. This is a groundbreaking film with a potent message that touches on debates about the nature of criminality and the ultimate responsibilities for actions. Debates that are still occurring more than 70 years after this films release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's second absolute landmark (after the equally brilliant but completely different 'Metropolis') and also his first opportunity to work with the wonders of sound. And boy, did he ever deliver a great piece of work! Like the M (for murderer) is marked on Peter Lorre's coat, the film M (for masterpiece) is branded on cinema history annals for all eternity. Lang's film is a triumph in every possible viewpoint and it covers a lot more genres and elements than just simply the manhunt for a child-molester.*** SPOILERS ****The horrors 'M' handles about is timeless and of all cultures, but yet it'll always remain a taboo subject and for that reason alone Fritz Lang deserves extra praising. In an utterly astonishing way, Peter Lorre portrays Hans Beckert, a child murderer who single-handedly terrorizes four and half million people simply by his uncontrollable urge to kidnap and molest young schoolgirls. The grim and haunting atmosphere is terrifically built up by images of previous Beckert-victims and the disappearance a new unfortunate girl. Her toy rolling of a remote hills...a balloon drifting away on the wind. Really simple but extremely efficient methods to reflect the ominous actions that just took place. Other than to focus on the further actions of the killer, Lang turns to the effect this terror has on the city and how the manhunt for Beckert develops. Our director is obviously fascinated by how a police procedure is organized and he serves the viewer a detailed overview of all the steps taken by the investigators. Meanwhile, he grabs the opportunity to forcefully criticize the media's influence and the German law system with both hands. I'd really like to stress that Lang's subtle mockery was a really risky thing to do with the upcoming Nazi-reign, so you can't admire him enough. Due to the constant (and fruitless) raids the police are holding in the hope to capture the killer, the criminal underworld begins to lose its profits as well and they start their own manhunt for the killer, assisted by whores, beggars and petty thieves. With the carefully observing eyes all over town, it becomes practically impossible for Becker to satisfy his monstrous needs. The almighty Peter Lorre arrives late in the film every moment he's on screen is a moment worth treasuring. His sad appearance and cruel testimony are sequences that leave no human being unmoved. Lorre is a brilliant actor and this is inarguably one of the most impressive performances of all time. 'M' features constant tension, outstanding dialogue and stunning camera-work. As said before, Fritz Lang had the opportunity to work with sound for this film and he immediately makes the most out of this. This was the first 'big' German production that featured sound and it STILL ranks as the title that made best use of it...and that sure means something after more than 70 years. There's the chilling and legendary tune Lorre constantly whistles but also the absence of sound Lang uses to portray the besieged city. As you can tell from the above review, 'M' is absolute must-see and easily one of the most essential productions ever shot. It's light-years ahead of its time and still disturbing after all these years. This film is a mesmerizing portrait about the darkest, most alarming aspects of humanity and yet still it doesn't live up to real-life facts. As you probably know, the plot of 'M' is based on the whereabouts of the serial killer Peter Kürten who brutally murdered many victims in the city of Düsseldorf. I read a biography on Kürten recently and the true details of his crimes and animal-lusts go beyond every filmmaker's wildest imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we're going to talk about hyper realistic film making let's forget about the likes of Peter Watkin's , Mike leigh Ken Loach etc and talk about Frizt lang's M . I kept forgetting this was a feature film and consciously thought I was watching a 1931 German documentary featuring a serial child killer . Seriously I did . All throughout the running time we cut to concerned parents , policemen who have no leads and criminals who are falling over themselves wanting the child killer to be caught . And it should be pointed out that this is where the realism lies - the criminals have ulterior motives because the police search means the gangs can't operate their wares due to the heavy police presence . Something similar happened during the troubles in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 80s when loyalist terror groups found they couldn't operate extortion rackets and robberies and drug dealing because their more extreme death squads carrying out secterian murders attracted too much attention from the RUC , so they eliminated them . Be very wary of criminals who take the moral high ground because there's no honour amongst thieves Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert doesn't appear in the movie until well after the halfway mark of the running time though his sickening shadow does hang over the film throughout . It's by no bad thing lorre's appearance is held back because after later emigrating to Hollywood the illusion is somewhat shattered when he finally does appear on screen and you only then realise you're watching a feature film and not a fly on the wall documentary , but as I said Lorre's bone chilling performance hangs over the entire film and Hans Beckert is one of the most disgustingly memorable villains from 20th century cinema If I have a problem watching M today it has nothing to do with the way it was originally made , it's all to do with the modern day presentation where there's no black background to the subtitles which means it's very difficult to read the white letters on the faded film print . I hope to see someone to a fully restored version where someone has taken the time and trouble to make the captions/subtitles easier to read</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that is devoid of anything pleasant. For a film made in 1931 it certainly took a risk. The plot is about a disturbed man who kills little children. Now you can probably understand the meaning of the first sentence. The police look restlessly for the man but are unsuccessful. After no luck other criminals decide to hunt him down as well. It sounds very much like a precursor to Jean Pierre-Melville's Le Samourai(1967) which is another excellent classic foreign film. My favorite part of the film is at the end at a trial staged by the criminals in which everyone jeers at the killer who says he can't help what he does. I think the film is suspenseful, dramatic, horrifying, atmospheric, and even hateful almost. Yet it is a classic. God bless every despicable frame of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The content of this movie is extremely hard to stomach, even today. It is also filmed in German, so one has to frequently pause it to read the subtitles. After 80+ years - with even more nut-cases running around society, this movie really hits home. Peter Lorre is as sinister as it gets, and really makes himself the most vile villain known to movie audiences up until that time. Fritz Lang was way ahead of his time, and this movie essentially brought him to Hollywood, along with Peter Lorre. The movie also addresses the same, timeless issue we are still dealing with today, in stark reality - child abductors, murderers, and pedophiles, with such complete frankness, that it would rival a current amber alert story. One of the top 100 films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's Finest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An expertly written &amp; masterfully executed example of genre-filmmaking that was far ahead of its time back when it was released and which even today is counted amongst the greatest &amp; most influential works of world cinema, Fritz Lang's M is an intriguing character study that paints an interesting portrait of a serial killer &amp; is a biting criticism of a negligent society as well.The story of M concerns a serial killer who preys on children &amp; presents an underworld society whose usual business is disrupted due to the everyday raids carried out by the police to apprehend the killer-on-loose. Driven by police's continued failure &amp; increasing losses in their business, the criminal bosses ultimately decide to take matters in their own hands &amp; try to capture the killer all by themselves.Directed by Fritz Lang, this is the film that the esteemed director called his finest &amp; it's not really difficult to see why. The screenplay &amp; direction brims with creativity, the suspense is wonderfully created &amp; utilized, black-n-white photography is crisp &amp; inventive, editing never lets the story settle down, score &amp; sound effects work in seamless harmony, and Peter Lorre steals the show with a highly compelling performance.On an overall scale, M is a cinematic treasure that has innovation written all over it. Whether it's the narrative style, leitmotifs, camera angles, sound mixing, symbolism or expressions, the contribution this German classic has made in the world of filmmaking is groundbreaking. A thought-provoking &amp; well-researched study into the mind of a disturbed character, M is a strong meditation on the morals of right &amp; wrong, that has a lot to say about our very own society.Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listen here: http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.htmlA colleague of mine recently asked about 'that film that used to be on with Peter Lore'. I instantly replied 'M'; it wasn't some smug retort to show how film literate I was it, was because of the simple fact M is not shown on television anymore. Why? Well I dare say the answer may have something to do with the fact that despite being made in 1931 it is as shocking today as it was upon its original release. Indeed, M is one of the rare films to never lose its relevancy, to never cease asking the type of questions that society chooses to ignore.Fritz Lang didn't just make a film about a serial killer and a police investigation designed to thrill audiences, he made a film that probed areas of psychology and the world we live that wasn't just native to the films country Germany; but one that transcends national boundaries and more worryingly time.In this episode we delve into M share our thoughts on what makes it such an important addition to the Masters of Cinema collection.http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Lorre's star-making film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Lorre stars in "M," a 1931 German Expressionist film directed by Fritz Lang.I saw a restored version of this film -- apparently over the years it has been being pieced together when new sections are found. This ran 111 minutes.Lorre plays a child murderer (and probably molester, though that isn't stated) who is terrorizing a town in Germany and writing to the police and to the press.Believe it or not, with such a serious and daring subject, the film actually has some humor. When the police can't get the murderer, a group of burglars, angry at all the extra security and difficulties the murderer has caused them, decide they have to get him themselves. They round up beggars, who are everywhere and not noticed, and the burglars watch them. Each person is responsible for a section of the city.The acting is marvelous. Lorre is magnificent as a pathetic man who has a compulsion to kill. The other actors are wonderful as well. Due to the difference in acting styles today, the audience laughed in a couple of places that were not meant to be laughed at. That's understandable.The film has sections which are completely silent, with no music.The end of the film is a little abrupt, but nevertheless effective.This is a true masterpiece from the hand of Fritz Lang, who also co-wrote the script. The print was excellent as well, and the film is in German with English subtitles.It was important to see the newly found pieces of the film, though I'm not sure how much it added.Definitely a film to see with Peter Lorre's great performance that made him a star.</fullReview>

Written by Lang and wife Thea von Harbou, M boosted Lorre's career.Lang was stroke by Lorre when he first saw him on Berlin's stage in "Engineers in Ingolstadt" a play where he portrayed a confused adolescent. Fritz Lang naturally thought of him while writing M, his childish look would perfectly matches Hans Beckert the main character.Lang said that one of the reasons he chose twenty six years old Lorre was because he fit this story, set in the everyday life of Weimar- era Berlin, depicting ordinary citizens, criminals, and police and forensics experts at work. He just looked like a real, everyday person. Despite his bug-eyed and purring voice, Lorre's baby- faced child-killer role catapulted him to international fame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Crime Drama, Years Before The Genre Took Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A serial killer who favors children (Peter Lorre) is on the loose in Berlin. He is wanted by the police. But, even worse for him, he is wanted by the Berlin underworld, who have been targeted falsely by the police for being involved. Watch out, child killer! There is nothing bad I can say about this film. The acting, the directing, the sound... all perfect. Many have praised Lang for his use of sound at a time when the practice was just coming into play. And rightfully so. Whereas other films have sound matching what is on the screen, Lang realized he could use the effect to signify what he was not showing, including the murderer (who has a distinctive whistle). Brilliant. Not to mention that one key role is a blind beggar... a man who cannot appreciate visuals, but only sounds... he is appropriately the man who can identify the killer! Basing the story loosely off of child-murderers of the day (Grossman, Haarman and Peter Kürten) this is one of the darkest tales set to film up to this point. There is no blood, and no children are actually seen killed. And the killer is relatively reserved compared to his real-life counterparts, who were also rapists and cannibals. He presents an interesting defense: his crimes are less wrong than the crimes of others because he cannot psychologically control himself. Or, in modern terms, not guilty by reason of mental defect. Is a child killer less evil than a pickpocket? Is he in some way also a victim?I enjoyed the idea of a unionized underworld. I do not know the reality of this, as it seemed sort of comic and anticipated such villainous team-ups as we might see in comic books. But crime was certainly not unheard of, and even "black market meat" existed... and I am not sure if I really want to know what that means.Many, including reviewer Stanley Kauffmann, have noticed the similarity between "M" and Bertolt Brecht's "Threepenny Opera". Sadly, I have not seen Brecht's work and cannot comment on the comparison. German philosopher Theodor Lessing, best known for his work on Jewish self-hatred, may even have been an inspiration, due to his work on Haarmann. But regardless of inspiration, Lang is the master here... his work stands the test of time and today, almost a century later, is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements on film. At the least, many consider it the all-time greatest German film. And rightfully so.There are so many great shots, including the so-called "inventory" shot of the criminal underworld's wares. Lang also excelled with the camera angles, using knives as frames and getting more than one great mirror shot. (I should also give credit to cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner, who previously worked on "Nosferatu" and many others -- his reputation should be second only to Karl Freund.)There is nothing that beats the Criterion release with commentary, short films and more. I watched the film this way on DVD. Perhaps a Blu-ray release has even more, but I would not even know what could be added. This disc is packed and a must-own for any film historian or Lang fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking crime drama, with a standout performance by Peter Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can totally recognize how influential and ahead of its time Fritz Lang's M was, but I wasn't that impressed for the most part of the film unfortunately. First of all, the camera work is simply outstanding, having plenty of overhead shots as well as innovative techniques. I was quite surprised by how deep the story got in the last 15 minutes of the film, which led to a very powerful ending. The most interesting aspect here is the presence of a strong social criticism, demonstrated in the final discussions. Also, Peter Lorre was absolutely brilliant as Hans Beckert, the serial killer who murders children, making us believe how his heinous acts of violence are driven by this extreme compulsion within him. Now there are some things that bothered me. I felt the investigation scenes were too expository and overly stretched, making the film a little bloated. In addition, many scenes seemed to be sped up so that annoyed me a bit as they looked pretty unnatural. Finally, I didn't find any of the characters, apart from Hans Beckert, to be very interesting so that made it harder to get really engaged with the story sometimes. Overall, M is undoubtedly a revolutionary film and its ending was truly brilliant, but it had its bumps along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people have said a lot about this film so I don't really know that I can add that much. However, this is a truly great film and without a doubt an influential classic.Although the basic story may seem rather tired and common now, people must remember that for 1931 this was a fresh and potent plot. It is thus even a fairly groundbreaking film on that point alone and viewers must keep this in mind when watching it. Moreover, it is handled so well that even today, the film remains very interesting, compelling, and entertaining. It is also fun to see how so many of the basic methods of police/investigative work seen in recent movies are essentially derivatives of the ideas and methods touched on in this much earlier film.The same is true about the whole idea of the serial killer and exploring his psyche, determining whether he is "insane" or just evil. The film addresses this issue well and one can feel the conflict and stress in Lorre's character even long before the finale in the abandoned brewery.The film wonderfully builds tension in the characters and their circumstances. Again, this is, naturally, particularly strong with Lorre, such as when he is hiding in the office building.In addition, the film does much more than deal with an effort to catch a killer, but explores society and the killer's impact on it. It is a brilliant, and even for today very unusual, idea to have the criminals organize to catch the killer. Their motive makes sense and their reaction in handling the situation in the office building and brewery is believable, very entertaining and dramatic, and allows significant commentary on society, how people should act, the meaning of the rule of law, and more. The same is true for the mob hysteria that seems to grip the city during the murders. Thus, this film is about much more than the need to catch the killer, making the story much more rich, meaningful, and enduring.The use of sound, lighting, and shadows, as well as using commonalities to tie scenes together, etc. is very artistic and effective, in addition to being imaginative, particularly for the time. Others have mentioned it before, but a great example that I love is the fact that we first see Lorre's shadow appear on his own wanted poster and hear him speak before we ever see him. This particularly helps build a sinister sense of foreboding about his appearance.Anyway, this is a true classic that is so beautifully handled, it is still highly entertaining and satisfying to watch even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Germany, Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) is an unknown killer of girls. He whistles Edvard Grieg's 'In The Hall of the Mountain King', from the 'Peer Gynt' Suite I Op. 46 while attracting the little girls for death. The police force pressed by the Minister gives its best effort trying unsuccessfully to arrest the serial killer. The organized crime has great losses due to the intense search of the police and decides to chase the murderer, with the support of the beggars association. They catch Hans and judge him, in an impressive scene. This movie is another spectacular masterpiece of Fritz Lang. The story is timeless: I saw it today for the first time, and although being a 1931 movie, the theme is very updated. Peter Lorre has an outstanding performance in the role of a man who can not control his dark impulses of killing. I just regret the quality of the VHS released in Brazil. I tried to see this movie in an expensive VHS released by the Brazilian distributor Continental, but it is a shame. In many scenes, it is almost impossible to read the white subtitles in Portuguese. In the end, I saw it in a VHS released in Brazil by Altaya, which had English subtitles, and a large stripe with the yellow subtitles in a terrible and full of mistakes Portuguese and covering a great part of the screen over the English subtitles. Unfortunately this type of lack of respect of some distributors happens in my country with movie lovers. The greatest problem is that we do not have other alternative. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'M., O Vampiro de Düsseldorf' ('M., The Vampire of Düsseldorf')</fullReview>

I watched the original German not realizing at first that they made an English version and that it was included on the BluRay. The subtitles were good but its difficult sometimes for someone like myself who likes to appreciate the visual artistry of a film (framing, lighting, acting etc). So when I noticed that the Blu-Ray included the English version I decided to watch it again. Big mistake! You'll notice right away that the film isn't as good. Most of the English version is just dubbed over but some scenes were actually shot in English. You'd think it would be the same basic film but it wasn't. They edited it differently. Some scenes were cut short. Other shots were left out completely, or changed. The scenes shot in English were noticeable not as good and its thought that the Fritz Lang didn't direct the English parts. In summary, only watch this film in German.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this the first movie about a child murderer? I guess so. This movie certainly quite some good stuff going for. It is unconventional in the sense that we do not really have a main character. Well you could call the murderer the main character but he doesn't have that awful much of screening time. OK the best about the movie is that we have the mob and the beggars who join forces to catch the murderer, hoping to succeed where the police have failed this far. The shock and hysteria it causes among the people is believable for the time. People suspect and accuse each other, are suspicious when an adult is friendly towards a child. However this also results in long dialogs and shouting at each other which did tedious at times. It's rather odd that no one ever remembered anything while the murderer operated in broad daylight on the streets and was not actually secretive whistling "King of the Mountain Hall" tune constantly. Good performance from peter Lorre. Yes the chasing scene at the bank was exciting even if a bit overdue. The court scene was interesting but I didn't like the way how the murderer tried to be empathic. A big minus point to me was that the mystery surrounding the murderer was quickly gone for me as viewer as he came into full view pretty early in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bone chilling masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many love detective stories. We love trying to figure out who did it. I am a lover of detective stories and cannot wait to finally see Se7en. However, do I really need to see it? It is already clear that I will never see a murder mystery movie as chilling, menacing, borderline harrowing as Fritz Lang's masterpiece 'M'. The plot concerns a child murderer on the loose in Berlin. Both the police and the criminal underworld hunt for him. Trying to find a more haunting detective story than M is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Every single frame is meticulously composed and oozes with suspense, menace and terror. Reflections and symbols are used brilliantly. The lighting is hauntingly atmospheric. Visually, the film is a total masterclass. The film's decision not to have a clear protagonist and to observe the action from an objective viewpoint may seem detached to some, but ultimately it makes the film feel more real and if even possible even more disturbing than it already is.Peter Lorre seems to be known for comedic roles prior to M, but you would never have guessed. He creates a chilling villain but ingeniously creates a bizarre sympathy for the murderer, and the film has some very sharp social commentary. The script is extremely well written and the story is handled and told very well to maximise impact. M is a very tense and frightening film and will give you goose-bumps. Maybe the best German film of all time, it's unlikely this will ever be topped by other murder mystery films. This one is a must for fans of world cinema. Also recommended is Fritz Lang's Metropolis, which is a bit too long but still extraordinary and influential. In general, M is for masterpiece and it's one of the best movies I watched all year. It's not the easiest watch, but it is well worth the effort. It's also notable for making the sound of Peter Lorre whistling a tune as menacing as the Jaws theme.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang was one of those remarkable directors who not only gracefully transitioned from work on silent films into the world of talkies, but also continued to develop styles and techniques that would become mainstays in the years to come. The difference between M and one of his earlier silent films, such as Metropolis, is striking. While the latter compensated for technical limitations with heavy acting and visually appealing sets, the former was driven by comparatively rich dialogue and developed its plot in a way that might seem familiar and appealing even to modern audiences. Lang used the recent addition of a soundtrack to great effect leading up to the climax as the killer, played by Peter Lorre, came to be identified with a particular whistled tune. Lorre's desperate plea for clemency would have been difficult or impossible to capture using intertitles and hand gestures, but Lang made it one of the most powerful and memorable scenes in his first talkie. This new technology allowed Lang to develop an entire cast of characters whose machinations and quirks made this movie unforgettable.</fullReview>

Fritz Lang, who was one of the most versatile directors adds his mark to this. Lorre is terrific in his role, whistling "In the Hall of the Mountain King," slinking around. That voice. That persona. It is also about the people who pursue him. One thinks immediately of Hitchcock's "The Lodger" (the first one) where the blood lust takes the place of reason and vigilantism rears its ugly head. We are led on a chase here and the close ups and the editing are masterful. Some would put this in a top ten (if they had actually seen it). It says, "Don't go out at night in the fog." The atmosphere is as responsible for the success of this as any facet of the portrayal of the sick soul that is Lorre.</fullReview>

His best sound film and second best film overall, behind only the silent sci-fi masterpiece Metropolis. The cast is terrific. Peter Lorre is amazing in this, which put him on the map. The direction, the cinematography, the angles, the lighting, the dark atmosphere all help to create this visually arresting film. It's a classic in every sense.

		<fullReview>***User reviewer EThompsonUMD ("Influential and unforgettable masterpiece", EThompsonUMD from Massachusetts, 31 March 2006) has a great summary. Also, rxcdr has very interesting insights ("M a few thoughts", rxcdr, 28 March 2003).***"M" (Fritz Lang, 1931) is master class. It is an expressionist, suspenseful study of individual vs. collective perversion. There are three storytelling techniques you might not see anywhere else: Scenes utterly without sound, no musical score and all violence withheld from view. (The latter point may be surprising to contemporary audiences accustomed to paying to witness modern kill-a-thons.) Lang always wanted the violence in his films to be implied. In "M", he winds down the extremely suspenseful opening and conveys the tragic death of young Elsie (Inge Landgut) without showing any part of her demise. Instead, he cuts to a familiar plastic ball bouncing on patchy-grass (without its owner) followed by an balloon (that resembles a phallus) floating near telephone lines. Lang's meaning is unmistakable: The serial child murderer (Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert) first raped and then killed her. The audience is aware of the magnitude of the crime but is not too emotionally taxed to miss what will follow. There is a twist coming. Because the police (of an unnamed German city of 4.5 million) investigation is shown with painstaking detail, it seems as if they will remain the focus of the story. However, as the PD fail to make any progress in the case they begin to harass criminal elements (e.g. thieves and prostitutes) while restricting everyone's civil liberties. We are then introduced to a particular gang of hard-core bank robbers who are led by an imposing man named "Safecracker" (Gustaf Gründgens, who resembles the classic handsome SS man seen in other films.). To get the police off their backs, Safecracker chillingly insists to his associates that they must "exterminate" the child killer themselves. Safecracker's gang will eventually infiltrate a secure office building and apprehend Beckert in a way that resembles a coup d'etat.There appear to be very obvious historical parallels with the psychopathic Safecracker (and the mob he is inciting) with the rising National Socialist party led by Adolf Hitler. ("M" was released only two years before Hitler became Chancellor of Germany). As the bank robbers and assorted thieves, prostitutes and beggars assume the climatic kangaroo court, Lang is depicting the horror of sadistic criminals assuming control of government. (BTW, it is believed that Lang did not author the final scene, which weakens the anti-authoritarian message. Also, it is worth noting that Fritz Lang and Peter Lorre were both considered anti-Fascist and fled Germany. Apparently, Joseph Goebbels himself warned Lang it was time to go.)Without revealing too many details of the climatic scene, Beckert's pleading to the court (that he can't help himself around underage girls) is contrasted with the pitiless voices that are willingly becoming Safecracker's mob. The depiction of a society nearing its own collapse is being made with extraordinary sophistication. (Lorre is outstanding throughout, but especially at the finish.)"M" has some strange moments, such as a 30-second, floor-level view (looking up) at a male policeman's crotch. Then there is the abundance of tobacco: Every male smokes cigars like chimneys; some use contraptions that are rather unsightly; while beggars eagerly organize their collections of butts recovered who-knows-where. (Let's not forget this was from 1931, so of course the scenes unfold with the pacing of that era.)The terror-repression-Fascism path in "M" resonates with present-day events. Cinephiles are encouraged to bounce their plastic balls in the direction of the revival theater that is screening it to see Fritz Lang's masterpiece, "M".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"M" is an incredible masterpiece. It's cliché to say something is a head of it's time but "M" is. This films excellence did not surprise me when I first watched it knowing it came from the visionary Fritz Lang. Usually when we think of serial killer films we think of a cop and a killer fighting and the cop eventually finding the killer, but in "M" you also have other criminals and even townspeople searching for the madman. It's incredible script, cinematography and Peter Lorre's performance inspired many films of this genre but you can see that not film can match the wonderfully exiting, suspenseful and overall genius "M".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens with couple of children playing in front of an apartment, and a mother setting table for lunch for her daughter, yet to return from school. Everything seems normal and that's when the spine chilling felonious character surfaces. We immediately learn that, there is a child murderer in the town and has already slay ed 8 children and the girl whose mother is waiting for lunch is the ninth victim. The town becomes unrest about the untamed psychopath, still at large. The Police in desperation start raiding every corner of the town. The sudden surge in Police activity is a bad news for local gangsters and crime syndicates, as these raids disturb their business. The bad guys of underworld arrange a clandestine meet to decide how to get rid of Police raids. Only way they find is to catch the pathological child killer, the police looking for. The syndicate puts every beggar in the town on the man hunt. Each street will be monitored by a beggar and he'll keep an eye on the every girl child in the street until she goes in to home or school or passes to the next street. The effort pays off. A blind man selling balloons, hears a man passing by whistling and he suddenly recalls that the tune was same from a man who purchased a balloon for school girl few weeks ago, and the same day the girl went missing. The killer already has tenth victim with him, lured by a candy. The vendor quickly alerts nearest beggar, and the beggar, in order to not to lose the murderer in the crowd, pretends to slip and clutches the killer for support and transfers onto the back on his shoulder a big 'M' that he previously chalked on his palm. The murderer is caught and is bought to a remote warehouse to face trial. The trial is conducted by the parents of the victims, beggars and the underworld syndicate who hatched the plan. The murderer kind of defends his actions complaining that he is driven by these uncontrollable evil urges and blames his mental condition for his actions and pleads, others do not understand what he is going through. Just when the jury is about to declare verdict, police arrive and take him into custody. The real trial begins as the movie ends with a mother saying ' no sentence would bring back the dead children, and One has to keep closer watch over the children." The screen goes black as she adds, "All of you'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overlong for sure and with a rather abrupt ending, this remarkably suspense filled film, is quite spellbinding at points, able to view several facets of society and interweave a number of stories with great clarity.Peter Lorre gives an impassioned performance, playing a servile and repugnant child murderer, before finally giving a powerful speech rebuking his captors and supplying an emotional and sympathetic statement on his plight. His performance is so good, we understand his problems, and any murderous intent we once had is quickly drained.As an essay on justice, and its motivations, the film weaves in its themes with great skill, the director able to juggle, drama, suspense, and a very real message with remarkable impact.The cinematography is amazing, able to tell a story with its powerful image easily: a strong visual drama. And the directors ability to illuminate the room and create emotion with his images is also very good, creating a paranoid or claustrophobic atmosphere with ease. Music is used sparingly, and the taut silence of chases, is particularly good. The editing is amazing for a film of this age, and create good tense storytelling with both complexity and clarity.The film lags a little in places, and could be tightened up all round, to create a taut, powerful thriller. But otherwise it is strong all round, with great images, performances, and production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Extremely well-crafted and powerful drama that could spring from the pages of today's newspapers. Fritz Lang poignantly captures the vulnerability of the sweets-loving child victim and the mother pathetically waiting for her daughter to return home from school. We see cops feeling the heat from a horrified public and the bumbling incompetence within their ranks. We also see the well-organized thugs who beat the police at their own game -- not because they like kids but because the murders are costing them profits. Speaking of poignancy, we don't feel any when the predator is finally cornered like a trapped rat. He can't help himself...he must suffer from his inexorable compulsion. Awwww... The Peter Lorre character's judges aren't moved, either. And while the stony, moralistic justice of the cons' court comes as a refreshing surprise, one recoils with the realization that this was filmed within years of the rise of the ultimate rogue tribunal -- the Nazis, who also appointed themselves executioner. Lorre excels here but has surprisingly little screen time. I haven't seen much of his work elsewhere but it's hard to imagine his surpassing this performance. Truly memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"M" still remains at the top of my list, as the best film I have ever seen.To think that Fritz Lang had never used sound in any of his previous films, makes one marvel at his deft use of the 'voice', which often continues where the actors do not.The 'texture' of the film is created by the ever so real and vivid characters; real Berliners, that embody the very soul of that city at that time. You have the sensation of being there, sitting at the table with these characters and eating a 'Wurst' and having a beer. You not only get to know them, but actually feel like you want to know them. It's a form of cinematic surrogate love. You want to be, and are, a part of the experience and events.Experiencing this film once again, tonight, at the Film Museum in Vienna, I feel satiated, fed with art at it's highest form. I thank all artists who make me not only 'attentive' to the world around me, but are able to captivate me body and soul with their work.Thank you Fritz Lang,A masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Germany's Best film? I think not, but then again this is my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to look for this because I heard that it was Germany's best film. To be truly honest I prefer the German War films I have seen (with the exception of Downfall, I'm sorry but I hated the effect that movie had on me), so I then bought it because I thought it would be worth buying... It is worth it but not as much as others like Das Boot or Stalingrad (Stalingrad IS my favourite German film).The plot is that a child murderer, when killing his 8th victim causes more tension in the town than the viewer would have watching The Thing. He writes a letter to the newspaper saying he is not going to stop (which to me is kind of a dumb move if your causing that much tension in the town). Cops then decide to raid every house and every business within the town. A group decide to get together and find this murderer themselves because it would ruin business.As far as films go this one does have reason to be a classic, I did expect more than what I got (No offense to readers but with older films I get that very often, but not that often in foreign classics) the actor playing the child murderer is the best performance out of the whole thing.So all in all this is worth a shot but it is not what everybody says.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M is a German drama-thriller directed by Fritz Lang and written by Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou. It was Lang's first sound film, although he had directed more than a dozen films previously.The film has become a classic which Lang himself considered his finest work.Fritz Lang's classic early talkie crime melodrama is set in 1931 Berlin. The police are anxious to capture an elusive child murderer, and they begin rounding up every criminal in town. The underworld leaders decide to take the heat off their activities by catching the child killer themselves. Once the killer is fingered, he is marked with the letter "M" chalked on his back. He is tracked down and captured by the combined forces of the Berlin criminal community, who put him on trial for his life in a kangaroo court. The killer pleads for mercy, whining that he can't control his homicidal instincts. The police close in and rescue the killer from the underworld so that he can stand trial again in "respectable" circumstances. Some prints of the film end with a caution to the audience to watch after their children more carefully. Filmed in Germany, M was the film that solidified Fritz Lang's reputation with American audiences, and it also made a star out of Peter Lorre. The moral issues are complex and deftly handled: Lorre is at once entirely innocent and absolutely evil. Lang's detached, modified expressionist style gives the action a plastic beauty.It can also be classified as an extraordinary, good, impressive and strong talker.And most of all,it is a landmark psychological thriller with arresting images, deep thoughts on modern society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M for Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A child-murderer is on the loose, terrorizing a German city of 4.5 million people. The police's failure to capture him is driving the city into chaos; mobs appear to interrogate anyone who looks in the least bit suspicious. Public outrage encourages police to step up their game against criminals everywhere, disrupting their activities. These underground organizations become so desperate that they themselves decide to lead their own investigation against the killer. Yes, I know,the premise is pretty ridiculous; it is very unlikely that a single killer, no matter successful, would be able to make this much noise, but the above paragraph describes the film's only flaw. M is a masterpiece of the thriller genre, and currently my favorite film of the 1930's. M's greatest strength is its pacing. In M, there are no subplots, no pointless romances, and no distractions. The result is a steady-paced and very focused film (the focus being the investigation(s) itself and eventually its aftermath). Of course, by today's Hollywoodien standards it would be seen as rather slow, but my own opinion is that Hollywood is perhaps just a little bit too fast.But I suspect that even to a viewer who has never seen a movie made before 1980 would be able to hold their attention through this one without a problem. There are only really two character in this film: the killer (Peter Lorre) and the public. I say the public because none of the characters besides the killer are truly developed. Instead, what we get is a mob of people who belong to different factions of society (the law, the general public, and the criminals) but who all share the same opinion: this murderer is a monster that needs to be dealt with. As a result, the only great performance is Peter Lorre's. But what a performance it is! Lorre's character is only on-screen in the last third of the film, and has only one scene of important dialog, but in that short amount of time Lorre leaves one hell of an impression. The film climaxes with his assertion that he "can't help it!" while he looks on at his accusers, wide-eyed, scared, and deranged. It is in fact his portrayal of a man to be pitied rather than feared that puts his character apart from the psychopaths of more recent cinema. One of the best of the early talkies, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good movie regardless of its language or age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are no "answers" {Fritz Lang}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a piece of cinema history. Fritz Lang, has left an impressive record of his genius and love of the cinematic art form. In this particular work we are taken on a journey of exploration, touching on some of Lang's big themes, {which are often repeated in his cinematic "body of work"}.A perverse,{from a pathological view-point} or evil, {from a moral view- point}, force is at work in a Dusseldorf precinct of 80 years ago. The viewer is led through a beautifully wrought cinematography with insane camera angles {the camera is definitely a player in this movie}, as the fear and paranoia of one of the most heinous forms of criminality is explored. The rape and murder of young girls by a serial killer.Hans Beckett {played by the totally amazing actor Peter Lorre} is wreaking mayhem amongst the population as the townspeople become gripped with a mass hysteria fed by sensationalist broadsheets and the pull and tug of imaginary monsters.The realism {a style pioneered by Lang in this film} is palpable and emphasized by the precise care for detail, that Lang delivers throughout. The tension is cast in a delineated incise clarity with all of the actors being finely portrayed by the master film-maker.Apart from being a great yarn, suspense thriller, chase movie, detective/police drama, bohemian milieu expose, {this movie has something of every possible genre}, there is also the philosophical question of human morality that Lang raises {its ugly head?}.What is to be done about the criminally insane? Are they different from the vocational criminal? In what way are they different? How should their punishment differ? How can society be protected from this category of miscreant? Should they be punished at all? Finally, apart from the aforementioned questions and other related questions, Lang poses the eternal conundrum "What can Mothers do to protect their children from these aberrants and their violent obsessions?" The final solution, Lang offers amounts to the admonition to "look after your children", in other words Lang is saying, "not very much can be done".This is a dense movie, running the gamut of horror, and comedy, a mirror that is shone in your face and ultimately challenging the viewer to ask the primal question "exactly what is it, to be human?".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irving Thalberg assembled his writers and directors for a screening of M and told them that they need to make films like this that are innovative, meaningful and commercially successful. Todays Hollywood studio bosses must make same thing maybe then we can start to see quality dramas and thrillers again.Fritz Lang's M is absolute masterpiece and groundbreaking achievement in cinema. It is definitely one of the most powerful serial killer movies of all time. There aren't many films nowadays that are as creepy and thrilling as M (David Fincher's Zodiac is the one that comes to mind at first). The moment when the killer meets with his next victim Elsie gives a better creeps than any average horror film. And then when Elise's mother gets news that her daughter has been murdered you get that powerless and helpless feeling. Fritz Lang knows how to play with the emotions of the viewers.Peter Lorre is superb and creepy. No wonder people started to think that he was a child molester in real life too. Specially touching is his last speech in front of the self-appointed court where the main "judge" was killer himself. What an irony!M might seem bit slow or outdated (hey, the film is 70 year old, not many film from that era couldn't stand in time that well) for younger people who are used to modern and flashy Hollywood but still, it's a strong movie and must see for every serial killer movie fan because this is the film that started everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's "M" took me by surprise completely! It is one of those amazing motion pictures which holds the audience in their grasp and never lets go. And when it is finally over, it refuses to exit the mind and forces the viewer to constantly think about what he/she has just seen! I wasn't expecting much, but I was more than satisfied when I was finished with this timeless classic. I have watched countless films, but this is one story that is definitely unique. It is one of those films which will leave the viewer in two minds about who to sympathize with..and puts him/her in (for lack of a better expression) a true moral dilemma! Peter Lorre delivers a bravura performance as a child murderer who is the center of this whole drama involving everyone from the police to the families who lose their children to even the underworld! That is pretty much all that can be said about the plot of this gem which has to be seen to be believed.This also happens to be Lang's first talkie film and is probably one of the greatest films ever made about a pathological serial killer.True, due to the era it was released in(1931), it lacks some of the finesse that is used in "creating" a motion picture in today's times. But that hardly mars the overall viewing experience. There are some great movie moments, masterfully shot sequences and nail-biting proceedings in the narrative combined with great display of acting from Peter Lorre, as mentioned earlier, along with some commendable supporting acts from Otto Wernicke as Inspector Lohmann and Gustaf Gründgens as Schränker.Go ahead and rent/buy this and treat yourself to a wholly satisfying movie experience! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very interesting film on so many levels. It's interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time. Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture - Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place - what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding. Compare it with any American film from 1931 and you can't help but see the difference.The murderer, artfully played by Peter Lorre, has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months. The police, despite all of their efforts, are unable to catch him, mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims. At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing. Then, the film shifts to two normally opposed groups - the police and the underworld. After several months of no results by the authorities, the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them, and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killer.In a particularly well-done part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld. They discuss how they are going to catch the killer. The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released. The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group - the beggars - to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer. Both groups focus on the right suspect, the question is - who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics - the death penalty, a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion, and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The mind?blowing panoramic aspect is obvious?Lang was not going to simply shot a police inquiry, but choose one of Berlin's proportions?all, stuffed with procedural elements and realist approach?and, significantly, not flirting with exploitation?Lang does not, despite what folks say, turn 'M' into a chiller. It is Lorre who indulges a bit in _picturesqueness and histrionics?though his performance constitutes of course a great show, the vividly Expressionistic element of this otherwise realist movie. A police procedural at the scale of a mega-city?this puts a conceptual problem, and Lang solved it by alternating his approaches?first, a city?scale survey?then, in the second half, a suspenseful, hugely thrilling urban thriller?and then a few treats in the form of several actors' recitals. Lang aims at scaring and terrifying, delighting, amusing, informing, thrilling his audiences with his procedural epic?a movie that investigates a whole city of Berlin's scale, a tight ordering of the essential elements of the story.The pace of 'M' is constantly excellent, yet the movie looks a bit patchy?changing quite suddenly from the panoramic police procedural to the crisp breathless thriller of the Benno Street operation and then to the several recitals?'Lohmann', 'Franz' (--the arrested thug--), and, of course, Lorre, whose performance is stagy but commending. The organic heterogeneity of 'M' is not perhaps a flaw, yet it somehow comes across as a lack and a partial loss of mastery. But the approach is changed and heterogeneous on even another plane?as visual storytelling?because 'M' becomes, slightly, smoothly, a truly sound movie as it progresses, the storytelling resembles less that of the silent flicks.The general level of the performances is visibly respectable, with the actors using fully their screen?time.'Lohmann', the tough, crushing and imposing cop, is a great role, and there's a long shot of his penis, from under the desk; the scene of the murderer's branding with chalk is awesome, and the fact that he's tracked down and identified by the middle of the movie.It seems immediately noticeable that M's artistic logic is, in the first third, essentially that of a silent movie, Lang doesn't really play or juggle with the sound, didn't really make it his own?thought the assassin's signature whistling is an important gimmick, then Lang's approach evolves, he takes heart, the sound is put to full use, it's wonderful to see this; a large part of Lang's career consists in his work as a genre director, he made perhaps more genre movies than any other great director (--except, of course, for Hitchcock, Hawks, Ford and --), and when he tries a more meditative form of cinema he was truly nowhere as good as Murnau or Renoir. Yet Lang's approach in M's first part is strikingly not that of a genre thriller?suspense, atmosphere, action (--though it latter picks up very alertly and becomes a brisk exciting thriller--), instead there's an almost humorous approach, satire elements, and the movie is conceived like a police procedural, an inverted detective story, a how catch'em, as they call these ?, with all the focus of a realist drama, and this brings us also to how could Lang's M be tentatively described?as a police procedural realist drama canvas with witty filming devices and comic embroidering for humorous relief, all told from a commonsensical and documentary POV ?in a sense, and for the buffs interested in this stuff, Hitchcock's older crime story THE LODGER is Expressionistic to the hilt?but not Lang's M (--I know there are people who have found a reason to live in talking about how Hitchcock learned it all from German Expressionism via Lang whose sets he visited as a youngster, etc.--). But then?rewarding suspense to the hilt! And in a word, 'M' is a police epic, a police procedural epic on Berlin's scale, from a time when the German cinema had something to say ?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece in the truest, fullest sense of the word. M is not just a thriller, but a study of human behaviour and the diseased mind and how the eternal battle of mind and soul forever troubles us or as it happens in this case, destroys us, after the main character has destroyed the lives of others. It also very successfully shows how society, even its most unjust members, craves for justice and how unprepared, or unwilling it is to tolerate child murder. Furthermore, the tendency of human psyche to take law in its own hands above and beyond its appointed instruments, in the event of the most horrific crimes involving children, is also very clearly demonstrated in M. Though released in 1931 its story and underlying principles remain timeless. Perhaps a lesson for today's filmmakers: Fritz Lang undoubtedly did not have access to advanced computer technology nor a budget in the multi million range and yet he delivers a film that is much more successful in both thrilling, respecting and entertaining its audience than many of today's ultra-expensive productions that desperately try to hide their lack of substance by filling the screen with gory, blood-filled imagery.</fullReview>

It is also a masterful portrait of a city gripped in fear, and Lang effectively captures mob hysteria and the character of the city and it's inhabitants like few others. And we have Peter Lorre's astonishing performance as the child killer, at once both a horrible monster, and a pathetic and pitiful creature.

		<shortDescription>M For Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest movies ever made.Based on the murders committed in the late 1920's by Peter Kurten in the area around Dusseldorf (Kurten was guillotined in 1931, the year that 'M' was made and released)The black and white cinematography is wonderful to see - modern colour photography is lost when trying to evoke gas lit or fog laden streets and the sense of atmosphere that pervades this film is remarkable.The murder of children is a topic difficult to portray on screen - usually (for reasons of taste) we are merely shown the grief of the bereaved parents and the steely determination of detectives to catch the killer. Nothing in 'M' fits this stereotype.Peter Lorre is superb as the killer who sits in greasy cafes whilst whistling Grieg's 'In The Hall of the Mountain King'from the 'Peer Gynt' Suite in an effort to drive the evil compulsions that he is unable to resist from his mind. As the music grows faster and more insistent, he succumbs, unwillingly to his terrible urges. He is seen picking up a small girl and buying her a balloon; the pair descend a flight of stairs into a murky alley and seconds later the balloon drifts up the stairway - a throat clutching image that speaks more to the fears of the viewer than the goriest of special effects.We have a stout and jolly policeman (who greatly resembles Ernst Gennert, the detective who investigated the Kurten case) in hot pursuit of the killer.Also in pursuit are the criminal fraternity - who are annoyed at the intense police activity generated by the killings, which is stifling their predations. Indeed, it is eventually the criminals who catch the killer and subject him to a trial in their lair. Lorre argues that they cannot understand the compulsions that drive his actions and is mocked by his captors.Suspenseful, artistic and intellectually satisfying, 'M' is a great cinema classic which I unhesitatingly award a munificent 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A black and white gem where nothing is black and white</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was curious about the movie M because in Firesign Theater's "Further Adventures of Nick Danger", the Peter Lorre like Rocky Rococo says "This hasn't happened to me since M". When I realized that M was a 1930 black and white film in German, about a serial child murderer I was ready to fast forward to the the end just to see what happened to Peter Lorre. I was expecting a simplistic plot with the over-acting typical of the early talkies, and an unsympathetic evil Peter Lorre.What I really like about M is that things are not good vs. evil, black and white. You end up with conflicting feelings about all the groups. The evil Peter Lorre is sadly mentally ill and you worry about him as he is being tracked like an animal. The good police are ineffective and doing evil by trampling on everyones rights and subsequently making everyone mad at the police. The evil gangsters, in reaction to the increased police activity hurting their businesses, are doing good by systematically tracking down the murderer.I was very surprised at how modern M felt. It felt like a modern Hitchcock movie. You are given more information than any of the characters and then you worry about what the players will do as the discover what you already know. Peter Lorre was used perfectly in M. He has very little dialog until his speech at the end of the film. That makes him both more frightening and more sympathetic in the beginning and it makes his final speech more dramatic because you have been waiting through the entire movie to hear what he thinks. That works especially well for Peter Lorre because of either his limited acting range or his type-casting his voice immediately suggests someone evil and deranged. Keeping him quiet keeps us guessing about what is going on inside him.Some of the reviews called this a scary movie, but I thought is was thought provoking and compelling. I could not stop watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? It's a classic. The fact that it was based on a REAL case in Düsseldorf, Germany, really scares me, knowing that huge crime sindicates were able to form one league, to battle this common enemy. If they could do it then, then why not again? Peter Lorre's portrail of the murderer was brilliant, completely believable. At times, I was compelled to feel sorry for him, seeing how he was caught between two existences. So for anyone who hasn't seen "M", I strongly recommend it. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'M' is excellent in every single way. A movie with a magnificent plot. A movie with a superb acting. A movie with an even better filming. It's a masterpiece beyond time, a film so real and absorbing that you wont even stand to go to the bathroom. Lang's movie suggests a lot but says a lot, too. And it can be proved when the Nazis got it forbidden. The way it recreates a chaotic situation in which millions of people are affected because of a single man deeds is simply amazing. It's a movie about misery, and humans at their worst....and maybe a bit at their best. 'M' created a genre (film-noir) and, although being made in 1931, it's a guideline and a FAQ for making this kind of movies. A film that should be seen by many directors nowadays and by all you movies' fans. A classic, simply and totally. It deserves to be in your personal collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the first sound masterpiece. Though it's one of the first to use the new technology, it doesn't feel like it, as the camera is fluid and expressive and the sound effects are utilized perfectly and are even essential to the story. Lang's direction is superb, amping up the suspense and terror by using the cinematography, lighting, and sound together to create a very tense and distinctive atmosphere. Peter Lorre is fantastic in what is really the lead role of the film, making us feel sympathy and pity for a horrific child-murderer. The combination of German expressionism, film-noir tendencies, and social commentary that Lang injects into the film makes for a brilliant and gripping work. Simply a terrific film all-around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it captures the way cinema and theater were once very close, especially in Deutchland. this movie is wonderful, it really is, you should watch it! it is a drama picture, it deals with the way the film maker saw his surrounding, which wasn't good at all. to me it felt like the filmmakers were quite aware to the awful state in which the German nation was, in the late 20s, early 30s. it directly referred to the way in which crippled people were referred to at the time, and i think it is equivalent to many films we have now days, talking about society. "M" was a great movie, that came to sum up a part of cultural life in Germany, fearing the land might not have anybody to do that later on.</fullReview>

Another great sequence is the alarm system being activated during a factory break and enter - the amazing details shows the opening of a window triggering a sensor which in turn sets of an alarm at the police station, where a light flashes above a number. Police then go to a card file system, look up that number and straight away know which window in which building and the address within seconds of the window being forced. I never knew they had such systems in 1931 - but hey did and the detail with which the sequence is filmed in remarkable. A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In addition to everything wonderful about the film already mentioned was the reflection of society it portrayed. A strong minded, family oriented society who had a "sub society" who felt they had the right to convict the criminally insane but who cowed totally to the authority of the police. Interesting when you see how life unfolded in the subsequent 30 years! Next most interesting to me was Lorre's absolutely perfect depiction of a compulsively motivated human. I agree this film should be ranked as one of the top 10 of all times though I only recently discovered it by accident. Using the pictures of the victims is more like a modern TV reenactment than the first "talkie" for a nation. Wonderful movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is a masterpiece... and I don't use that term lightly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father has often told me about this movie. It's been available for next to nothing at the local DVD/CD shop here for longer than I can remember, and not long ago, I finally pulled myself together and bought it. Today, we sat down to watch it. I must say, this movie astounded and impressed me. From the first frame, it had me. It gripped me and didn't let go until the ending... if even then. If I'm not still in its clutches. The plot is excellent, and the way it's told is very interesting. It develops constantly, though never too quickly; the film never stands still, yet never moves too fast, either. The pacing is among the best in any of the films I've watched... and that list count nears one thousand titles(as I'm writing this, I'm nearing my way to 700 written reviews... but I've got a good 17 years of watching movies prior to my starting to comment on them). The acting is incredible. I can't think of a single performance I found anything less than flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The cinematography is nothing short of amazing. The way they created all those great shots, be it stationary or those with movement, at that time, with that equipment... magnificent work. Fritz (either Lang or the cinematographer, they share a first name) knows his way around cameras, and knows when to use movement... and, perhaps more importantly, when not to. This film has its share of both kinds of shots, and both work perfectly. The film uses the art of hinting to the fullest; something Hitchcock, the very master of suspense, would later employ, in huge thrillers such as Psycho. Shadows, suggestive camera movements, a tiny movement in body or face... things that, in a film of today, would be simply not be found. The silent and unclear would replaced by loud and obvious. One of the most important things to note about this film is how little it says outright... and how much it merely... hints. A careful, subtle remark, presented casually... in place of an absolute. Having recently watched Scarface, a film from the same period(it was released about a year later) which leaves little to be pondered over by the viewer(and much to be desired in that very area), the contrast between an open movie and a closed one is blatantly obvious. There is much to debate over and consider in this film. It reminded me of Alejandro Amenábar - a man whom I very much admire - the Spanish director who also employs few definite truths in his films. It's not up to the director to decide what is right... but rather us, the viewers, the movie-going audience. Alejandro knows that. So did Fritz. I will have to watch more films of his. Another thing is the level of detail in this film... reminiscent of Kubrick, another master of the art of film-making, this film is packed with detail. So many seemingly meaningless, but endlessly insightful little things. A scene that shows shady types idle... a subtle touch that would be edited out as early as during the script-writing phase of most newer movies... characters that are seen once and then never again... the examples are endless. Fortunately, this review isn't that, and on that note, I'll refrain from further listing of them. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. If you can, get a original version of this film... not a dubbed one. No matter how awful you are at the language, it just fits better in German. Just make sure you've got good subtitles... I myself am rather hopelessly poor at the language, and I noticed that many times, the lazy Danish translator skipped entire sentences(though I noticed it to be prominently used words and sentences, that, when uttered and translated once, were from then on left to only be heard, and not seen, which I guess is at least more acceptable than the worse alternatives). This film is full of suspense, and some of the best I've ever seen. Again, I would guess that Mr. Hitchcock took a lesson or two from Lang and this film. I was on the edge of my seat for just about all of this, and I couldn't have taken my eyes off it had the house been on fire. Well, I might've gotten up, once my chair was caught in the flames. Last but not least... the film-noir qualities. The interplay of light and dark, the dreary atmosphere and the tone... all spot-on. The film deals with several very difficult subjects... not to be mentioned here. I suggest you watch it for yourself and make up your own mind about each of them. Lang won't force his opinion on you. For such an old film, this is really not terribly dated... apart from some things that have obviously changed over the 75 years, three generations, yes, three quarters of a century that has passed, but they're really not that obvious. Had this film been made today, little would have to be changed. Sadly, it would not get made today... for many reasons. Unless it was on the indie scene, this simply would not be made. I can't see any studio accepting it as profitable. By today's standards, it's event-less, tame and, well, black and white. Of course, that says quite a lot more about today's standards(which, in my humble opinion, are far, far lower, and, indeed, too low) than the quality of this film, which is impeccable. I recommend this to any fan of Lorre, Lang and noir. Heck, crime, thriller and suspense fans will enjoy it as well. As would most anyone, really, who aren't too used to the films of today to enjoy an old great work. 10/10</fullReview>

It is full of controversial topics and thrilling scenes that kept my eyes glued to the screen. There are numerous non speaking scenes that may seem to drag but the scenes speaks volumes in the way the actors performed! Imagination is definitely important because there are numerous scenes of violence/darkness that aren't shown. Maybe it was because this movie was made in 30s or maybe it was censored but Fritz Lang does a great job in telling the story. Just have to pay attention or you'll miss some details. The mystery and drama between numerous characters is intense. I had no problem following the movie despite it being in German language.

		<fullReview>I am not much for sub-titled movies, but this movie is rated at least 50th best of all-time no matter where you look, so my curiosity drove me to watch it this morning on commercial free TCM.I was astounded at how well filmed it was (at least in the version I saw), and at how magnificently the plotting and acting were performed. I read all of the reviews here before watching (even the techno-babble ones) so I was well prepared to be critical.In the end result I agree totally with its rating. It is astounding that in the 73 years that have passed, that less than 50 movies have ever been created that are critically acclaimed as being "better".Oddly enough, this movie does not appear anywhere in the AFI's list. But "Singing in the Rain" it is not.I found this movie's theme as modern in 2004 as it was in 1931. The social issues raised are every bit as fresh today as back then. I liked how "electronically" and technologically modern the movie was...for example, phones were used as often in the movie as cell phones are today; the police used "labs" and fingerprinting, and psychological experts, and had in-depth research facilities for searching records. When certain people wanted to synchronize their watches, they called the operator for the correct time.Check out the scene where the "criminals" are stalking the killer in the office building, and one of their experts discovers something like "this building has a state-of-the-art alarm mechanism, whereby if the guards don't punch their rounds into the clock, a signal will be sent to the police". Sure enough it does happen, and a signal similar to a ticker tape is sent to the police headquarters, and not only shows the alarm, but the exact location and room where the alarm is triggered from.I got so mesmerized at some points I forgot to read the sub-titles. I was a little surprised at its abrupt ending, but in 1931, maybe the statement "we should all watch our children better" was as wise and profound as you can get.I know that director Fritz Lang and actor Peter Lorre "got outa town" to Hollywood after this movie, as they were both Jewish. But Hitler was apparently a fan of theirs, and used one of the Peter Lorre scenes as propaganda against the Jews in 1940 (out of context).Imagine people watching this movie in the year 2131 (which they will), and what they will be able to understand about life 200 years previous. It would be similar to us watching the Revolutionary War on DVD...but I digress.:) Watch this movie if you get a chance!</fullReview>

Fritz Lang was a master and his approach to this movie (well..all his work) was as avant garde as anything in its day (save maybe for the work of Luis Bu?uel).But the thing the truly sends this picture to the upper echelon of great films is the finest performance of Lorre's great career. Much has been said of the trail scene...I won't rehash those comments other than to say if you want to watch what is one of the single greatest performances ever committed to film, start right here! Lorre is that good in this.One other note....the Criterion Collection DVD of "M" is simply wonderful, and one that belongs in the collection of any serious movie buff.</fullReview>

From the stark, atmospheric, almost expressionistic look of the film; to the tightly woven plot, this one is great.

		<fullReview>If you like Hitchcock, you'll love "M" as Hitchcock was director Lang's student and protege. In fact, many of the scenes in Lang's movies have been transposed (I dare not say stolen) into Hitchcock's work. Certainly, without Lang, we'd have no Hitchcock. And this is just as much a classic as any Hitchcock. At the time sound was just moving into studios, Lang used it as a mere accent to the movie not as a character of it. In otherwords, minimum sound save that used to heighten suspense and drama--no music--save that of the whistling the killer would hum. And what a killer. In 1931 we have a story, starring Peter Lorre--the great--as the serial killer of small children- a terrifying subject now, but especially then. When you watch, notice how certain scenes are shot including the place setting scene and when Elsie is playing with the ball--will she or won't she? Lang's directing and choices of allusion over direct expression make every moment a "what's going to happen next" moment. At first you get annoyed with the lack of sound but then realize that that is exactly what is producing the effect- Lang was a genius. Also, last few scenes are famous and should be thought about with deep philosophical pondering as great questions are raised. I highly suggest as this movie deserves nothing less then an A and a name on the list of greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M a few thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not take time to praise the film, as others have done it far better than I can. I would like to point out that the ending on M is not Lang's. The ending was tacked on by others at the studio. Lang's version ends in the cellar of the brewery. That is why the ending is in contrast to the film...it doesn't belong. I can only say that the ending does give a vision that Schranker's prediction, delivered so forcefully a few minutes earlier is now coming true in the final scene..the wheel is coming around.I would also like to say that being familiar with German the subtitles are relatively true to the spoken word with only minor deviations done for clarity-something that is not always the case.I would like to recommend for those that are interested that they check out the internet crime library database as under "Serial Killers" they have both Peter Kurten (the Dusseldorf Vampire) and Fritz Haarman (the Butcher of Hannover) both of whom inspired "M" in much the same way that Ed Gein inspired "Psycho". No where is this clearer than in the beginning where the children are singing about how the "man in black will come and chop you up". This song is a derivation of the "Haarman song" that was part of a similar selection game where one child per round is put out. It is amazing but true that children did sing this song about a child murderer.Another musical comment before I go, the music Peter Lorre is whistling, In the Hall of the Mountain King, comes at the point where the hero is attacked by hordes of crazed beings...does Peter Lorre's character identify with the hero and kills children to escape? Watch the movie and decide for yourself if you are rooting for Lohmann or forSchranker.P.S. as for the real life inspiration of Kurten and Haarman, insane though they must have been, they both, as Schranker puts it, were "taken care of so that it will not happen again".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A vastly interesting and somewhat disturbing German production from 1931 that stars a very young Peter Lorre as a psychopath who goes around the city trying to find children to murder. Naturally the entire community gets in a raged uproar as no one has any clues as to who is committing these grisly crimes. The police, fearful of more murders, hire more officers and the streets become patrolled at all times. Now the crime syndicates have their hands tied as their shady dealings cannot go down due to the watchful eyes of the cops. Disenchanted with the authorities, many citizens begin to take matters into their own hands in the hopes of finding the culprit themselves. A dark underworld of dangerous criminals and hysterical civilians then join forces in the hopes of ending the murderer's life forever. "M" is one of those productions that is engrossing from the very start due to its realism and its frightening tone. Director Fritz Lang makes the film work by creating a landscape that shows all people that are directly and indirectly affected by Lorre's sick actions. Lorre though does come off at times as a strangely sympathetic character as it is made quite clear that he has an addiction to killing that he cannot deny. He is actually a mental case, but everyone else does not seem to care. Germany was about to foresee many changes shortly after 1931 and it seems very apparent in "M". The crazed control that cops and underworld syndicates have on typical citizens is an intriguing premise explored here. Of course Hitler's Nazis would use similar strong-armed tactics and strange forms of propaganda to gain support within their own country by the mid-1930s. Thus "M" feels like a frightening foreshadower of things to come. The film has aged pretty well, but I did feel like most of the characters were not as deep as they could have been. I also had a problem with a solemn ending that just did not really go well with the rest of the film. With all that said, I still think "M" is a genuinely super achievement. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After looking over some earlier comments I am astonished that some were "confused" by this film or that it had a "mediocre" plot.For those "confused", the plot was pretty clear. A killer loose on the streets is elusive from authorities, so a group of people who live in the area take matters into their own hands (Which was pretty apparent in the famous kangaroo court scene at the end.) I don't know how anyone can call this "mediocre" when "M" was one of the first talkies in Cinema, and the fact no film has been made with a similar plot, either as a silent or later film in the 70-plus years it has been around.All of the suspense is built not on action, or violence, but a sense of atmosphere; shadows, whistling, frantic people, and dark/abandoned architecture (buildings, row houses, street corners, etc.) Be sure to see this classic in its restored release, as the older version has subtitles that are white on a black and white background and the newer version has better formated subtitles that are easier to read. Don't miss this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As riveting as it is intellectually demanding. And that's just by 2001 standards-- Fritz Lang directed this film, his first with sound-- in 1931, when hardly anyone knew how to integrate dialogue into a previously silent art form, and in the midst of the Nazi uprising at the same time.The plot is taught and tense, waiting to find out what's going to happen next, or which side is going to make the next move. Moreso when you realize that Lang was the first ever to do this-- previous IMDB comments such as "we've seen this all before" show ignorance, because in 1931, NO ONE had seen this before. No one had DONE this before.The Nazi regime wanted to ban this film because they suspected-- correctly-- that the film was talking about them. Seventy years later, its questions of good vs. evil are still equally as relevant, or else you weren't paying attention.Grieg's "In the Hall of the Mountain King" has never been more powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a remarkably powerful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you found Todd Solendz's recent film "Happiness" to be an effective film, Fritz Lang's "M" will positively blow your socks off. The films are basically about the same subject, serial child molesters/murderers. It's a gruesome subject, and an emotional rollercoaster, but in the hands of a talented filmmaker, powerful stuff. Where Solendz gives us a little more initial sympathy toward his main character, Lang's suspense takes front stage, only later giving way to a small measure of relief, in the scenes of the criminal underworld mobilizing their mission to make the streets safe (for them) again. Fritz Lang was an artist decades ahead of his craft, using dark, stark, or sharply contrasting images and other innovative angles and techniques not widely seen in other films until the '50s or later. His choice of script was often visionary as well, tackling subjects that no one else would dare try to turn into art. All the drama, power and impact of "M" survives intact today. You may notice that some of the pacing of the film may lag in places by contemporary standards, and some of the action bits seem a little creaky, but by and large the hands of time have hardly touched this masterful film.There are a few versions of the print around, ranging from around 90 minutes to 118. In some versions, a brief scene of a German courtroom and a briefer line by one of the bereaved mothers is present. This was part of the original film, omitted in later versions. It probably will make a minor difference in what you take away with you after the film. I saw the Janus Films Release on a 1997 Home Media Vision (Chicago, IL) VHS cassette at 111 minutes which contained the scenes. The 1991 release by Pearl Entertainment, and the 1986 release by Embassy Home Entertainment, each at 99 minutes, are rumored not to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lang's Child Murderer Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's first sound film is undoubtedly a classic. Peter Lorre is utterly convincing as the serial child murderer, but an even bigger asset of the film is its realism. When we see the children playing we believe they are playing, it does not look staged. When we see the mother calling for her daughter and she doesn't respond then we can relate to it. It is much more chilling and effective than the special effects bonanza of a modern slasher film, simply because it is much closer to our (speaking as somebody who lived in similar housing estates) everyday experiences. This must have been even more impressive in its own period when viewers were accustomed to villains in comic book style, like Henry Bergman in the early Chaplin films.Fritz Lang seems to have a message when he shows police and mob operating in a similar way to hunt down the killer, but I'm not so sure which. Some reviewers suggested that the organised mob was a reference to the organised Nazis (storm troopers and all) but I feel a bit uneasy about such a suggestion, it looks a bit construed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M is not for the faint of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinematically, I thought that the opening sequence of the film was frightful. I think it is because Lang used such long takes to watch the children playing (from a rather obtuse angle too); then the mother tells them not to sing the horrifying song they were singing (similar to our version of London Bridges or Engine Engine Number Nine. Children mirror what they see and hear; but the only reason the children's song was so atrocious was because the Child Murderer was afoot. Then Lang uses that long take to show the woman readying her table for her child?who will never come home; it is a drastic and dramatic scene and I find the horror of it magnified because we do not see Peter Lorre choking the girl, or stabbing her?or doing whatever. We figured what would happen and in implication the suspense and horror are far greater than any Freddy or Jason slasher flick.I believe, what I find so appealing in this (first) version (Lang's 1931 cut) is that he was directorially satisfied to use long takes and wide shots that showed a world beyond the immediate camera lens?or at least an implied world. That show directorial finesse; something sadly lacking in a lot of contemporary cinema. I was shocked by the use of the obscene language, but it made sense. I found myself wondering, though, if Lang did not use long takes of silence because there were moments where he simply did not have story to tell?ergo, he shows people doing what they do.What I thought most alarming was once the mobs collaborated and cornered and captured Lorre's character, they were actually driven by the rule of law, in a fashion. Though what they did was somewhat vigil-ante, it was at least a forum for a discussion on who has the right to do what to whom. Who does have the right to take a life? Does the state? I must say that Peter Lorre's acting in that scene was nearly as perfect as any actor can get to perfection as humanly possible.It is fitting the justice exacted on the killer life even though Frau Beckmann said justice does not bring their children back (everyone needs to watch their children closer).Of course, we have to understand, this film emerges from pre-Nazi Germany, between the wars. Germany was a demolished state nearly collapsing from the devastating war reparations imposed on it by the League of Nations. The German people were suffering with devastating unemployment rates (for heaven's sake, there wasn't even air conditioning) and people were angry. This is the condition that produced Robert Wiene The Cabinet of Dr. Caligary, Paul Leni's The Man Who Laughs with Conrad Veidt, King Vidor's The Golem and the perennial (immortal, no pun intended) favorite F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu. The expressionists of the 20s and 30s were, as you say Trailblazers. They could make frightening films and I think that Hitchcock did well to study their works, because I believe that he refined what they did into the realm of stereo sound and Technicolor. The pre-noir effect is stark and bleak, and you are right, I think it paints a frightening picture; I will add that it shows us how life may have been in the era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A quick word to video renters: AVOID THE VERSIONS FROM BARR ENTERTAINMENT and BUDGET VIDEO! Aside from using the grainiest, scratchiest, and noisiest prints I've ever seen, the subtitles on these tapes are a joke. They only kick in about 40% of the time, and seem to paraphrase the characters' dialogue instead of actually translate it. Even when they do show up, they're often unreadable because the white text blends in with white objects on the screen. If you can get ahold of it, watch the Criterion DVD! You'll be glad you did!*** MINOR SPOILERS WITHIN! ***In the world of film, there is certain subject matter that is just too taboo to be explored by mainstream filmmakers. Even now, with Hollywood's shameless predilection for blood, sex, and drugs, some topics are still just too iffy for the Steven Spielbergs and the George Lucases of today. Movies that contain serious portrayals of homosexual romance, scenes of rape, or strong anti-governmental themes are big no-no's in Hollywood; but the biggest way to guarantee a permanent shun from Columbia Pictures or DreamWorks SKG is to make a movie about child murder. Better yet, why not make the child murderer a sympathetic character?This is exactly what Fritz Lang did in his phenomenal 1931 feature, M. M was truly ahead of its time, and not simply because of its early use of synchronized sound. What amazed me most about M was that it featured a character who, when introduced, is utterly despicable. The audience quickly learns of his unforgivable crimes, and although none of the murders are actually shown, they are talked about in grim detail, with the camera often focusing-almost unbearably-on the reactions of the distraught parents as they speak of their children's demise. As the film progresses, however, our perceptions began to change, and we start to take pity on this man, all the while coming to the realization that the vigilant mob who wants to beat this man to death is no better than the murderer himself. After all, is mercilessly pummeling a defenseless man to death somehow more `civil' than killing a child? To some, the answer may be yes; but to me, murder cannot be divided into degrees of acceptability like that-it is wrong, no matter who does it or who it is done to, period.But it goes much deeper than that. Aside from just feeling sympathy for the murderer simply because an entire town wants his head on a stick, you can't help but be affected by his genuinely sorrowful personality. After all, he honestly cannot control what he is doing, and he is just as horrified learning about his crimes as the parents of the children he kills-perhaps even more so, since the shock of discovering that you are the one responsible for such evil is a probably an impossible one to recover from. His speech at the end is not only heartfelt and pitiful, but it's thought-provoking as well. As short of a speech as it is, it provides a great deal of insight into the relatively simple mindset most people have regarding issues like these.Another fascinating quality about M was its constant, almost overwhelming references to angry mobs and vigilante justice. Even before the final chase segment, there are many scenes wherein a dominant force bullies an innocent person or group of people with little or no justification. The scene that sticks out most in my mind is one where a man is beaten down by some nearby pedestrians, simply because he asked a child if she knew the time. The main purpose behind this particular scene is obvious: it serves as a harrowingly realistic portrayal of the dangerous type of hysteria that can infect a highly emotional group of people. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that these types of scenes were probably meant to be sly references to the recent settlement of the Nazi party in Germany. Lang seems to be commenting not only on the steadily growing support of the party, but also his disdain for their violent and often dictatorial methods of government and international relations.M is a movie that not only forces you to think, but to feel as well. Peter Lorre's portrayal of the murderous antagonist (or is he the protagonist?) is both frightening and heartrending, and Fritz Lang's script and direction are both first rate. M's cinematography is also marvelous, not only helping to tell its story in a fluid, stylish manner, but also causing the film as a whole to give off an ominous, unsettling vibe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enthralling Classic, and a Triumph For Lang &amp; Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enthralling classic that still works as well as any movie of the genre that has been made since, "M" is also an artistic triumph for Fritz Lang and an acting triumph for Peter Lorre. The grim, complex story and the varied and sometimes weird settings fit together perfectly, leaving you with a lasting impression of the world that they create.The story pulls you in quickly, and it only gets deeper as it goes on. To the basic story-line of the hunt for the murderer, it adds a detailed and distinctive portrayal of its society, with some unusual and thought-provoking parallels between sectors of society that at first would seem quite different. The settings are quite detailed and often unusual, yet never without a purpose. Lang strives for uniqueness but always keeps things tied together. There are many good sequences - too many to detail - that are as interesting to watch as they are important to the story.To all this is added Lorre's performance, which showed how many things he could do. Seeing him perform so well in such a challenging lead role, it is no surprise that his supporting roles were such an important part of so many other fine films. Here, Lorre is one of numerous factors that make "M" such a memorable classic.</fullReview>

He poses as a filmmaker just as the seducer here poses as a friend. Both are talented fakers.In the second half of the equation, I have always been unsatisfied by the elementary social commentary he selects.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while there comes along a film about a serial killer. There's usually a lot of hype, and the film is no doubt controversial. The best known example of a serial killer film is PSYCHO. More recent examples would be MANIAC and American PSYCHO. But the film that started them all off was this black-and-white thriller/chiller that came from Germany, a shocking and disturbing film which still holds up as being powerful and frightening this day. Surprisingly, it's a film which hasn't dated, a film which looks at psychology - both individual and mob-orientated.Peter Lorre appears in his first starring role, and it's safe to say this is his best and most well-remembered performance. Lorre portrays his killer as a sympathetic, whining, bug-eyed creep who hates himself for what he does but is unable to resist the compulsion to killer. His multi-dimensional murderer manages to be upsetting and frightening in equal measures. Lorre is given surprisingly little screen time until the mock-courtroom ending which gives us a real insight into the mind of a child murderer/molester.This is a film which was way ahead of itself at the time it was made - in much the same way that PEEPING TOM was, thirty years later on. Fritz Lang directs with plenty of artistic flair, never letting the camera sit static for too long, which was the main flaw with Universal's Dracula. All the main actors and actresses are very good, especially the criminals who play the good guys for a change. There are plenty of memorable scenes, such as the balloon floating into the electricity lines at the beginning (subtle and disturbing), Lorre discovering, to his horror, that he has an 'M' chalked on to his back, and a tense chase through the streets and man hunt for the killer. And who can forget the eerie tune of Hall of the Mountain King that Lorre whistles to himself whenever he's on the prowl. Harrowing and profound, M is rightly regarded as a suspenseful masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no words to describe Fritz Lang's masterpiece M. It is brimmed with suspense that will make you shiver throughout. Peter Lorre's performance in all is mind-boggling, in one particular scene he describes how he cannot help killing children and it is a masterful moment, the actor who went on to feature in Casablanca and the Maltese Falcon makes M, seventy-fourth on the IMDb Top 250. It has immediately jumped into my top ten favourite films of all time, joining Cinema Paridiso in foreign films, which are films I don't usually like, but yet the most firm hater of foreign films must be drawn to a film like M. Fritz Lang is a film genius and I will continue to love this film, I have also been asked to watch another Fritz Lang film, Metropolis, so here I come!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pioneering drama and cinematic landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang, dubbed as the "Master of Darkness", achieved new heights with his groundbreaking, 1927 silent masterpiece "Metropolis". Four years later, Lang would create his first 'talking' film in "M", a precursor to the film-noir genre that, even today, serves as the quintessence of crime thriller.One thing I truly admire about B&amp;W films is its use of light and shadows to manipulate setting, emotions and character development. Lang's visual style was said to mirror his contempt and increasingly pessimistic worldview. In "M", Lang creates an atmosphere of fearful apprehension; men are seen in shadows, in smoke-filled rooms.This is a powerful and fertile piece of art. Hans Beckert, the disturbed child killer, uncannily portrayed by Peter Lorre, is often seen looking through glass windows or mirrors for expressive purposes. Sometimes we see just his shadow. His words are few and far between, and yet his general frame of mind and emotions are quite apparent to us.The acting is superb and the story is a riveting one. But it was the cinematography that took my breathe away. One spectacular shot, among many, occurs when Becker is unwillingly dragged down to a basement. His cries for help are quickly silenced as he turns around to the sight of hundreds of criminal faces - silent, eerie, menacing.The flow of this story is guided by two seemingly distinct groups seeking out the notorious child murderer - the police and the criminals. And yet, they are both cleverly shot (in their dark, smoky rooms) to appear as virtually homologous beings - even the criminals deem this man's freedom as injustice, with this commonality almost blending two morally opposite figures into one force.The film is masterfully crafted and serves as an important message for parental neglect of their children. As we hear our killer compulsively whistle the same tune from "Peer Gynt," we are continually reminded of the innocence children can see in others and the perils of them acting on that naiveté. "M" is an unpredictably formidable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of children are playing an elimination game in the courtyard of an apartment building in Berlin[5] using a chant about a murderer of children. A woman sets the table for dinner, waiting for her daughter to come home from school. A wanted poster warns of a serial killer preying on children, as anxious parents wait outside a school.Little Elsie Beckmann leaves school, bouncing a ball on her way home. She is approached by Hans Beckert, who is whistling "In the Hall of the Mountain King" by Edvard Grieg. He offers to buy her a balloon from a blind street-vendor. He walks and talks with her. Elsie's place at the dinner table remains empty, her ball is shown rolling away across a patch of grass, and her balloon is lost in the telephone lines overhead.In the wake of Elsie's death, Beckert sends an angry letter about his crimes to the newspapers, from which the police extract clues using the new techniques of fingerprinting and handwriting analysis. Under mounting pressure from city leaders, the police work around the clock. Inspector Karl Lohmann instructs his men to intensify their search and to check the records of recently released psychiatric patients to look for those with a history of violence against children. They stage frequent raids to question known criminals, disrupting underworld business so badly that Der Schränker ("The Safecracker") calls a meeting of the city's criminal bosses. They decide to organize their own manhunt, using beggars to watch and guard the children.The police discover two clues corresponding to the killer's letter in Beckert's rented rooms. They wait there to arrest him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"M" makes you create the violence in your own mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This masterwork was the joint creation of a husband and wife team, Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou, even though Lang's name is the only one featured up front. "M" is much more than just a film about capturing a pedophile murderer. In fact, you never see a murder. Most reviews overlook the clever structure of the script, which was credited to both Lang and von Harbou. Berlin is famous for its dry humor, which is sprinkled throughout the dialog despite the grim theme. Early on there's a scene in a bar in which a group of regulars discuss the latest murder until one man accuses another of possibly being the culprit. And there is a sequence of wry cuts which switch back and forth between a police conference and a gang conference as both separately discuss how to capture the child killer. Peter Lorre was a stage actor before accepting this film role, and it shows at times. Actually, the film is almost stolen by the sly Otto Wernicke (Inspector Karl Lohmann), whose performance was so strong that Lang brought him back to play the same character in "The Testament of Dr. Mabuse" (1933). Another outstanding performance was given by Gustav Gründgens (Schränker, the crime boss). The large cast was matched to the top talents. The cutting is marvelous, as is the camera work. But be careful to avoid the washed-out copies that were sold before the restored version (2004). The English subtitles were clear without interfering with the images, and the sound was very good (by 1931 standards).</fullReview>

It also engages with the ideas of insanity and crime. Can a person be exempted from murder if they are insane and not in charge of their actions? This idea is explored brilliantly in the film's final scene. Despite this, I did not enjoy the film as much as I thought I would. It jumped about a lot and the characters were largely forgettable.

		<shortDescription>A hidden message warning against Nazi Germany, Lorre's performance, and Lang's direction all make this a very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first question you might find yourself asking while watching this movie is just where the hell is the 'stranger danger'? Despite the news of a serial killer preying on children in the news for a long time, we still see children on the street alone, and one easily lured in with candy and treats. Peter Lorre is brilliant in the role of the killer, setting the tone early on as director Fritz Lang cuts to him looking in the mirror, and, like a child, distorting his face to look monstrous, while the police are talking about the psychological profile of a killer.While the police are shown at work with some early examples of forensics ? fingerprints, handwriting analysis, and sifting through physical evidence in concentric circles around the crime scene ? the overall picture of them is unflattering. In a very heavy-handed way they begin putting heat on the street and in pubs, asking for papers and rounding people up for little reason, motivating an organized crime ring to get involved to find the killer themselves and get things back to normal. The police and mob are barely distinguishable as they both discuss the matter over cigars and alcohol in separate meetings as Lang flips back and forth between them, and perhaps that's one of his larger points about Germany at the time. He does do a fantastic job at establishing a dark feel to the film throughout, and is brilliant when he cuts the sound a few times, letting the action speak for itself, which is heightened because of the darkness of it all.Unfortunately the movie gets a little bogged down in its middle portion, when Lang could have shown us other sinister acts from Lorre or at built some type of backstory in his characters. Instead, he shows us the surveillance network of beggars and focuses too much on procedure. At one point we do see Lorre nearly salivating at the sight of a child's reflection in the window of a shop he's looking into, and at another, him trying to lure in his next victim, but he's simply not on-screen enough. I have to also say that when the mob have found him holed up in a building and don't just call the police instead painstakingly going through the rooms, it seems like a plot hole, since from their perspective all they need is to get the police off the streets.The ultimate scene showing Lorre confronted by a mob intent on killing him after a mock trial redeems the film, however, and is riveting. The scene of Lorre seeing them all staring at him as Lang has the camera pan slowly from left to right is brilliant, as is his own statement in self-defense shortly afterward. We have an unruly mob confronting a child killer, where both sides are reprehensible. We feel for the mob when they voice their concern that he will simply serve a little time in a mental institution, then be back on the street again and kill again. Perhaps improbably, we even feel for Lorre, as he says he's sick, in what is one of the great scenes in film.There are few positive role models here, except perhaps the counsel who stands up and says and tries to defend him. This a dark, brooding film showing us some of the worst aspects of mankind. A child killer, sure, but also a mob which draws the wrong conclusions and gets violent without evidence. There is a lot of smoking and drinking. Lang shows one guy drinking out of a giant stein with a plateful of sausages in front of him, and another guy from a camera angle up his crotch practically as he's sitting down. If it was made by someone other than a German, you might think it a caricature, as it's made by Lang, we know he's expressing his frustrations with the state of Germany at the time. The ending that has a mother simply asking the audience to watch out for their children probably refers to watching out against predators, but also watching out for them that they don't get swept up into mob hysteria (history would turn out differently of course). It's this hidden message warning against Nazi Germany, Lorre's performance, and Lang's direction that all make this a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Subtle, appropriately bleak, film also works as a portrait of early 1930s Berlin, a city of (then) four and a half million people, and the fear and dread, the slow&nbsp;realisation&nbsp;by a handful of them, that young Elsie has gone missing, is gone, the latest victim of an unknown killer, without ever showing any on-screen violence. A grim intimation.&nbsp;The unknown killer writes to the press, taunting them, almost daring them to catch him, a la Jack The Ripper. Handwriting analysis is done on the letter, to no avail. Nervousness increases, accusations run wild, fingers are pointed, and paranoia sets in further, as both the police, as well as the criminal underworld, search for the killer.Thriller skirts the edges of horror, as well as early film noir, as both&nbsp;organised&nbsp;crime, and the police trace any clues to find the killer, who, in a smoke-filled room, it is said could be "a harmless citizen, who wouldn't hurt a fly" - could that have been an inspiration for Psycho?&nbsp;Top-billed Peter Lorre Lorre has precious little screen time in the beginning, only becoming dominant in the final act, after a blind man&nbsp;recognises&nbsp;the tune he is whistling, after hearing the killer whistle the same song. Overhead shot of Lorre being encircled on the wide open street was probably the first time an overhead shot was used, and to great effect, so was the nearly abstract views of the staircases.&nbsp;Lorre's character is filled with fear, trying to hide, then trying to escape from the junk room of the building. We almost forget he's a killer, we almost understand the fear he felt in those moments, and the following moments as a room full of criminals put him on trial, in their own kangaroo court.What makes this such a chilling movie, which gets under one's skin and sticks in one's mind, is that there is absolutely no on-screen violence. Everything is implied, nothing is shown, and there is not the slightest bit of humour to break the tension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?M" is primarily a bold and controversial piece of work. Lang's first sound film. Directed us to the beginning of the game offers shade and excellent cinematography. The atmosphere is gloomy and tense. The case of child killer is thematically processed. The focus of the story is not a serial killer but on how his murder affect people.All that is unacceptable and incomprehensible leads to division among the people. The essence of terrible things, such as the murder of children, people understand in different ways. Given the panic that is certainly present in this film, chaos reigned. The killer must locate and catch. In the story dominate two segments. On the one hand we see a strong power law in its infinite analysis of the psychological profile of the killer, organizing raids and executing them, clinging to straws, all under public pressure and an uneasy feeling of general panic. On the other hand, the underground has its problems. Because of frequent raids and increased the number of police officers on the street, suffering job. Then the key decisions are made: the criminals themselves will catch the killer. The way the underworld decided to end the hunt was my genius. How to find and trace the man, and without this it noticed? How can I be invisible in the street? Everybody?"M" is quite realistic movie and in many situations it can be replicated in our everyday lives shaken the social and economic crisis. Understandably, panic, fear and general mood affect each individual, but it is fascinating how the individual devices judge, jury and executioner. A mass hysteria not to speak.Peter Lorre is ?M" His performance deserves praise and admiration. Lorre before mobs straw, pray, but not for mercy, but to understand. Understanding? The expression on his face leaves the deepest impression.Acting follows the dark tone of the film. The atmosphere is excellent and followed by darkness, dirt, whores, bums and ugly people ... a lot of bad people.People are in uncontrolled situations corrupted. Most of us are trying to see the best in people. It is true that a large number of people conceals an eerie hatred that people often degrades in large social activities. Lang is a true master. He made a great movie. I will not have to engage in in-depth analysis.Below is a simplified message: ?Think only for themselves, but never head of the mob and keep an eye on children." Paradoxically. I know. "M" is an excellent thriller and police essay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's M is a great timeless thriller, a great thriller for the atmosphere of dread and paranoia it cultivates, timeless because the sequence of events of the film, the deliberation and the plotting of the police and the gangsters is nothing more than a mask being peeled back as the film unfolds. As the film unfolds it feels less like a procedural and more like the psyche of the beast unmasking itself methodically, as if the chase after child murderer Becket (Peter Lorre) is nothing more than the humanity itself exposing its' own devil, the problem of evil it struggles with in eternity. The city is like an organic machine, and Becket merely filling in the ultimate quota. He is pure evil, and yet innocent in that purity. He commits the most appalling crime of all, the murder of innocents, and yet he is a symbol for society's own corruption, the way the machine systematically murders its' own innocence from within. Because Becket is absolutely responsible, he is also absolutely absolved, because his crime is beyond reason, it is insanity, good and evil wrestling but joined in symbiosis, the ultimate monster none of us can bear. Trapped by the criminals who want him perished so they can continue their vices without restriction by police and civilian paranoia, he finds himself charged guilty by the guilty, by those that greedily profit from the weak, those criminals of 10 000 reasons who cannot deal with the devil directly. Becket must do that for their sake, god forbid they face the ultimate truth.The film is a tense, taut, brilliant thriller. The opening scene of the murder of little Ellsie is done with subtlety, shown only as a mother crying out for her daughter and the balloon Becket gave her caught in power lines. It's a powerful image to kick off the meticulous frenzy as the gangsters plot to remove themselves from the murders so as to continue business unhindered by the police raids. From there the tension only builds, until Becket is cornered in safe house by the gangsters. He is their ultimate treasure, that which has been locked up and hidden, that which they want killed so they can finally be free. But he cannot be killed, even by his own hand, such is his madness. The final scene with the criminal courtroom is incredible and must be seen, and Lorre's performance as the tortured soul is devastating. The film goes beyond merely pitying Becket, rather it simply shows the necessity of evil and the problems that arise when people try to take this into their own hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Engaging Milestone of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is touted as one of the first great thrillers, but I didn't know what to expect. What is a Weimar Republic-era black and white German proto-suspense film supposed to feel like? I had high- perhaps too high- expectations going into the film, and my faith was mostly rewarded.Let's get one thing out of the way: there are some modern film features that are not present here and may be jarring. The camera-work is nothing special. Some of the shots take so long that I felt myself drifting off to sleep. To some extent, this a problem in almost all pre-Citizen Kane era films, but in this movie, it is particularly noticeable.There is also no orchestral score to speak of. None at all. For the talking scenes, this is not noticeable and actually sort of nice, saying that the dialogue is remarkably well-written. But for the visual scenes- which are the backbone of cinema and what separate it from books- it can be extremely distracting. Often, I just hum my own tunes during the quiet bits and ask others to do the same.Moving past all that, this film is an interesting take on the traditional detective story. Peter Lorre plays a serial killer who targets children. The cops, understandably, try to take him down. But they are as ineffectual as cops can be in a non-comedy movie. They get in each other's way, bother the citizens, decrease business, arrest innocents, and utterly fail to track down Lorre. The crime syndicate also wants to take down Lorre. But unlike the cops, they are effective and efficient.More than once in the film, the cops find syndicate members and detain them. In one hand, they have reason enough to do so, particularly considering the syndicate members have committed some horrible crimes. But on the other hand, they are aggressively stopping Lorre from being brought to justice.Now consider that even if the cops did catch Lorre, he would plead insanity and likely be released from the asylum as harmless within a matter of a few years. This has happened before. Lorre's character can hide his true intentions until he has an opportunity to run wild.This all adds up to an interesting quandary that leads to one of cinema's great endings.When I popped in the film, I expected to be writing a review about its historical significance. That I've spent so much time breaking down the plot and the themes go to show how detailed and well-done those two elements are. It's almost enough to make me forgive the dearth of character moments or good pacing.This film only starts getting good around the halfway mark. Until then, you are left wandering in a much, trying to determine what kind of film this is. This could be viewed as the film not holding your hand and letting you determine yourself how all its elements stick together, but if that is the case, it should have been done in a more dynamic way that did not leave the audience grasping at dull straws for the first half-hour.Know what you're getting into when you pick this up. If you want a musically spectacular, amazingly acted spectacle, this is not for you. But if you're interested in the history of film or you want to see a surprisingly interesting story, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent, magnetic, macabre masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the turn of the 20th century, children have grown up with the cautionary parable of 'Captain Hooks' - charismatic, likable strangers with sinister intent of whisking them away. Regardless, there's a ferocious urgency in Fritz Lang's M, and its operatic hunt for the unassuming killer with the human face (you can practically feel Alfred Hitchcock leaning in for a fist bump); perhaps, sniffing out a shifting sociopolitical climate, he could tell "indolent" adults needed a 'Captain Hook' of their own.To say he succeeds would be an understatement for the century. Visionary and devastating, Lang's M is nearly as chilling in its immaculate technical mastery and scathing social commentary as it is eerily proficient at plumbing the depths of its macabre material. Even 85 years after its release, the film feels unnervingly mesmerizing and frightfully topical, with generations of filmic offspring doing nothing to dilute its power. M is legendary for a a number of attributes: its grimly beautiful imagery, singlehandedly birthing (or at least publicizing) the serial killer thriller and police procedural genres, and, of course, Peter Lorre's haunting performance. What's often forgotten is how all these attributes click into place, in a feat of truly laudable gestalt. From its opening shot - the now iconic trope of children cheerfully chanting about being butchered by the lurking murderer - the viewer is sucked into an absorbing atmosphere of spectral discomfort, assembled with the meticulous grotesquery of a glass case of taxidermy insects. Lang's horror is distressingly artistic: cameras glide through shadowy hallways, taverns, and city streets like a ghoul, framing the inner anguish of their villain through the muted anonymity of a hedge, while tactfully leaving the atrocities offscreen by instead fixating on beautifully devastating images - a ball and balloon each loll, unattended - in a feat of classic montage. But Lang doesn't simply play for tragedy, however - Beckert, the killer, is introduced in a grimly playful fashion, his silhouette creeping across a warrant for his own arrest, while the desperate police hunt concedes the guilty titillation of a killer on the loose, sparking 85 years of audience schadenfreude with the genre. Like his contemporary Chaplin, Lang also has fun playing with the newfound toy of synchronized sound as a storytelling device. After an era where directors had no control over the soundtrack to their films, Lang's long sequences of stark silence are uncomfortably present, allowing his few sound effects to resonate to an almost teasing extent. He seems practically tickled by Beckert being betrayed by his whistling, a thoroughly modern conceit, while linking the killer's approach to his compulsive, nervous tune of "In the Hall of the Mountain King" introduced the operatic trope of character leitmotif to cinema to a truly chilling effect (you're welcome, Jaws). Indeed, the film's only real drawback is its middle act, where the police procedural takes over the film. This tangential interlude is entirely too slow, alternatively uncomfortably silent and talky, and the scenes of authorities piecing together evidence or pontificating on the mental state of the killer are irritatingly redundant, sidetracking the core hunt for the killer. Only an hour and forty minutes in length, the film could easily have shed 30-40 minutes of running time and done nothing but maintain the claustrophobic tautness of its opening act. It's a relatively minor complaint in the face of such cinematic mastery, but it's unsurprising that all of the film's iconic, unforgettable bits bookmark this extraneous mid-film bloat. It's no surprise to concede that Lorre, in his starmaking turn, is absolutely spellbinding, but what's often forgotten is how little he's in the film, and how much he does with so little. Lorre is careful to keep Beckert ambiguous - always terrifying, yet sometimes bizarrely charming, pulling 'monstrous' faces in the mirror like a deranged fish, and sometimes woefully pitiful, pounding down cognacs and pounding his head as he attempts to silence the voices of temptation therein. He's never wholly sympathetic, even allowing notes of snivelling and self-righteous arrogance to flit through his captivating, pleading, climactic monologue, but Lorre is far too accomplished for us not to understand or feel for Beckert, amidst our disgust. If anything, Lang is at his most condemning in his depiction of a town tearing itself to pieces in its witch hunt for the murderer, its depiction of backstabbing paranoia rife with subtext (it's telling that production was nearly shut down by an indignant budding Nazi party who thought the film criticized them based on its subtitle: "Murderers among us"). With the exception of the tragic Frau Beckmann, with whom we devastatingly linger as she does laundry and sets the table for a daughter we know won't be coming home, the film's cast of characters, cop, criminal, and citizen alike, are a unanimously surly, petty, selfish lot, most invested in the hunt for the killer for all the wrong reasons. There's a brilliantly grim joke in the criminal underworld hunting for Beckert because the police presence he attracts is bad for business, while the iconic kangaroo court sequence is a snake's den of ironies, as Beckert is tried by murderers who gripe about the red tape inefficiencies of a legal system that would protect them if they, in turn, were arrested for their crimes. It's here that M's ultimate thesis is unearthed: not a serial killer thriller so much as a furious diatribe against public indifference against all looming evil, whether individual or systemic. And, like its unbelievably bleak final accusation, condemning every audience member who fails to be vigilant, it's as tenaciously unforgettable as it is grotesquely stunning - needless to say, you'll be 'hooked'. -9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a masterpiece in film history. Despite all the difficulties for a film to be made in the beginning of the sound era, where the influence of the techniques affect the way directors and actors make a film, M sets a mark that still continues to be solid decades later. Everything in the film is a reference, the work with photography, the work with sound, the understanding of how film grammar can still set the mise-en-sc?ne and take advantage of sound, how editing incorporates sound in a powerful way. A great film, with a story that has an impact and this resonates for people until today, a strong plot conducted by a solid director and his crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one has the right to kill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."M" (1931) isn't as much a story about child murderer and mobs attempts to capture him in order to avoid police raids, although it looked like that in the beginning, this movie is much ore then that. Although plot is intriguing and movie superbly crafted, the last 10 min of this movie are essential. They aren't about what happened to murdered, they show that what did happen to him was right. He could have been killed, but "lawyer's" speech is crucial - no one has right to kill, even if it's a child killer - it is against nature laws. It is impossible in my opinion to decide what part is right (although mother's argument is immeasurable), but i agree on one thing- no one has a right to kill - that is against nature. Overall, "M" is a great movie. It is superbly crafted (the movie was made back in 1931!), but seeing it for the first time in 2015 doesn't take away the essence - it is more of a testament film rather then dull entertainment, it must be seen. If you are looking for a fun film / thriller you could be disappointed by "M", although it's superbly paced and almost doesn't drag, it lacks the central "hero" of the story - it is more about idea, not actions. All in all this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The nasty man in black..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A weary mother chides a group of kids for singing about "the nasty man in black," a local child killer on the prowl. Meanwhile, her own daughter, Elsie, encounters a kindly stranger (Peter Lorre) who proceeds to ply the child with goodies (candy, balloons; you know the lures). Elsie has become victim number nine. Like Jack the Ripper himself, the mysterious M writes an open letter to the local newspaper. His handwriting "shows signs of pathological insanity." Police pressure on the local underworld prompts the criminals to seek the killer among their own. They must use "funds meant for our colleagues already being hosted by the authorities." Lang's camera moves among the suspects like a voyeuristic visual vulture, ever searching, always watching. (Perhaps only contemporary filmmaker John Carpenter has ever done it better.) In a truly stunning scene, we see "Beckert" (Lorre) aroused by the sight of a potential victim; he is prompted to begin whistling his signature tune- but a blind vendor selling balloons recognizes the tune (whistled when Beckert bought Elsie a balloon the day she disappeared). Beckert is marked by one of the underworld hoods and the chase is on. If there's one thing you DON'T want, it's a bunch of angry Germans chasing you... They call these Classics for a reason.</fullReview>

In this film,every beggar,common criminal,or just about anyone who wanted in,including the families directly involved in the crimes - became Detective,officer,judge,executioner,jury etc...And they all did it exactly as we secretly would - only if we could...Every moment of this movie is sincerely interesting and amazingly well made you won't be able to turn your head away for a minute.

		<shortDescription>An over-hyped film, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang is a director who is quite well known. His most famous film is the groundbreaking masterpiece Metropolis. The other film he is known for is M, his first sound film. The film tells the story of a serial killer named Hans. He only preys on children and because of this causes a massive manhunt that leaves all of Berlin on edge (it never says where in Germany it takes place, but since it's so large, I'm just saying Berlin). The police start to get out of hand, they raid bars and houses every night just to find Hans. A group of criminals get sick of this and set out to find Hans themselves. This is not a mystery story. You know who the murder is within the first 15 minutes. It's a thriller that creates tension for both parts of the audience. Those who want Hans to be caught and those who want him not to be caught. When a thriller can create tension for everyone who has their own viewpoint, you know your watching a good movie. This is why Hitchcock's Psycho works so well. Peter Lore as Hans is great. He is just so mysterious and looks rather harmless, but inside he is a broken man who needs help. Most of the cast are good, in fact. Even the child actors were O.K. Fritz Lang's direction is works really well in the field of suspense and tension. His hints of violence, but never showing the murders themselves, leaves the audience to use their imagination. Doing this you can learn a lot about yourself. I do have some problems with this film, though. My main problem is that it was a tiny bit hard to get 100% invested in the characters and their situations because we don't see much of Hans actually hunting down and killing children. The police claim him to be a terrible monster, but during the events of the movie, he only kills one child and attempts at another one, but fails and then finds another one and again fails. If he would of murdered at least two more people during the events, I would of been more invested and think "Yeah, this guy needs to be caught, he's murdered so many kids." Another flaw is that the climax is dull and repetitive. Overall, M is well acted, well directed film.....but it has flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Police and underworld hunt for a child killer payed by Peter Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the 109m restored version dating from 2000. I hadn't seen this movie in quite some time. I rate it 10/10.This is an absolutely astonishing film in every way, a masterpiece. It doesn't miss a beat.This is clearly a very early full-fledged noir. However, it is actually more neo-noir than noir because of the depth of its themes and the breadth and intricacy of its story, touching on so many facets of the society and the people in it. I have the impression that noirs of the classic era tend to be more confined or restricted in focusing on individual persons and less on the social effects of criminality on broader numbers of people, whereas neo-noirs somewhat more frequently but certainly not always address systemic issues. That is why on this viewing of M, it seemed more modern than years of movies that followed it. Other movies like that would be Panique (1946) and Roma, Open City (1945). Lang's Fury (1936) is another example as is The Sound of Fury (1950). The Chase (1966) is an early neo-noir case.What we have here is an incredible production with direction by Fritz Lang that is off the map. Everything about this picture is meticulous, the sets, the casting of the extras and smaller parts, the use of both sound and silence, the camera shots, the buildings, the architectural lines, the smoking, the food, the everyday tasks, the intercutting of the deliberations of the officials and the criminals, the use of high shots to show the vulnerability of the little girls and again to show Lorre running like a trapped animal in the street. The whole way that the sets look convey a cleanliness and an order that are belied by the human tragedies that are occurring. There is scarcely any scene that is not a work of art one way or another. The final monologue of Peter Lorre is unbelievably well-acted and completely convincing. The script delves deeply into the various attitudes toward the child murderer, without providing a ready made answer.M carries on the mass theme from Metropolis. Mobs are a symbol of mass culture, and there are other such symbols abundantly in the movie such as mass murder itself, the pressures on both police and criminals to dispense with rule of law, the similarity of police and criminals, the fascination and fears of the crowds reading the latest news, all reading the same reports, and especially the total mobilization of the city in an effort to apprehend the killer. "The Threepenny Opera" also had a form of mass mobilization, and so did "Emil and the Detectives" (co-scripted by Billy Wilder). It's all-out war.There are also surveillance and individuals spying on one another. Anonymity and not knowing others in the city encourages this and suspicion as everyone is a stranger and possibly culpable. It encourages the formation of a mob or crowd behavior in which each person is anonymous. The formation of such a mob by the criminals at the end is very interesting as at first we are shown the varying reactions -- even sympathies -- of individuals but then they are whipped into a frenzy by the head man and converge to kill Lorre. Their individual reactions vanish and they act as one. M is prophetic for our times regarding mass control. Abundant examples exist in which leaders propagate stories and propaganda that move masses and gain acceptance for their policies, here and elsewhere.Fritz Lang's camera is somehow intensely narrative in this movie. It constantly spies and reveals, participating in the surveillance and making us into voyeurs up to a point. It's imperfect. People escape the net of eyes and ears, which is too difficult to maintain. Ironically, a blind beggar holds the key to a whistled refrain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Fritz Lang (Metropolis, Secret Beyond the Door), this German film was a title I had heard of so many times, and I memorised it being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was definitely going to be watching it. Basically in Berlin, Germany, a number of child abductions and murders have been taking place, wanted posters are all over the place to find the psychopathic killer, this man lures his child victims with candy, balloons and other child-friendly items. The most substantial evidence the police, led by Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke), have collected are hand written letters from the killer himself, to be published by the press in newspapers, and also a Blind Panhandler (Georg John) who sold a man a balloon to a child remembers hearing key information to identify the killer, the man whistles Edvard Grieg's "In The Hall of the Mountain King", from the 'Peer Gynt' Suite I Op. 46 while luring the children. The police are not getting anywhere fast, as members of the paranoid public are tipping them about any person seen and quickly accused of being suspicious, but also criminals are taking the case into their own hands, wanting to catch the killer themselves while the police are straining their ability of conducting criminal activities. The killer himself, Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) is a self-loathing man, on the occasion the blind beggar recognised his whistling, he passes a message and gets a man to mark on Beckert's back the letter "M" with chalk (this stands for Mörder, meaning "murderer" in German), he eventually realises he is being followed, but gets caught by the criminals hiding in a building. Beckert in a criminal "court room" scenario is put on "trial", in a passionate monologue he explains that his urges compelled him to commit murders, which he regrets, the other criminals break the law by choice, and he pleads to be handed over to the police. The enraged mob are about to kill Beckert, but the police arrive to arrest him and the other criminals, Beckert is taken to a real courtroom where five judges will pass judgement, but the sentence is not seen, instead it cuts to many crying parents to murdered children before fading to black. Also starring Gustaf Gründgens as Safecracker/Safebreaker, Theo Lingen as Con Man, Inge Landgut as child Elsie Beckmann, Ellen Widmann as mother Frau Beckmann, Fritz Odemar as The Cheater, Theodor Loos as Inspector Groeber, Paul Kemp as Pickpocket with Six Watches, Friedrich Gnass as burglar Franz, Franz Stein as Minister and Ernst Stahl-Nachbaur as Police Chief. Lorre was best known playing sinister snivelling characters like parody, here he is genuinely rather menacing who catches and kills children, following his captures with chilling whistling. I admit the film was a little all over the place at times, especially with the concept of both police and criminals searching for the guilty man, but this being Lang's first talking picture is clever in its use of sound, from the clicking of a knife to crowd scenes, and of course the whistling, it is definitely one to be seen as a masterpiece, a great classic crime drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A serial child killer (Peter Lorre) is on the loose in the city. $10k Marks is the posted reward. The city is helpless and paranoia is spreading. All the latest forensics and police tactics are laid to bear. The police crackdown is ruining the criminal class and they join forces to find the killer themselves by calling in the organization of beggars. Polic inspectors track down Mr. Beckert. The blind balloon vendor recognizes his whistling and his friend marks Beckert with the letter M. While Beckert is hiding in a building, the criminal class gather to break in and catch the child killer themselves in one of the strangest heist movie ever. They eventually bring him to an underworld trial.This is the first sound movie from director Fritz Lang. There are the visual artistry as always. Peter Lorre and his bulging eyes are terrific. It's a sprawling story of humanity. It's got the weird view of organized crime and I love the underground justice. It's a multifaceted story coming from different angles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a film like "M" to be made in 1931 is absolutely shocking.The film is a journey through the mind of an almost child-like child murderer (the brilliant Peter Lorre) who terrorizes a German city.The film's screenwriters are geniuses crafting every single character with distinctive personalities. Also, worth noting are the themes of the film. The film deals with controversial themes such as the morality of the death penalty, criminalization of people with mental illnesses and neglectful parenting, these issues are tackled with frank honesty while also being sympathetic.The acting in this film is stellar especially Peter Lorre's performance. Lorre is successful in something that is very rare in film: he allows the viewer to feel compassion for a child murderer. Lorre plays his role not as a man to be feared, but rather a fearful man himself which is very rare in film.I also love this film's atmosphere. This film has a mysterious ambiance that adds to the suspenseful nature of the film. Also notable is the lack of music which gives the atmosphere a unnerving quality.Overall, "M" is a timeless classic that will shock and intrigue audiences for years to come. A rare flawless film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say? It is indisputably a classic in the film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My words may be redundant since Fritz Lang's unanimously accepted classic doesn't need any more empty plaudits, the fact that in his very first sound film he has already accomplished it with such unparalleled dexterity is utterly astonishing, but still I need to vent my thoughts after watching its restored 109-minutes version for the first time ever.The scenario is quite gruesome, it is a crime-drama about a serial child (girl specifically) killer Hans Beckert (Lorre), who engenders a city-wide panic in Berlin when he commits another crime and still remains at large with no clear identity. The police department is under severe pressure to dig him out but its productivity is mainly hampered by the paranoia and massive false information from the terror-stricken hoi polloi, meanwhile, local underworld business is also critically undermined by policemen's all-too-frequent ferreting and investigations, so the criminal bosses are also in line with the fervent intent to unearth the despicable murderer. Through the paralleled ways, police gleans the key clue from the information of recovered and released mentally impaired patients, whereas the gangsters utilizing the large number of beggars on the street to set an all-inclusive dragnet to pin down their object, yet it is the street-smart method has the edge and finally Hans is hunted by the gangsters inside a posh office building, after an engaging cat-and-mouse chase, Hans is caught alive to a kangaroo court in front of an angry mob just before policemen's raid. It is then, the climax crops up when Hans harrowingly confesses about his abhorrent obsession with his young targets and the losing battle with his demon inside, which doesn't mitigate the crowd's rage for sure, however, in a politically correct detour, the policemen arrive right before the lynching. Lorre munificently showcases his tour-de-force in laying bare his tormenting psyche, his popped eyes is thrilling to behold, more unbelievably he even evokes a palpable sympathy from such a monstrous creature, which unfortunately would end up be the incubus and stereotype haunting all his future career. And in a manifest fashion, Lang judiciously challenges the conundrum of the legit guideline supplying for criminals inflicted with mental illness, and asserts a sharp warning on the sane, watching over your children is the right thing to do. Technically speaking, the film is way over its time, let alone Lang's trademark impressionist allure, the cubism structures and compositions are all over the place, the ingenious usage of a whistle leitmotif which surprisingly triggers Hans' undoing is groundbreaking then and leaves indelible marks inside one's mind; DP Fritz Arno Wagner's fluid tracking lens lithely undulates in the smoking-shrouded space and patiently observes the ongoing developments. Also it is a patchwork of sound and silent pieces amalgamating together, inducing a quite bizarre transition for new audience. For me, I prefer M to Lang's other master class brainchild METROPOLIS (1927, 8/10) for its narrative intrigue and Lorre's acting potency (also, Wernicke as inspector Lohmann and Gnaß as the gutless whistle-blower Franz come strong in their prowess among a large cast), they are such formidable mammoths with brimful of innovations and genuine fruition out of committed labor of love, which eventually does make me wonder, how come Lang's later walk-of-life in Hollywood fails to match his pre-WWII superlative domestic masterpieces? I guess one can only find that out in his works, and it seriously piques my interest.</fullReview>

Good plot where suspense, slapstick and thrill mix, skilled camera work, distinct performances (particularly Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert, Otto Wernicke as Inspector Karl Lohmann) pave the way for enjoyable watching; in addition, you get an overview of lifestyle and practices in Berlin in the end of 1920ies and recognise that love for order among Germans is not just a tag... As for the issues and human approaches, you can realise that there is nothing new under the sun as well - people are and were indifferent, easily manipulated, and revengeful.Great - especially considering the year of release.

		<shortDescription>A Delirious Dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to believe this is the man's first sound film. I prefer "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse" (1933) not only as entertainment but also as an epitome of the exploration of the marriage between sight and sound, but this brilliant, too. The way he ties images and sounds together in a delirious dance makes me feel like I am at the heart of a mystery being unravelled, a symphony unfolding.I know Lang himself considered himself as a "social" director tackling "social" issues. For me his strength lies elsewhere, that is, in the beautiful editing of visually strong images into visually strong narratives. And his use of sound strengthens this: it's quite a marvel to witness how some sounds anticipate certain images and certain images give way to certain sounds.This film is most certainly an inspiration for Béla Tarr's "Werckmeister harmóniák" (2000), and unsurprisingly Tarr voted this as one of the top ten films in the 2012 Sight &amp; Sound poll. There's the same sense of societal paranoia that projects into the black-and-white frame, especially in the crowd scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early masterpiece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is among the oldest films I have ever watched and the fact that it is now over 80 years old is very interesting because this films gives us a portal to the Germany of the time of the last years of Weimar's republic during the great depression that preceded the rise of Nazism.It is also a very powerful film and highly engaging. The climax is one of the most powerful moments in film and it truly captures the spirits of a country that would in a few years, declare war on the rest of the world.Still, this film is not without flaws and thus I have deducted one point from it's score: the simple fact is that before the 1950's nobody was able to produce a film that was satisfactory on all levels, the first of such films was Seven Samurai. So I would rate this film as perhaps one of the top 5 films ever made before Seven Samurai (1954), about as good as Citizen Kane, with a better ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film, the great Fritz Lang. The story is entertaining, suspenseful, shortcuts, track. A solid script and good pace. Until there is a good film normal. But M has those details that make it a masterpiece, visual treatment, the director's vision ... Throughout the film we see the effect of acusmatia, sound effect that makes us imagine, that shows the importance of sound in film, five years since the arrival of talkies, Lang used this in a great way, plans show us a part of this universe that we make M, and the sound gives us another piece of information and you do just superb. The camera shots are enigmatic in any sense, based on this story unfolds seamlessly, making this a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Study Of Paraphilias And It's Consequence In Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first let's point out that Peter Lorre gives a brilliant and very daring performance as a pedophile child murderer. the performance is daring because few actors would choose to play such a squeamish role. secondly i must note that director Fritz Lang must have been a born sociologist and psychologist.i've seen few films that deal with deviancy and it's consequence in society with this kind of natural insight. the insight here is both intuitive and instinctive obviously because it doesn't deal with the subject in dry text form.it's chilling to hear Lorre's pedophile scream out in agony "i can't stop", and "i don't know what i'm doing". the kangaroo court by underworld criminals desperate to put a end to the rampage of terror is all to real when studying the treatment of pedophiles behind prison bars. all this knowingly and effectively carried out by cinema master Lang.few films today dare to even deal with this touchy social issue or explore it with the same intelligent, social conscience. this is pure genius.footnote; i must also point out that Criterion distributors have done it again by putting out a beautifully restored print with a wonderful, clear remastered audio track. bravo to Criterion for giving us a superior viewing of yet another cinema masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's first talkie is one of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M is one of the most controversial films of the 1930's, a film that explores the power of the human spirit and the depravity of it as well. The film works because it shows us the mind of a serial killer and the beauty within the killer as well. This haunting picture also shows us the similarities between police and criminal, showing how both have hearts in the same image. The film is a great moral statement, it's not excessive or exploitive, nor is it under-played and sentimentalized, but somewhere in-between. It's as scandalous as any slasher film these days, but it boasts greater moral intention, more creative camera angles, and more of a lasting impact than any modern horror-thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a young movie buff, I have seen a limited the amount of foreign classics. M topped off all the other foreign films I've seen and showed me what a master Fritz Lang is and how Peter Lorre is a brilliant actor!Fritz Lang's M is one of cinema's great achievements. An unmistakable classic, this heavy German thriller was highly criticized upon its original release, whereas today it's never looked, sounded and been more exciting than ever. Fritz Lang's famous name is most often associated with Metropolis, hailed as one of the greatest silent films ever made, but M is equally enthralling and brilliant, if not better. Directing with an unmistakable style and outstanding effort, Lang smartly sets up the thrilling story and shows the script through unforgettable visuals, terrific psychological suspense and brilliant staging of the murders, the police effort and the thrilling chase and trial scenes.In his finest performance, Peter Lorre proved to me that he is one of the great actors of the classic film era. Portraying such a complex psychopath, Lorre makes the audience hate, as well as feel pity for his character, which is an incredibly difficult task. Performing silent for most of the film, Lorre finally speaks in the outstanding closing Trial scene, where he unforgettably pleads insanity in a speechless moment. Lang and his wife Thea Von Harbou collaborated on the thrilling script, and used both sound and silent moments to tell the horrifying psychological story of Franz Becker, (the beginning of Lorre's great villain roles) a psychopathic serial child-killer who causes a frightening uproar in Germany. He is wanted by the police and citizens, yet the police can't get much further in their case. Becker's killing doesn't only disturb the large police force and four and a half million citizens, but disrupts the city's criminals at a point where they decide they must find the killer and eventually suspect Becker.A true achievement by all means, Lang's M is one of my favourite psychological thrillers. The brilliant staging, terrific use of sound, (despite there being no musical score) and inspiring camera, acting and writing techniques all help shape this thriller as a cult-classic. An unusual piece of storytelling, M is presented through a series of montage like techniques that add up to the portrait of a German city in terror before being converted into a true mystery-thriller in the second half.The film's oddities can get picture down and make it too slow and boring to comprehend, yet there hardly worth criticizing. The lighting and use of shadows make the film look like a foreign noir, and the social-drama and satire help the film remain entertaining even when it seems to drag on. The screenplay is entirely unforgettable, as it takes a risky story and makes that into a creative emphasize of Becker's psychosis and has the murders and chases all the more entertaining. Lang and his wife's work makes you both hate and feel sorry for the villain which is a hard task to do. Their work has some terrific lines of dialogue and features some brilliant scenes (especially the final courtroom sequence) which allows Lang to give outstanding camera work.Like I said at the beginning of my review, Lorre is brilliant and gives his finest work. His portrayal of Becker never gets boring and leaves you speechless right after his brilliant trial finale. He is superb as a villain and floats hauntingly through the various psychological scenes. His bug-eyes make him all the more frightening and his expressionistic style of his performance make him horribly remarkable.Fritz Lang's unique work may be his greatest. The picture is a heck of a thriller and his directing perfectly compliments the film's darkness. His strange thrilling style is best-shown here as he gives some of his most famous haunting angles and shows great movement in scenes with multiple characters. He also uses the lighting, shadows and sounds to express the film's horrifying reality and help stage the film brilliantly. Altogether, Lang's M is one of foreign cinemas greatest and a frighteningly real psychological treat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Fritz Lang 'talkie' from 1931 starring Peter Lorre? Good stuff!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an early German film (with subtitles for those that fear them) about a child molester and murderer. It's quite an interesting film that slowly draws you in and before you know it, you're hooked. Fritz Lang had great vision in his earlier works, particularly in Metropolis made just four years earlier and it really shows in this early 'talkie'. I'll give you my thoughts after this very brief summary.A child murderer is about and he's taunting the police by writing to the newspapers. The whole neighbourhood is up in arms about it and the police are leaving no stone uncovered in order to find the culprit. This, unfortunately, comes at a price, a price the local crime bosses aren't prepared to pay. To this end they get together and enlist the help of the local beggars to keep an eye on the children. This pays off and they are soon on the trail of one Hans Beckert, who they trap in an office building. At the same time the police also have a line on Herr Beckert and are closing in on the same target. Who will get to him first? I had better not say any more or the Interpol branch of the Spoiler Police will be after me as well.For its day this is an exceptionally well made film with a lot of techniques that are still used today. There are good performances all round, but head and shoulders above the rest was Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert, he definitely had star quality. One thing I did miss about this one was that there is no incidental music, in fact, no orchestral score at all. This leads to a very stark effect that can make it all sound a little bit strange. I did also find it a little long as a consequence; with no music to break it up we have to rely solely on the visuals. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are great for the most part, but it's a tough act to hold the attention of the audience. I enjoyed this film though; it has some quality about it that keeps you watching? Recommended.My Score: 8.3/10.IMDb Score: 8.6/10 (based on 47,551 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 100/100 (based on 40 reviews counted at the time of going to press).FAVOURITE QUOTES: Hans Beckert: I can't help what I do! I can't help it, I can't... Criminal: The old story! We never can help it in court! Hans Beckert: What do you know about it? Who are you anyway? Who are you? Criminals? Are you proud of yourselves? Proud of breaking safes or cheating at cards? Things you could just as well keep your fingers off. You wouldn't need to do all that if you'd learn a proper trade or if you'd work. If you weren't a bunch of lazy bastards. But I... I can't help myself! I have no control over this, this evil thing inside of me, the fire, the voices, the torment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films in early sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is my understanding that this is Fritz Lang's first talkie after perhaps a dozen silent films. His use of sound in "M" is astounding. There are scenes of many minutes duration where there is complete silence as characters strive desperately to catch or evade someone. As a scene switches from a character in the street looking in a window to inside the window looking at the character, street sounds come and go with the abruptness of the cut. Lang understood sound in his very first talkie, and he used sound as well as he used the camera.The story is compelling, and the characters are, too. Children are being murdered, and the public is clamoring for the murderer to be caught. Inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together with the help of the criminal underground.Lang's direction is brilliant, and Peter Lorre shows great talent that ended up being wasted as sidekicks and as Mr. Moto."M" is available on Cinevault.com. This version is listed as High Definition, and it's the best copy of the film I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's "M" is a masterpiece of cinematography, direction, editing, and acting. The silent eeriness of the static shots, and the emotional intensity and energy of the raging crowds are both equally arresting. There are moments so tense that I can feel the sweat on my palms, and others, such as the murderer's plea for mercy, that challenge my personal moral biases and my concepts of justice.The film does a great job of drawing the viewer in, snatching your attention from the opening frame and never letting go. It works on many levels: it's an enthralling murder mystery; a brave character study; and a sociological examination of the mob mentality and the way fear often drives us in directions we would not normally go. Perhaps even more interesting is that the film must have been bold or even controversial at the time, but even by today's standards, it addresses issues and challenges societal preconceptions that most films steer away from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen Peter Lorre before, but for the first time I really SAW him in "M".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About three months ago I saw this film for the very first time. It was one of those "eye-opening" experiences for me. I recall being a child and seeing Peter Lorre in movies with Vincent Price and a couple of Bugs Bunny cartoons as the mad scientist. I had always thought that he was a bit creepy. But the first time I saw "M" made me notice Peter Lorre as a man.I won't include any spoilers, but I did discover some things about this film. It was directed by the great Fritz Lang of "Metropolis" fame and was also the first film about a serial murderer. It gives a rare glimpse of the buildings and general life of pre-war Berlin, touches on the forensics of the day and, in the end, forces the viewer to take mental illness into consideration when dealing with crime in society. It's sudden cut-off at the end of the film was done before in "Metropolis", but here it leaves the audience with a different thought to ponder: what is to be done with people like this that commit these types of crimes? Peter Lorre was extremely convincing in this role that eventually earned him international recognition. At one point in the movie, we get a brief glimpse of his character observing himself in a mirror. We are made to wonder, "What is he thinking when he sees himself there? Does he know who he is or what it is that he has done?" Peter plays the character so well that it is literally the first time I really noticed him. He is young, rotund, not very attractive but something about that particular shot, even at just a few seconds, is striking to me. I noticed his character, felt a kind of disgust mingled with pity, which made me notice Peter Lorre, which made me realise his extraordinary talent to make the audience believe that he is the person that he is playing. Suddenly he becomes very attractive to me. His unusual eyes peer at his reflection and instantly he is type-cast forever in his subsequent films. Another reviewer pointed out that only liberals would have sympathy for Hans Beckert. I have to disagree strongly. Sympathy transcends all political parties. What happens in this movie is the realisation that the mentally disturbed often do NOT have control over their actions and reactions. Their brain chemistry does not function the way it does in a person that is normal. In many cases it leads them to do strange things or even what is the unthinkable. Some of these people do not know or even realise what they have done until after the action has happened. For this I pity Hans Beckert and others like him. If he knew what he was doing he would not have done it. That much is related at the end of the movie. Yet we are still left with the nagging question: what does society do with these dangerous individuals that sometimes do not know what they have done? Is it right to simply imprison them? Should they undergo psychotherapy and eventually be released again or kept in an institution where they will not endanger the members of society beyond the hospital walls? Or shall we demand the ultimate price of them? How can we punish them when oftentimes their crime is not pre-meditated but instead a reaction to their brain's unusual chemistry? The debate goes on, I suppose.I would like very much to have seen Peter Lorre play other roles which he very much wanted to do. Would he have been as good as say, Jimmy Stewart, in "It's A Wonderful Life"? Perhaps we could never imagine him in such a role because of his great talent playing a shady foreigner. Sadly, he is gone now and we will never know how well he might have done them or what impact it could have had on his audiences.This film is a treasure for movie lovers, particularly for people that love classic cinema, the foundational pieces of art upon which our modern movies are built. Peter Lorre is a man well loved even today and whose talents will endure in the hearts and minds of his admirers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M is about a child murderer played by Peter Lorre, the great character actor. While the other players aren't familiar to me, they all do an excellent job. This film was done in the early days of talking pictures or movies. So the audience has to be aware that the English subtitles may not be complete but it doesn't matter. The film classic depicts a dark side in this black and white film about human crimes. Peter Lorre plays the killer in his best role. I thought the film was chilling enough about every mother and father's worst crisis. It's interesting to note that the cast list refers to Lorre as the murderer. Anyway, the killer is hunted down not only by the authorities but other criminals who seek vigilante justice of their own which may be more frightening than the actual court case. The killer becomes the hunted prey by ruthless predators seeking justice for crimes against children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without Lorre, M would not have been half as memorable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's M is a recognized masterpiece in film history. Released in the early 30s, it's most remembered for Peter Lorre's chilling performance as a serial child murderer. Lorre's character, Hans Beckert, is a complex one. It requires a certain sadistic yet humanistic approach to it, in which Lorre's expressiveness with his eyes is vital. Without Lorre, M would not have been half as memorable.In my opinion, M fails in the part of narration. It's average storytelling in a too straightforward manner, often deactivating my interest at times. The middle parts are the most painstaking to sit through, but thankfully, the film redeems itself at the end with a conclusion that is likely to stun most viewers. M is essentially a social commentary on 1930s Germany during the Great Depression when most ordinary folks were criminals living on scraps and stolen items. While it doesn't fully capture the mood of that era as well as I expect, Peter Lorre steals the show when it matters most.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn those Germans are rough with their Expressionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's actually lesser known masterpiece is bedrock for film and society and societal observation/interaction in a post world wars world. After Metropolis' flop at the box office (though massively loved in later years thanks to Superman cartoons and Herr Goebbels) Lang turned to much more naturalistic fare and turned from the overly stylized world of German Expressionism.Though some overt lighting, exaggerated camera angles and a fresh-from- silent-acting Peter Lorre may stage-ify M, its illustration of paranoia in civilization is still cutting edge. M follows the capture of a pedophiliac serial killer; sure it's a cliché to today's CSI and Nancy Grace-drenched audience, but in 1931 it was still pretty chilling. What sets M apart from other psychological thrillers (either then or now) is the focus on fear due to physical violence rather than the violence itself. That is, the only evidence that a small girl is abducted is a symbolic balloon tangling in some electrical wires.Instead, Lang follows an interlaced plot of Berlin's police force and Berlin's criminal force. Due to this especially hateful crime, both sides of the law are out for Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre). This is where the only dating of the film occurs: Fingerprinting seems to be a new fangled invention. This leads us to the idea, and conclusion of the film, that primitive passion is way more effective than coolly cornering a criminal. The mob boss has the bright idea to hire the homeless to track for suspicious characters. Lang interlaces this with coppers rounding up the usual suspects and filling their cells with obviously innocent run-of-the-mill criminals in a giddy blaze of self righteousness. Yep, we never see that little girl again, and the police pretty quickly forget about the mother; the mob boss never cared that there was a mother in the first place. What they don't lose sight of is Peter Lorre and his creepy cum cute chub. A beggar chances on the killer and chases him down. Only here does the title become apparent. The beggar draws a giant "M" in chalk and nonchalantly slaps Beckert's shoulder so all the mob scouts can join in the chase.What ensues is a chase scene shot from above to emphasize a rat maze claustrophobia. The only comic relief in the film comes at this point where the petty criminals act as we would expect a swat team to do. Eventually they ferret him out of a dark and sodden wood hole in the attic and take him down to their world?a cement walled basement! There, they continue their sham of justice (lest we forget that earlier in the film they were being strong armed by the law because they were the only people worth suspecting) with a fair trial. Despite a riveting plea for mercy on Beckert's part (a performance worthy of Charlize Theron's MONSTER or Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal) the "jury" quickly devolves to a mob again, complete with pitchforks.Beckert, coming so close to being sympathetic in the face of this mob, is saved only by the law who breaks in at the last second. Their only ability, the whole movie, is to track normal criminals, and track them they do, just in time to claim credit for the arrest.Statements made by Lang: Pedophiles and murderers suck, but mass paranoia is scarier. Also, Johnny Law is next to useless unless you are committing a crime committed by these five guys over here first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A child murderer is top priority.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang directs and co-writes a chilling crime melodrama that will have you not necessarily in suspense as much as anxious. The setting is 1931 Berlin and the top priority of the local police is to find an elusive child murderer Hans Beckert(Peter Lorre). The pursuit of the pedophile uses early fingerprinting and handwriting techniques. The local underworld's "business" is cramped with the cops and their steadfast hunt for the serial killer. The criminals decide to hunt down Beckert themselves to take the heat off their activities. They enlist street beggars to keep a watch out for the killer. Once Beckert is fingered , he becomes a marked man...literally. Will he be caught by Inspector Lohmann's(Otto Wernicke)police force or end up a victim of an underworld kangaroo court?Lorre is tremendous in his first starring role. He aptly conveys the desperation of a cornered man. His facial expressions tell volumes. This will typecast him as a big screen villain for years. If this was translated into English and the subtitles dropped, I would rate this movie higher. But to think a movie this good being filmed in 1931 is amazing. Other players include: Inge Landgut, Ellen Widmann, Paul Kemp, Theodor Loos and Fritz Odemar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lang's twisting, turning, thrilling tale of a killer on the run and danger around most corners holds up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an immediacy to this film; there's something that makes Fritz Lang's 1931 film distinctly menacing throughout. Whether it's the distinct intimacy of certain scenes, which take place in enclosed spaces such as underground bars and locked storage rooms; the manipulation of light to create bizarre images and shapes as familiar and somewhat usually unspectacular places are rendered spaces of terror or, indeed, 'uncanny'; the idea that the most powerful 'groups' of characters are additionally the more unlikeable; or just the frank and sheer immediacy of the title, 'M', something in Lang's 1931 picture always seems to just toy with the audience. 'M' is a sublimely taught and somewhat creepy little film that basks in its breaking down of genre convention and thoroughly enjoys its swaying in and out of scenes, elements and subject matter that both thrill and horrify in equal measure.The film was made by a man on a seemingly insatiable run for making movies; some will argue he never made a better one than this. Lang's 1931 piece is so accomplished that watching it decades later, ticking off the influences and ideas spawned because of it borders on a little game within itself; from John Mackenzie's 1980 effort The Long Good Friday, to the much more contemporary and far more reliant on ambiguity and symbolism, Lady Vengeance; Lang's M knows no bounds in terms of levels of influence.The world in which M takes place is a frightening and confusing one; a world in which public hysteria and paranoia grips practically everyone. A world in which a police force are experimenting with new techniques in catching criminals and must venture into this investigation blind; a film in which criminals and organised gangs of criminals feel the need to step to the forefront, thus threatening to take on the role of the protagonists as we will them on in their goals, but it is a drive born out of loss of income that takes control within the minds of those that head the operations, thus placing their actions on a fine line between righteous and ignorant. But above all this, a world in which a child killing individual is made the focus of interest and the sole reason all the hate, confusion and anger is born.M starts in a manner that captures some of what its overall themes will observe. A group of young girls are about to commence a street-set game, and in order to select those first to take part, one member of the group uses a particularly blood thirsty rhyme to 'pick out' a random child. The scene echoes not only what it is the evil within the film indulges in, but highlights a certain juxtaposition that will be prominent later on; in the sense young and innocent girls sing about blood-shed and murder, while supposedly hardened and unlikeable criminals whom run underground bars, are on the hunt to capture a murderer. The notion of evil fighting evil is prominent and Lang plays with this notion when, in what is one of my favourite scenes from the film, the aforementioned killer is trapped in a room and the criminals are closing in ? we have to remind ourselves of Lorre's character's past deeds to save wanting him to get out.The film does indeed revolve around Lorre's character; a certain Hans Beckert. The film has no shame in revealing who he is and precisely what he is very early on; this is less-so a detective story posing the question "who's doing it?" as much as it is a film asking how someone can go about being caught and stopped. A lot of the eeriness of Lorre's Beckert comes from the actor's 'patched up' look and expressive face; that child-like expression, that odd look he carries at the most relaxed of times, that worried and juxtaposed sense of excitement and fear that grips him when a net led by mobsters closes in. This is in great credit to the casting of Lorre, in relation to face and figure, and how he himself delivers a performance that gets across a sense of blood-lust, madness and dread at well spaced intervals.The sense of technique and progression in M in relation to capturing the killer acts as one of the film's more interesting diversions. Perhaps acting as a representation of modernity, the police force and their methods of apprehension are shot in stark contrast to how the lower-downs of society go about their business. In this sense, the criminals, who are in it purely out of loss of income, use the lowest of the low in street-dwelling beggars and the homeless to keep a look out for who might be the killer. This cross comparison of new methods, which prove unsuccessful, and 'old fashioned'grounded techniques that prove useful, is interesting. As a film that blurs lines between what is frightening and what it thrilling; who is good and who is evil, and how the clear-cut representation of 'good' in the police force is placed in the background for most a film of this ilk, M is a monstrous triumph. In regards to exploring German cinema from whatever era, be sure to include M as a film to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Over the Children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so rich in depth and meaning. It tackles so many important themes and treats even that examination as a mystery, revealing the primary message only in the last line.The startling thing is how we are drawn into a film that doesn't have a main character. It's a composition in which the eye is batted back and forth between citizens. But Lang isn't telling a story from these perspectives necessarily; rather, we are the protagonist, the viewer. We explore, probe, move from character to character, group to group. We probe, sneakily, all the architectural turns, transitioning like a mind does from one scene seamlessly to another. We move in spurts toward characters as they have realizations of truth, as if we're the truth they're trying to grasp. We pass through sets of eyes along the way assuming a particular character's perspective, possessing him until we abandon him and move on to another. We intercut between the pols and the syndicate -- because the society is our object, not a single man, not a single group, and we are the subject.It's hard not to relate this to our experience the past eight years: a fear consumes an entire society, there is an object of that fear but it's beyond our grasp and our understanding, and it makes shameless, impassioned vigilantes of us all.But, like I mentioned above, I think the real mystery is the theme. So many are examined: who committed the murders?; how best to catch the villain?; what's the best way to deal with him, should we trust justice or is there a higher justice not the law? And Lang only reveals the answer at the very end: watch over the children. And children should not be taken entirely literally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is simply not a film like this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if the rating system on IMDb went up to 100, I'd still rate this film 101, at least. There is simply not a film like M (except, perhaps, for the uncalled-for remake); it is unique in every way: From the storyline, the camera shots, the killer lines, the emotions involved and the audience's response. Also, there is something very odd about the film, which is the fact that this film does not contain any background music at all; creating an eerie feel to the film, and also it somewhat involves the audience into the film.After watching this film for the first time, I couldn't help but admire Fritz Lang's genius behind it. Especially more so, as this was his first sound film. But he even seemed to have mastered the art of sound films, as well!! And Peter Lorre's acting... this film was what made him recognised as an excellent actor. And it is evident; his acting seems natural (which is quite a worrying thought), and there could not have been a better performance from any other actor.If you are more of a fan of modern filming, I must warn: it may seem very drawn out. Unlike modern filming, Fritz Lang's films tend to be very meticulous in the story details, which I personally think is a good point. Also, there is no 'real' on-screen violence; if you were expecting blood and violence, you will probably be disappointed; the art of German Expressionism in films (M is a G.Expressionist film) is that the horrors are subjective, which is what makes this film purely excellent.This film is simply unique. I have never before seen a film like it. Combined with Fritz Lang's genius and Peter Lorre's talents, it has risen to the status of my favourite film. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who favours this film above all others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A warning to nazified Germany?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This very humane reminder of what being civilized means really shocked me, as it was made in 1931, just as the Darkness of the Nazis horrors was spreading over Germany. It wasn't just little children murdered by one sexual deviant, but millions of men, women and children murdered by an insane country. Hitler didn't kill all those folks by himself.The free lawyer for the accused by the Band of Beggars and Thieves, one of whom has murdered 3 people, points out that the murderer could not help himself. He was sick and needed a doctor. So what was Germany's excuse: the whole country needed a doctor? As I watched the beggars in their shelter, I thought, "This looks just like our homeless shelters here in my civilized humane country." What amazes me in this excellent film is what doesn't happen: these guys don't tear this animal limb from limb, don't lynch him as we have done here in the U.S. for far less, simply suspicion. And yet they are the dregs of society.The police are made to be laughable , yet in their own way, their are using forensic science in a way unaided by all the fancy technology we have today. The unity of this Beggar's Union also intrigued me. I really appreciated the camera angles of the director,as he showed the cornered rat, Peter Lorre. Lorre himself showed an excellent, if somewhat exaggerated style (as was the practice then) of what was going on with this guy internally. I would have like to know what he did for a living, how he managed to support himself, as a 'parolee' from either a prison or an asylum.I understand it was remade in 1951. I would very much like to know more about the comparison. And how did this movie differ from the real "Vampire of Dusseldorf" or the REAL guy this movie was supposed to be about. The point about there being no connection between the murderer and the children making it harder to identify the murderer was the same point made in "Henry, a Serial Killer". That guy suffered no torment, this one did. Yet both killed. Interesting perspective.Why wouldn't someone with these internal tendencies be able to go to a psychiatrist and say, "Help me"? (before he murders) Does this ever happen, I wonder?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man in black will soon be here ? M</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One could say that cinema has been copying M throughout the decades. With impeccable cinematography?save one very odd and disturbing shot of Inspector Lohmann?fantastic editing and montage work, a mesmerizing performance from Peter Lorre, and a careful use of sound, there is very little to fault. Not only technically sound, the underlying politics of the events at hand, the question of whether a justice system is flawed when murderers can be let go due to insanity, really intrigue. It's not just about a manhunt for a child killer, it is a race between the law and the criminal underworld to find him and carry out whichever brand of punishment gets enforced first.Lang creates one of the most memorable opening sequences I've ever seen. A perfect set-up to the events that have been occurring while also introducing the monster lurking behind the scenes with his welcoming whistle; it is orchestrated to perfection. Subtly giving the audience the details, Lang makes us a part of this world, invested in the manhunt, trying to figure out a way for him to be captured, instilling a bloodlust in us, making the final verdict a tough decision to swallow. The little girls play jump rope while singing a song about the "man in black" despite the chiding of one's mother for them to stop. These killings have become a part of their lives, young and old, leaving an indelible mark on the community. And then comes the whistling, so cheerful and warm, what child could resist this man's offering of candy and balloons? All we see at first is a silhouette covering over his wanted poster on a street post, adding to the mystery and fear, despite what appears to be just a nice man on a stroll. There is truly nothing more heartbreaking then watching young Elsie's mother go room to room of her apartment, calling her daughter's name after she is late from school. Lang's static shots of the emptiness: the bare dinner plate, the unpopulated clothing room, and the sterile geometry of the stairwell with a hope that she may soon ascend become tough to stomach. And it all ends with a close-up shot outdoors?focusing on nothing?a bush in frame to the right. Soon, though, Elsie's ball slowly rolls from the foliage into frame, a haunting image standing in for the tragedy we all know just occurred.It's not all artistry and craft setting the tone, but also wonderful storytelling. While the public is in an uproar for the safety of their streets, paranoid and lashing out on any unsuspecting man who appears to be talking to a child, the crime world becomes concerned because they are losing business and money. With raids on bars and seedy joints, identification papers are asked for and the police seem to be doing their jobs, if not actually looking for the killer. As they say, though, this man is probably a kind, gentle creature, someone you know as a friend, who just snaps when the time is right. It won't be an easy case, because the man they are seeking only exists when he is doing the deed. Thus, the criminals begin their own hunt, to find the cause of their troubles, while also ridding the world of a killer, a man that the state doesn't have the right to deem "reformed" only to let back out to kill again. The question becomes whether a man who isn't held responsible for his actions can truly be given the blame. You need to come to grips with your own moral compass on that topic, because while you want him dead, you also feel sympathetic for his lack of control on his urges. Can the blame really be placed on the community?the parents who weren't diligent enough to watch their own children while they were snatched from them? Maybe there isn't anyone at absolute fault. Once you bring psychology into the equation, the problem only gets more confusing and tough to decipher, blurring that line between black and white, until the demarcation disappears completely.It's a credit to Lorre's skill as an actor for allowing the audience to feel some remorse for him, despite the atrocities he has been committing. This is a time in cinema where sound was still being learned and its use in film becoming honed through trial and error. As a result, Lorre is a mix of silent film styling with sound added in. His expressions are big, but it all works along with his troubled soul, cowering in the face of a mob wanting blood, unable to remember the crimes he committed. He is a lost soul that needs help, but also needs to be stopped. With such an expressive face, Lang enhances his performance by only bringing sound in when necessary. He is unafraid to have moments of complete silence, marked by strong scratches and tapping of the killer, focusing all our attention exactly where it needs to be. M is the epitome of how a script can be directed in a way that allows the audience to follow along and understand each step of the way. Lang has a story to tell of corruption, violence, love, and loss. He tells it in a way that leads the viewers along a specific path, yet still keeps ambiguity as far as our feelings on what is happening. The groundwork is laid, but it is up to us to decide where we fall on the subject of responsibility. If a mother who fails to look at her child for one moment can be blamed for the child's disappearance, then doesn't the man who took her deserve it too, whether he was in his right mind or not? It's a slippery slope that crops up in court decisions even today and yet it was handled deftly way back in 1931 Germany, even getting by the Berlin censor board ? showing that the topic won't be solved anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way ahead of its time as well as anyone else's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the attention that this film received in 1931 when it was released in Germany, I am sure people failed to understand the real success of the story. It wasn't just the fact that director Fritz Lang was able to communicate heinous crimes through simple images, or that he flawlessly mixed German Expressionism with film-noir, a genre that had yet to be completely understood. The real reason this film has stood the test of time is the fact that it features some of the finest examples of direction and storytelling ever used. The way Lang communicates the very nature of Hans Breckert's crimes is foreboding and unforgettable. It was also not acceptable during the much conservative early twentieth century, but Lang could have cared less, rather willing to go for the most disturbing images and plot.Despite all the controversy surrounding it when released, Fritz Lang has delivered a thought-provoking story about a man committing horrible acts that are terrorizing a city even though he knows he shouldn't but can't help himself. The police are on him, as well as the underworld of criminals who seem to think that Breckert deserves punishment more than they do. The film opens up with some very strong images and closes strongly as well. Pacing here is not a problem and the acting lends its hand to flesh out these characters as they attempt to solve this case. If you are not one for subtitles, don't try to keep up with this. However, if solid acting, splendid directing, and plenty of dark themes attract your attention, M delivers with plenty to spare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Just you wait, it won't be long. The man in black will soon be here. With his cleaver's blade so true, he'll make mincemeat out of you."Thus starts "M", a horrific and brilliant film, with this morbid child's nursery rhyme which foreshadows things to come. There is something about the use of children singing grim nursery rhymes that I always find eerie. But it is more than the use of a simple song that makes "M" a disturbing tale and a grim look into the mind of a child serial killer.From the first silhouette of the murderer and his whistling that creepy tune (I have heard this classical piece several times but can't think of the name of it ) and the use of the ball rolling away, the balloon floating and the mother frantically calling to show the little girl's death, the viewer is presented with a chilling tale of child murder and vigilante justice that will keep one's attention from start to finish.When police surveillance and investigation of a series of child murders starts to interfere with the criminal activities of organized criminals, they decide that it would be better if the murderer were captured and dealt with quickly. But who will catch him, the police or them?This is a really powerful film, that is visually stunning because of its focus on detail and the brilliant use of lighting and contrast. It is a film that also focuses on character development and the performance by Peter Lorre as the psychotic child killer is chilling. He does such a good job in fact, that I wouldn't have been surprised if people stopped him on the street after the movie thinking that he really was a child murderer.There are many questions raised about the nature of justice, punishment and vigilantism, as well as responsibility for one's actions in the setting of mental illness. And the treatment of these in the film certainly is interesting.The Criterion Collection edition that I watched has a beautiful transfer in picture and sound quality, as well as a lot of extras that are worth having. While I haven't seen other versions, this is definitely worth buying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A phenomenal film in nearly every way, "M" is genuinely chilling and doesn't present Lorre's child-killer as sympathetic, even though he is driven by a compulsion to kill. The black and white photography is stunning - to the point where you don't even notice it's black and white, if that makes sense. Camera angles are fascinating and mostly off-kilter, lending a sense of madness to the viewer. Even the use of sound - and this was very early in filmdom to rely so heavily on sound to produce mood - is stunning.The plot doesn't dwell on the details of the child murders, which makes them somehow more horrible, especially if you've read of Peter Kurten's exploits. And shots like the one where Peter Lorre first sees the room of accusers can knock the wind out of you. The ending - where we don't quite get the resolution we wanted - still packs a punch as well. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Cinema's Most Outstanding and Outliving Achievements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M was unfortunately caught in the transition between the change in aspect ratio from the silent era to sound, leading to a frame incongruous to any available format from theater to television. It was also during a time when translation for international distribution required entirely re-shooting certain scenes, often with different actors. The German version is the original film directed by Fritz Lang. Be sure that you see the original German version. In 1931, when one's rarely disappointed expectations are to have to look past stagy overacting, glaringly scripted dialogue and an oversimplified script in order to enjoy a movie, Lang created a film that still holds its own today, in terms of style, production values, acting, and social significance.What is particularly charming about M is its even still unprecedented blend of disturbing film about child murder and a seriously disturbed mind, and a gangland procedural with its tongue half in its cheek due to our scoffs of impressed reaction at their wit and sneaky maneuvers. The film opens with a ring of children playing and chanting a rhyme about a child murderer. This warns of the appearance of a serial killer who preys on children in 1930s Berlin. At the outset, we do not see the face of Peter Lorre, who plays the killer with a riveting self-torture. As in the grand style of the German Expressionist cinema mainly of the silent era, we only see his shadow and images of his body, hearing him whistle an intense melody by Edvard Grieg while he purchases a balloon from a blind man and gives it to a little girl. Lang then cuts to her mother, seeking and calling for her hysterically as we see the balloon floating up into the telephone wires.Meanwhile, still through definitive montage, but with a fast pace that carries an almost contemporary feel, the police hunt Loree by means of such advanced police procedures as fingerprinting and handwriting analysis. They also raid speakeasies and other crook hangouts, arresting the proverbial usual suspects under the presumptive lack of discernment between gangland crime and serial murder of little children. At the same time as the police work around the clock, the Berlin criminal element grows to be more and more worried about the murder spree. Not only is it troublesome for their dealings to have the police nosing in, but it is offensive to be grouped together in the same ballpark as a child killer. Tight suspense mounts as a race progresses between the police and the criminals to trap the killer, who is totally oblivious to what is materializing.What is particularly important about M is the moral dilemma Lang's film strikes comparing Lorre's child murderer and the thieves and racketeers. Lorre plays an enormously disturbed sociopath, a victim of his own warped urges. He lurks in the shadows in shame and self-hate, unable to justify his deeds. The gangsters, who maintain honor amongst their underworld, lionize themselves with their dogged pursuit of Lorre, who is a logical tool with which they can justify their lifestyle. We do not reach any conclusions before the film does. M realizes the easy distinction between pure evil and decadent corruption at the same time it refuses to judge one against the other. According to M, they are both social harms and setbacks of the human mind. As M unravels, its twists are stunning albeit not visible. Rather than plot twist, the story elusively unravels altering investments in the characters on our part as the audience. We come to see that Lorre is not the only one who bears some sort of psychological disorder. The difference is that he suffers from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang pulls out another great piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally had a chance to watch the restored version of this film and have to say that, again, the subject matter was way ahead of its time. I am a bit confused by the comments of others that say the bad guy in this movie was somehow infantile or childish / child-like. That's just beyond inaccurate. He's a 100%, hears-voices-in-his-head, "I must kill to quiet the voices", driven killer. One of the things I would like to point out in this movie is how "German" it is, if that makes any sense. The spoken German in this can be oft harsh as the volume and sound levels can sometimes spike and be a bit distorted but you kind of get to peek at the 1920s/30s German mindset and zeitgeist and see it projected onto the screen. Sometimes the gritty acting is pretty risqué even by 1930s standards and I don't think the US started seeing movies like this until MUCH later. I defy anyone to point out something similar in caliber to this movie that was made in the US before 1931. One thing everyone in this movie and likely in most societies agree upon: child killer should die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Things I liked about this movie: 1) the lighting isn't high-contrast. A great example of how early black and white films could still have perfect lighting. 2) They relied on visuals *and* dialogue to tell the story. For example during the first predatory scene, instead of hearing the girl cry out or yell, we see her balloon float away, followed by a shot of her ball rolling down the hill and stopping at the bottom. This indicates that she's been killed. The effect is chilling - far more so than any dialogue would have been. I wish more modern movies would use this technique to tell crucial parts of a story. 3) The ending - without spoiling anything, it's interesting to note which side you agreed with and then to ask yourself if that's something you would normally do. Many people have brought up the Nazi paranoia in this film, but I think it goes beyond the film. If you place yourself within the ending scene (and how can you not?), you can get a feel for which side you might have been on in WWII...and it might not be what you want to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An allegory on pre-Nazi Germany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised how few people have pointed out how this film fore-shadows the coming of the Third Reich to Germany. "M" was released two years before the Nazis seized power. Fritz Lang had trouble making it because the films original title "Murderers Among Us", caused many Nazi Party members to assume it was about them. Of course, they weren't entirely wrong....Written by Lang's wife (who would later be co-opted by the Nazis herself), it tells the story of a child murderer terrorizing Berlin and the attempts of both the police and the criminal underworld to capture him. Lang shows us unsettling parallels between both the police and the mobsters in their methods. Peter Lorre gives a remarkable performance as the compulsive child murderer who is unable to control his devious impulses. Is this how the Germans perceived the Jews? When an "M" is stenciled on the back of the killer's coat, his fate is sealed. If the "M" on his coat was replaced by a star of David, then this WOULD be Nazi Germany. Filmed in moody black &amp; white with naturalistic sound and minimal use of dialogue, one almost gets the feeling one is watching a documentary.What is so fascinating to me is the gradual switch in sympathies we feel as we watch the film. In the beginning we find ourselves identifying with the mob in their efforts to catch the killer. Yet by the end, we no longer wish to identify with these revenge obsessed crazies. We find ourselves sympathizing with the cowaring killer. The killer may be sick, but the people that persue him are a lot sicker. No wonder the Nazis found this film so unnerving.</fullReview>

The chase scene starts with music then adds a sense of urgency to it when it goes completely silent. The cinematography is amazing in this film, especially the scene where Lorre confesses to an angry mob.Lorre creates sympathy for his character even though we know how sick of a person he is, he makes us understand how it feels for him. Even though, you still want the mob to destroy him for the dastardly acts he's committed. Great acting nearly all the way around, superb directing.

		<shortDescription>Weird, monumental film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing film. The whole film involves looking at society up and down. It starts with the mother wailing `Elsie!' down the endless stairwell and continues throughout the movie. Among other memorable shots ? the series of storm trooper boots descending into the bar, the safe cracker coming up through a hole in the floor surrounded by cops, the grim views of authority figures from below (the uncomfortably long crotch shot of Insp. Lohman and the storm trooper posted outside the bar window), Lorre being dragged back down the stairs, and so on. When Lang isn't explicitly showing us views that look up or down, he's making a point of concentrating on the high and low aspects of German society. The overclass (represented by the police, military, clergy, politicians and an academic who looks a wee bit like Freud) represent the rational aspect of the society. The lower elements are generally portrayed in subterranean settings with pretty over-the-top imagery like standing pools of water and intestinal-looking piping overhead. When the overclass needs to deal with the underclass, they send the appropriately named `Lohman' to stir them up. But they are the same being, as Lang shows us with the masterful blending of the two settings where the overclass and underclass set about solving the same problem thinking essentially along the same lines. Lorre is simply amazing. He creates a character who is somehow sympathetic, even though we know that he's essentially too selfish to do something about the fact that he compulsively kills children. When he reads of his crimes in the paper, it merely prompts him muse at his own face in the mirror instead of throwing himself out a high window.Part of sympathizing with Lorre comes from the revulsion we feel for the mob. By the time Lorre is thrown before the mob court, we have already seen another mob try to rip apart a man we know to be innocent. Lorre is a broken part of the overclass. He is associated with writing and a polished manner. When he's dragged back into the cellar, it's a reversal of the storm troopers storming into it at the beginning of the movie. Instead of being singled out and probed by Lohman, Hans Beckert is singled out and probed by a Schraenker. There are so many perfect things about this film. The characters are almost all grotesquely ugly. Cigars have never looked so disgusting. The balance of sympathies between the individual and the mob is played exquisitely. I can't say enough for the cinematography - it's monumental in every way. Made in 1931, M is a film about an ugly society on the brink of becoming something evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sound era starts with a bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"M" is one of the earliest sound movies - and already uses sound in a perfect way. Fritz Lang knew exactly when to use sound, noise and music, and when silence did serve a better purpose. Apart from this, "M" is technically solid in every department. For example witness the cross cutting of the dialogue between scenes at the gangsters and the police. Very well made. However, it isn't the technical aspect that makes it the masterpiece it is. It's Peter Lorre and the gripping story. Peter Lorre's portrail of the child murderer is one of the best acting I've ever seen on screen. He evokes so many feelings in the viewer throughout the film: anger, pitty, sadness or helplessness to name just a few. His speech before the criminal jury is also very well written. It's psychologically more gripping than any Grisham-film you'll ever see and it is chilling as a view into the brain of such a tortured human being. Highly recommended.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps playing a child-murderer might not be the most desirable way to be a big name, but this Fritz Lang gem definately made Peter Lorre a star. It's an uncomfortable flick for moral absolutists, since we routinely comfort ourselves by the notion that such criminals couldn't be truly human. But when Lorre finally expresses himself, we can't help but feel his horror at the idea of being included in the unsavory world of those "other" social outcasts. He doesn't want to be the monster that he is, but something in his hard-wiring won't let him stop! Few films are more disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film epitomizes the word "classic". Lang directs this with such intensity and wrings such a heart wrenching performance from Peter Lorre, that it is almost painful to watch. Lorre may give one of the greatest screen performances of all times The subject matter, child murder, is unpleasant but the murders are never shown. The rolling ball and the drifting balloon are the indicators that something terrible has happened. Yet, somehow, you begin to have pity on Lorre as the murderer simply based on his poignant performance. Many people are put off by sub-titled films but dubbing would ruin this movie and the performances really don't need dialogue. The "trial" scene is very disturbing and Lorre's cry of "I can't help myself" will move the most jaded movie lover. The American remake with David Wayne doesn't even come close although you might want to watch it just to compare a classic to a ill advised remake. This is Lang and Lorre at the top of the game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film was released sound was still very new. However, rather than randomly use sound as novelty, Lang craftly used sound in a powerful "less is more" effect.The film opens with a black screen...only the sound of the children can be heard. This two or three seconds of blackness is a foreshadowing of the entire theme of the movie; what you hear is more important than what you see. The film ends in the same manner. There are numerous instances in the film where this idea can be cited (however, i'll refrain to avoid possible spoilers).In a time in film when sound could have been abused purely for the act of using sound, Lang utilizes the abscence of sound to make a more profound impact. Absolutely brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best films depicting a serial killer that I have ever come across. The movie plot is pretty absurd with the whole of the self-righteous "underground" world of criminals uniting to catch the kindermorder who threatens to blacken their reputation! The Nazi propaganda is typically moronic, but that can safely be ignored to get to the climax where Lorre is being "tried" by the gangsters and gangland killers who think they are so much superior to them and he launched into his tirade. The killer is not an evil man, but one driven by an insane urge to kill, regardless of the consequences. Unlike the rest of the criminals who prosecute him, he does not do what he does for gain, but because his very nature, a drive that is alien even to him, forces him to obey. The sheer power of Lorre's performance, especially in the prosecution scene, blasts most other movies out of the water. There are few scenes as intense and revealing as this one. As a member of the progeny of UFA's expressionist classics, the movie is visually quite stunning and of course, highly artificial in its plot and acting, but this in no way takes away from its dramatic power. I wonder how it would have turned out had Lang not been under the Nazi censors who forced him to fell for his life a few years later?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's M retains its ability to shock almost 70 years after its conception. This stylized german production by one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, works on the senses in the most methodical insinuating way. A perfect model of subtlety, that provides a powerful counter-argument to the gory modern horror film. M shows us just enough onscreen action to frighten us, and forces us to make up the rest in our mind. By portraying the Peter Lorre child murderer as a sad little wretch of a man, the material becomes twice as disturbing as it would be, if Lang had chosen to exploit his subject. And as a result, we are presented with a timeless film, that has much to say about society. To add to its successes, M suggests its ideas through the images and using early sound techniques to truly chilling effect. Some of the images are unforgettable, and Lorre gives the performance of his career. Do not be put off by the subtitles, this film is a first rate character study and one of the most profoundly disturbing psycho thrillers ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>m (1931) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early German thriller from Fritz Lang ("Metropolis"), spotlighting a young Peter Lorre as a crazed child murderer. He selects innocent young girls and discreetly walks off with them, leaving the police force baffled as to trying to apprehend him and bring him to justice. So a concerned vigilante mob consisting of average citizens and hardened criminals take matters into their own hands in trying to catch the killer without interference from the law.My basic summation above sounds far more interesting than the way this overrated film plays out. I just re-watched this for my third (but final) time, on a Criterion DVD which offered the original German language version with English subtitles. The movie has a troubled history of having different prints at varying lengths, and this one was way overlong at around 109 minutes. I first saw M at the Film Forum in NYC, around the late 1990's. (It may have been a shorter English-dubbed version). At that time I recall being impressed at least with the intense ending, which highlights an emotional and sympathetic performance by Peter Lorre, where he is thrown at the mercy of a kangaroo court and actually pleads for the audience to consider his compulsions from his own warped perspective. It was based on that memory that I picked up the Criterion DVD release at the time it came out, which I may have spun maybe only one other time after I first bought it. However, I found this newest viewing to be dull and prolonged, with endless scenes of police procedures and discussions. Peter Lorre's screen time was precious little, and he only got to shine at the end for the last 15 minutes or so -- which was a good scene, but not worth enduring the rest of this tedium. There was not much in the way of "directorial flourishes". There are some nice suggestive visual setups at the opening to allude to Lorre's crimes, but that was about all. Just too much contemplating, searching, investigating, talking, meandering, to take up the most inflated guts of this film. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"M"... what an unusual title (a single one letter). Apparently insignificant, it means something though: "Mörder" ("Murderer" in German).For a 1931 film, this is far from looking so old. Looks more like a movie of the late 40's than from the early 30's. Most movies from the 30's are hopelessly dated. Also, for a 1931 film, some of the language used is a surprise.This movie tells the story of a mysterious child murderer and the challenge of catching him, as nobody knows who he is and he leaves no clues whatsoever. He is slowly introduced in a clever way as the movie runs. The weird thing is that this criminal only kills girls (only one boy is killed).My big complaint about this movie is that it wastes too much time in the police investigation scenes and the society's general concern about these hideous crimes. Also, I must confess, the policemen and the gangsters smoke so much that seeing all that smoke becomes nauseating.The film becomes more interesting and intense in the 2nd half, as the real hunt against the killer takes place. The "kangaroo court" scene is psychologically strong and the killer, at the same time he begs to spare his life, explains everything about his criminal nature.The criminal's sentence is unknown. It is almost revealed but just as that is about to happen, the shot cuts to some women saying that «No sentence will bring the children back. One has to keep closer watch over the children....... All of you».Peter Lorre's acting as the child murderer has a lot of dignity and his eyes are incredibly expressive. This superb performance is worthy of an Oscar for Best Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very bold early sound film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the key early talkies. Fritz Lang had already proved in the silent era that he was a master of visual story-telling with the likes of Metropolis. In M he combined this visual brilliance with some of the most inventive use of sound in the early days of the technology. The former is typified by rightfully famous scenes such as the murder of the little girl which is alluded to with four simple shots of an empty chair, an empty stair-well, a little ball rolling out from the bushes and a balloon caught high up in the telephone wires - in this way Lang was able to depict the most heinous of crimes imaginable in the most restrained, but nevertheless disturbing, way; sound is added to the mix in a similar creepy manner with the killers whistling being used as a clear indicator of his ominous presence.The film also takes an unusually complex view of the aftermath of the killer's capture. Most films would have depicted the murderer as an irredeemable monster and had clear moral certainties about his fate. I can't say I personally disagree with this approach in the case of a serial child killer to be perfectly honest, however, in M society is called into question in their desire for swift punishment for the killer. Its certainly a commendably complex approach to the subject, even if it is extremely difficult having any sympathy with the man we the audience know perfectly well is the child murderer.Without doubt this is a very important movie. I can't say I love it though, as I did feel it dragged somewhat in the middle section. Peter Lorre's absence from the screen for most of the running time isn't perhaps a good thing either. But in terms of bold approach both stylistically and thematically, this film certainly delivers the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very important film in the history of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is safe to say that Fritz Lang's M was the very first serial killer film in the history of cinema. And it's not secret that it spawned a genre that has produced timeless classics like Shadow of a Doubt or Psycho, as well as more contemporary classics like Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. For this we all owe M serious credit. This film is about a mysterious child murderer who terrorizes the consciences of the German people. The hunt for this mad man stretches from the police, to the common citizen, and even the common criminal. It's an interesting take (and also the first take) on public reaction to a situation as dire as this, as well as a dark look into the mind of an insane killer.This film explores many realms of psychology and how each social demographic would react to something as unimaginably terrible as murdered children. The topics prevalent in the film are very interesting to think about in retrospect but while actually viewing the film they get somewhat lost. Parts of this film seem fairly dry emotionally during the setup for major plot advancements. Towards the beginning we see the police reaction to these murderers as they crack down hard on finding who is responsible. They violate personal privacy of many people for the sake of finding this killer. This idea is most definitely present and easy to understand, but it seems to lack emotional integrity and makes me feel like it could have hit harder. I felt like this less and less as the movie progressed and by the end it finally picks up to practically be an emotional roller coaster.Where this film absolutely does not fall short is its artistic style. There are some fantastic artistic decisions made by Fritz Lang to really bring across the style of this film. M is, undoubtedly, an eerie film. It ventures into very uncomfortable places of the human mind. The film does a fantastic job at keeping you on edge and out of your comfort zone. This is accomplished mainly by the visual style of the film. Lang employs an extremely effective use of shadows to give the film its dark and mysterious air. The entire film is characterized by its subtle yet effective visuals, all put together meticulously in eerie black and white cinematography.Artistically M is brilliant. Some of the story and character development leave something to be desired, but it all works out by the thrilling conclusion of the film. It's intelligent, cynical, and unexpected. Putting this film in the perspective of its time period (the 1930's) it is most definitely way ahead of its time, and for that I can have nothing but undying respect for the film, even if there were parts that didn't suit me. M was certainly a significant advancement in cinema and will forever be one of the timeless classics that affected, and continues to affect, film today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A chilling film with a fluid moral centre. This is a very interesting film to have seen in the wake of Hitchcock's Psycho (currently on re-release) and Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon (released last year): the former is also a disturbing thriller which demands pity for its murderous protagonist; the latter an elliptical tale alluding to the dank origins of the Third Reich.Lang's film opens with a horrible extended, insinuating sequence in which a child is murdered - and, it is consequently mentioned, sexually abused in the process. As unequivocally foul though this crime is painted, so too is the subsequently paranoid-to-mindless actions of the public in reaction to it. Lang's satire stretches further though, as the voice of reason that steps in to focus the mob's hysteria is that of the criminal underworld. The parallel is clear - in a situation of civic instability, there is choice between the law and the outlaw. Indeed the intense final tableau even has the leader, Schränker, presiding over the bilious show trial wearing in a proto-Gestapo leather trench-coat. It comes as no surprise that M was banned by the Nazis three years later.It has been noted that this film is the first to employ the idea of the leitmotif (Beckert's whistling of Grieg). This I don't believe - in exactly the same way that I had always been led to believe that a dollied shot at the beginning of Citizen Kane, travelling through the skylight of a building, was the first such instance of such an impossible shot. Not at all. Lang does it in order to introduce a police meeting in this film. There are other interesting technical moments scattered about the film, many readily recognisable as part of an established school of German expressionism and the latter shots of Lorre in the loft sheds of the office building are this extreme chiaroscuro at its most effective.Above all, the film is terribly sad and its troubling irresolution nicely underlined by the final shot; grief is all that comes from what we discover during the horror and suspense of the story. An admirable and unlovely film 7/10</fullReview>

When the film was released in Germany the posters were in German but when the film was released in France the posters were in French. Also, "M" was one of the last "expressionalistic" movies to come out of Germany before Hitler came to power.

		<fullReview>Technically/Artistically, Lang uses suspense and visual imagery that few others have been able to accomplish. The film moves at an ever increasing pace - starting from an already fast pace, the film quickly and continually increases the suspense and overall action until finally reaching the ultimate climax in the final act. As a viewer, you are left emotionally drained by the end, as literally every emotion possible is thrown at you. The scenes between the parents and children leave one particularly emotional as anyone with children must have felt what those poor parents were going through. Peter Lorre's performance was spectacular and is in my opinion the best of his career, unmatched even by his performances in "The Maltese Falcon" and "Casablanca". I am sure that it is this performance that lead to his being cast in his first English movie, "The Man Who Knew Too Much", directed by the Master himself Alfred Hitchcock.Morally, the film forces the viewer to make his own decision on issues that are still very contentious even today. We are given insight into the mind of a very sick individual, and it is up to you, the viewer, to determine your own opinion on such matters as: What determines right from wrong? Is guilt/innocence determined by ones will, or one's actions? Who has the right to persecute - society in general, or a few elite individuals who have been elected to represent the best interest of said society? Furthermore, as a piece of historical fiction, I think this movie captures the essence of Germany following WWI, and immediately preceding the rise of the Third Reich perfectly. We see repeatedly the dangers of living in Germany at this time, the lack of rights afforded the average citizen, and the absolute power of the state police. The scene at the beginning where they display the paraphernalia taken off just one raid on one local bar says much for the environment of Germany at that time. The causality of the conversations between citizens and those between the local proprietors and the police show you that this type of action, although extreme under the circumstances, obviously was not unprecedented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am fascinated by M. (sign on the shoulder of killer)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this era, such films aren't produced with high budgets but in 1931 Fritz Lang did a great job with M. I don't want to say too much about it because every cinema fans should have watched this masterpiece. But I would like to complete some Fritz Lang films because M is really a masterpiece in its' area.Pre-World War II periods are reflected in M perfectly. Inspiring a series killer in Germany, Fritz Lang's M is a good copy of real one and if Peter Kürten who is the inspired real killer and called "Monster of Düsseldorf" had a chance to watch this film before the execution in these years I think he would admire Lang, too. Lang's well designated tension elements make the film "classical". Whistles, sounds, conversations, tags are wonderful. I especially admire the scenes that series killer trying to escape from mafia.Inge Landgut. I examine her and the note is for her: Probably best remembered for playing Elsie Beckmann. Peter Lorre is perfect choice for the role of series killer. The confessions that series killer Hans Beckert made at the end of the film is very good. According to this, Beckert says he was borned to kill. Representative court founded by mafia and representative lawyer found by mafia come face to face amazingly and of course the mother's words: Nothing will bring my daughter.M can't be compared any films whether in its' sector or not. I don't forget this and I'll watch whenever I have a chance for second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang + Peter Lorre = Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's frightening to think that this film was made in 1931. Not only is it a precursor to the film noir explosion of the following decade and put the production, direction and every other technical fundamental of contemporary films firmly to shame, the subject matter with which the ridiculously great Fritz Lang has chose to explore (a character analysis of a deranged, child murdering, sociopath) is one that far exceeds the period of time for whens the film was released.The lead performance from Lorre is astonishing in both its complexity and simplicity. The equal measures of polar opposites aid every viewer in their task to understand and, despite his crimes, astonishingly empathise and sympathise with what, by all accounts, should be a monster.Whilst the concept, the subtitles and the somewhat abstract and avant garde nature of much of the film (particularly some of the bizarre choices of framing and shot selection)may be too much for the intellectually challenged (*sigh*), those entering with an open mind and prepared for a challenging, thought evoking experience cannot possibly fail to be griped and engaged by a truly masterful piece of work.The work is also notable in that it was overtly anti-Nazi; providing a commentary on the society of the time that led to the film being banned in Germany and forcing Lang and Lorre (both Jewish) to flee Germany.A must watch for anyone who even attempts to consider themselves a lover of film/high end art (which is what this film, most definitely, is) and the absolute pinnacle of German expressionist art. Simply frightening/fantastic, and as close to perfection as you're ever likely to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultimately, I think how you got to find out about 'M' does influence to a degree how you perceive it.If you were to approach this after being told it was one of the greatest movies ever; I think you would be disappointed. But only because, such a comment implies that it should be viewed on equal terms with films of today (which have used and added to many of the ideas in this film).However, given I came across it as part of a "Cult Film" box-set which included Plan 9 from Outer Space, my expectations were not necessarily high.Viewed as a piece of movie making from early 1930s, it's quite fascinating. Directionally, it is very impressive, apart from a most unusual shot of a policeman at a desk viewed from below the desk. I guess the idea is to imply a "Land of the Giants" feel, but you end up in a Spinal Tap moment, as you start hypothesising about what is wrapped around the cucumber.Peter Lorre is brilliant, yet you can't but help notice exaggerated acting moments more akin to a silent movie. And yet, there are other moments where his acting is so sublime you wonder whether there has been any significant improvements in the supposed art at all in 75yrs. The sound also links back to silent film, in that, whilst a talkie with music, there are significant moments of silence; which add such a strange atmosphere to the film you wonder why someone doesn't try it with a film made today.And, it has that one thing I like about old films. Time. It takes its time.The world has changed incredibly in 75yrs, yet this film is still entertaining, provoking and ultimately leaves the viewer at the end with something to decide. For just these reasons its worth watching, but it's definite you will not forget it (and Im talking here about more than cucumbers).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to comment on several posting that I have read regarding the vigilante justice that the criminal underworld tries to exact on Peter Lorre's character at the end of this film. Some people have suggested that somehow the "mob" that tries to judge the serial killer is more evil than the serial killer himself. That somehow Peter Lorre's "compulsion" or "mental illness" mitigates his crime. That the "mob's" thirst for Old Testament, eye-for-an-eye justice is somehow illegitimate.To this I say bull****. There are degrees of evil. And the last time I checked, a man who rapes and kills little girls pretty much wins the grand prize for evil. No matter what voices may or may not be telling him to do it. No matter how bad he feels afterward. What Peter Lorre's character has done to his victims is horrific, and any sympathy we have for his tortured soul should be weighed against the torture he has inflicted on his victims.Sure, he's human. But he's a human who has raped and killed small children. Hey, maybe you feel that the death penalty is wrong. Maybe you don't feel that vigilante justice is a good idea. But the criminals do make an excellent argument: this psychopath needs to be removed from society PERMANENTLY, and the only way to absolutely, positively, guarantee this outcome is by killing him. Punishing death with more death? Yeah, it might be evil. But it's an evil that is at least comprehensible, on emotional and rational terms.To vilify what happens in the warehouse scene as "mob justice" ignores the fact that maybe, in this case, the mob wants to do the right thing. Or at least the human thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #054: M</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>054: M (1931) - released (in Germany) 5/11/31; viewed 5/17/06 Construction of the Empire State Building is completed in New York City.BIRTHS: Willie Mays.DOUG: We cross the half-way mark for '31 with German director Fritz Lang's first talkie, M, with Peter Lorre in his first starring role (looking noticeably plumper than in most of his later roles), and his best performance, bar none. We watched this film some years ago, just by chance; watching it the second time was much better, and I'm sure watching a lot of other German films from the period had something to do with it. One thing I always liked about this movie is its observation of the balance between the police and the criminals, and how both sides react when that balance is disrupted. Hans Beckert is a man who does things that are so evil that he greatly disrupts the balance, and he must eventually answer to either the good guys or the bad guys so the balance may be restored. His deeds sow such chaos and unleash such paranoia that an innocent man can't help a lost girl without being accosted by an army of bystanders calling him "murderer." One thing that the cops and the crooks have in common, and I'm sure this is intentional, is that they all smoke all the time. I had forgotten about 80% of the film from when I watched it the first time, but the scene I always remembered was the final scene of the kangaroo court, where Beckert loses it completely, screaming and sputtering and accusing his accusers while telling them that he can't help what he does. "Who knows what it's like to be me?!" he screams. Although we've barely seen Beckert up until this point, the whole movie revolves around his character, everyone else talks about him in every scene, and you always walk away knowing that this film belongs to Lorre. The film as a whole moves at a leisurely and deliberate pace. It could be cut down to 90 minutes easily, not that I'd want to.KEVIN: In Fritz Lang's first sound film, the crime masterpiece M, we have another classic villain from 1931, Hans Beckert, played by 26-year-old Peter Lorre. Featuring the cinema's first realistic serial killer (Dracula doesn't count), M is probably the darkest film we've watched yet. Not even the most maverick pre-code Hollywood director would want to tackle something like a child killer at the time, especially with the horrifying implications of his crimes in the film. Since the first time I watched this movie, I had completely forgotten more than half the film. Basically all I remembered was some of the beginning and most of the end, while the middle 80 minutes were a blank. So it was rewarding to fill that empty space in, as the rest of the film is just as high quality. Sometimes it looks as though very little is going on, when really the narrative is as tight and constant as can be. If Peter Lorre had been a few years older , he might have been big during the silent era with a face and eyes like his. His performance is still as riveting as ever. Whenever he's on screen, even before we hear that he is a compulsive killer, there's still something about him that makes it difficult for us to hate everything about him.Last film: The Public Enemy (1931). Next film viewed: Monkey Business (1931). Next Film chronologically: The Smiling Lieutenant (1931).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. First of all, excuse me for my English. I know it is not as good as it could be. But now ? some words about this brilliant film. "M" ? is not just a story about a maniac, it's great allegory on the German society in 1930's. Fritz Lang shot this film in outstanding way: the film is really dramatic and captivating. The first 10 minutes of film is really terrifying and then investigation begins. In 1931 Lang felt that the Germany is frightened and too aggressive. Maniac (Piter Lorre) is not really great murder like Lector or Spacey in "Seven". He is just a little man that is really, really ill. His decease destroys him. He is just a silly monster. But look at the honest citizens: they are so frightened and aggressive; they are ready to destroy all. At that moment the criminals decided to find and destroy "monster". That's funny but even real murderers, burglars that had become the criminals on their free will, were sure that Lorre is a monster that had to be killed. And then ? the last and, maybe, one of the best scenes in history of the world cinema: criminals caught Lorre and were trying to judge him. But at that moment maniac talked ? holy God, it is a great moment!!! And at that moment I understood the main idea of this film: Lorre is a monster, murderer, but his enemies is much worse. Unbelievably, but in 1931 Lang predicted the blood massacre of 1933 and dreadful time of fascism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early German sound classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M, alongside the expressionist classic The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, is one of the greatest films of the first few decades of German cinema and director Fritz Lang's greatest achievement. I recently saw the restored 2002 version and the restoration effort is a great achievement in itself.Fritz Lang, till M, had only directed silent movies and brought a strong visual style of storytelling which all great silent film directors possessed to the loosely adapted story of Peter Kurten, the so-called "vampire of Dusseldorf". Sound was used, but in a limited way and very effectively. For example, the empty staircase and the sound of the mother shouting her missing daughters name. Or, Hans Beckert whistling the same classic tune and the sound being captured even when he wasn't in the frame.Apart from the excellent direction, what really struck me was how well the film holds up. Its not a silly movie with ridiculous behaviour (from todays perspective) so typical of films from that era. The whole idea of the criminal underworld wanting to catch the murderer first was unique yet logical. The entire police profiling sequence was very intelligent and involved the audience. Then, there is the classic sequence where Lorre is hiding in the building and the way the tension builds up. This is among the finest early sound films and should rate as unmissable by any film buff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has an extremely realistic feeling and provides a view on a child-murderer and the effect it has on the normal everyday society of Germany in 1930. It's one of the most chilling movies I have ever seen along with movies like "Psycho" and "Se7en".The storytelling in this movie is extremely good. It's slow but it perfectly captures the fear and desperate feelings. Because everything in the movie feels so realistic, it gets a chilling atmosphere. This is also thanks to the at times phenomenal camera-work, directing and the child-murderer part that's played by Peter Lorre. In my opinion his character is just as chilling and classic as Hannibal Lecter.Director Fritz Lang already proved his talent with "Metropolis" in 1927. This is his first movie that also uses sound but he still manages to put in, just as many visual style and groundbreaking moments in this movie, as he did in his early silent movie works. This is one of the very first film-noir's ever created and this movie helped to set the standards for later movies in the same genre. Truly a milestone in movie history.The directing is really top-class and so is the cinematography from Fritz Arno Wagner who is also known for working on the classic German expressionist horror masterpiece "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens". The combination of both provide some highly original and memorable scene's.The acting is silly over-the-top at times as often was still the case in German movies from the '30's. It's also obvious that German isn't Peter Lorre's native language. His German is just a bit off at times.A classic powerful, chilling, atmospheric, stylish masterpiece that I can whole heartedly recommend to everyone.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain movies that are considered classic-Some Like it hot, Casablanca, and others. Then there are movies like M- they transcend the genre and become masterpieces. Every frame, every line of dialog, every shot is amazing. Fritz Lang, in using sound for the first time, is able to allow the dialog to tell a story that mere faces could not. Peter Lorre was one of the greatest actors of all time, and he makes a stunning debut. His Hans Beckert is a truly tragic figure- a man who has committed these horrible acts and cannot stop or help himself. His passionate outburst in front of the "court" is truly effective. This is a magnificent and moving masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unquestionable Triumph for Peter Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sit here absolutely riveted from one of the most astounding performances I have ever witnessed. I am almost speechless with awe and terror.Who am I speaking of?PETER LORRE.Without wanting to give away too much of the climax of this startling movie, I want to declare that Lorre's performance in this movie has got to be one of the truly astounding debuts in film history (though he did appear unceremoniously in two earlier films of negligible participation.)I am still shaking from the utter terror which Lorre has instilled in my memory for all time. He was only 27 when her portrayed Franz Beckert, but he shone with such consummate skills that only more seasoned performers have ever dug this deeply into the psyche of a raging, ravenous murderer or any other role for that matter.Lorre's savage abandon never even comes close to the base theatrical histrionics which a lesser actor could have been induced to emit had they possessed one miniscule portion of his immeasurable talent. He shows us the inner mind of a wildly desperate man from the inside out. It's a shame that America or Hollywood never offered him a better role than this. We were instead treated to a series of very interesting roles -- which I admit will always be memorable in their own rights -- but which will never equal the sheer, raw power of this singular performance. A great deal of credit must be bestowed upon FRITZ LANG for this searing portrait of a deranged mind. It is interesting to note the sparse use of musical accompaniment to the action. That was a wise decision...which did not serve the later remake at all and reduced that mere shadow to a melodrama instead of a full-blooded drama as this original version of "M" is.If you've never watched a foreign-language film before, you may begin wondering if this is going to be a trying experience. Frankly, even after seeing scores of foreign-language films, I had my doubts about this one in the beginning. But as the film progressed, I began to forget more and more that I was reading subtitles - I was watching the story unfold with some of the most unforgettably inventive images I've ever seen. They took over the narrative and suddenly the written dialogue fell into place with the spoken German without me realizing it. For many, this may not be a pleasant movie to watch -- but I will alert you to the fact that as dark as this movie is, no graphic depictions of violence are shown. They are merely transferred to your mind from the unfolding of the story - more like suggestions than the overt delineations we have almost been desensitized to accept these days. Any more and "M" would have become a horror movie and not the unquestionable triumph of filmmaking it is.Recommended with highest praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark in cinema history, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so much about Fritz Lang, I decided to watch M last night. I think my only complaint was that I had the old grainy/blurry version with poor subtitles. I've only seen a few people give the same opinion as mine, others seem to think it's flawless. First of all, I did enjoy the film and recommend this to all film buffs, especially those interested in early cinema. The film's plot is that of a kidnapper/murderer. The murderer is putting the whole city in panic; stopping the mobsters from doing their 'business' and making the police look like scum.The whole point of this film is not the plot. In fact, I'll say this right now, the plot is very dull and cliché (by today's standards). But it's this early cinema, pre-film noir, which really makes the film interesting. Lang uses unusual techniques to show eerie, creepy and lonely imagery. Towards the start of the film, we see the murderer's shadow on his own wanted poster. We see his mentality break down through a song he whistles. We see the fear transferred to him in the second half, when the hunter becomes the hunted. It's for style and approach of direction that one must see this film.The negative part is the plot. I'm sure a few will disagree, but in my opinion, it's very stale. I saw someone mention that this plot has never been done in the past 70 years, to that, all I can say is bullsh*t! It's the most typical plot in film history, a killer is on the loose, the first half is tracking him down, the second half is a type of vigilante group chasing him through a building. For this reason, this interesting film becomes less intriguing. The plot has been done so many times that it's become stale and weary and definitely ruins part of the viewing pleasure that you might have got 70 years ago, especially in a time when speech was first being implemented into film.I do recommend this film, but I also warn you at the same time. Watch it for its direction, keep in mind the time it was made and more importantly, the time it was set (think of the Nazis). Don't expect a gripping plot; just enjoy a nice classic film. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M is a magnificent, menacincing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm thoroughly ashamed of myself. Why had I not seen this film before last night? It's in the top 50 here, top 30 on the foreign films database and was voted the greatest German film of all time, and it's taken me 24 years to get round to watching it!If you're in a similar position, rectify it immediately; M is an outstanding film, as relevant today as it was 70 years ago. It is the story of a society in fear of an unknown child killer (and, it is suggested, paedophile) who has struck seven times. The films opening scenes depict him luring and killing his eighth victim. From this point on it is not so much the killer (Franz Beckert played brilliantly by Peter Lorre) that director Fritz Lang is interested in, but the public and their reaction. As parents become more concerned about the welfare of their children, the authorities become increasingly heavy handed in their investigations. The petty criminal underworld, exasperated by the frequency of police busts decide that they will hunt down Beckert themselves so business can return to normal.The story reflects perfectly the current attitude towards offences against children (when a UK tabloid recently printed the names of registered sex offenders, mobs attacked their homes), but questions them. Is it right that the mob want Beckert dead? Should we be able to choose to kill someone because they have killed? Most people would call this an eye for an eye, but as Beckert points out in his defense at the kangaroo court ``I can't help myself! I haven't any control over this evil thing that's inside of me! The fire, the voices, the torment!'' Should someone without self-control be punished or helped?The advanced questions raised by the film would be enough, but the technical achievement of it takes things to another level altogether. Made in 1931, I was (naively) expecting lots of long, still, wide shots that were functional but in no way flashy. How wrong could I be? The camera hardly stops moving, from the very first scene where it cranes up a block of flats, it's like watching a scorsese film that was made in the 30's. A camera starts outside, goes through a window and through several rooms of a building in one continuous shot. When the camera isn't moving the cuts come thick and fast, whether it's between the arguing faces of a pair of witnesses or (10 years before citizen Kane) when a crime boss starts a sentence by swinging his arm back and a police commissioner finishes it while swiping his arm in front of him.This film was ahead of its time on every level and offers as much to any viewer now as it did then.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I'm still kind of surprised that a film like this actually existed back in 1931. Because of the extremely dark subject matter, even today the project would have plenty of difficulty getting off the ground. But the important thing is that it DOES exist, and even back then it's clear that at least somebody out there knew how innovative and brilliant cinema can be, which leaves no excuse for all those bloody awful films the studios churned out at the time. Fritz Lang as usual allows things to unfold at a leisurely pace, which is fine although he does linger too long on some aspects particularly in the middle section of the film, which means that it very nearly suffers from that age-old disease whereby a film has a great opening and a great ending, but is ruined by the fact that it lags heavily in the middle. But there are enough to great scenes and original ideas in there to ensure that this is among the greatest films of all the time. I'm sure today's directors must envy Fritz Lang in that back then he had pretty much a blank slate, and so was free to experiment without fear of borrowing from other places, so ultimately you have to admit that this is not a film about other films -- it's a film about life, inspired by real life and shot in a way that truly tries to memorably capture everyday life.The highlight of the film as far as the acting is concerned is of course Peter Lorre's haunting, creepy little performance as the child murderer himself. There is one point in the film where the killer is standing in front of a shop window, and his reflection in the glass is dark and murky except for his eyes when he looks over at a little girl, which glow like those of a demon -- almost certainly an accident, but a great-looking accident nonetheless.This film easily deserves 5/5 (a classic, absolutely not to be missed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FRITZ LANG'S REAL MASTERPIECE. TOP TEN MATERIAL.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"M" is better than METROPOLIS! Classic is too weak a word for this great film. This is a true landmark. Fritz Lang's M is a genius expressionist film that changed the face of cinema and brought a whole new dimension to the old story concepts of "right" and "wrong". Peter Lorre is a child molester/murderer in Germany. His crimes have not gone unnoticed, but the police are powerless to stop him.Ordinary citizens and common criminals work to stop the monster in their midst, annoyed by the failings of the law. SPOILERS. They chase him through the small shadowy spaces of the city and eventually the get him. But something has happened during the course of the film. Lang has made the murderer a human being, tortured by his compulsions, and we sympathize with him. Lorre's great performance goes a long way to pull this off, and Lang went a long way to get that performance. The look of terror on Lorre's face in the final scene is real because Fritz Lang threw him down the stairs repeatedly until he got it right (it was worth it).This picture blazed the trail later traveled by PSYCHO and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. It's a shame the movie is such a rarity, then again, if it were more common it would be the subject of continuing controversy. This is a pinnacle of expressionist film-making, and is deeply enriched by great performances and a remarkable script. One of the first human psychopath films, and almost certainly the best. Its imitators are worth seeing too, just beware of a lame "classic" called PEEPING TOM (1960). M is a film to be seen ad admired as long as the movies last.</fullReview>

After all, the scum of the ghetto's scum had decency enough in them to do proper detective work, and bring a murderer to final Justice. The film is so complex, and rich that it's certainly one of a handful of my all-time favourites. Recalling some dark scenes today, I still shiver - and I read that those unnatural crimes are now common in our society. Where is all that decency of the ghetto gone, I wonder?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absolutely riveting from beginning to end, and as trite as that sounds it's true. I just finished watching it a minute or two ago, and I was glued to my seat with the suspense. One of the earliest sound films, it uses the limited sound effects available to it in a way more haunting than any emotional Hollywood scoring. The sole music is the eerie whistling of Grieg against a silent background. The piercing cries of mothers and children contrast with silence causing several tense jumps in any viewer. The cinematography is excellent, fusing the criminal underworld with the police search in a way that both builds conflict and shows similarity. The acting... superb. Peter Lorre is phenomenal in his dual role as both the terrifying psychotic and the helpless victim of his desires. Every element is exactly what it should be to create a cinematic masterpiece. To think that such genius came so early to film itself is mind-blowing. I apologize for all the cliche language, but this movie is a 10/10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang was a fine director with an artistic vision that is just genius. This is seen perfectly in pretty much all of his resume, especially in Metropolis and this unforgettable masterpiece, M. The film has a great story that unfolds without feeling too fast or too slow in development with a theme that is still relevant today, and to this day I never thought I would see a film that would make me think that the music of Grieg(Peer Gynt being the murderer's motif in a form of a truly chilling whistle) was scary.When it comes to sound and visuals, M is a triumph. The images expressionistic in their look and tone are incredibly atmospheric including in the brilliantly crafted opening sequence, and the sound is very inspired, yes even in the small details like Lorre clicking open his knife. The script is accomplished and intelligent, Lang's direction is superb and the characters intrigue not just Lorre's very chilling murderer but also Inspector Lohman. While there is a fair bit of suspense and chills, the final shot actually quite touched me in a way.The acting is excellent. While the support playing of the likes of Otto Klemike hits the nail on the head, it is the performance of Peter Lorre that lives long into the memory. Here he parodies the sinister snivelling that often makes him so compelling to watch and while he is very menacing there are times as you delve deeper into his character where you feel pity for him. All in all, an unforgettable masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A child murderer terrorizes a German city in this classic thriller. Lang's expressionistic camera work is quite remarkable, efficiently conveying information visually. However, the script is weak, rambling aimlessly for much of the middle part of the film. The plot line concerning the underground criminals and the beggars detracts from what could have been a tightly constructed investigative film. The acting is not good for the most part. The bug-eyed, diminutive Lorre is an interesting presence, but he overacts wildly. Despite these shortcomings, it's worth watching for its historical importance and for the issues it raises, which are are still timely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may be especially interesting to cinema students, as people say it's an historical point for film-noir and other such genres, besides all the new techniques applied, which were indeed well used..But for a more general public, the pace of the movie is too slow. Like most "old" movies. Also, the story is quite simple, especially for today's standards, since we've already "seen it all".However, the way it is presented works. Quite well, in fact. The only problem is that the story has so little to it, that it could've been presented easily in half the time, instead of boring the viewer with meaningless police investigations.. Until I got past half of the movie, I was considering giving up on it, but the last part hooked me up till the end. The way they present the moral dilemma behind the story really makes one think about it. But that's pretty much it.Still, a pleasant experience, if the viewer is patient/doesn't have anything else to do..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'M' is one of those movies that sits with you for years after viewing. Fritz Lang is, of course, one of the true masters, and it is evident that a lot of his real fears were sewn into 'M'. Peter Lorre creates a truly memorable character, and the pre-50's handling of the violent aspects of the film should be examined by everyone in the industry - 'M' proves that you don't an army of FX technicians and gallons of fake blood to be scary. From the lighting to the sound-work, all aspects of 'M' add up to a night of great suspense for those with enough patience and imagination, and to this day, I still can't listen to the 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' without breaking out in a few dozen goosebumps.Truly recommended though not suitable for sensitive or young viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful museum piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not so long ago I watched another German classic by Fritz Lang - Metropolis. M was released only XXX years after it. Yet, in such little time, a radical development happened, which altered filmmaking completely. Actors could now talk. The silent film era was over. And oh lord, did Fritz Lang surely know how to use voiced cinema.This movie is a gem. For enjoying it, present-day viewers need to keep in mind that the public that was watching M was not used to watching in cinemas long dialogs like in the theatre. And probably Lang took many resources from theatre, but since them they have become cinema's heritage. There's so many tropes, so many pathos formulae and plot tricks that were used in this movie for the first time. It would be practically impossible nowadays to make a crime movie without borrowing, consciously or unconsciously, elements from M. From the public paranoia and the work of the police to the public persecution and personalization of the killer, everything in this movie has been reused over and over.Of course, the genre has evolved since then, and for being the first Suspense movie ever, it is probably among the most suspenseless movies I've ever watched. But that's not M's fault, it's just that contemporary cinema has made a much more demanding viewer than the one this movie is intended to. So much is that, that the movie can now even be seen as a parody of suspense movies; a comedy. There are scenes that are truly hilarious; some of it because they are meant to be funny, and others just because they are not something you would expect from a suspense movie nowadays (such as the crime organization meeting to discuss the issue of the murderer, probably among the most surrealist aspects of the movie). And the angry, expressive, theatrical German goes a long way in helping to make this movie funny.There are some thing that are quite unique, and that I miss in modern cinema. Where did all those theatrical dialogs go? Where are the contemporary movies with breathtaking final monologues, where the actor gives his best as if speaking to the theatre audience? From time to time, filmmakers should revise classics; drop the tropes that have since then become too overused, and be re-inspired by wonderful, rich movies such as M.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic black-and-white movie from the 1930s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"M" is another collaboration film between legendary director Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou. These two made "Metropolis" a couple years earlier and you cannot think of a better transition from silent film to sound film than "Metropolis" to "M". But it is not just them. Peter Lorre is absolutely outstanding in here. He did not have as much screen time as I remembered from previews viewing of these almost 110 minutes, but when he is on screen, he absolutely nails it, even more impressive as this was basically his first bigger role and he wasn't even 30 yet.This is about a city's hunt for a child killer, played by Lorre. The first third is about the situation unfolding. The second third of the film is mostly about the hunt for Lorre in an office building and the last third is about what justice determines in this particular case. I thought the first and the last third of the movie were the best. In-between there are some lengths and this film could have been kept at around 90 minutes in my opinion with cutting out some of the less important scenes. One weakness was maybe that I found it sometimes different to see if we deal with police right now or with the gangsters trying to catch the killer as well. Yes they did. First of all, they were annoyed with all the police presence because of Lorre's character on the loose and secondly they did not want to be categorized the same like a child murderer, even if some of them were murderers as well as we find out in the last scene.That last scene was an absolute highlight, especially thanks to Lorre's portrayal of guilt while being a victim himself due to the voices in his head. As good as it gets for a 1930s movie. And there is also a great lesson on moral included in here. All in all, I give this film a thumbs-up. It's a good watch from start to finish and even has a great moment occasionally. Definitely a good watch and I wonder which other great films Lang may have come up with if his work in Germany had not suffered from the Nazi's rise to power 2 years after this film came out. But he left us quite a few strong works nonetheless. This is certainly one of them. Recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MThe only time it's acceptable to kill a child is if they're crying uncontrollably while you're in a restaurant, at a theater, or on an airplane.Unfortunately, the monster in this thriller committed his crimes far from the tarmac. When the law comes down on Berlin's underworld due to a rash of child killings, the criminals in turn conduct their own search for the culprit (Peter Lorre) to clear their names and cool the heat.Marked with the letter M while abducting another victim, the kid killer is finally caught?but not by police.Brought before gangland judges to answer for his crimes, the accused calls out the courts own morality.Director Fritz Lang's first talkie, M is masterfully shot and marvelously performed by Peter Lorre, who magically embodies the creepy persona of the repentant predator. However, Germans wouldn't be so adverse to the kid killings if the blonde/blue-eyed ones were spared.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cinematography presentation even though technically flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens up subtly but directly addressing the main conflict at hand. It then speedily goes into arrival of the main conflict, also speedily explaining the background through a text and then continues on building the atmosphere of the environment setting. I like how the movie builds its story quite slowly up to one third of its duration and then quickly changes pace to medium speed long sequences starting from where the murder suspect is identified by the blind man. It then lets the viewers ride a roller coaster of a story, inciting more and more curiosity as the movie provide room for it by presenting the two sides of the story, the police side and the organized crime side. The cinematography tries very hard to looks sophisticated for its time. Using camera movements that may be complicated to execute at that time, the movie continues on despite all those major and frequent hiccups. The sound department also doesn't escape this, as all the entire voice-over acting are misplaced by a third to half a second. The twist with Franz is also quite funny for me. The acting in general is quite okay. Much over-acting here and there but I think that's quite common for movies from that age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Lorre saves this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is contrived, hokey, corny, stagy, and dated and would be virtually unwatchable, but is saved by one person, Peter Lorre. His performance as the pervert/murderer is outstanding and allows one to forget the obviously dated contrivances that characterize this movie. The impressionistic character of this movie is unmistakable. Scene after the scene the director attempts to use all kind of wide angled and skewed camera shots to generate certain feelings. Other times he uses close ups. These are all transparent attempts at manipulating the audience through gimmickry instead of through the story itself. If the story is strong, the gimmickry is not necessary. Here, the story is good but alone is not enough to sustain a full-length motion picture. Further, the story is so contrived as to create a need to prop it up with camera work and sound. The idea of a gang of thieves solving a crime is ludicrous. But all this is rendered secondary by Peter Lorre's performance. His performance sets the standard for future depictions of the sociopathic personality. Although playing a most reprehensible character, Lorre succeeds in investing in his character a pathos that preserves his basic humanity. That alone makes this movie worth watching. Rating, entire movie 5, Lorre's performance, 10, 10+5=15/2=7.5 rounded off to next highest number, 8.</fullReview>

Lang should have incorporated more of these. Likewise, a pro for the moving camera work.The mass hysteria and amateuristic manhunt does not feel believable, all the random arrests based on some citizen's anxieties feel unrealistic.Good acting performance by Peter Lorre, the scene were he pleads his innocence is particularly strong.The film raises a complex moral issue and concludes with an open ending in court after having heard both the defendant and the prosecutor, this challenges the viewer to make his own judgment over the guilt of M.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is by no means easy to judge a film almost 80 years after its creation. Should you put yourself in the shoes of the 30's audience or a contemporary one? In either case, M is a well directed film that will engage and provide food for thought for the viewer that is not obsessed by special effects or the shock effect common in many modern crime thrillers.The viewer is presented by a simple but dark story of a city haunted by the threat of a child killer. The moral of the story is surprising, and perhaps not to everyone's liking, but it certainly will provide a basis for thought and discussion.The film is even more interesting when you consider its position in cinema history. This was one of the first films to show us graphology, fingerprint analysis and the huge lengths the police go to to search crime scenes. These concepts are explained, from our point of view, naively, but to the viewer in 1931 these would be new ideas and they have clearly shaped the development of films of this genre.The suggestion of the murders themselves is also interesting, far from the graphic and disturbing scenes we would expect today. The subtlety reflects the taboo with which these matters were regarded.Peter Lorre's performance in this film, in his final monologue in particular, is amazing. He has the perfect look for his role and plays it convincingly, seeming like a tortured human rather than a monster. Typically of films of this time, many of the performances and some direction are overly theatrical but not in any way a distraction from the plot.If given a proper chance, this film will provide succour for the most analytical film viewer and can also entertain those who merely wish to be entertained. I suspect the former will enjoy it more, but there is little to criticise in any case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual black and white lending expressivity to the dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first talky by Fritz Lang in 1930-31. This great master of silent movies tries his hand on this talking long feature and succeeds in many ways. First the pictures are so beautiful, so well framed and lighted that the visual fascination Fritz Lang was a master of in the past is till there full and powerful. Second the actors are still acting as if they were voiceless, their body language being essential for the understanding of the action and the feelings. What's more long silent sequences give some density to the sound when it comes back and this sound is used in full expressivity, even in its imperfection as if it were the real sound we could hear in the street, muffled, discordant and with interferences from all around. Fritz Lang even manages not to have the typical sound of a sound stage though the whole film was shot in a studio, that sound stage sound so typical of so many American films of the 1930s. Then Fritz Lang deals with a subject that was just plain out in his time and yet he manages to do the job with such delicateness and tactfulness that it looks deeply human though dealing with the worst possible crime and criminal, and the board of censors of his time let it go through. But Fritz Lang manages to demonstrate how even that criminal will have to get a real defense, a real trial, justice in other words. Two visions of justice are thus contrasted: the justice that looks for some kind of vengeance, or at least a full retaliation, and the justice that is considering the real state of mind of the criminal and hence his responsibility. This explains well why the Nazis will ban the film later: it entirely condemns the Nazi expedient form of what they would have called justice which was always designating some kind of cleaning up of society, expurgating of the anti-social characters, be they political, sexual, criminal, religious or racial. And that's where the film today takes a new value. It becomes an allegory of what was to come. Hitler and the Nazis will be those who will authorize the underworld to take over and we must admit that they are more effective than the police in such situations and they don't wait for the judicial process to go through. The SS were the police, the court, the jury, the judge and the executioner, all of them in one body. In five minutes the mystery was solved and the criminal was eliminated, even if it was not a criminal but a Jew or a Communist, these facts being the worst crimes the Nazis could identify, crimes deserving immediate death. That's this visionary aspect of the film that is disquieting. Did the Germans know what was coming? Probably. So why did they not stop it? That is THE question and a very difficult one at that. Historians will still be asking that question in a couple of centuries.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

I bought the movie and watched it that night, and the next night immediately again, and I will see it many more times I guess.The film is great mainly because of three things. First, the techniques. The camera movements, camera positions, the cuts between scenes, the use of lights, all this is greatly done in "M", true craftsmanship! Second, the acting, mainly of Peter Lorre. The third reason why this movie is so memorable is the ending. I've always liked books and movies where you read or see a truly interesting discussion. In "Brave New World" for example, but also in "M".

		<fullReview>I have given this movie a 10, but know many of this generation's movie goers will disagree. I expect many will think it boring and unbelievable. But I would disagree for several reasons. First of all it is paramount to remember that this movie is from the early days of talking films and still works much like a silent movie. Lang seems to have been using the sound medium gingerly and relied much on his silent experience. Secondly, this movie was made for a generation of vastly different sensibilities than that of our own time. Take off you culturally shaped glasses and try to watch the film with an opened mind. You might well see a movie that is both rich is stunning visuals, frame composition, as well as its strikingly humanitarian spirit. For me most interesting aspect of "M" though, is the view it affords of 1931 Germany. Here is a "cinematic" slice of what Germany may have been like prior to the total domination by Hitler and his party. As I watched the characters passing through many of the frames I was surprised at the extremely diverse parade of humanity that made up the cast. There were so many men who's physical forms were in direct contrast to Hitler's Aryan Model that I could not help but wonder how many of them later became victims of the Nazi death machine only a few years after the film was made. In this sense it is a sort of quiet witness for these men.Give this movie a chance and think about it if you are so inclined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seminal film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approach purported classics with some trepidation, particularly old ones. I usually wind up recognizing the quality, but the experience is not always one of unalloyed pleasure - "Birth of a Nation" being a case in point. However, "M" engaged me from beginning to end, aided greatly by the pristine quality of the print on the Criterion Collection DVD.In Germany in the early 1930s a serial child killer, Hans Beckert (aka "M") is on the loose. Who better to play the part than Peter Lorre. His performance was so effective that it typecast him as a creepy bad guy for most of the rest of his career, as well as establishing his character as the canonical image of the perverted sex offender. Lorre actually has very little screen time as the story concentrates on his pursuit and capture. The nether world of beggars, thieves, pimps, prostitutes, gamblers and the like are as intent on capturing "M" as the police, since he has precipitated a major shake-down that has disrupted their economy. The police force and the underworld are presented as parallel universes in competition for nabbing Beckert. The picture painted of Germany on the cusp of Nazism is not a pretty one. We do not get the stylish decadence of "Caberet," but a portrayal of a depressing, paranoid society.Lorre is truly outstanding in his only big scene at the end of the movie in the mock trial overseen by his underworld captors. He so convincingly portrays a tortured soul who is compulsed to execute his evil acts that you can almost rise above your disgust and feel some pity for him, while despairing that there seems to be no way to expunge this sort of gruesome, compulsive behavior from society. I liked the way that Lorre accused those sitting in judgment of him of being as compulsed to behave in their own criminal ways as he - that it is just a quirk of fate that some unfortunate people are driven to act out compulsions that require their removal from society. While the social commentary and Lorre's performance are noteworthy, it is the outstanding black and white cinematography that dazzles. Orson Wells may have been a genius, but after seeing "M" you realize that he was standing on the shoulders of Fritz Lang. The same could be said for Alfred Hitchcock - could Hitchcock have filmed the off-screen murder of the little girl, signified by her toy ball leaking out of the bushes, to any more chilling effect? "M" sets the standard for noir thrillers down to the present day. Having stood the test of time for seventy-five years, it has to be regarded as a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Ground-breaking Fritz Lang crime drama, that's also considered by many to be the very first film-noir, about a serial child murder terrorizing the streets of Weimar Germanys Berlin. Baffled by the elusive killer and unable to catch or track him down the Berlin police start to put pressure on the city's beggars pickpockets and just all around quality of life offenders thinking they may be able to break open the case for them.Feeling the heat and resenting to be lumped in with someone as loathsome as a child murderer the Berlin underworld headed by it's chief crime boss Schranker, Gustaf Grundgens, decide to solve the case themselves. In them having much more persons to be used as block watchers and a better understanding of what's going down or happening on the street. It's not that long that they eventually get a bead on who the killer is by non other then a blind bagger, Georg John, who recognizes the murderer by a tune he whistled "In the Hall of the Mountain King". Just moments before he abducted and later killed his latest victim the nine years old girl Elsie Beckmann, Inge Landgut. The killer out on the street again to find his next victim befriends a little girl, much the same way he did Elise, and as he and the girl walk by John who's selling balloons he whistles the very same tune unknowingly identify himself.Branded by one of his pursuers with the chalk mark of a murder, the letter M, and chased by a band of the local criminals into an empty office building. The now revealed child murderer Hans Beckert, Peter Lorre, is then captured and bought to this deserted distillery on the edge of town to stand trial for murder with both his defender ,Rudolf Blomner, jury and possible executions being the criminal element of the city.Gripping and thought-provoking film that has Beckert stand before a jury of his peers, criminals, and plead for his life not protesting his innocence but explaining to them his uncontrollable blood lust that had taken control of him and forced him to commit murder. There's a time during Beckert's trial that you, and the criminals who are standing in judgment of him, are moved by his tortured tearful and yes honest summation. Beckert's defender Blomner brings out that his client is as much a victim of his crimes as the persons, mostly young girls, that he murdered in that he wasn't in control of his actions when he committed his crimes. Thus making a very good insanity defense on his behalf.The persons in the distillery soon have enough of Beckert's monologue and feel that his crimes, despite his diminished mental capacity when he committed them, were deserving of the death penalty and then stormed after the terrified and repentant killer. It's then that Beckert is saved by the Berlin police who came just in the nick of time to keep him from joining his victims.Very unusual movie for it's time, 1931, that actually tries to understand the pathology of a brutal and monstrous murderer by showing it's audience that he can easily come across as normal any one of us when he's not perpetrating his crimes. Peter Lorre as the child murderer Hans Beckert was so unoffensive and harmless looking, with a baby face and chubby appearance, that it was very easy for him to win over the confidence of the many young girls that he eventually killed. It's that what made him both so effective and dangerous as well as undetectable at the same time.Fritz Lang got the idea for the movie "M" from the real life story of German serial killer Peter Kurten who was known as the Vampire of Dusseldorf. Kurten murdered nine persons during his 1929-1930 reign of terror in that city ending up being captured by the police and put on trial for his life. Convicted of mass murder Kurten was sentenced to death, by guillotine, and despite the protests of many anti-death penalty groups in Germany as well as all over Europe to spear his life Kurten was executed in the city of Cologne on July 2, 1931 Just two month after the movie "M" premiered. Kurten said that he got a morbid thrill when he raped mutilated and murdered his victims, sometimes ever drinking their blood. In the end he got the biggest thrill of his life when he got it in the neck and then later was made to face up to what he did,in the next world, when he finally met his maker on Judgment Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully horrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so fascinating that the whole Fritz Lang's legacy is still in force, specially this "M". The movie is so dark, so dirty, so evil... The portrait of human misery in a time when cinema wasn't used that much as a way to reflect about society. In "M" there's too kind of a protest against the death penalty, against the "eye for an eye", against all those things that makes us look like irrational beings.A sequence that's become a thing of the past: Peter Lorre/M and his horrifying testimony, a man devoured and controlled by his own demons, forced to kill. A poor devil that finds in crime the best way to feel pleasure, but also the epicentre of all his nightmares.*My rate: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early German Talkie -- An All-Time Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the limited development of cinema technology of the day, Fritz Lang's "M" truly is a visually and acoustically stunning gem. The story of a psychotic child murderer engages the audience throughout; if ever a film deserved the label "thriller", this certainly is one.Besides introducing Peter Lorre to a large audience, "M" also features many well-known German actors, who would go on entertaining for decades, into the age of television of the 1960s and 70s. In a leading role we see Gustav Grundgens, the acclaimed Shakespearean actor who was selected by Adolf Hitler as a "tool" to promote the "new regime".The brilliant use of lights and shadows gives the film an edge over anything achieved up to this point. Although most existing copies, even restored DVD or laser disc versions, have many audible flaws, crackling and popping, etc., the use of continuous dialog and sound clearly aides the effectiveness of the visual presentation. Look for a particularly haunting, whistled version of Edvard Grieg's "In the Hall of the Mountain King" as a dramatic highlight.Peter Lorre, with his trademark eerie look and macabre voice, was immediately catapulted to International stardom, answering Hollywood's call to go on acting in films like The Maltese Falcon and other film noire classics. Fritz Lang's directorial career also took him to America, making mostly great Westerns."M" is one of the true Classics of early German Cinema. To be disappointed by this Masterpiece is virtually impossible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M (1931)M is not a cheerful movie like City Lights, which also came out in the same year. M is the dark, deep and edgy crime drama. M focuses on a German city of thousands, the movie begins and feels much like a after school special, but quickly turns dark as the first victim in the movie is taken. The movie then focuses on the dark and undertone of society and human behavior. Inspired by the sheer panic of Jack the Ripper in London 50 years before, the German city goes through a nightmarish time where no one trusts anyone else. The atmosphere of the movie is shown and one can almost hear the whispers of the town folk as the movie draws you in and you wonder who is the murderer. The mass hysteria also over turns the townsfolk better judgment to fear and it's three components: -Distrust ? no one in the town trusts anyone. The simple act of telling a child the time is misread by several people -Paranoia ? the edginess of the town is felt, people are constantly looking over their shoulders and urban legend of the killer runs rampant. -Terror ? A man who gave the time of day to a child is pointed at and a flash mob appears, nearly tearing the man apart. The murderer also adds to the chaos by being a normal person, police and later the organized crime also realize this. This means that the murder could be a normal man or woman walking among them, paying their taxes, buying their bread, or reading the newspaper, just like Jack the Ripper, to this day Jack the Ripper is still unknown. The killer, Hans, is represented as a normal looking guy, but as the movie progresses and shows more of him as he walks the street, we see an overwhelming force begin to take over him. Hans resists as much as he can, he tries to drown away the feelings and tries several different ways. But soon his murderous side takes over and his once jittering and nervous self is replaced by a calm and cool gentleman who treats kids kindly until the end. The calm Hans is broken out of his killer trance when he realizes that he's been marked and is being hunted. He reverts to his jittery and nervous self and tries to hide. When finally caught and placed before a jury of his peers and local townsfolk, Hans tells them what it feels like to be haunted by the feeling to kill, the overwhelming urge to kill. Hans tells them how he deeply regrets killing his victims and how he's consistently haunted by the faces of the victims and the family. Hans displays thought patterns associated to a disorganized serial killer. He kills on impulse, not having a plan, but just getting urges and quickly takes the first victim they can find. These types often block out memories of killing their victim, as stated by Hans in M.M continues to be considered to be one of the top movies from the 1930's. The movie's style is quick to capture the isolation and fear of the story through the clever work with camera angles and lighting. The use of sound, a relatively new thing in the 30's, is used carefully and there's isn't too much talking, only the bare minimum. The director slides the auto around to make it sound like two group of people, police and mobsters, are having the same conversation. There's also several parts where there is no sound, but instead takes the ear point of the crowd of people. The empty shots shown as the first victim is murdered quickly brings a silence and an awe to the movie. The touchy subject of murder is strengthen in this movie since it deals with child murders and possible rapes. The controversial topic is well shown and isn't glorified and is felt evil without showing any blood. M feels a lot like a cautionary tale, a movie saying to be more careful of children, how well do you know people, and that deep down everyone can quickly become different people.M's strong storytelling and strong visuals as well as some superb acting makes this movie a classic and continues to stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest films of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's 1931 masterpiece M was the first psychological thriller of the cinema. Based on the real crimes of the "Monster of Dusseldorf" Peter Kurten who was put the death the year this film was released. According to crime historians Kurten is one of the most evil, depraved and disgusting criminals of all time. The character played by Peter Lorre, Hans Beckert was portrayed as a more sympathetic person. One of the details about this film that makes it unique even among todays thrillers is that the movie is more about the actions and reactions made by society rather than delving into the lifestyle of the serial killer like "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer". In pure cinematic ingenuity Lang smoothly cuts back and forth between the police and the criminal underground as they both strive for the same ultimate goal, find the killer. One of the many thrilling things about this film is as an audience member you are on edge about Beckert killing another child as well as wanting to know if it will be the police who capture Beckert or the criminal underground, plus what will either side do once they capture him. Another part of Lang's brilliant film-making is that he does not make it mellow dramatic. This was still the beginning of the sound era and many film makers through out the world thought that there should never be silence on the screen. Showing how far ahead he was of his time he took the opportunity to go without music and simply let the streets and crowds play as the soundtrack. This film is one of a kind and not only should every film fanatic own this film but anyone who is a fan of the art form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M is an absolute masterpiece set in Germany about a child murderer roaming the streets. I see that over 150 people have written reviews so almost everything that I'd like to say has probably already been said. Here it goes: M is a great film. It's the kind of film that you won't see on television. Controversial, landmark talkie film among many other things. If you haven't seen it, it is well worth renting or even better watching on the big screen if you have access to a movie projector. The great thing about discovering a film like M is that you wonder what else might be out there. Then you watch Metropolis and so on. Something tells me that Fritz Lang may not have been the life of the party yet he also had a way of creating dark and dreary like no one else.10 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How people react to a murderer in their midst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly eighty years later this movie explores the nature of human beings under stress and the arguments for and against capital punishment with more power than anything I have seen. The black and white photography is astounding, the performance of Peter Lorre shows why he ended up in Hollywood. You are both repulsed and strangely sympathetic to his character. Possibly this is Fritz Lang's finest film and every time I watch it I see the culmination of that whole post WW1 expressionist style in Germany, even though it is not really an Expressionist film. The way you get the self interest of the people in power and their human frailties exposed-no one is a 'hero' in this film. I can see why Nazi Germany banned it-it is uncomfortably accurate in its portrayal of the weaknesses of the German people. Part murder mystery it is really an exploration of us all. Our need for revenge, our lack of empathy, our ability to not see our own weaknesses. Yet it is also a portrait of evil. Wonderful film-they don't make like this any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ominous yet completely different from most thrillers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, there's a public domain copy of M on archive.org (I guess it's legal at least in some parts of the world).I do not like thrillers or movies about assassins. Usually the bad guy is invincible up until the final scenes. Usually no attention is given to the relatives of the victims, those who have to endure the pain for the loss. Usually violence is depicted in all gory details, and sound is innaturally loud and sudden (nowadays they mix animal cries into human screams to make them more unsettling, ain't that cheap...) Then I get to see M. A plot that unravels with a slow pace, and no music, like that thing called "real life" often does. All the violence is inferred, not fed to the viewer instincts. It's essential, but not pretentious nor cold film making: most characters show some kind of humanity, the monster, the victim and their relatives, of course, but also the crooks and the police. I like the way actors performad back in the 30s, that seems kinda exotic now and may affect positively my opinion of the movie. Yet after watching M, Hitchcock approach seems more stimulating but in an artificial way, and newer stuff of the same genre seems almost irrelevant.The ending of the movie is terrible, with a mere repetition of something already said, but I read another comment saying it was tacked on. Nevermind, I'd have rated it excellent anyway.M must also be one of the first movies with a "there is no cop when you need one" line. Funny I saw this one right after The omega man, so I was quick to notice that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true cinematic classic. M is one of the best film-experiences ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Storyline: A German city is terrorized by a pathological child-murderer (Peter Lorre) that has murdered eight helpless little girls by seducing them with candy or toys, and continues to make streets unsafe. The mothers of the city live in constant fear of having their little daughters kidnapped. Soon both the Inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) with his police force and the criminal underworld, who believe that the killer's actions reflects badly on their business, are on a manhunt to find the child-murderer.Frits Lang's first sound-movie M is brilliant classic from the late period of German Expressionism (1920s-1930s). It contains so many of the elements that would lay the foundation for film-noir, in terms of Lang's brilliant use of shadow and that it's portrayed from a morally flawed character's POV. Lang often only shows the murderer's actions indirectly, for example via a shadow on a wall or when we hear him whistling the very characteristic tune "In the Hall of the Mountain King".Lang says some very important things with this movie. It's about the true nature of justice, and the madness it is to have people self-regulating it. This is a very current theme considering the lynch-atmospheres that often arise in medias led by journalists and readers who feel offended by, for example, sex-criminals. I understand the harm, but it really is a police matter. If we were allowed to take the law in our own hands, an anarchy would arise. Lorre's character was also very complex for it's time, as seen towards the end of the movie. The criminal underworld gathers to sentence the him to death. He gets desperate, begging them to hand him over to the police, pleading with them that he's a mentally sick guy. It's my favorite scene, because of the social-criticism and poetry. The points that Lang is making are very important, and it's sad to see that bad guys in thrillers nowadays aren't half as complex characters.M is full of suspense and atmosphere, and highly recommendable to everyone, especially fans of German Expressionism or film-noir. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's real opus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film about three years ago in a class that I took on German film as a capstone for my German major in undergrad. Interestingly, this was one of the first sound films that we watched for the class, and the second of Lang's work (we saw three in total, "Metropolis," "M," and "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuses"). The other two films remain high on my list of favorite films, but "M" blew me away.The plot is that there is a child-murdering pedophile (Peter Lorre) terrorizing the streets of Berlin. The police are baffled as to who this man is and clamp down on the underworld trying to smoke him out. The underworld responds by trying to catch the killer to take the heat off of them.The first thing that struck me was Lang's use of sound in this film. There is no musical score (in the original cut) and every sound can be heard by the characters on the screen. This seemed to draw me into what was going on rather than put up a boundary, like so many films seem to do today. This was Lang's first sound film, so he used many of the same techniques that he had in making silent films. However, rather than simply now using sound to tell the story Lang wanted to make it an intricate part of the story. In my opinion, this film should be watched by anyone, but especially film students who want to see an effectively done film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't begin to imagine what audiences made of this film upon its release in 1931. The idea of having your protagonist be a child killer, and one the audience is meant to feel pity for, would be a tough sell TODAY let alone then. But that's exactly what director Fritz Lang gives us, and in Peter Lorre he found the perfect actor to create this wounded soul.Lorre, with his frazzled appearance and bug eyes, gives perhaps one of cinema's greatest and most chilling performances. He seems to be pleading for mercy without even saying a word. His child killer is one who is driven to do what he does by forces beyond his control--not something audiences who turn to movies for black/white, right/wrong moral messages want to hear. His frantic soliloquy at the movie's end, where he pleads for mercy and understanding, is a triumph of writing and acting.In a period when director after director was handed the new technique of sound and then didn't know what to do with it, Lang seems perfectly at home with the new medium, and in fact one can't quite imagine "M" without sound. It's a deeply disturbing and effective film, and not to be missed.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Naturally as first comment explains, film is a work of genius.since the first comment has already described the remarkable exposition of the pathology of the criminal and his ability to invoke relative sympathy to his apparent illness, it is not necessary to repeat.the political and social propaganda should not be ignored.it is typical 20th century propaganda aimed at a disruption of tradition views of justice and politics.here, although the police have arrived finally at the identity of the criminal, it is the criminal socialist "unions" which have actually beat them to it and rooted out the Morder and have established a court to judge him.Lorre explains his inability to control himself and we see nodding old-timers confirming his explanation.The 'Nazi' type Schrachter ? is the one who condemns to death and he is joined by hysterical mobs mainly hysterical women screaming for blood. "Du Hund!" Not like Peter Lorre's intellectual defense attorney who will not be silenced and so explains how stupid they all are for wanting to make Lorre disappear.The scenario of course is straight out of late 1920s Weimar politics spiralling down to more chaos with socialism in one form or another and her sister Liberalism competing for solutions.From the social side we see where Lang stands -- crime is a "pathology" and punishment can't bring back the children.Lang's solution is "keep a better watch over our children." That is, the illness is possibly permitted to coexist and is even to a degree acceptable.Although i see the film as a work of art and magnificent genius, perhaps even one of the best films ever made, there is no pulling the wool over my eyes what Lang represents.As part of the expressionist movement so called he is not atypical of this misleading way of dealing with his times.or ours.</fullReview>

If they even see a man touch a child, they blame him.The use of the song from the "Peer Gynt" suite is intense; the murderer (Peter Lorre) starts whistling it whenever he's about to go after a child. Probably the most impressive scene in the movie is when the murderer explains why he does what he does.

It captured the fear the permeates the populace when a child molester and murderer is abducting children. The police turn up the heat and this begins to be felt in the underworld. So much so, they decide to catch / prosecute /execute him. See the movie to find out what happens.The movie is filled with marvelous shots that have obviously been the inspiration for many a movie since. Some of the focus effects using narrow, changing field of view are just stunning. It shows how little modern directors bring to the table with their CGI mega-blockbuster attempts. Imagine CGI in the hands of the really talented! Highly recommended and begs repeated viewings. I've just finished the second for me.PS. I watched the interview with Fritz on the DVD.

		<fullReview>Very good horror-detective movie. I thought the build-up was kind of slow but the final court room drama is so spectacular and awesome that is really unparralled in any movie since then. Lorre´s defense strikes at the heart of the human condition. He is innocent yet accused by people for something he could not possible have prevented. It is in his psychology to act like he does and he has no choiche. The criminals around him has a choice though. They accuse him when they should really accuse themselves. It all comes down to the question of "free will". Nietzsche said that "free will" is a phony conception. This movie seems to discuss this concept in depth though, and it is up to the viewer to make his own judgment. That Lorre is "rescued" by the police in the end suggests that he made a strong defense though. Then a voice puts blame off him by saying: "We must all take better care of our children".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grim and haunting masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** out of ****Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho may be the greatest horror film, but Fritz Lang's M is the greatest film about a psychotic serial killer. Peter Lorre hauntingly plays the psychotic man who is driven by forces beyond his control to hunt down and murder young girls. In turn, he is hunted by unscrupulous criminals of the underworld and the police force. Much like Psycho's, M's characters are flawed and sometimes as pathetic as the killer. Perhaps this is why in both films we find ourselves pulling for the killer. Less so in this film though. Lorre's character is just too creepy to root for, but we sympathize with him all the same. This was Lang's first talking picture, but he doesn't rely heavily on sound as much as slowly paced, silent shots to build suspense and intensify the grim atmosphere of the German ghetto. The final sequence, which includes Lorre's powerful plea, is among the greatest of any film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick and Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching `M' for the third time, I realised that this was where Stanley Kubrick got the image he used for Alex in `A Clockwork Orange'. Look at the gangster chief Schraenker, specifically during the kangaroo court sequence?the appearance, the mannerisms, they're all the same (except that Schraenker doesn't wear his undies on the outside). I wondered for years how Kubrick and McDowell could come up with such a compelling image, and now here's the answer. Other people have pointed that Kubrick's mad Doctor, `Strangelove', is based on the mad scientist Rotwang in `Metropolis', so Kubrick was obviously familiar with Fritz Lang. Speaking of Dr. Strangelove, General Ripper's huge cigar, the phallic way he handles it, and the shots we see of him from crotch level all derive from this movie (especially from Fatty Lohmann); Lang sure knows to make a cigar look disgusting.There's no need for me to make more general comments as other viewers have expounded on its brilliance?the very beginning of this genre of movie, and still better than any of those that have come since. What really sets it apart is its use of black humour and social comment. Since Kubrick is supposed to be the master of black humour, you can see how much he is indebted to `M'. (One joke viewers might not pick up on is where a blackboard in a snack-bar serves as a stock exchange, posting the latest prices for the crusts and knickknacks that the panhandlers have begged and brought in). Lang seems to have single-handedly founded the metaphysical movie (Destiny), the dystopian sci-fi movie (Metropolis), and the serial-killer thriller. His movies previous to `M' were quite sentimental, so he seems to have undergone a big change as he entered the new decade; his wit has become razor-sharp. Doubtless it was the distemper of the times.</fullReview>

That they are sick individuals, themselves the product of warped circumstances, and often capable of being helped, with care and treatment, to become useful members of society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M is a highly interesting film about the hunt for a child murderer in a mid-sized German town called Dusseldorf. The film is especially interesting because it takes the viewer into a realm of madness, unlike they have ever seen before. Also, in addition to having a well-developed and performed plot, the movie has sound, which is an uncommon feature of films made during the 1930's. M starts out with a group of boys and girls seen playing children's game. One of their games, however, features an uncommon song about how there is a possibility of a "strange man dressed in black" coming to take one of them away. This first scene is highly symbolic of the fact that, during that time, the murder was well known and feared throughout the area. The targets of this killer consisted of little girls, who were lured to their death with "bait" such as toys, balloons, and/or candy. As part of taking action against these happenings police search the Dusseldorf area for evidence and raid the underworld on a nightly basis. While this progresses, however, criminal leaders become unsatisfied with what is going on (mainly by the fact that the police are ruining their business), and decide to catch the child murderer themselves. To do this, the leaders turn to a union of beggars, to whom they assign the duty of watching the streets for peculiar men socializing with children. Although the work of the police and the underworld in catching this criminal is highly appreciative, it is not they who finally "spot" him. On one day, when the murderer is trying to lure in another victim, he stops by at a balloon vender to buy her a balloon. The vender, however, being a blind man, quickly spots the killer by his characteristic whistle. Thus, after the he leaves, the blind man tells a young man working for the underworld that the man who is whistling is the child murderer. The young man puts a mark (M) on the killer, by pretending to pat his left shoulder, and tells the rest of the lookouts that he has been spotted. The murderer is soon cornered into a large office building, but after everyone leaves, the criminals break-in and search for him on every floor. Right after they find the killer, however, two unfortunate things happen in consecutive order. First, a guard, who was left unattended for a mere minute or two, pulls an alarm that calls for the police, and thus renders the majority of the criminals to grab the murderer and escape. And second, after the police come, they find a criminal who was unable to escape. Soon, this criminal reveals the location of his colleagues, along with the murderer, to be at an abandoned distillery in Dusseldorf. This information shocks the inspector because he did not by any means expect the underworld criminals to be looking for the child murderer. Back at the distillery, the killer is put on a "people's" trial, which he has no way of winning. There he reveals to everyone that his action do not at all meet his intentions, due to the fact that what he does is a result of obsessively instinctive behavior that he himself cannot control. I, myself, however, do not find this man's words to be true, because in a letter that he wrote to the press he clearly stated that he was the child murderer and that "this is not the end", which indicates that he had some control over his doings. The movie ends with the arrival of the police.As you could probably tell, M is a real "twisted" thriller that is way ahead of its time. The fact that the issues raised by M are as relevant today as they were in the 1930's is extremely impressive. And also the movie' incomplete ending lets your imagination deal with the possible outcomes that might result for the killer, which is another admirable quality. I conclude by saying that I enjoyed M and would give it a 4 star rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare feat (warning: slight spoiler for Hitchcock's Psycho)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot about this film is heavily dated - the editing structure and progression of the story are typical of the era, clunky and heavy-handed by today's standards, and the visual style that was so avant-garde then just looks so '30s now. But Lang did something here that Hitchcock only reproduced three decades later in Psycho and that has rarely been accomplished or even attempted otherwise: he led you to willingly put yourself inside the mind of a very twisted man. Hitchcock did this by setting it up so that by the middle of the film your only choice of a character to identify with, a protagonist, is Norman Bates, since everyone else of any substance has been bumped off. Lang accomplished the feat (with the help of an exquisite performance by Peter Lorre) by simply painting a vivid and subtle portrait of this one character, leaving all the others as bare outlines by comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Fritz Lang was able to deliver the atmosphere of a story such as this, and do it quite well. But, to this day, I still feel that the police/underworld investigation of the crimes took just too much away of this film. In my eyes it would be more of a masterpiece If we were able to catch glimpses of the victim's family as well as the killer throughout. Of Course, We all know that PETER LORRE is the murderer, but there is'nt enough screen time of him to prove so. Still, this is a darn well made motion picture of crime. And yeah, it deserves a good look. Be sure to find the restored version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and H is for hype. For example, "I sat motionless during most of the film, hardly breathing, and my heart pounding; I was practically in tears at the end. This is one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen."Terrifying? Deary me. This film has to be one of the most overrated in history. The plot, what there is, is pedestrian, the acting dreadful - lots of mugging to the camera from actors who've forgotten it's a talkie - and Lorre's histrionic speech at the end is so melodramatically bad it's almost funny. The kangaroo court scene is perfunctory to say the least - a few clichés are duly trotted out about a madman not being responsible for his actions - the mob doesn't agree and prepare to lynch Lorre but then the cavalry arrive in shape of the hitherto flat-footed cops and he's saved. Finally some woman tells us to look after the kids and then, in darkness, that means all of us. The end. Righto, point taken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More social commentary than straight noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the earliest talkies, 1931's "M" kicks off the film noir subgenre in pre-Hitler Germany with a stylistic tale of Peter Lorre's child-murdering psychopath. Fritz Lang's genius for building suspense and using uncomplicated visuals to leave the horror to the audience's imagination is in full effect here. Where a modern film would take us painstakingly through the capture, torture and dispatching of the eight or nine girls Lorre's character goes through before the villagers with pitchforks catch up with him, Lang uses the lingering shot of a balloon caught in electric wires or an empty place-setting to let us figure out that the deed is done. Lang instead focuses his attention on the reaction of society to the killings: people accuse one another wildly, politicians use the events to gain power and police try the nothing-to-see-here tact until Lorre sends a confession note to the local paper. Lorre is the standout performance here eschewing more modern minimalist acting style for one with broad facial expressions, wild gestures and scenery (to the extent the minimalist Lang uses it) chewing soliloquies. These lack of modern touches do make some scenes difficult to comprehend for the modern viewer unacquainted with things that probably made a lot of sense in 1930s Berlin. Also the films unsatisfying ending and noir-ish moral ambiguity (sorry but pointing out that Lorre's accusers also have committed crimes in no way puts them on the same moral depth as someone who has killed eight children) are also points against it. However, if you a fan of "Basic Instinct", "Double Indemnity", "DOA" or other noirs, this is required viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Just you wait, it won't be long, the man in black will soon be here..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was taken aback somewhat by the physical appearance of Peter Lorre as Beckert; I had pictured him more like the scheming character Ugarte from "Casablanca" or the sinister henchman Joel Cairo from "The Maltese Falcon". In "M", he appears almost like a man-child, a roly poly round faced character who doesn't fit the profile of a child molester or murderer. Perhaps that was the point, to make him appear harmless until that creepy window scene where he wipes his lips and swoons with his evil desires while contemplating his next victim. Lorre brings out the evil in Beckert gradually over the course of the story, culminating in that agonizing appeal for mercy before the criminal underground at the finale.That in itself was a unique device for such an early talking picture, the question of whether a child murderer should be turned over to the police by a band of criminals or dealt with privately in vigilante fashion. Adding the third layer of a vagabond beggar society was also an interesting device, keeping the focus of the story at street level as it were, as the beggars used a host of ruses to keep their target in sight.It appeared to me that director Fritz Lang in this, his first talking picture, tried to maintain a link to the silent era with a number of extended scenes that relied on no sound at all. I found it almost distracting during one of the street scenes, since it seemed like it could have been a flaw in the filming rather than an intended result. Particularly since the silence drew attention to itself at the expense of expected background noise simulating street activity. The re-emergence of sound then was more like relief that the film was back on track, even if it was all the while.The other element that seemed overdone was Beckert's whistling that couldn't help but draw attention to himself. It seemed too convenient for the blind balloon man to make the connection with Beckert and Elsie Beckmann based simply on that circumstance. If it was intended to represent a subconscious desire on the part of Beckert to be caught, then that idea wasn't explored satisfactorily. Probably not, but it's interesting to consider.It's also curious to consider the similarities between this film and Lang's silent masterpiece "Metropolis". Both utilize underground locations and capitalize on mob mentality. The tag line of "Metropolis" states that 'there can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator'. Cleverly, the character of Hans Beckert exists with no understanding between his murderous hands and a sick twisted mind, and no mention at all of a non-existent heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's study of serial murder, justice, and the death penalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on an article Fritz Lang read about serial killer Peter Kuerten, M is a fascinating study of the criminal mind. Peter Lorre is compelling as Hans Beckert, a murderer of little girls. His diminutive size and high pitched squeal are used to great effect to hide the enormity of the demons within him. Mr. Beckert preys on little girls, buying them balloons, candy, anything they might want, just as long as they agree to leave with him. The murders are never shown, though, because Lang knew that by leaving them to our imagination, we provide far worse depictions of what may have transpired than anything that could have been put to film. Besides, no censors would have allowed such things to be shot at that time anyway. Instead, we see a balloon with no owner, a ball with no one to bounce it, and a dinner plate awaiting the return of Beckert's latest victim. Of course, the entire town is panic-stricken, and the film shifts its magnifying lens to the effects that Beckert's killing spree has on the remaining populace. We see fear, anger, frustration. The police are at their wits' end, attempting to catch a criminal who strikes on impulse and leaves hardly any clues at the murder scenes. To make matters worse, the frenzied public cannot agree on any solid leads. Even the underworld is haunted by the murders. The police are everywhere, searching for any clue at all, and the criminals have no way of getting around to their ill-gotten gains. Finally, the criminals decide it is up to them to succeed where the police have failed, and so, they decide to catch the monster themselves. In the meantime, psychological evidence taken from Beckert's hand-writing leads the police to the conclusion that Hans is clinically insane, killing out of a pathological need. The man hunt continues until a mob of criminals finally track down the perpetrator. Hans is then taken to an abandoned ware-house where he is subjected to a kangaroo court. In a panic, Hans admits that he has no control over his murdering little children, he pleads insanity. He begs to be placed under police custody, which is a joke to the "court," compromised of every criminal that had to put his work on hold because of Beckert's string of homicides. Peter Lorre is spectacular in conveying Hans' desperation and the agony with which he lives every day of his life. His words fall on deaf ears, except for the man who has been appointed to "defend" him. His defense argues that he cannot be held responsible his actions if he cannot control himself. A wonderful debate takes place here, arguing over the justice or injustice of the death penalty, and whether or not it fair to punish a man who is clinically insane. Just before his sentence is to be carried out, though, the police arrive, and Beckert is taken into custody. You never find out what happens to him, though, as the film ends with the mother of one of the victims telling us that the no court ruling can ever bring her child back. Some may find this film slow or disappointing because of a lack of "action" or a some-what anti-climactic ending, but I believe that this film does what it set out to do. It sheds some light on the criminal mind, shows the psychological effects that a serial killer has on us all, questions our sense of justice, and also questions the morality of the death penalty. This film is disturbing, and I will admit that I find it a little slow here and there, but there is so much here to think about, that I cannot help but give it 9 out of 10 stars. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Langs first talkie and Peter Lorre's first starring role, M is a shocking masterpiece of German cinema, profoundly disturbing and way ahead of its time.There is a child killer on the loose in 1930s Germany, and no little girl is safe upon the streets. Loosely based on the real life murders of Peter Kurten, the Vampire of Dusseldorf, M manages to horrify without showing a single drop of blood. The horror here is all suggestion. Another little girl is missing, and as her terrified mother screams her name over and over, we are shown stark images of simple things: an empty chair with a waiting plate, a rubber ball rolling out of the bushes, a balloon. The horror is so huge and unspeakable that nothing more needs to be seen. We can imagine what has happened. It is truly devastating.Fans of modern, fast paced slasher films will probably find this boring and talky. German police and street ruffians spend much of the film arguing about who the killer is and how to find him and stop him. The paranoia is rich, and the irony is brilliant as the city's criminals form their own lynch mob and hunt the killer down.The killer is played by Peter Lorre, the most seriously underrated actor of the times. Lorre is magnificent here, a babyfat, bug-eyed creep, cool and slick one moment, a shaking, sweating wreck the next. His climactic scene at films end, as he is put on "trial," is an absolute jaw dropper. Lorre plays his killer flawlessly. You hate him, you are sickened by him, but, in the end, you also feel terribly sorry for him. This is not an easy thing for an actor to accomplish. Sympathy for the Devil is no easy feat, but Lorre does it, and he does it triumphantly. This film would forever damn him to roles as the "creepy little weirdo" for he simply played it too well. If your knowledge of Mr. Lorre is limited to his small role in "Casablanca" or his twitchy turn in "Arsenic and Old Lace" then I beg you to rent M and see what an awesome actor he truly was.This movie haunted me for weeks after I saw it. I will never forget how it felt to sit there, watching Lorre plead for his life with my eyes wide and my mouth hanging open in absolute frozen shock. This film is a masterpiece, so far ahead of its time in portraying the psychological profile of a serial killer (some 40 years before the term "Serial Killer" was even invented!) and the methods used in tracking one down that the film never seems dated. It is as strong today as it was in 1930. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSI won't go over the plot here. I have yet to see a good print of this film.It's one of the earlier talkies and is scratchy and blurry and a nuisance to watch and listen to. Sometimes the scenes -- even the action scenes -- have no sound whatever, not even wild sound, so it's like watching a silent movie without any musical accompaniment. And then there are subtitles, which aren't badly done, although some of the uniquely German curse words emerge in a milder form in print. (Well, maybe at that there's no easy way to translate something like "Scheisskerln" into anything other than "swine" or "pig.") It's a nuisance to watch but a powerful and inventive film. Certainly it's got to be one of Peter Lorre's two or three best roles. He's pudgy and young here and it makes him seem vulnerable and helpless even while he's in the clutches of his murderous compulsions. The other roles are rather by-the-book and, if it may be said, sometimes the players overact. A police inspector is not only surprised to hear some news. His cigar and its holder must drop out of his mouth in a cloud of smoke and when he picks it back up his hands must twitch spastically. But it's not any particular role or any particular piece of business that gives this film the impact it has. It's the plot itself. Both sides of the law slowly closing in on a man who cannot keep himself from assaulting and murdering little girls. (There is no violence on screen. When Lorre kills a young girl he's just walked off with, we know it has happened because we see the balloon he's bought for her floating away, catching for a heartbreaking moment in the telephone lines.) Lorre's speech at his mock trial by the underworld is moving in its inarticulateness. The man can't describe his motives. He's not a philosopher but a creature controlled by forces he can't identify. When he's being pursued through the building he's hiding in we can almost smell his fear.Lang manages to introduce a bit of humor into a pretty grim story. Our introduction to the Inspector in charge of Homicide includes a shot from under the guy's desk, so we see his bulk from between his legs, his waistband pulled up to his Hitchcockian chest. And the police capture one of the thieves and interrogate him, trying to find out what the gang was after. They lie to him, telling him that one of the guards who was conked on the head died, and that he's now charged with murder. Lang gives us a quick cut to a shot of the perfectly healthy guard sitting at dinner and stuffing himself full of wurst and gulping from what appears to be a gallon-sized glass of beer. There is some interesting stuff about police procedures too. Good Lord, what thoroughness! They take it step by step, while the underworld uses beggars to track Lorre down. It's a movie without much in the way of subtlety though. None of the characters is very introspective except Lorre. Nobody suffers from self doubt. When they get together for a talk, the characters shout at one another. And the disrespect shown for authority figures is shocking. But maybe the most striking feature of the film is its almost total absence of sentimentality. Little girls are being serially murdered, but Lang doesn't dwell on a mother's grief. And the underworld, although disapproving of the crimes themselves, are primarily annoyed at the murderer for getting the police aroused enough to interfere with their criminal enterprises. When the criminals stage a kangaroo court to try Lorre, the drunken "defense counsel" rises to make his statement, and he begins with something like, "I would like to address the honorable judge who has, I believe, three murders to his own credit." "That has nothing to do with this case!", exclaims the judge.It occurred to me while watching the movie that it would be a good film to show in any social science class. It shows a society almost completely alien to ours -- Berlin in the early 1930s -- in which horrible murders take place and the director shows us a society organizing itself against the killer, but without any pathos whatever. Lang doesn't manipulate the viewer by letting us get to know the victims or their families, or by forcing us to listen to long speeches about how terrible these murders are. He lets us TAKE IT FOR GRANTED that the characters on both sides hate the murderer. It's almost a compliment to the viewer. Lang assumes that you already know evil when you see it, just as the characters in the movie do -- so why go on about it? It may be an alien culture but the judgments made are universal in their application. At least in this respect, these people are just like us.</fullReview>

We never see his evil deeds, but we know what's happening because we hear his eerie, disturbing whistling of the theme from "Peer Gynt" before the child is murdered.The entire city is in an uproar. Someone is slaughtering their innocents. The police are cracking down. The gangsters and the underworld are ticked off, too. This child murderer is making it hard for them to keep picking pockets and turning tricks! Something must be done. The criminals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt down this killer.Lang was a German citizen and made this film in his home country at the onset of Nazism. He was disgusted by what he felt was the coming ruination of his beloved country. He made "M" in response to the ugliness he was beginning to see in Germany. Consequently, the film was banned by the Nazi regime, although ironically they wanted Lang to be their official filmmaker, a position he refused. In what is now famous Hollywood lore, he left the meeting with the Nazi officals and fled to America on a train, leaving everything (including his wife, a Nazi sympathizer) behind."M" is more than a powerful statement on the human condition. It's a social satire that grows deeper and scarier on each viewing. God help us if we forget the lessons learned in "M".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally chilling and effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This German film is about the search among the underworld for a sadistic child rapist-murderer. Even among the lowest elements of society, they are outraged and the film shows the underworld figures mobilizing to find the murderer and bring him to justice. This is an exceptionally interesting and unusual idea, and their intent is NOT to bring him to the police,...at least not alive! No, they are out for blood and have no intention of letting the perpetrator go. Peter Lorre plays the killer and this film helped make him an international star. Despite this being a very important role for him, he actually doesn't have all that many lines in the film and it's really an ensemble cast that guides this film. The movie gets kudos for its grim and realistic atmosphere. While technically NOT a film noir movie, the lighting and earthiness of the story seem to have inspired later noir films. I particularly loved the odd camera angles and exceptional black and white filming--it was extremely effective and set a great mood. I also liked how the film focused on forensics, the actual steps taken during the investigation and very realistic style of film making--almost like a documentary. An exceptional and dark film that is way ahead of its time--as well as one you won't soon forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, Fritz.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of garbage during my semester of Film Studies, but this film, surprisingly, wasn't half bad. Actually, for todays standards, it is pretty bad. However, compared with any Russian film created at this time, the "M" as the film title should stand for "Masterpiece". This movie is about 1000% more realistic than Battleship Potemkin, therefore, it deserves to be taken seriously.I typically rate my movies based on how frequently i fall asleep during them. And in this film i only fell asleep one time. I give Fritz Lang an A+ on this film. Fritz Lang makes Sergei Eisenstein look like a dumb red-headed step-child. If i had the opportunity to travel backwards in time and decide whether to drop the atom bomb on Hiroshima or on the storage house where every copy of Battleship Potemkin was kept, i would definitely choose the latter.The only advice i would have given Mr. Lang for this film is that he really needs to include some more sweet babes and sweet action. That's all that really needs to be said. Peace out POTRATZ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the most masterful depiction of mental illness ever in a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things about "M" that impresses me the most is how comfortable it is with the new medium of sound. Most early talkie pictures are incredibly awkward (see Tod Browning's "Dracula" for example). "M" has the same silences, but none of them seem unnecessary. They all add to a sense of dread and bleakness. This film has one of the most haunting atmospheres ever and (even though I haven't seen too many early German talkies) is a completely unique experience. Also, it hasn't dated one bit. The cross-cutting between the investigations of the police and the underworld are masterfully done and feel as if they could've come out of any crime thriller made today. The editing is masterful as is the direction. In my mind, this is Fritz Lang's masterpiece. Additionally, it was probably the first sexual deviant in cinema, predating both "Psycho" and "Peeping Tom" by nearly thirty years. It takes such a taboo subject and handles it in a very tasteful way. Lang manages to imply the murders happened without actually showing them or any bloodshed.The film is as important to cinema as "Citizen Kane". In addition to its influence, its still a chilling experience. The lead performance by Peter Lorre is amazing. He managed to become a star and is a compelling character, despite very limited screen time. He is obviously a diseased individual and you can't help but feel sorry for him throughout. His final monologue about not being able to help himself is still the most masterful depiction of mental illness ever in a film. The film has a minimalist atmosphere which makes it quite haunting. This is one of the films you must see if you have any interest in the evolution of cinema or in just good movies. "M" has aged incredibly well and remains one of the greatest films ever made. I really can't think of a single flaw in the whole film. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other Fritz Lang masterpiece besides Metropolis from what I know of. Here we are on the hunt for our bug-eyed child murderer Hans Beckert played by Peter Lorre. I think he has an awesome face or at least his expression is really something. We are hunting him down through a very dark and hostile, shadow filled Berlin. This is the original, if not the best, serial killer flick. I don't want to spoil it for anybody.....but we do catch him, we are all there. The camera work here is great, its quite a shock when he gets caught because we are in his shoes. And we just don't see it coming, or believe it is coming. I was quite unsure if I wanted him to get caught, i don't think its what I wished. He begs and pleads for mercy and lets us know what his very dramatic problem is. Now what? Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtle warning against Nazism and an excellent Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's classic M still acts as a milestone for films today; his use of mise-en-scene and editing is remarkable by any standard. In a scene where the gang lords and city authorities are discussing what to do about Peter Lorre's character, their complete blindness to the situation is displayed through the rooms being smothered in cigarette smoke, like a smokescreen. Quality stuff. This scene is also cross-cut between the two parties to show how similar they are and of course not to bore the audience.The link to Nazism comes at its strongest at the trial scene. Here the character Schrenker shrieks down at Hans Beckart using words like "extinguished" and "obliterated" that only Hitler would use when accusing the Nazi enemies at trial. The film was banned in Germany (1934) after it was made and later both Peter Lorre and Fritz Lang fled Germany to America for their Jewish faith before the Nazis came into power.One shot that is quite baffling is an undignified view of Lohmann from underneath a desk. What a weird idea, but it watching afterwards the reason for the shot comes true when we find out that Lohmann thinks he has all the knowledge about the reasons for the bank raid. He then open-mouthed drops his cigar when he finds out he was on the complete wrong track. Makes perfect sense.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging psycho-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, I thought a foreign film would never work out as a psycho-thriller kind of movie. "M" proved me wrong.Fritz Lang's film reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock, the master at thrilling mystery movies. "M" is about a child murderer (Peter Lorre in an excellent performance) whose whereabouts are unknown until he is discovered as the last man who saw one of the latest murder victims alive. Desperate to escape and elude punishment, he makes a plea for his life.This is an awesome film, despite being in black and white. Although it will never be better than "Psycho," "Rebecca," or "North by Northwest," it rightfully earns its' place as one of the best foreign films of all time.</fullReview>

This was the first talking film in Germany. The Cinema course I had showed M as one of the ten most influential movies of all time. With wonderful directing by Fritz Lang and a stellar performance by Peter Lorre, it's more thrilling than what you'll find produced today by Hollywood. The story is timeless.It's also a fascinating snapshot of Germany right before the Nazis took over and the Art Deco of the time. The story was inspired by a real case in Dusseldorf. It was so powerful that clips were used in antisemitic propaganda by the Nazis. (They needed it - their propaganda was REALLY boring!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Manhunt in Cinematic History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 30s, silent maestro Fritz Lang made his first foray into sound films with this police procedural, M (or, in its original title, Murderers Among Us). Child murderer Hans Beckert (Lorre) terrorizes a community, and before long every law enforcement agency is on the case, putting such pressure on the underworld that it too starts its own manhunt... But who will catch him first?For such an innovative film, the miracle of M is how definitively it masters many of the concepts it pioneered: the layered narrative, the ominous, minimalist use of sound and sophisticated vision of madness were groundbreaking at the time, and endure to this day. Seven decades later this remains the finest manhunt in the history of cinema.Everything works, not just, in pure Lang tradition, the amazing visuals, a dynamic evolution of his trademark impressionistic style, but also in the clever editing, presence or absence of sound, and, more than anything, a serendipitous combination of smart casting and great acting.There is the revelation of Peter Lorre, already an established stage giant at the time, as the killer, in one of the silver screen's most legendary performances. There is Otto Wernicke's pudgy, savvy commissioner Lohman, a character so awesome Lang reused him in his Testament of Dr Mabuse. There is the endless parade of unforgettable characters, big and small...Through it all, what keeps the film so enduring, engaging and fascinating is Lang's fearless willingness to empathize with the killer, allowing us an unprecedented and seldom-equaled look into a frightening abyss, and a just as eerie commentary on a society on the verge of collapse. The cloud of Nazism looms heavily on the horizon.This is one of the films that will set the standard by which you judge all subsequent films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Lorre (Franz Becker),"Arsenic &amp; Old Lace",'44 made his first great screen debut and was type-cast throughout his entire career because of this film. The same situation happened to Boris Karloff after "The Criminal Code" '31 and "Frankenstein". Bela Lugosi, "Dracula", experienced the same doom into the Horror or Evil character roles. All these actors were under-rated by Hollywood and were great actors who were capable of performing in great acting roles and were never given the chance, because of box office dollars and cents. I am quite sure they did not regret having appeared in these films, for we would never have known these great Classic Actors who were very under paid compared to the pay checks of actors today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmed in Berlin in the early days of naziism, you get the feel-ing that the citizens of Berlin knew something terrible was onthe way. Peter Lorre stars as a child killer. No one suspectshim at first because he appears so harmless. After much futilepolice work, there is finally a break in the case. The under-world element decides to capture the elusive killers themselves.Not out of a sense of duty to the community but to take the heatoff their own illicit operations. They want to get back in tothe business of making money. They charge the town beggars withthe task of watching out for Lorre. A blind vendor finallyremembers that the abductor whistled a certain tune which was ahabit of his. Thus, they were able to isolate him and corner himshortly thereafter. You must see this film just for the shootingof the scenes alone. A great spartan technique that gets themessage across, with a strange but plausible ending. It reallyis a piece of film making history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much more sophisticated than films of its time, or today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I found astonishing about this film, after seeing it for the first time in thirty years, is how far ahead it is, not only of other films of its time, but of present day films as well. The basement trial scene illustrates just how unsentimental this film is: rather than letting us (or the killer) off easy by telling us what to think, Lang keeps jerking us between pleas for mercy, requests for legality, and demands for vengeance, without making any of them obviously more "right" than the other. Lorre's performance is, moreover, not only brilliant, but believable--enough to draw our sympathy without letting us forget just what it is he has done. An amazing accomplishment for 1931. And an amazing one for 1999 as well. Compare M to Silence of the Lambs, which was, in the final analysis, a movie about a freak show monster and another killer, who was given characteristics, but no personality. Lambs looked on the FBI crime lab's investigative prowess with all the critical detachment of a groupie and set its story in a never-never land of politics that meant nothing to anyone in the real world. M, on the other hand, set its story in something like real world Berlin, with a political commentary that, whatever Lang meant, was still subversive enough to raise the Nazis' suspicions. And finally the look of the movie--expressionism that looks modern, film noir without the palm trees. A beautiful, brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mind is a wonderful thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely brilliant movie! It is hard to believe that it was made in 1931. The director, Fritz Lang was very much ahead of his time. The editing is as good as a movie can get. The scenes of the police meeting in the early hours of the morning at the same time as the mob leaders are meeting and the cutting back and forth between the meetings adds tremendously to the pace and suspense of the movie.It is also quite refreshing and revealing that we never see the murders. Yet, the horror of them very definitely comes across in the conversations people hold, in their physical reactions, and in the scenes that occur after the murder has been committed. All is proof that you don't need to show gore to get across what is happening. Certainly there are times when blood and gore is appropriate, such as in a war movie. But, the majority of films today contain such scenes that do not add to the movie except to satisfy some strange need to see more and more violence. It is as if we are back in the days of Rome and the increasing violence and gore that the crowds wanted to see in the coliseum. They became jaded and bored and to keep them happy began showing ever more brutal events. Mindless comes to mind.Todays directors need to study movies like M and re-adopt the method of telling stories that involves a person's mind. The mind is a wonderful thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was great then, but is it so now? I really doubtSure it had one of the finest acting in the climax, but 80 years later and having seen many movies that had superb acting in climaxes like Few Good Men being one, this falls short. Also, it comes as a tad silly than what it truly was, like a Monster being searched extraneously and at the end is found out by a girl and is marked M on his shirt which he cannot rub and erase. Oh, this one thing bothered me a lot. Also, at the end when this man is supposed to be brutally punished for what he has done, he brings up a case of his own that he too deserves a chance. Fine then, what was the whole point of the film is what I had thought.Intriguing with suspense as to what is going to happen for the first half, it falls flat as per the expectations the film arose in me. Oh, he even hides in a place where he is very easily caught. Damn, was it for this man that the whole of police found, it's like making mockery of police searches which was an innovative thing as long as in 30's.Fritz Lang who was than considered a great director if had seen the film now, would not have liked it as it is too very obvious at many places. He did a good job just to throw it off at the end is what I firmly believe. Yet, this a good film for what it does is make us sit and watch with a hope that something great or something gruesome is going to happen. Nothing of that sort though happens but we are relived by superb acting and great production design and oh, yes good music that for a film in 1930's is a great sign.Its is by no means bad, yet it does not become a great film as per me. It is just average as it did not reach what I have really expected it to be. A 2/5 for a movie by Lang that is more or less social message oriented and is filled with suspense that rises to a peak just to fall flat later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I saw the wrong film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yikes. This is the second "classic" I'm reviewing in the same day where my opinion is almost the polar opposite of the consensus (the other was Things to Come, 1936). At least I do not feel that M is a complete disaster. The final third is actually quite good, and there are occasional moments of artistic merit prior to that. Further, you should watch M at least once for the same reason that you should head out to see the Emperor parade by in his new clothes at least once--namely, because everyone is talking about it, a lot of people are being influenced by it, and so on. But M is far from a masterpiece. Comparing M to classic Hitchcock is almost criminal. The hot air that's regularly emitted about this film could fill a million balloons for street vendors. The first two thirds of M are pretty bad--I almost couldn't make it to the ending, which would have been a shame, and I'm someone who is almost _never_ tempted to bail out on a film.The crux of the story is that there is a serial killer targeting young girls in a large German City. The time period is the film's present. The police are having difficulty catching the killer, who is regularly making the headlines of the local paper, especially as the killer keeps writing taunting notes to be published. After the latest murder, a large vigilante group of panicked citizens, including a fair number of criminals, decides to take action. They organize, dividing up the city into quadrants for different people to patrol, and they try to keep the police uninvolved.The problem with the majority of the film, in a nutshell, is that the storytelling is extremely sloppy. The script, co-written by director Fritz Lang, is all over the map. There are way too many characters. The audience doesn't get to know any of them, at least in the first hour. Instead, it is scene after scene of people we've never met before, mostly sitting or standing around and fretting about how they're going to catch the killer. Lang's direction is extremely flat, and the editing is even worse. The pacing is horrible. There are superfluous pregnant pauses around every corner. There are a lot of superfluous insert shots. There is a lot of poorly chosen camera placement. The absence of a score, except for the killer whistling a famous bit of Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt, doesn't help. There are no characters to care about. There are no characters to follow into a story. The scenes have all the flow of waiting for two hours in a dentist's office. The dialogue is bland.And the plot unfolds very linearly--this is even true when the film improves in its final third. There are no surprises or twists to be had here. All of the information that the police and the vigilantes need basically falls right into their laps. They hardly run into a kink. There are a couple small problems, but they're easily resolved.For a thriller, M has very little tension. The first hour is more in the realm of "police procedural", but it's very slow at that, and the police aren't in it enough, or at least there's not enough procedure shown, to make it work. M is also considered a film noir, but residence in that genre is more superficial here. At any rate, it doesn't help create an engaging film.But, as I mentioned, there are a few moments of value in the first hour. These mostly come by way of cinematographic symbolism. For example, one shot shows a child's balloon being ensnared in power lines. That and a rolling ball are sufficient to convey that the child has fallen into the killer's trap and is now dead. Some of the interesting symbolism is a bit heavy-handed, but still attractive. For example, a potential child victim who ends up in front of a store's picture window, beneath a large arrow pointing down at her, and next to a hypnotically spinning spiral.The improvement arrives once the vigilante mob believes it has the killer cornered. This is more than an hour into the film. The sequence where they're "taking the place apart" is well directed and actually becomes suspenseful. We finally get to know a couple characters, later including two members of the police force. The crowning scene features Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert giving an impassioned speech before a huge vigilante mob--he's defending himself before a kangaroo court. Yes, Lorre is excellent here, but he's not in the film enough. 15 minutes of an excellent performance, with scattered moments elsewhere, are surely not enough to put M on "best films of all time" lists.Lang has interesting things to say about (vigilante) justice and criminal culpability. But the vigilante justice stuff was to be much better handled by Lang elsewhere, such as Fury (1936), which is very nearly a 10. Beckert's culpability speech covers some of the basic issues that one would in an ethics class, but it's not very complete--it doesn't delve into the ontology of choice enough, and of course, it doesn't answer any of the issues. The latter fact is probably for the better. There aren't really easy answers, although my personal view is that choice is not strictly necessary for responsibility or culpability. This scene also at least implies a lot of the ethical issues involved with the formal justice system, vis-?-vis insanity defenses, the possibility of parole, and so on.But why couldn't Lang have dived right into the material of the last half-hour after, say, a 5 or 10-minute prologue? The film ends abruptly. Extend the ending and cut out all of the fiddling-about garbage that consumes the majority of the screen time. This is just bad screen writing, and it doesn't deserve the praise it has received.</fullReview>

M was Lang's first foray into sound film although he had directed over a dozen films previously including Metropolis.Over the years the film has become a defining classic that rivals Lang's other works for the title of "magnum opus". The lead, Peter Lorre, was typecast for years after the film's release as a villain for his portrayal of a child murderer (and, it is implied, a pedophile). M also pioneered the use of leitmotif to give the film score a more intense feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The not so mysterious M</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filled with long silent shots of dour faces and dirty places, Fritz Lang's "M" paints the Pre-Nazi playground for his not so mysterious, near silent German murder mystery. The contempt the director felt for the setting is palpable in this movie; from the dark and dirty undergrounds to the hazy smoke filled police headquarters, the film oozed the grimy corrupt society Lang seemed to loathe. The characters are sour, angry and unrelatable and while containing a brief yet sweet taste of suspense it's just a dark and abstruse murder mystery that leaves you feeling an unsatisfying disconnected after a sad translucent attempt at mystery and silent shots of obscure things. We'll take the Murderer for example, one of the least mysterious character in the movie. Throughout the film you can obviously tell he is the insane killer that we are all so use to in today's movies. As he knocks down a couple cold ones to silence the voices in his head, bugs out his eyes as he stares down another little victim or makes frightening faces at himself in shop windows the director makes the point very clear; 'He kills because he's crazy'. No backstory or develop beyond this is given, and yet he's the character we know the most about! The lack of a real protagonist or any relatable or even understandable characters really causes a disconnect when you watch this movie.You'll find yourself wondering more about the odd silent shots of greasy sausages or how the inspector's mustache manages to stay attached to his incessantly flapping lips than you will about any of the characters. The height of this film is of course the scene when our baby faced serial killer is trapped like a treed coon by some of Germany's underground crime bosses, intent on killing the fool that had put the cops on high alert, thus messing with their unsavory business. In this scene you feel the thrill that perhaps someone will finally catch the weirdo and put him to some kind of justice. The suspense is more due to the fact that you've now waited for three fourths of the movie listening to the dimwitted, mustachioed inspectors arguing about how they can't catch the killer and yet a blind balloon salesman does. None the less it is definitely a high point, as the pursuers finally manage to corner the killer. Sadly though the moment is marred by a badly rushed ending and an unfortunately lengthy camera shot from under the police commissioner's desk aimed directly at his 'bratwurst'. So while this dreary German tale provided a small and enjoyable instance of suspense, this "mystery movie" lacked just that: mystery. Not only do you know who the murderer is right off the bat, but don't really care how it turns out because you don't know (and frankly don't want to know) any of the characters. Fritz Lang's "M" is a mustachioed misfortune of a mystery movie that rather than leaving me mystified like many during its time, left me with the urge to grow a mustache and never watch another Fritz Lang film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's M is undoubtedly one of cinema's most influential works. It set a precedent for all thrillers that would follow. It demonstrates the properties of mis en scene with expertise and style. But it is not a perfect film. Certainly, I am biased due today's higher standards for story telling through film, but M is cinema at its basics, and as such, it feels very simplified.The story is very straight forward; there is a child-killer on the loose and both the cops and the crooks are out to get him. But I feel the film suffers because of this. There is no expansion on the themes of the story and the message is practically told to you in the film's last line rather than gradually developed throughout the entire film. It is this kind of simplification that leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied. While it would be unfair to go so far as to call it shallow, M offers no depth in terms of story or characters.The characters in general are barely even developed. With the exception of Peter Lorre's Beckett, we are not given time to understand who the characters are. Each scene we meet a new major dialog character, and most of the time, we never see them again. While Lang and writer Thea von Harbou did an admirable job indicating who we were supposed to view as the good guys, they did not give the audience time to connect with the more important characters, like the missing child's mother, or the police captain. This leaves the viewer feeling more detached and less likely to respond to the film. The performances are also over the top, a practice that was left over from the silent era.The story itself is rather poorly paced, or rather, it could have been edited better. With the story rarely intercutting between the police's investigation into the child-killer and the criminal's hunt for the murderer, the film should have more individual scenes, thus creating a more rapid and intense sense of suspense. The transitions themselves between the scenes could have been improved as well. Lang makes frequent use of the fade technique (a technique that is often overused in many classic films), thus creating a sense of dreaminess. Whether this was his intention or not, I feel that it is distracting and further detaches the viewer from the emotional content of the film.Perhaps the most noticeable element that is missing from the picture is music. This has more to do with the emergence of talkies than it does with anything else. It was felt by most film makers at the time that the music that had provided most of the emotion of the old silents would be too distracting and create clutter in a film in which there is a practical soundtrack. But it is in the use of 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' that proves to be one of the most innovative aspects of the film. Not only does it serve as a plot point, with it being used to point out the killer, but it set a trend of associating musical cues to identify to the viewer who the protagonist and who the antagonists were and when they were influencing the story.The other notable aspect of the film is Peter Lorre's performance. Through his portrayal of Hans Beckert, we learn to sympathize with the killer. We are drawn in by his pleas for mercy, and we can feel his fear as the crooks search for him in the bank building. The lighting of his character is also particularly effective, as it always keeps him in the shadows, creating a mood of foreboding whenever we see him (or his shadow, for that matter).Again, I am viewing this from the perspective of a time in which tastes and standards are vastly different than in the time that M was made. But I can still see why this film is held in such high regard. Without it, modern thrillers would not be where they are today. Influence that it has on modern cinema is irreplaceable. And the theme of the film, unfortunately, still rings true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this for the first time two nights ago. I was pretty unimpressed. I found it to be dull for the first hour or so. Peter Lorre was very good. His performance at the end saved the movie for me. I liked where the title snuck in. Not bad, but definitely not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I expected too much...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I loved "Metropolis" and was mesmerized by the great storyline of "M", I happily shelled out 25 euro's to get the deluxe DVD-set of Fritz Lang's first talkie, fully expecting I was going to view it over and over again.Well, that was 25 euro's I should have spent on a new haircut or something. This is a very boring film, one that is only somewhat redeemed by a great Peter Lorre and an interesting final scene. But the first hour was sooo slooow! Low point was a ten-minute scene in which four boring men were having a round-table about deciding what to do about the child killer. No camera movement whatsoever, just blabbering, and no oneliners either. He's a killer, for heaven's sake - ACTION! DO SOMETHING! STOP HIM! ...Looking back, maybe I was even more mesmerized by the brand "M". The film posters are great, and that single M just makes for a classic, even harrowing logo.Still, I honestly can't believe that a modern viewer would actually enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, but not suspenseful by today's standards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so much about Fritz Lang, I decided to watch M last night. I think my only complaint was that I had the old grainy/blurry version with poor subtitles. Anyway, I've only seen a few people give the same opinion as mine. Others seem to think it's flawless. First of all, I did enjoy the film and recommend this to all film buffs, especially those interested in early cinema. The film's plot is that of a kidnapper/murderer. The murderer is putting the whole city in panic; stopping the mobsters from doing their 'business' and making the police look like scum.The whole point of this film is not the plot. In fact, I'll say this right now, the plot is very dull and cliché (by today's standards). But it's this early cinema, pre-film noir, which really makes the film interesting. Lang uses unusual techniques to show eerie, creepy and lonely imagery. Towards the start of the film, we see the murderer's shadow on his own wanted poster. We see his mentality break down through a song he whistles. We see the fear transferred to him in the second half, when the hunter becomes the hunted. It's for style and approach of direction that one must see this film.The negative part is the plot. I'm sure a few will disagree, but in my opinion, it's very stale. I saw someone mention that this plot has never been done in the past 70 years, that is a completely inaccurate statement! It's the most typical plot in film history, a killer is on the loose, the first half is tracking him down, the second half is a type of vigilante group chasing him through a building. For this reason, this interesting film becomes less intriguing. The plot has been done so many times that it's become stale and weary and definitely ruins part of the viewing pleasure that you might have got 70 years ago, especially in a time when speech was first being implemented into film.I do recommend this film, but I also warn you at the same time. Watch it for its direction, keep in mind the time it was made and more importantly, the time it was set (think of the Nazis). Don't expect a gripping plot; just enjoy a nice classic film. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual but no suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps this was influential at the time but as entertainment now it has little to offer.The plot is simple enough, a serial killer is loose and the police can't find, pretty normal. Where it becomes more interesting is that the police, to show the public they are trying, harass the criminal community to the point that the criminals start to look for the killer. This is a nice idea.Unfortunately the good parts of the plot stop there, the way the killer is identified makes no sense at all, it is hard not to shout "wtf?" at the TV, it is contrived and unbelievable and just plain stupid.There is also no suspense in the film, the chase scene has an obvious conclusion and although you are kept in doubt as to what the fate of the killer will be you don't care, he has no personality.There is also a lot of preaching in the final sequence about the death penalty and insanity that becomes very annoying.The acting is good, pretty much everyone delivers which is especially unusual in films of this vintage.Dated and lacking in real entertainment.I don't understand the high rating it has got, maybe people are going easy on it because it is old but new or old it has to entertain and it doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incomprehensibility does not equal art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Peter Lorre's and I love black &amp; white films. I enjoy foreign films. I even like trying to twist my brain around mind-boggling, symbol-filled, convoluted art flicks. But I was incredibly disappointed in, *M*.It had a lot of potential, but it kept drowning in itself. It took me a while to understand this. The plot itself wasn't overly complex -- so why did I still have the feeling of unpleasant confusion. What I finally realized is that *M*'s downfall is that it can't decide what it is.I went into it with a general understanding of what it was going to be about, and knowing Peter Lorre's work I had certain expectations. The parts of the movie that were most satisfying to me were those which fit those expectations: a tense, shadowy atmosphere made all the more eerie and suspenseful by the skillful use of, "In the Hall of Mountain King."Other parts of the movie felt more like a police procedural. There is certainly a place for the Ed McBain's of our world, but that place is not being mixed in with Robyn Cook. These segments felt out of place, and they jarringly interrupted the mood created by the spookier, more emotionally taut scenes.The much-applauded ending had the same problem for me: it suddenly introduced yet another mood -- that of introspection and social consciousness. This was too distinct from either of the other two moods to feel as if it were even part of the same picture.Each mood, each theme, each general strain could have been very good on its own -- but, as a package, the film felt ill-blended. And, as much as I enjoy paradox and even confusion, they are not, in of themselves, sufficient criteria for a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why so much tobacco smoke in the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TCM [Turner Classic Movies ] had this movie on this week. It is a very good movie , whose theme lives today in society. Is someone guilty of their crimes , when they are insane at the same time?.But that is not my question about this movie. My question is why all the photography of tobacco smoke.Notice that in virtually every scene, the males are smoking big cigars , and different styled water pipes of pipe tobacco. The insideous tobacco smoke is everywhere!I got nauseous watching it. What was the director trying to express. Was he was a non-smoker, and suffered as a second hand smoker?It wasn't that long ago, maybe 15 years , that we were allowed to smoke in hospitals, and courthouses. [And that was absolutely discussting].Was he an activist , with a silent voice against smoking?This movie was made in 1931. I have seen many movies from that old era that don't come close to the tobacco that M has.Keep in mind , the MAA [Medical Assocition of America] did not discover lung cancer until 1934.Maybe Mr. Lang was also a visionary about the medical health of smokers?Just a thought, because of all the tobacco smoke in this movie.

		<shortDescription>Slowly paced social drama and early film noir from Lang...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What hurts "M" most of all is the pace. It's almost as though the new transition from silent to sound film had not yet given filmmakers enough time to polish their work. Fritz Lang directs some scenes in "M" with the full force of the sound technique--namely, the scenes where the criminals and police are both telling us why they want to capture the serial killer of little girls. Then, there's an abrupt switch to silent technique as we follow the man on his rounds (PETER LORRE) and watch as he finds a hideout that drags much of the last part of the film out beyond necessity.A taut filming of this story, with the same clever use of shadows and atmospheric effects, and perhaps some menacing background music on the soundtrack, would have made "M" a much more efficient thriller.A smoother technique of telling both a heist tale, the hunt for a serial killer and an ending loaded with social commentary on the workings of a sick mind, require much more than Fritz Lang was able to deliver within the confines of a film that is part silent and part talkie in technique.PETER LORRE plays the killer with his usual wide-eyed look of terror (the deer in the headlights look that he perfected over and over again in other films), but there are times when a little restraint in his performance might have helped. The melodramatic ending where he faces a jury of his peers would have been more effective if the final scene was not cut so abruptly for "The End" title. Having robed judges entering a courtroom without rendering a verdict is hardly a satisfying conclusion to this sort of crime and punishment tale. The abruptness makes me think something was cut from the version I saw.The print shown on TCM was in fine form and the cinematography was exceptional considering when the film was made.</fullReview>

The plot as such is maybe not too hot - we've seen this kind of thing over and over - but the direction, acting and photography... absolutely stunning (a bit of overacting, perhaps, but it was an early sound-movie). This movie is 70 years old, and it still moves you. Peter Lorre is great in the title role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Disappointing Film I've Seen to Date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes an ending can ruin a movie for me. Such is the case with this one. I have a very dim view of child murderers. In this movie, Peter Lorre, kills children. The gendarmes can't catch him, so criminals take it upon themselves to try, convict and kill him! Okay...it has atmosphere, it's interesting. Parts of it are scary and I was all set to recommend it to friends as a movie to see during this Halloween season. But I won't! I care about my friends! One thing I do like about this film (and one reason it didn't get a "1" is because you don't see Peter Lorre actually kill the children, but you know he did it. I won't completely give away the ending, except to say the criminals don't get their way. He has his trial and sentence is not only pronounced, but about to be carried out when Peter's defense attorney speaks up and gives a speech that any person who doesn't believe in the death penalty would champion. You'll notice I said they took it upon themselves to kill him, but I also said they don't get their way. You might see this film and you might love it! That's cool, but I sure didn't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lorre's best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd say this movie was one of the best movies right from the beginning of cinema till the 30's, nonetheless an extremely weak movie if one looks at the history of cinema. This movie would be around 999 in my 1000 best films of all time list. Quite frankly there's little to appreciate, except the fact that it has some genuine elements to it that were original, nonetheless they are utilized weakly.This is my final analysis of this movie and what I think has led to the downfall:Story: Original for a 1931 movie, some elements of suspense and thrill, but not to the point, (e.g. police procedure throughout the movie and i can see where they wanted to go from that, but it's quite unrealistic and impossible) far fetched, and unbelievable, certainly unfulfilling and boring. Way too much over-explanatory material (at least 40 minutes of the movie is police procedure and meetings that are quite unnecessary about which frankly, the audience couldn't care less) which makes the movie a super sleep pill!Characters: Almost the entire characters are briefly introduced, we don't really know much about them, thus most of them are impersonal (maybe except Lorre's character, and Elsie's mother) Direction: As I said the movie does have some elements of suspense, and thrill: e.g. 'M' at the back of Lorre's overcoat, Lorre's whistling, the mother waiting for her child's arrival) which are done perfectly in my opinion, But I can't see how Fritz Lang expected the audience to react watching approx. 40 min. of pointless meetings &amp; conversations e.g. Wernicke reads 6 pages of police reports on the phone for Stein. Music: The movie has no music, and interestingly enough neither does it any sound effects. Weak!Camera Work, Cinematography: Camera is shaken continuously throughout the movie, mind you not as an effect but because it's sloppy; the scenes are blurryMese En Scene: Very to the point, not much of frame space spent on background, not many close-ups, no music, no sound effects, no added sound except for annoying noises from time to time: e.g. someone screaming, whistling, etc.Light: A 1931 movie, and not an Orson Welles film so naturally light is terrible, nonetheless expressionistic.Montage: Just a matter of putting the film together, nothing specialActing: I give Peter Lorre 8/10 for acting, as he is quite a gifted actor, and his performance at the end is applaud-able. As for the rest of the cast, unbelievable, weak, and quite frankly uninteresting, except maybe for the balloon vendor at the end of the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow and predictable, never thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M is one of those movies that you can't wait for the end of. no, not because you're so full of suspense and dying to know how it ends but because you can't sit through another minute of it. The acting is good for the time (still typical 30's cheese and the sound tech. back then didn't help) but you never really feel for any of the characters. Everything that happens could be predicted by anyone over the age of 6 which, of course, makes for a rather unsuspenseful film. while the social questions it raises are poignant, the movie fails to make us care about trying to answer them. Basically, M WAS a great movie. however, compared to modern standards it is not chilling, well-acted, or particularly well-shot. it is a star that burned out long ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I'm Just Spoiled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I take this movie at face value and come to the conclusion that it is pretty good. Thats all. Just pretty good. I have a few reasons for this. First of all, the storyline is not very good. A guy is killing kids. As a result, the police crack down leading to a loss in money for organized crime. Ok, I can accept that....but when bosses of organized crime turn to the beggars union? Beggar's what?! The plot line is barely developed. Little tension is built. The only disturbing aspect is the introduction, after that little is done to build the character of Peter Lorre as threatening character. He's is immediately discovered by a blind balloon salesmen. From then on its the underworld figuring out what to do with him. The trial scene is supposed to be big and emotional. Its completely laughable in every way. The mock trial? This makes no sense and is completely unbelievable.The "intense" filming is nothing more than a shot of a ball rolling which hints the girl was killed. Thats the only innovative camera work in the whole film. That does not impress me at all, noer does the character of peter lorre. His acting is the redeeming point of the movie. However, his character is not built at all. The only development is at the end in the trial scene which is too late for me to feel any feelings for what he has to say and too little to make up for the lack up untill this point.The message of the movie is weak and scetchy. I can however appreciate the fact that this movie was made in 1941....meaning it was a pioneer in the subject of schitzophrania.Although, this movie stands not as a movie with a message but as a plot driven mystery thriller. For having such a poor plot, little is accomplished. This film is a poor showing compared to earlier works such as Metropolis. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick Movie Overrated By Sick Critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was fairly entertaining but is overrated by film critics. It's also a horrible example of - I'm not kidding here - actually making a child killer into a sympathetic figure. How sick is that? No wonder the professional critics like this so much, being the disturbed lot tend to be.Peter Lorre, who plays the killer, can be a creepy guy but he isn't as creepy as the critics would have you believe, either. The film, however, gets points for being well-made for its time period. The movie is about 75 years old but really is not dated too much, which is amazing. The camera-work is excellent, too, with some interesting high and low angles and it's a story that generally keeps your interest.What really turned me off was the last part. Critics particularly liked this film because of the plea by the "lawyer" near the end to spare the man's life. That's okay, but they went overboard with that to the point of portraying this madman as a sympathetic figure. Liberals would have you more concerned about the killer than his victims. Sick.</fullReview>
