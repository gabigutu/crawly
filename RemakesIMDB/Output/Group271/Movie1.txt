		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seymour Nebenzal didn't have an especially illustrious career as a producer, either in Europe or the United States. Two of his American movies, in fact, SIREN OF ATLANTIS and this one, were remakes of movies he had produced in Europe. But in this case, he hired the right director. Was it the growing Blacklist that resulted in this movie having no writing credits on screen? Perhaps, but also perhaps not, as the soon-to-be-blacklisted Howard da Silva and Joseph Losey both use their own names. Losey and his team make excellent use of numerous Los Angeles locations, including Angel's Flight, Bunker Hill, the Bradbury Building (which is identified by name and location) and what seems to be that old amusement park in Long Beach, although what's seen here could be Venice. David Wayne is fine as the disturbed child killer, and delivers the required final act speech very well. But he doesn't have the power and poetry of Lorre's performance--but then who in Hollywood in 1951 would have? The movie still has some of the comedy of Lang's original, but it's not as dry and sardonic, and there isn't as much of it. The score isn't good, and shoves the movie even more firmly in the direction of the melodrama it keeps threatening to become. The very last shot is oddly theatrical in a literal sense: it looks like it is being performed on a stage. And I'm not sure what the point of the drunken lawyer trying to grasp a bit of his former glory really was. However, this element merely weakens the film, it doesn't destroy it. No, this isn't as good as Lang's original, but Lang's original is perhaps the best film of a great director. It's a classic in almost every regard. This version of "M" is an interesting and largely successful attempt at adapting the themes and ideas of the original to Los Angeles, and to 1950s Hollywood. Naturally there are some weaknesses, but the movie is brisk and engrossing, and certainly doesn't deserve the obscurity into which it has fallen.  Some condemn the film merely for being a remake, but remakes have always been a large part of movie history. There's little reason to object to them, especially now that the original films tend to be available on video. (In the 1930s-50s, originals were generally withdrawn.) If the remake is good, then hooray, there are now two good movies on the subject. If it's bad, then the remake will soon be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M (Joseph Losey, 1951) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I commemorated the 25th anniversary from the death of director Joseph Losey (which occurred on 22nd June 1984) by watching his two best (and, ironically, rarest) Hollywood movies, both noirs made in 1951 ? THE PROWLER and M. Fritz Lang's original 1931 version of the latter is not only generally considered to be its director's masterpiece but, on a personal note, is also included in my all-time Top 20 movies. Therefore, I had always been particularly interested in seeing how Losey (another director I admire a great deal) had tackled the daunting task of remaking ? and relocating to L.A. ? such an iconic German movie. Boasting the original's own producer, Seymour Nebenzal, the 1951 remake has been almost impossible to see and, actually, I only managed to track down a mediocre-looking print a few months ago; even so, I am certainly grateful to have been given the opportunity to catch up with it?especially in view of the fact that Sony's long-rumored Joseph Losey box set on R1 did not materialize after all! Perhaps inevitably, the film's initial stages (the murder of little Elsie) closely resemble those of Lang's film ? even down to the choice of camera set-ups: the high angle shot down an eerily desolate flight of stairs, the close-up of the vacant breakfast table, the tell-tale shots of a solitary flying balloon and a rolling ball ? but Losey nevertheless manages to gradually make the film his own, culminating in a trademark hysterical finale that highlights a new character not featured in the original: Luther Adler's alcoholic attorney who is, ill-advisedly, moved to turn against his boss Martin Gabel after the baby-killer's confession. David Wayne ? best-known until then for playing lightly comic roles ? is quite good in his own right (especially during the aforementioned trial sequence) if, understandably, falling short of Peter Lorre's unforgettable original characterization; similarly (and effectively) cast against type, Howard Da Silva makes for a fine Chief of Police, while the sterling supporting cast includes Raymond Burr (also atypically amusing as a raspy-voiced, leading underworld thug), Steve Brodie (as a sadistic cop), Glenn Anders and Jim Backus (as the mayor)! Interestingly enough, two directors-to-be were employed in minor capacities on this film: assistant director Robert Aldrich and script supervisor Don Weis. Allegedly, Fritz Lang balked at Nebenzal's offer to direct the remake himself and never forgave Losey for daring to touch his magnum opus?he must have conveniently forgotten the fact that he had himself remade in Hollywood two Jean Renoir classics ? LA CHIENNE (1931) and LA BETE HUMAINE (1938) ? as SCARLET STREET (1945) and HUMAN DESIRE (1954) respectively!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blacklisted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "M" in 1952. The theater in LA was picketed because Joseph Losey was Blacklisted by the McCarthy Committee, and the film wasn't shown again after that week. I don't think it's been shown since then, and it's probably difficult finding a copy. I hadn't seen the original, but I was very impressed by this film, especially David Wayne. The attitude of the mob, especially the women, was expected. But I was surprised by the speech of the "defense attorney". Even today, people would be vexed by his sympathy toward this mentally disturbed criminal. When the original "M' was shown, the Nazis were coming to power, but Lang was able to escape to the USA. Joseph Losey, however, wasn't able to escape the Blacklist. Was this version of "M" meant to foreshadow the "new order" of McCarthyism?</fullReview>

I hope they hurry up and get this in a DVD format with clearer, sharper images!! The acting of David Wayne as the "baby killer" was great as was Howard DeSilva's "chainsmoking" police investigator and Martin Gabel's crime boss, and look closely for Raymond Burr's tough talking "goon" who is following orders from the crime boss. Really great overall performances from all involved also including Steve Brody, John Miljan (as blind man....where are all the women in this picture except the children!! No leading actress was featured. Photography on location with excellent use of the moving camera was really eye-filling!!! The fat, laughing lady and those floating balloons were part of the tension and irony. Great movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's Responsible?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand someone not understanding this film, or considering it as anything less than masterful. I saw it on the big screen, and it left me, like its more illustrious predecessor, profoundly disturbed. In fact, David Wayne's "M" is more frightening than Peter Lorre's--Lorre was a brilliant actor, but his rather idiosyncratic appearance makes it easy to tag him as a "monster", and it typecast him as a perverse (and fascinating!) villain for most of his career. David Wayne not only turns in an harrowing and sympathetic (!) performance in this underrated masterpiece, but he does it with a face as bland and Midwestern as Wonder Bread. His casting, and Losey's change of locale and lighting to working class, sun-drenched and sun-faded shots of L.A., make the crimes and the criminal too believable, too naturalistic for comfort. Murder is more frightening in broad daylight than in shadows, where we've been taught to expect it. There are outstanding moments here: Losey's double-coded messages about the female body (the mannequin scene), which--despite lines inserted to please the censors--indicate that sex is behind the child-murders, the incredible hunt in the wonderful Bradbury Building, even a few comedic one liners (when the hapless police force shake up a low-class joint, and they ask the patrons what they're doing in the place, a bum replies, "Slummin'!") But it is the conclusion, the gut-wrenching final "courtroom" scene with David Wayne giving the most realistic, disturbing and moving portrait of psychopathy on the screen, that cements this film as a classic worthy of standing up to its predecessor. And when his "lawyer" questions the mob--and himself, and the viewers--as to who was truly responsible for this man and his evil, the answer is always disturbing. Losey believed that "it takes a village" fifty years ago, and his "M" remains a brand-hot indictment of a corrupt and money-hungry, perverse and puritanical, escapist and scapegoating society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Film Indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wrongly maligned film. Fritz Lang, director of the original version, famously hated Joseph Losey's remake, but that is no reason to brush if off. Even if the remake of "M" were poorly directed and acted, the film has so much value as an historic document of old Los Angeles, it is a crime it is unavailable for the general public on video in any format. Yet, the film has far more than its historic legacy. Losey's "M" is not the masterpiece that Lang's original is, but it's sure a darn great film, with fine performances by David Wayne as the killer, Howard De Silva as the head of the investigation, and Luther Adler as the drunken crime boss lawyer. I must also add that there are a number of changes to Lang's film. In one regard, the remake is simplified, with less delineated individual characters and an overall faster pace. This actually streamlines the action somewhat, while losing the strength of Lang's depth of minor characters. In other ways, the film expands on the original. (MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!) While it has shortchanged some of the minor characters, Losey's film has developed the crime boss beyond Lang's film, and is more explicit in revealing the man's violent nature, particularly in the closing moments when he he shoots his lawyer just as the police arrive. There's a fine irony as a result of at least one change. Another reviewer pointed out that the children in the film would hardly have gone off with the murderer as easily as they did, however, they do so in the original version as well. What is interesting in Losey's film is that both the murderer and a little girl (his intended victim) get trapped in the Bradbury building at the film's climax. It is the crime syndicate (not the police) that finally rescue her and as they carry her away (to take her back home) the girl finally asks, "Where are you taking me?" (something she never asked the murderer). The remake goes into more detail as to why the man commits his murders, and David Wayne's big confession scene in the garage (a perfect update of Lang's subterranean mock trial) is both compelling in terms of his gut wrenching performance as well as psychologically sound (or maybe I should say "PSYCHO-logically"). In this regard, I think the remake improves on the original. I am a big fan of Frtiz Lang. His "M" has long been one of my favorite films. I avoided seeing the remake for years because I thought it might taint or spoil my feelings for the original. This has not been the case. My appreciation of the original has only been amplified by seeing how Lang's film and screenwriter Thea Von Harbou's original script, so universal in its moral perceptions of human behavior, effectively translated to another time and place in such fine and expanded form. The remake was made only 30 years after the original, so it could be that in 1951 Lang's film was still too revered to allow for an upstart low budget Hollywood remake to take any credit for itself. However, I think it's not too far fetched to imagine someone having not seen the original, stumbling upon the remake and considering it an American classic. Now that the original "M" is 75 years old, we have nothing to fear by appreciating Losey's remake for the good film it is, classic or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated American Re-Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. This is a really under-sung, but still great remake of M. Like anyone else, I assumed this would be an inferior version of the Lang classic, but this movie stands alone and takes the already disturbing plot to a very '50's place.If you're interested in noir, and you're seen the original M, you definitely, so much, HAVE to see this. The performance from David Wayne rivals Peter Lorre's and if nothing else, for you Americans, he is surprisingly sympathetic and relate-able.The original M is one of the first great thrillers and bridges the gap between expressionism and what would become noir in film. This movie serves an exact opposite purpose - it takes the plot of "M" and does an amazing job of turning it in to a local film that both serves as a great thriller and a great commentary on our society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not quite as bad as its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's classic 'M' back in the 1930s is a well-regarded classic, which brought Peter Lorre to prominence and a career in Hollywood.This film, made twenty years later by Joseph Losey, starred light comedian David Wayne as the child-killer, and has much of the same storyline and set-pieces as its predecessor. But is it any good? It has its chilling moments - notably the ones involving the plasticine figure and the bird at the cafe - and Wayne, in a largely silent part, is surprisingly good. But much of the film is a copy of the original, and this lessens its impact. Also, the character of the lawyer who has gone to drink is too prominent, and the underworld search for the murderer who threatens their operation doesn't quite fit on the mean streets of LA, where it did in Germany.Not as bad as I'd heard, in fact this film is really quite good, but some bad editing decisions (acknowledged at the time of its release by Losey) have done damage. It deserves a nod for unusual casting though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw it at the Film Forum in Manhattan, and the notion that your review of "abysmal" could be the topline comment for this movie is really a shame. Far from having a terrible reputation, this unknown classic is just now being rediscovered. And your description of the conflict between the cops and the mobsters as being like "Ed Wood" says more about you personally than it does about the movie. And to everyone else: this is a lost classic, unfairly dismissed in its day because it was a low-budget remake. The vintage L.A. locations alone make this movie well worth seeing, almost like a documentary of a past that is mostly gone.And Raegan, I love how you so consistently make statements and then retreat from them, claiming that it's interesting, yet a failure, dated, yet not without merit. Pick a side buddy. I also love how you say that the movie is set in San Francisco (you too, repticicus!). Uh, it's set in L.A., buddies. They're two different cities, and they're about 6 hours away from each other on the 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the equal of the original, but equally valid and solid on its own terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the Fritz Lang classic about the hunt for a child murderer is a good little film in its own right. To be certain the film is not the equal of the original, however it is a solid film in its own right. The film plays like a "daylight" film noir (since kids are only really out during the day it has to be set during the day) mixed a bit with a procedural ala Dragnet, though the people we follow most are actually the crooks of the city who view the killer as a hindrance to their own ends. One of the films strong points is how we see the madness of the mob as regular citizens and even the "bad guys" try to get the right man, and aren't always successful. If there is any trouble with the film its that David Wayne as the killer is not the presence of Peter Lorre. Wayne is probably closer to a real sociopath in that he is a little nothing of a man which is terrifying thought since he could be anyone, but its not exciting on the screen because he is such a nobody. Worth tracking down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Excellent English language re-make of the 1931 German Fritz Lang crime classic "M" about a child murderer who's caught and tried by his own kind-criminals-for crimes that even they find beyond the pale. Martin Harrow, David Wayne, has been suffering from mantel illness since he was a child and now fully grown up, at age 35, those horrors of his childhood have come to manifest themselves to him as an a adult. Picking up school girls and offering them candy and ice cream Harrow ends up murdering them and mysteriously keeping their shoes as trophies of his crimes. With an all out dragnet by the L.A police to catch the child murderer it's the mob headed by crime kingpin Charlie Marshall, Martin Gabel, who puts out a contract on him; Not to whack him or rub him out but capture him and put him on trail from the crimes that he committed.Marshall feels in him bringing the child killer to justice it will take the heat of him and his crime syndicate by the LAPD headed by Chief Carney, Howard De Silva, and his hot handed assistant Lt. Becker, Steve Brodie, who seem to be totally helpless in capturing him. With the mob mobilizing all its resources they finally track Harrow down with his latest but still live victim 10 year old girl Janine Perreau at the deserted Bradbury Building in downtown L.A. Caught and brought to this mob run taxi garage Harrow is to learn his fate as Marshall's mouthpiece or high priced, with bottles of gin &amp; scotch, shyster Daniel Langley, Luther Adler, acting as his public or mob picked defender.****SPOILERS**** Langley despite his severe alcoholism makes a brilliant defense of the what looked like doomed to die Harrow about his mantel illness that has controlled his actions during his six month murder spree. This is not what Marshall wanted in being put, together with his goons, in the same boat as Harrow who he feels he's an upright and law abiding citizen in comparison. With the helpless, from being beaten up by the mob, Harrow looking on his trial turns out to be not just against him but the person who had him captured and put on trial for murder the mob boss Charlie Marshall! With the police suddenly showing up and about to arrest,from his mob captors, Harrow Marshall lose it and with Langley exposing him and his mob's actions blows him away with the startled police being eyewitness to the murder looking on! Check out Marshall's top enforcer who does all the dirty work and heavy lifting, like breaking heads arms &amp; legs, for him Pottsy played by a gorilla like Raymond Burr before he shed over 100 pounds and played a slimmed down looking Perry Mason on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Know Where Your Children Are?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the difficult things about shooting a movie in Los Angeles is that the city itself seems so dull. Every vista looks flat and tends to fall into one or another of two types. There are the wide car-choked boulevards with used car lots and Chinese restaurants, or there are the sterile, empty residential areas of trimmed lawns and ranch houses. Fast food dispensaries proudly proclaim, "Serving the Public Since 2009." There is no downtown. Some films manage to overcome this disadvantage. "Chinatown" was one. This one partially succeeds. The urban setting here has a texture to it. Not just the familiar Bradbury Building (in which Neff tried to outwit Keyes) or the Santa Monica pier but hills with steps, and multilayered wooden apartments, and corner candy stores. The location scout should get a screen credit.Few remakes live up to the original, even if the remake was directed by a young Joseph Losey. It's pretty thoroughly Americanized. In the original, Peter Lorre was the helpless child killer. Here, David Wayne is driven by ego-alien impulses too but Lang gave Lorre no facile excuse, whereas this script has Wayne hating his mother and taking his rage out on little girls. He was probably abused as a child. That accounts for all rudeness these days, doesn't it? Lang's treatment is both less sentimental and more in line with what psychologists know about serial killers, which is virtually nothing. Not all the changes are dumb. Instead of being trapped in the wooden bin of a warehouse, Wayne (and a kidnapped girl) are stuck in a room jammed with plastic mannequins and the air is full of legs dangling as if recently severed. What really freaks me about those mannequins is that their feet are shaped into smooth wedges but they have no toes.I don't think I'll go farther into the plot. Wayne is hauled up before "a jury of his peers" and defended by a drunk but I can't discuss the case out of court.Wayne has a heavy duty speech at his mock trial. The camera doesn't cut away from him for a long while. And he handles it pretty well -- not like Lorre, whose only justification is that he's in the grip of his obsession, but equally pathetic.In general, Lang's is the better film because, for one thing, it was an original, not a remake. For another, the agency of social control was Berlin's horde of beggars and small-time thieves in 1931 who formed a convincing network. Losey's movie loses that sense of solidarity and tries to being together too disparate a group: juvenile delinquents, rich racketeers, a black shoe shine boy. And Lang's depiction of police procedure is more explicit and more interesting. This version looks like a gangster movie.On his hunting trips, Lorre whistled a piece from Grieg's "Peer Gynt", "In the Hall of the Mountain King," which was both catchy and a little ominous. Here, David Wayne plays a lugubrious tune in a minor key on a flute, bespeaking utter misery and impending doom. The overall effect of these and other modifications is just to simplify the story by reducing, or eliminating, the ambiguity. Everything is spelled out for the viewer, as in a kindergarten class where the ABCs are being taught.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Remake of the Lang Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M (1951) *** (out of 4)A child killer is stalking the streets and soon the police are everywhere trying to catch him. This means that the police are stalking the low-life criminals and the crime bosses grow tired of it because it's costing them business. In order to get their business back, the crime bosses set out to catch the killer.Fritz Lang's 1931 film M is without question one of the greatest and most disturbing movies ever made. This 1951 remake from Joseph Losey went decades without being seen but a recent restoration has it available for fans to finally catch. Is it a worthy remake? It absolutely is a winning gem. Some people have called it a film noir but I really don't agree with that. The film is very much like the original in that it has you who the real monsters are out in the world.This film really shocked me on a couple levels. For starters, this was made in 1951 and I was shocked at how suggestive the material was. The early scenes show the killer stalking various little girls of all ages and race. The film certainly puts it in your face that this is a pervert and it doesn't shy away from this guy being attracted to them. Unlike the first film this one tries to explain why the killer is this way and of course it's the hatred of his mother.The cinematography is a major plus and there's no question that Losey has great control of everything going on. There's a very long sequence inside a shopping center where the criminals are searching for the killer and the way this sequence is edited was just flawlessly done. Another major plus were the performances with everyone from a large role to a small one doing a great job. David Wayne plays the killer and brings a certain coldness to the role as well as a creepy undertone.M has been forgotten over the years due to it being unavailable but now that it's making the rounds I can't help but think that it's reputation is going to improve. It's certainly not on the same level as the Lang film but it's still quite impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an IMDb prolific reviewer I have no objection to the passion shown by other members in comparing this Americanization to the original. I get it.The problem is that, leaving the backstory of the production aside, this is a superb film from a decade not otherwise known for superb films.First I was lucky to catch a new cut of the film in top quality shown on HD TV in 2016. For those fans who complained about poor VHS copies, again, I feel your pain.Again, if you can stand to rate this film on its own, it is brilliant.The story. Some 15 years before the mob and the authorities would get together for real (JFK) here you have a story that captures your imagination. What if it was in the mob's interest to do a job that no one else wanted to do ... or could do? The acting is top notch, especially since there are few big names in the cast, even by 50s standards. Raymond Burr playing a thug is a treat.The script is hypnotizing. The writer just let the subject matter tell itself.However at the end of the day it is the direction and cinematography that capture the viewer. A few more films like this and you can almost make an argument for going back to B&amp;W prints.The subtext is awesome. I found myself thinking of the original French version of Beauty and the Beast (LA BELLE ET LA BETE.) How many movies can give you in the very same film the best and the worst of our species?

		<shortDescription>A Bunch of Nonsex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the original version of "M" made in 1931, as well as in the remake of 1951, a city is plagued by a man who is killing children. The police become so relentless in their pursuit of the killer that the ordinary way of life of the criminal underclass becomes disrupted. As a result, the criminals take matters into their own hands, capture the child killer, and have a trial of sorts, during which he tells everyone that he is compulsively driven to do what he does. Before the mob can do anything to him, the police show up and take him away.In the 1931 movie, it is never explicitly stated that the children are sexually molested, but it is implied, and in any event, we would automatically assume as much anyway. In the remake, however, the movie goes out of its way to make it clear that the children are not molested. While a crowd watches the chief of police on television warning parents about the child killer, someone in the crowd asks, "What's he mean the children were neither violated nor outraged?" Someone else in the crowd responds, "What's the difference? He killed them, didn't he?"Well, it may not make any difference to the people in the crowd, but apparently it must have made a difference to the Production Code Administration. It was not sufficient merely to omit all reference to sexual molestation. It had to be explicitly denied. At the same time, all of the killer's victims are little girls, which would indicate a sexual preference. Presumably, just in case the audience refused to believe sex was not involved, the producers went the extra step to avoid any hint of homosexuality. The killer takes the shoes of his victims, which suggests a fetish, which in turn suggests a sexual perversion. Furthermore, in one scene, a man and wife are informed that their child has been a victim. As they start to leave, the woman turns around in desperation and says that maybe it is a mistake, that the child is someone else's. We can only conclude from this that there was no body in the morgue for them to identify, that the police were only going by the doll and the girl's dress, which are on the chief's desk. He holds up the dress for her to look at, which she recognizes as belonging to her daughter. From this we can only conclude one thing: the killer took off the girl's clothes, and her naked body is yet to be found. Still, we are supposed to believe that sex is not the motive for these murders. Censorship can be confusing.It goes without saying that the original was much better, and one way in which it was better is that the killer simply had an evil impulse that he did not understand. In the remake, owing to the popularity of psychoanalysis at the time, we are given an explanation for the killer's behavior as resulting from something that happened when he was a child. As a harbinger of that explanation, we see him strangling a clay model of a child, with a picture of his elderly mother sitting right beside him, almost as if she were watching him do it. At the end, when the child killer is surrounded by the underworld figures that captured him, he gives a garbled explanation about how his father mistreated his mother, and how she raised him to believe that all men are evil. As a result, he reasons that since he is a man, then he is evil and deserves punishment. So, he has to kill little girls, partly to keep them from growing up and being mistreated by evil men, and partly so he will get caught and get the punishment he deserves. The explanation comes across as artificial, unsatisfying, and unbelievable. Fortunately, we are not told why he took the girls' shoes, which would only have made the explanation even more tortured. The remake was destined to be inferior to the original, but it would still have been a lot better movie had all that psychobabble at the end been left out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joseph, you're good but you're no Fritz Lang.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This is a very hard film to see, and after screening it I know why. Virtually a scene for scene remake of Fritz Lang's 1931 classic (his first talkie by the way) but director Joseph Losey (best remembered for THE SERVANT, 1961) has added some touches which make the film even more disturbing. The killer (David Wayne in the role that made Peter Lorre a European star) takes the shoes from the children he kills thus adding fetishism and paedophilia to his homicidal urges. Berlin's organised underworld is replaced by a Mafia-style boss who recruits teenage thugs, replacing the Beggars Union from the original film, to track down the killer who blends in so well with the regular populace. Meanwhile the public are whipped into lynch mob frenzy by newspaper headlines and many innocent people nearly become victims of mob mentality. Even camera angles from the original are copied in these quick vignettes. Once again the killer's undoing is the blind beggar who recognises his whistling. (For you trivia buffs, the blind beggar this time is played by John Miljan who in 1930 was the DA who yanked of Mrs. O'Grady's wig and exposed Lon Chaney Sr in the courtroom scene of THE UNHOLY THREE.) San Francisco's famous Bradbury Building, also the site of the "Outer Limits" episode "Demon With A Glass Hand", is where the killer takes refuge before being captured by the criminals of the city. Once again we explore the social and ethical implications of their actions. Many of the crooks, prostitutes and lowlifes are genuinely appalled by the actions of the child murderer but many others are just miffed because of the increased police activity that keeps them from "working". In that respect we can agree with the killer's cry (from Lang's version) "You wouldn't have to do this if you could keep your hands off things, if you worked! But I! I cannot help myself! The fire, the voices, the torment!" Losey almost makes a critical error by introducing the character of the drunken, has-been lawyer so early in the film and allowing him to pop up throughout the story until he becomes the reluctant defence counsel for the killer at the end. The killer and the hunt for him should be the main focus of the picture and by putting such emphasis on the lawyer character the powerful ending of the film is blunted. David Wayne's own speech to the kangaroo court, what should have been a highly dramatic moment, is reduced to a few lines and overshadowed by the lawyer (Luther Adler, admittedly giving a good performance) delineating his own life and how he came to be such a loser that we almost forget about the man whose actions we have been following since the film began! Nice try Joseph but you should have left a classic alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Babe Ruth of Remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1951 remake of the Fritz Lang classic of 1931 is overlooked often just simply because of the original. It was banned by the Catholic Decency Board due to subject matter. It is a darned good remake when it is judged on it's own merits.The story setting is moved from Germany to Los Angeles. David Wayne plays the Peter Lorre role with amazing energy. It is a shame this one got so butchered by critics because of the original. It reminds me of Roger Maris getting poor ratings for breaking Babe Ruth's records. He deserves better than he got treated here.If you have never seen the original, you will find this stands on it's own merits. The cast is large and includes some names who would go on to other things after this one. On this first view on TCM I am quite impressed with the film noir quality of the recent restoration of this film. Raymond Burr and William Schalert are in the support for this redoing of the original. It really is so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes interesting remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this American remake of the classic 1931 Fritz Lang movie for some time, but apparently legal issues had caused the movie to be withdrawn until recently. Having seen the movie, was it worth the wait? Well, yes and no. Of course, like almost all remakes, this particular one isn't as good as the original. It does have some significant faults. There are some slow spots, for one thing. Also, the movie doubts the intelligence of the audience at times, spoon-feeding it blatant explanations for decisions various characters in the movie make. Speaking of the characters, some important characters (the mob boss, the chief police investigators, and even the child murderer himself) were not explored in enough depth to my taste.But all the same, the movie has some strengths. It's very good looking, for one thing. The photography is very good, some shots are very well composed, and you get to see some really interesting Los Angeles locations, such as the famed Bradbury building. There are some interesting themes explored here, like Gestapo-like actions from the police to manipulation of the press (by both the police and the city's criminal element.) And while the murderer's character was not in my opinion explored enough, he does come across as a creepy character because of both the direction of his scenes and David Wayne's very good performance. When you weigh the good stuff against the not so good stuff, the scale makes this to be an okay movie. Certainly not up to the original version, but not one deserving of all the critical slams it got when it was first released. The two movies would make an interesting double bill, but just make sure the original movie is the first of the pair that you see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Wayne's murderer well worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the American version of "M", David Wayne portrays the murderer. Much to his credit, he does not imitate Peter Lorre but creates his own character. His body language is constantly novel and interesting, his final monologue very intense. I really like Wayne in the part.Director Losey makes terrific use of Los Angeles locations. The supporting cast is a very good one. They cannot always rise above certain mundane features of the script. Raymond Burr does wonders, but the scenes with the least impact are those involving the police.The exterior scenes involving the finding of Wayne and following him have good location work, but the "underworld" connection as we see and feel it through various small character roles feels diluted. The criminal menace plays better when it moves indoors to search the Bradley Building. Scenes of crowd panic that repeat those from the earlier "M" can't match its impact. Some of the psychoanalytic material that was apparently inserted to satisfy the censors weakens the story too. It has been said that Luther Adler's part takes away from the focus on Wayne, and I'd have to agree.This is a noir well worth seeing. It clearly reflects its time as did the first version. I like the way that Losey stages scenes. I like Wayne in his part. It's great that it has been restored because the copies that had been circulating were awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime &amp; Punishment in the Fifties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"M" is a remake of the Fritz Lang film shot twenty years earlier. In this version, the setting is Los Angeles, where the public is up at arms about a child killer on the loose.The first half of the film feels like a public service announcement for parents, warning them to protect their children from strangers. It's not a dramatic start, and the weaknesses easily shine through--the uneven acting, the contrived script, the repetitive exposition.Still, the film has interest as a document of its time--with its perhaps unintended swipes at the unprofessionalism of police, and the current views of crime and big city life. It also captures the nascent views of basic criminal psychology, much as some Hitchcock films do.The latter half of the film is about the actual apprehension of the murderer. There's a chase, which gives the film more interest, then a final denouement that examines common views of morality and opposing views of the nature/nurture dichotomy. If only the two halves were more cohesive.There is a lot going on in the film, and the cast offers many moments of surprising recognition. I recommend that viewers watch it, but I cannot assign a higher grade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abysmal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be hard for any remake to live up to Fritz Lang's original, but the Joseph Losey version of "M" deserves its terrible reputation. It's hard to imagine any little girl being stupid enough to befriend David Wayne's lurching gargoyle of a child-murderer, and the sequences depicting the police and underworld's parallel search for the killer are reminiscent of a very uninspired Ed Wood.</fullReview>
