		<shortDescription>Excellent!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent remake of the 1962 classic, with real life sisters Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave in the old Bette Davis and Joan Crawford roles.I am a big fan of the original film, and was pleasantly pleased when I watched the remake and it was a lot better than I thought it would be.Although based on the same story, the events in the two films are staged completely different, which was good because I can't stand a remake that is just a total rip-off of the first film.The basic story is as follows...Jane Hudson (Lynn Redgrave) is a former child star who was forgotten when her sister Blanche (Vanessa Redgrave) became famous and stole all of Jane's former success.Now middle-aged, the two sisters live together and Jane takes care of Blanche after a horrific accident leaves Blanche unable to walk. When a TV network starts to show a season of Blanche's old movies, Jane's forgotten jealousy returns, as she has always held her sister responsible for the loss of her career...I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Original "whatever happened to baby jane" was such a classic. it can be considered a timeless classic but trying to make it all modernized just ruins it. this film was completely unnecessary. At least in the early 1960s, they were able to pull this kind of a story off because of the camera angles and the character types. but this film is just annoying especially with the closeup camera angles and the cheap cinematography, and baby jane looks like a clown. the performances were weak by the redgrave sisters, they looked like they did not know what they were doing at all. plus in the original movie, Jane plays a revenge trick on blanche by putting a bird followed by a dead rat on her cover tray which is one of the most famous scenes in all of horror history, in this film, it is a sandwich with worms on it followed by really dramatic music and then cuts off to the next scene..that was not fun at all and nowhere near as exciting as the original....there is absolutely no point in watching this movie so stick with the original classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad in itself...but no remake of a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"whatever happened to Baby Jane?" remains a stunning,horrific story well ahead of it's time (1962) Joan Crawford and Bette Davis left memorable &amp; nightmarish examples of how to play a role for all it will get you! However, it's 1991 remake with the lovely and talented Redgrave sisters promised to leave viewers with the same creepy chills &amp; thrills! Unfortunately, this simply dosen't happen here!Don't get me wrong! The 1991 version of "Whatever happened to Baby Jane?" holds up as it's own story: set in modern-day Hollywood with it's all-too-familiar band of groupies,druggies,drag-queens &amp; has-beens,who will forever lurk in the video stores and back streets, hoping to meet aging or ailing celebrities in order to "break-in" to the big-time! This TV movie actually draws the viewer in to a modern version of a hybrid between "Sunset Boulevard" and "Midnight Cowboy" But, in deference to it's original.I must confess that as the ailing,aging Blanche, Vanessa Redgrave manages to hand in an adequate if not wooded portrayal.AS the nutty Jane,Lynn tries her best to NOT imitate Bette Davis and it does work-at least her portrayal is more remorseful and concerned about her crippled sister! In THIS version we actually FEEL for poor Jane as she's led to believe that SHE had caused the accident! When she finally learns the truth she actually seems to have been "set free" from 20 years of guilt,depressionn &amp; alcoholism! Of course,it's too late now,we realize, as we watch the police chase her on the beach in the final shot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Vs. The Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are doomed from the beginning. Even worse than sequels--remakes only have a limited way to go. "Baby Jane" was such a startling movie in all sorts of ways. First, you got to see two huge stars, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, decay right before your very eyes. That freaked some people out. Second, you saw Crawford and Davis in the same film. (Really, a documentary of the making of the original would have been much better than a remake). Bette Davis hated every cell in Joan Crawford's body, and it translates well onto film. Jane, Davis' character, despises Blanche, played by Crawford. We don't have all that hype with the Redgraves. Lynn plays Jane for laughs and maybe a few scares, and Vanessa doesn't do a darn thing. One of the major differences in the two is the way Jane treats Blanche. In Baby Jane 1, she is mean, abusive, and for the most part unforgiving. Baby Jane 2 shows a much nicer, more pathetic Jane. She obviously cares for Blanche (maybe being sisters helped the Redgraves out with this one), but she is still angry with her. If Blanche gets hurt, Jane is upset. Even if she caused the pain, she's sorry later. I have the feeling that the makers of this version got their hands on a copy of the book (by Henry Farrell--izzat his name?). In the book, Jane and Blanche got along better than Crawford and Davis. (Who doesn't?!?)One good thing about the film--Lynn Redgrave looks hilarious. She's got fried red hair that she wears in pigtails like antennae, Lynn's using her too-funny flat American accent, she's going for camp. On the other hand, Vanessa, who can act, doesn't. She doesn't seem to know what she's supposed to do. Do we hate Blanche Hudson, are we sorry for her, what? The beach scene is ruined by her stuttering, but it is quite obvious that she's very sick and COLD. COLD makes one stutter--they should have driven that point home. (They could have really ruined the scene by using the book--in it, Jane brings Blanche ice cream, Blanche eats in and promptly vomits. That would be pretty awful.) I do, however, love any movie that shows how enormously tall Vanessa Redgrave is. When Dominic (?) picks her up, she just dwarfs him completely.Last and least, this movie is very unkind. To the viewers, to the actors, and to anyone else who may have gotten involved. It's unkind to give Jane a chance to live out her dream only to have it go horribly wrong. It's unkind to be paralyzed from the waist down, as Blanche is. It's unkind to have a watch a movie that should have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Throwback to the Days of The ABC Movie of the Week</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ABC Movie of the Week was an unlikely art form; a kitschy grab bag of trash and treasure which might yeild Steven Spielberg's Duel or Satan's School for Girls and 'Whatever Happened to...' is a wonderful reminder of just how good and bad these films could be and the remarkable talent they routinely showcased. Here, David (Roots, Rich Man Poor Man) Greene directs stars Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave as the Hudson sisters in this tacky update of "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?". Lynn, as Jane Hudson is a grotesque, haggish Raggedy Anne doll come to mentally defective life tormenting her crippled, long suffering sister while trying to reignite her fame on the drag queen club scene. It's never quite as good as you hope it will be or as scary but the cast carries it along to the bitter end. Ultimately, it's no better or worse than Bad Ronald or Killdozer or All the Kind Strangers or a score of other films to grace the ABC Movie of the Week. If you approach it in that light you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hideous travesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godawful, pointless remake doesn't engender sympathy or interest for anyone; it's shameless, ill-conceived and difficult to watch and so is Lynn Redfaced's performance. Wasn't Bruce Vilanch available? Redgrave was ridiculous as a southerner in The Last of the Mobile Hot Shots, over-the-top in Smashing Time (she looked like Jay Leno in drag) but this is an embarrassment as is the whole film which destroys any sense the original,campy Gothic had, and even if you haven't seen the original this amateurish, mean-spirited remake will make you cringe. The whole thing seems like a long, unfunny joke that was completed in single takes and even Vanessa Redgrave is useless. I think I know why this travesty is never shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland bland bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unsurprisingly 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' falls into exactly the same trap as every other TV movie remake: it's bland, there's no atmosphere and it fails to convince you that it has a point. The original version, that squawky 1962 melodrama, wasn't much good either, but even so there's something inescapably redundant about the whole thing, and something irritating about the stylistic indifference on display here.Although the plot would suggest a moody, Gothic horror (something the original could have been if not for the two over-ripe performances of its past-it stars), this movie is shot and lit with zero regard for atmosphere. Not only does this run-of-the-mill approach flatten just about every scene, it also means that Jane, who is more of a caricature than a character, seems out of place. With her over-the-top make-up and occasional screeching fits, the TV movie remake machine has left her high and dry in a film that has only good acting to recommend it. She's sad, pathetic and occasionally sympathetic, but she's still as mad as ham and deserved a more stylised movie to fit the character.Lynn Redgrave is actually pretty good as Jane and although Vanessa Redgrave doesn't have half as much to do, she is too. But the novelty of seeing these two sisterly thesps battling it out can't sustain a whole movie, just as having real-life enemies Bette Davis and Joan Crawford biting chunks out of each other didn't make the original any less boring. From their point of view I guess the movie offered an interesting acting challenge (and the opportunity to act together on screen for the first time) but the director does them no favours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting. . .but unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My philosophy on remakes is if you can't outdo the original, why bother? Although there are several remakes that I like, this is one of those "why bother" films. Don't get me wrong, the cast did a decent job with what they had to work with, and it was interesting to see the characters moved into the ?90s, but where the original had a little too much backstory this version didn't have enough. But allowing time for commercials took away from the story, leaving this version nearly an hour short of the original. It was interesting to see the characters moved into a world with video stores, prostitutes, and drag queens -- which may be the only saving grace for the remake.I saw this version when it premiered, but didn't yet know the original, thus I didn't care for it that much. Seeing it again over 10 years later, now that I've seen the Davis/Crawford version, it made me like this one slightly better, but only slightly. The original is deservedly a classic, and the behind-the-scenes story is just as, if not more, interesting as the movie itself. When it comes to this version, there were no behind-the-scenes battles, being as the leads are real-life sisters.At the beginning of this version, the Redgrave sisters seem to be more friendly towards one another than Davis and Crawford were at any point of the original, but it still works. Lynn does a descent job as over-the-top Baby Jane, but she only plays it over-the-top, unlike the schizophrenic portrayal that Davis gave. Vanessa, on the other hand, lacked the depth that Crawford had as Blanche, which made her seem less like a victim and more like she just can't act, particularly the closer it got to the end of the film. Case in point, the final scene. Where Crawford gave an honest, breathless confession on the beach, Vanessa Redgrave studders her way through the dialogue as if she's reading it from cue cards perched above her head. John Glover, taking over the Victor Buono role, did a good job with his part, though it was a little disconcerting seeing the character in drag (though Buono could have never pulled that off).At the very most, this version was interesting. ?Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I found this Nineties remake of the timeless 1962 classic "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" I was expecting something really bad. To my surprise, it wasn't bad at all! Sure, it'll definitely never beat the original, but for a more modern version of the story it did an okay job. It's certainly watered down from the chilling performances of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the original, but at least this remake made an evident effort. The Redgrave sisters and Glover added new faces to the main roles and a modernized soundtrack added a new element to the plot as well. Personally I'll always love the original the best, but as far as remakes go, I've seen worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hi, I have not seen the remake as its not been released in UK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can anyone tell me if the Redgrave sisters' version has the same opening scene - jack-in-the-box - as the original? I gather the version is the same but set in the 60's rather than 1917 - is this true. I'd really appreciate some help on this and if anyone out there could answer these questions then I'd be eternally grateful. Incidentally I loved the original - it remains one of my all time top three favourite films. If you can help with this please post a message on the message board and I'll check it out daily for a reply. Many thanks for taking your time to read this message and for (in anticipation) your reply. Please Thaks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Glimmer Of Hope?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the original zillions of times but have only seen the remake once all the way through, though I seem to remember getting in on the last part a few years later when I happened to notice that it was on again.Either it was on again or else something similar to it.I can only remember seeing it once.One thing that especially impressed me about this one was that it seemed to me that the beach scene offered a glimmer of hope.Blanche told the cops that her sister was in need of professional help so to please be sure that she got it--and I also had the feeling that help just might have arrived in time that Blanche's life also was spared.This would mean that the two sisters would have another chance at a good relationship with each other instead of one being dead and the other either being permanently locked away in a mental institution or else a prison--and seen as "hopeless" either way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film showcases the brilliant talents of both Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece! Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave show once again why they are both such successful actresses. This version of Baby Jane rivals if not surpasses the original with Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. Both actresses give astounding performances, and deserve the accolades of critics and the film industry for such a great movie. This film deserved better coverage and a wider audience.</fullReview>
