		<shortDescription>Disturbing, because it's real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting, to see comments dismissing WEHTBJ? as a "gay" film, or "cult" film, etc.As a writer/producer who lived and worked in Hollywood for 30 years, I submit that those comments represent a "denial syndrome" of people who are ignorant of the facts of Hollywood.What is so "horrifying" about WEHTBJ? is that the film is an utterly realistic psychodrama about two specific sisters of that era.It's easy to say that Bette Davis' performance/makeup was "over the top," except that they weren't. In fact, I thought her look was taken from a sad "street person" in Hollywood who, in her seventies, walked up and down Hollywood Boulevard in a pink ball-gown and dead blonde wig and thick makeup, speaking into a transistor radio she held to her ear -- in the 60s, long before cell phones -- "talking" to the FBI about people chasing her.Perhaps those who've spent their lives elsewhere, other than in Hollywood, feel that the characters in WEHTBJ? are "over the top." But they're not.That's what makes them so heartbreaking. And the incredibly brave performances by Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Victor Bono and the rest -- not to mention the script and Robert Aldrich's direction -- make this simply the most definitive "Hollywood" psycho-thriller since "Sunset Boulevard."There's "A Star Is Born," in any of its incarnations. Which is also "true" in its (their) way.And there is "Sunset Boulevard" and "Baby Jane," which are even more true, and more brilliantly made.These are not "horror films." They are riveting psychological studies, cast with astonishing actors, and magnificently directed and photographed.They are the equivalent of Hitchcock's "Psycho," IMHO, which was preceeded by "Sunset Boulevard" and followed by "Baby Jane."Each different, each brilliant, each marked by some of the most indelible performances ever captured on film.It's typical of adolescents to make a "joke" about things that make them uncomfortable.But when experience and age acquaint one with people like Baby Jane and Norma Desmond and, yes, Norman Bates, what's the point of joking?These three films will tell those characters' stories forever, and better than 99% of films ever made.That's why they're classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling movie; Davis and Crawford tear each other apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? might seem dated, but it is still an extremely riveting watch. I literally could not look away, as soon as the movie started, I couldn't stop until it had finished. Not a lot of movies can do that to me. The acting is extremely good, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford are just so good as the main focus of the movie. The chilling score is suits the movie and the camera-work reminds me a lot of Hitchcock.The story focuses on two sisters, Blanche Hudson (Joan Crawford) who was crippled in an accident awhile ago and "Baby" Jane Hudson (Bette Davis). Jane used to be a big child star, she even had a doll brand after her. Now, though, she is no longer recognised while her sister has recently become very famous. They live in an old mansion, with Blanche confined to her room upstairs while Jane gets madder and more cruel by the day.Bette Davis gives the star performance here, some may call it over-acting but it is far from. She really makes Jane as mad, cruel and sad as possible. Joan Crawford is equally good in a very different role. She is much more timid then Jane and quite scared. The supporting cast are all good as well, especially Victor Buono as Victor Flagg, an odd pianist that befriends Jane. The black and white really are used to full effect, they make the mansion look extra creepy. Robert Aldrich's direction is fine.To today's modern audience, this may seem boring as it does not have any action. Most of the movie is dialogue, but I do urge those who haven't seen it to do so, as it is a truly excellent movie.A solid 5/5!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Was Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was suspenseful to the end and the musical score was awesome. I only disagreed with Henry Flagg's role, and he was such a wimp! It was great to see two '30- '50s Divas in one film, especially Joan Crawford's duplicitous role as a wronged sister. Bette Davis was truly deranged by the alcohol and the light switch personality changes was a joy to see. I especially loved the facial changes between the regression to the childlike Baby Jane and the hatred-driven character who was destined to take care of a sister more successful than her in adulthood. It may be a slow development of a story by today's standards, but the pace was good for me. I was intrigued to the end and suspected nothing like the final outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sibling Rivalry Between Hollywood's Leading Ladies -- At A Macabre Level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Ever Happened To Baby Jane" is a tense horror film, yet it seems almost comical at the same time. The story is about Baby Jane Hudson, a former child Vaudeville star who has now grown older and been shyed away from the spotlight and attention that she so dearly loved. Baby Jane has a sister, Blanche, who is now crippled and restrained to a wheelchair. But before becoming immobile, Blanche was once a movie queen herself, and she incidentally pushed her sister out of the spotlight, which ignited extreme jealousy from Baby Jane. Now, Baby Jane spends most of her time in a crumbling Hollywood mansion, taking care of her sister. She plays mean and dirty tricks on her, even going as far as to preparing Blanche a dead rat on her lunch platter and brutally beating her when she tries to phone for help, keeping Blanche contained within the walls of their home. Baby Jane lives in a world of false hope, thinking that she may be able to reprise her childhood career, putting on makeup and keeping her curly hair intact. But Baby Jane's continued jealousy burns on as Blanche's popular films are re-run on television, and her violent, twisted, and abusive side begins to come forth.The entire film surrounds the two sisters as they fight back and forth, doing horrible things to each other. It's like a grown-up case of sibling rivalry between two of Hollywood's leading women, that turns out to be very well crafted and interesting to watch. Both Davis and Crawford, Hollywood legends, give top quality performances and bring depth and dimension to the characters of Baby Jane and Blanche. Granted, there is no shock value in this film anymore because it has become so dated, but it is still worth the while to watch because of how interesting it is to watch both actresses interact with one another. Davis plays the mad Jane with perfect mannerisms and eerie hysterical expressions as she torments her sister, costumed in ghostly white, caked makeup and golden curls in her hair.It is kind of ironic because it has been speculated that Davis and Crawford really despised each other behind camera, they were both major award winners with legendary status in cinema, practically rivals themselves, which could have played into the way they treated each other in the film... or maybe not? I'd say it was very likely though. To sum it up this review, "What Ever Happened To Baby Jane" is a dated but exceptionally-crafted thriller. Modern day audiences will not be frightened, but the film itself was very, very well done. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie at least two dozen times, and I will see it at least that many times again. It's such a Bette Davis feast. Of course, she was nominated for an Oscar. And she should have won it! There was a lot of 'history' between Miss Davis and Miss Crawford going way back to the 1940s, when Crawford was let go from M-G-M and went to work at WB where Bette Davis was Queen of the lot. The stories behind the making of the film are as interesting as the movie, with Miss Crawford demanding the set be kept at a breezy 55 (but preservative) degrees causing all kinds of problems with Miss Davis's bronchitis. One only wonders how much 'acting' was involved as Miss Davis tortures Miss Crawford emotionally and, later, physically. Miss Crawford suffers grandly and has her mandatory telephone scene, big eyes tremulous with fear. She is great, but it is a Bette Davis tour-de-force and she wipes every other actor off the screen. Full 10 of 10 for this one, and recommended to everyone who wants to see what the great actresses of the 1930s and 1940s could and would still do, albeit in minor-A productions, as the requests for their services dwindled, but wanted to keep on working.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" is a most unusual and impressive thriller. Director Robert Aldrich achieves a fantastic sordid and dark atmosphere at the Huadson sisters mansion -where most of the action takes place- with an unusual black and white shooting for the early 60's. An interesting story, a well delivered screenplay and an accurate musical score also rise the film high.But the main credit of the picture is casting together to real big names in Hollywood's history, not at their peak then but always reliable and attractive to see. Bette Davis (Jane) takes the most interesting character as the former child star that couldn't make it as an adult in show business so she has gone insane and keeps behaving as the spoiled child he was. She looks grotesque and ridiculous in her child outfits, hairdo and heavy make up. Davis is outstanding in her role and looks really mean when she tortures both mentally and physically her sister Blanche, delicate and reasonable. Joan Crawford plays Blanche and very well too, a former big star whose career ended after a strange car accident that put her on a wheel chair for life.In the end things are not completely as they seem but the final twist is not what makes this film an extremely good one; it's the strange relationship between the sisters, that requires of that final twist to understand Blanche's tolerant conduct towards her sister.The movie is perhaps a little too long and it would probably have been even better with a 10 minutes cut. But no doubt this is a top product in its genre and a great movie indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somehow, this is indeed compelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I walked into this one with the right set of expectations. I expected a low-fi, creepy bit of occult-tinted fun from an age before horror films were bloated, over-done sacks of crap, and what I got was much different. I wouldn't really say this is a straight horror movie like Psycho or The Birds, as it unfolds itself like a riveting drama of two sisters instead. The acting is phenomenal, though, at least from our two lead characters, and the way they play off each other is just fantastic. This one takes a while to get going, but once it does, you are in for a high-octane, creepy thrill ride. Recommended to fans of older horror/suspense type movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But ya are Blanche!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently viewed this film with a friend who had never seen it before. Much to my surprise, we had to turn it off early because this friend actually found Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? boring. I'll admit that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is a dated piece of work. By today's standards, there is no shock value. The actresses are not well known by the younger crowds out there. There is a lot of dialogue and very little action. It simply doesn't fit in with today's expectations of horror and suspense. So why does it hold up as a great film, at least by my standards and by the standards of so many others?To truly appreciate this film, it would be necessary to understand the background. What actually contributed to the making of this film is what I find truly fascinating. The story itself is about two elderly sisters. One, Baby Jane, (played by Bette Davis) was a child star in the early part of the century. She was hugely popular on the vaudeville circuit. Backstage she was a spoiled brat. Later on in life the other sister, Blanche (played by Joan Crawford) became a popular Hollywood movie star, overshadowing her now 'has-been' sister. A supposed car accident leaves Blanche crippled during the height of her popularity and a crazed Jane is left to care for her.In their later life Blanche is confined to her bedroom and Jane, still donning the make up and curls from her childhood runs the house. Jane still believes she can resurect her career, but is tormented by her sisters continued popularity as her films are rerun on television.There are some fabulous lines throughout the movie that have become legendary. Blanche says, "You couldn't do this to me if I wasn't in this wheel chair.' Jane quips "But ya are Blanche, but ya are."Davis plays Jane to the hilt, looking hysterically eerie as she tortures Crawford's stoic Blanche. My kid sister saw this film after seeing Mommie Dearest and aptly stated that this was just dessert for a woman who beat her children so badly. I think my sister was most impressed when Davis kicks Joan in the stomach. "Take that Mommie Dearest!"Back to my original point, I believe that in order to truly appreciate this story, one must appreciate the behind-the-scenes legend that truly is the essence of this film. Davis and Crawford were, and are, two of the most formidable actresses in Hollywood. Between them there are hundreds of films, three Oscars, and countless tidbits of gossip. Both had to claw and chew their way to the top, and had to fight harder to stay there. They both had stormy relationships, and bitter feuds with studio bosses and directors. And both have a legion of fans that have survived long after they did. And of course, lets not forget the fact that they may have despised each other. There is a fantastic book called Bette and Joan (I can't recall the author's name) that I recommend any novice viewer read prior to viewing this film. In it, the lives of these two remarkable women are described in gossipy detail. A lot of time is spent detailing the making of this film. At the time Joan was pushing her husbands company, Pepsi. It was rumored, perhaps by Bette that her Pepsi bottles were half filled with vodka. Bette also complains vehemently about the size of Joan's fake cleavage, and how they got in the way of some of those scenes. It's even suggested that some of those beatings that Joan took from Bette were real. With all of this background, one might soon appreciate, as I did, the importance of this film in documenting the lives of these two prominent women. I don't think we'll ever come so close to true Hollywood Babylon as we will with this brilliant work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Davis and Crawford worked together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were the biggest rivals during the golden age of Hollywood.This is their only collaboration.In the beginning of the movie we're at 1917, where the six-year old Baby Jane Hudson (Davis) is a successful Vaudeville performer.Then we move to 1935 where her sister Blanche (Crawford) becomes paralyzed in an automobile accident for which Jane is held responsible.In the present-day of the film we see Blanche being kept as a prisoner upstairs of their mansion by the sadistic Jane.Robert Aldrich' What Ever Happened to Baby Jane (1962) is a terrific psychological thriller with some black comedy.The leading ladies are truly magnificent.Bette Davis was born a hundred years ago in 1908 and died in 1989.She could play all kind of roles and make the characters memorable.Baby Jane Hudson is that kind of a role.Joan Crawford lived from 1905 to 1977 and started making pictures during the silent era.Her Blanche Hudson is vulnerable and that's why we like her that much.A fine performance is given by Victor Buono who plays the shiftless musician Victor Flagg.Maidie Norman plays Elvira Stitt.Michael Fox, who the soap opera fans remember from The Bold and the Beautiful plays Motorcycle cop.This movie is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great movies about the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great movies about the movies, (and great movies about the movies aren't reverential, they bite the hand that feeds them), and the best of Aldrich's 'women's pictures'. Detractors see it as a misogynist load of horse manure about a couple of self-loathing sisters hauled up together in a decaying Hollywood mansion, a too-close-to-home study of the real life rivalry between stars Bette Davis and Joan Crawford or even as a veiled study of homosexual self-depreciation with the sisters as ageing drag queens. But these are the very things that make the picture great. It is precisely because it can be read in this way that makes it such a perversely enjoyable, subversive piece of work.As the sisters, Davis and Crawford pull all the stops out and then some. What makes Crawford's performance great is that she is never sympathetic even when Davis is feeding her dead rat or quite literally kicking her when she's down, while Davis is simply astonishing. With her face painted like a hideous Kabuki mask and dressed up like a doll that's filled with maggots it's an unashamedly naked piece of acting, as revealing as her work in "All About Eve" and almost as good. Unfortunately the film's commercial success lead both actresses into a downward spiral of not dissimilar but considerably lack-lustre material. But this bitch-fest is the real McCoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Hudson Sisters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that this film isn't good, it's very good in a ghoulish sort of way. But the miracle is that it got made at all. Was director Robert Aldrich really a director here or more of a referee.In any event Aldrich in directing Whatever Happened To Baby Jane took a pair of screen legends whose well known and public loathing for each other and managed without being killed to fashion a film about a pair of has been performers who live in the same house with their memories, their problems and mutual hatreds.Bette Davis as Baby Jane Hudson was a child vaudeville performer who like so many child stars was a has been when she became a teen. Not to worry about income because when she became a teen, her younger sister Blanche played by Joan Crawford then became the family breadwinner. But that came to an end when she was crippled in a car crash and it was widely believed that her sister had deliberately used the car as a weapon of jealousy.So these two with everything and yet nothing in common are bound to the family house and each other. Crawford a prisoner in her wheelchair and Davis a prisoner of her own fantasies as she retreats gradually into her childhood and glory days.Crawford is seeing how Davis is becoming more and more unhinged and decides to sell the family estate and get Davis into the 1962 equivalent of Happydale. But Davis gets wind of the plan and she makes Crawford a prisoner in her own home and eventually Davis just loses it totally.The wrap up of shooting must have been a day celebrated by Robert Aldrich on each anniversary the rest of his life. But he got himself a film that's as fascinating as a bloody 20 car pile up on the Interstate. Whatever Happened To Baby Jane got an Oscar for costume design for a black and white film and four other nominations.One of those nominations was for Best Actress, a then record 10 of them for Bette Davis in the title role. Bette Davis was an actress who could make some mediocre films entertaining when she took the brakes off. Here the role called for the most outrageous kind of overacting and Bette made the most of it. Joan's more subdued role of the victim in this film, good as she was didn't have a chance next to Bette's for recognition. Of course Crawford legendarily took a perverse pleasure in being the honorary acceptor for Anne Bancroft when she won the Oscar for Best Actress for The Miracle Worker in 1962. Truth be told Anne was the Best Actress that year.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane is such a two woman film that the rest of the cast is just left in the dust. Another miracle occurred when Victor Buono received some recognition with a nomination for Best Supporting Actor as the mother fixated pianist who plays along with Bette Davis when she decides to revive her career. Of course the strange noises and doings in that house eventually creep him out. Buono's scenes are all with Davis and with the scene stealing Marjorie Bennett who's kind of a mirror image of Baby Jane Hudson as Buono's inebriated mother. Just holding his own with these two I'm figuring the Academy figured Buono deserved some recognition.Bette and Joan, both were destined to be trapped in mediocrity for the most part in roles well beneath their talents. Bette to her credit did escape with such things as an Agatha Christie mystery occasionally and The Whales Of August. But mostly she and Joan did horror flicks because of the impression that Whatever Happened To Baby Jane left on the minds of the movie-going public. Both also got unceremoniously dissed by their daughters in memoirs, Bette not having the decency to die before B.D. Hyman's book came out.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane as repulsively fascinating as it is is a testament to two screen legends and the stamina of director Robert Aldrich who got them to share the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sibling Jealousy, Rivalry, Malevolence and Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1917, Baby Jane is a famous, but spoiled child star that performs a show with her father under the jealous look of her sister Blanche. In 1935, Blanche Hudson (Joan Crawford) becomes a famous and glamorous actress in Hollywood and the untalented Baby Jane Hudson (Bette Davis) only acts because Blanche forces the producers to give parts to her. One night, they go to a party and there is a car accident.In 1962, Blanche is a crippled woman that has been left wheelchair-bound after the accident that lives with her alcoholic sister Baby Jane in a decaying Hollywood mansion. Baby Jane does not recall the accident since she was drunk and is in absolute control over Blanche that is completely isolated without any contact with the outside world and dumping her correspondence in the trash. As Baby Jane becomes more insane, she decides to return to the stage and hires the idle Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono) to play piano. Meanwhile she continues to torment Blanche and her cruelty increases."What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" is one of the greatest American movies ever, with top-notch performances of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. The disturbing story of sibling jealousy, rivalry, malevolence and insanity has a surprising plot point in the end that really surprises. I believe the three lead characters ? Baby Jane, Blanche and Edwin Flagg ? are a field day for psychologists. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "O Que Terá Acontecido com Baby Jane?" ("What Might Have Happened to Baby Jane?")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildred and Mildred, For One and Only Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1962, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford had been all but relics from Old Hollywood. Even then, they were faint memories of a time gone by. No one young and alive at that time knew who they were nor did they have an interest in their all but dead careers. New stars were on the rise, sensibilities were changing, movies were starting to rely less on star power and taking risks with lesser known actors who did not convey the typical Hollywood image. New directors were also the hot ticket, and had little time or patience to deal with the vitriolic antics of temperamental females who threw their ego around like they would do with a small object in the heat of an argument. It was the start of the end of the American innocence.And innocence lost is what seems to be the central theme of Robert Aldrich's Gothic horror movie WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? The story of two sisters living in complete isolation from the rest of the world, hating each other every from dusk 'til dawn, and harboring a deadly secret that could kill them is not the kind of material anyone would associate the two lead actresses with, but by then, their choices in scripts were precious few, both had begun to take baby steps in television -- considered by many actors to be a step down in their careers -- and both needed the work to pay the bills. When Crawford got her hands on the book, she decided to turn it into a movie because it would give her a chance to work with the actress she admired the most, even when such admiration was rebuffed with brutal aggression and had turned into hatred.Enlisting Robert Aldrich, who had directed her in AUTUMN LEAVES (and with whom Crawford had had an affair with), and securing Davis in the role of the more dominant sister, cinema history was made when for the first time audiences got to see both actresses essay not only their character counterparts, but relive their extreme, morbid antipathy against each other. Reports of tension on the set flew like wildfire: for the first time since Miriam Hopkins, Bette Davis was up against the only other female whom she did not particularly like. Crawford knew she would have to compete in many other ways -- salary and dressing room included -- to make her experience with the stronger-willed Davis bearable. But... Crawford must have known what she was getting into: when you express such admiration for someone who does not respond back, and force yourself into a project with that person, anything can happen.Despite the belief of a feud, both actresses expressed getting along quite well together. Of course, Davis added that had they worked for three months instead of three weeks, the result would have been much different. It is interesting, however, to see how they play against each other scene by scene: Davis overacts to almost impossible degrees and without knowing makes Crawford come off better. It was like seeing Mildred Rogers meeting Mildred Pierce for a perverse face-off: and it is also interesting to see that the wig Davis wears bears a resemblance to the way she wore her hair in OF HUMAN BONDAGE to some degree, the same way the resemblance to Crawford as Blanche to her anterior character is striking.As a movie, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is a lesser sister film to SUNSET BLVD., but also a precursor to Rob Reiner's adaptation of Stephen King's MISERY with the genders reversed. It did pave the way for a sub-genre within the horror genre featuring older women in exaggerated Gothic stories of murder and mayhem, and on that alone it does deserve that accolade. It also became something of a distant relation to the works of David Lynch in its willingness to depict an inherent weirdness within the sadomasochistic, co-dependent relationship between the sisters. At times a little exploitative, at times gripping, and at times flat out funny, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? was yet another triumph in both Crawford's and Davis' careers with an Oscar nomination for Davis, an Oscar snub for Crawford, and increased tension between the two women. Both were slated to appear in a follow-up movie that became HUSH, HUSH... SWEET CHARLOTTE in 1964, but because of "medical reasons" Crawford had to bow out, leaving Davis' old friend Olivia deHaviland to step in. Neither actress would ever work together again. Crawford's career would come to an end not 8 years later in 1970 following a string of grade F horror movies (a shortened version of what has become Karen Black's career), whereas Davis would successfully alternate the remainder of the Sixties and all throughout the Seventies and Eighties between OK horror movies, TV dramas (where she would get Emmy nominations), and even a pilot for a series co-starring friend Anne Baxter. As it is, this remains a blueprint for actors who have been known to despise each other, working together, and making their mutual animosity the stuff of high camp and egotistical overacting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there a more surreal image in cinema than the sight of Bette Davis dragging Joan Crawford across the floor by her arm? And this, right after using Ms. Crawford for a soccer ball in a truly chilling scene. This movie is unlike so many classics you're likely to run across, not quite a horror film, but creepy enough to straddle that genre with a peculiar fit. I'm sorry now I waited so long to watch it.Davis and Crawford share about equal screen time, and it would be hard to score one's performance over the other. But without question, Davis is pure hag in this one, a bitch on wheels who takes glee in tormenting her sister due to the reversal in their career fortunes. The film will keep you off balance wondering why Blanche Hudson (Crawford) seems to continually make excuses for Baby Jane's (Davis) rude behavior, especially when as a child, she sets up the viewer for revenge with a remark she makes to their mother - "You bet I won't forget". It's not till the end of the story that Blanche makes her confession, but by then you've placed all your sympathies with her.As for creepy, you would think a dead bird in the lunch tray is tops in macabre, but only until Jane outdoes herself with a rat from the cellar. There's something about dead birds in film that arouses a primal, gut level response. It was used as a device in 1944's "The Curse of the Cat People" and more recently in the German film "The White Ribbon" (2009). Maybe it's just me, but the imagery is truly frightening and enough it seems, to send one's victim over the edge. It certainly did here.What drove this viewer over the edge though, was the adult Jane Hudson's version of 'I've Written a Letter to Daddy'! It was barely tolerable when the youthful Baby Jane sang it on stage, but Davis's performance was fingernails on chalkboard. That scene might just be worth waiting the entire picture for, notwithstanding the violent confrontation between Davis and Crawford near the finale.But the best is the twist ending that you never see coming as Blanche Hudson makes her dying confession on the beach. While the entire time the picture has you sucked in about what a hate filled woman Baby Jane has become, it's not until Blanche sets the record straight about the accident that ended her career. You have to wonder who was the more bitter woman, as Blanche tells Jane - "You weren't ugly then. I made you that way".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true story of a haunted house - with a living, breathing ghoul in residence! This is a great movie following a child star through her descent into alcoholism. Both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford (Blanche) are exceptional in this movie and this is one movie you really don't want to miss! Note the re-creation of "I've Written a Letter to Daddy" - truly chilling! The photography is exceptional and there are many fascinating scenes - Miss Davis has perhaps the most, eh, exotic makeup job ever seen in a movie and her every movement furthers her character. Victor Buono, in his first role, is a fascinating find, too - his lust for money vies with his morality and he wins by just a nose!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused grating disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge lover of all films, especially classics and horror flicks. I had heard about this film for years and was really excited when I rented it, but was thoroughly unsatisfied by the product. Where do I begin...The setup is very compelling. I loved seeing Jane as a talentless brat and Blanche as the quiet older sister who grows up to become the hottest actress in Hollywood while Jane turns into a drunk laughingstock. Then when it looks like Jane cripples Blanche, I was horrified and my eyes were glued to the screen. It was all downhill from there.First of all, I have to take issue with Bette Davis's performance. I know that's sacrilege, but I couldn't stand her. I'm not sure how much of the blame should be divided among her, the screenplay and the director but her character was so over-the-top that it just became cartoonish at times. Some would of course argue that that's to the film's benefit, because they love the black comedy. I've heard that the film is a favorite of drag queens, and I can see why. But I think it severely undermines the film's merits as a HORROR movie, which is how it's almost always qualified. If they wanted to go the black comedy route, they should have gone farther with that b/c I thought as they did it things just didn't mix. Davis's caricature was such a glaring contrast to the sincere performance of Joan Crawford, as well as pretty much everything else in the movie.Speaking of Crawford, though, I found her character mind-boggling at times. So it was established that Blanche has been trapped by Jane for all the years since the accident. Why couldn't she just leave? Surely the top actress in Hollywood would be able to afford personal care! Some fans might say that's answered at the end of the movie, but I'll come back to that. When Jane was torturing her that much, why couldn't Blanche at least call the police and say she was being held against her will? It's mentioned during the movie that Jane's started going insane, so maybe it hasn't been going on that long, but if Blanche doesn't even get any visitors ever, she must sense something's wrong. And then when Blanche goes through the INCREDIBLE ordeal of getting to the phone downstairs when she's home alone after Jane's taken out her phone, why doesn't she use that to CALL THE POLICE! Some might say she was concerned about Jane and wanted to get a doctor for her, but I'm sorry, when a character's such a one-dimensional doormat, I stop caring about here. If the ending is supposed to justify all this, well I think whatever Blanche did was more than made up for by the endless abuse Jane subject her to, and I don't see how anyone could reasonably argue otherwise.When Elvira found Blanche, I was relieved thinking at least the movie was going somewhere now with Blanche about to be rescued. BUT WHY DID ELVIRA LEAVE THE HAMMER OUTSIDE WITH THAT PSYCHO RIGHT NEXT TO IT? Gee, who thought Jane would bash her head in? I was again happy when Edwin found Blanche, but he just ran off stammering! What the hell was the point of him even being in the movie? I'm thinking there just wasn't enough story to fill out a film otherwise. I thought he was just an annoying fat guy, and he turned out to be an annoying heartless fat guy. How did Victor Buono get an Oscar nomination for that? Why am I not surprised that people never saw or heard of Mr. Buono again after this movie? While the movie had glaring flaws, I thought it would at least be great to see Blanche saved and Jane killed at the end. But instead, one of the worst twists in history was thrown at us! The only things the film had in its favor at any point were a sympathetic heroine and a contemptible villain. So what do they do at the end? Make Blanche responsible for her own trouble and Jane a lovable loon! Even if Blanche paralyzed herself, Jane kept her a prisoner, starved her, beat her, and berated her endlessly. And let's not forget SHE MURDERED ELVIRA! I'm not buying the mental illness excuse the movie tries-Jane was a monster her whole life and apparently towards the end became a monster unable to handle how pitiful she was. The pathetic attempt at shocking viewers just made me wish I'd never met either sister! Oh, and by the way-Jane's giddy dancing at the end? A RIPOFF of the INFINITELY superior Sunset Boulevard!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)You can't look at this movie without some kind of wringing of hands, and looking the other way, and astonishment. It's brutal at times, and has the highest kind of verisimilitude. But it's also archly, intentionally exaggerated so that you can't say it's realistic, not in the normal sense.This bugs a lot of viewers, who either just laugh it off or turn it off. Understandably. This almost defines early 1960s camp, a more palatable version of Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) where the viewer is pushed outside the experience and made to watch it happen in front of you. Another parallel, with roots outside the mainstream, would be Sam Fuller's movies of the period, like The Naked Kiss (1964). (Notice the dates coincide--it became a recognizable style, and one different than television, which was winning the viewership wars, along with Vietnam on television. More recently, directors like Tarantino and Burton prefer this slightly artificial approach, as compared to Scorsese or Spielberg who are all about immersion and invisibility of the moviemaker's hand.) So this is Robert Aldrich, also behind the other quirky classics like the noir Kiss Me Deadly (1955) and Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964). Just getting Bette Davis and Joan Crawford together is enough reason to watch. Both are extremes, one of overstatement, the other of maddening understatement. The beginning is all set-up, the core of the movie a rising tide of campy horror, and the ending a stretch of logic after all we've been through, but a welcome one, since by this point, anything goes. The filming is absolutely gripping, with strong angles and daring closeups and lots of moving camera, so the limited sets are kept alive. And the acting beyond the two women, the maid (Maidie Norman) and the pianist (Victor Buono), is spectacular.Which takes us back to what also matters--the idea of sisters trying to make sense of a childhood rivalry that became horrific, and then poisonous for decades. It's a study in frustration, for sure, as you want to grab Joan Crawford's character and say, "Just shout!" and she won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The experience of seeing it in first release, in 1962....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>provoked a considerably more intense reaction then it could possibly have for anybody seeing it for the first time now. Or any time in the last, say, forty years.This film was so successful that much of what was unique about it has been copied and reused in countless scary movies from that date forward.In 1962 I was a sophomore in high school when I saw this picture. It's difficult to convey how shocking it was. First of all, I was the first generation that grew up with movies of the 30s and 40s on TV. In fact, the script makes use of this when we see the neighbors and Joan's character watching herself on TV. So the audience knew perfectly well who Crawford and Davis were and the kind of movies they appeared in. This movie was so completely different from anything they had done before, it was a total surprise.The violence in the film was literally stunning. You couldn't believe what you were seeing when Jane assaulted her sister. It was horrifying. And the meals served--that's now a movie cliché, but at the time, it was completely unexpected; you couldn't believe they were showing this stuff on the screen. The suspense of what outrageous thing might come next was almost unbearable. It was totally thrilling.I think the film holds up pretty well, and of course, it's a must-see for anyone who wants to claim cultural literacy. But the truth is, the success of this movie has somewhat blunted the true horror us old-timers experienced back in 1962.But don't let that stop you. You're still going to get a few jolts....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astounding movie with two riveting actresses : Davis and Crawford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie deals with two old retired actresses : Bette Davis and Joan Crawford , Davis is a nut-head and Joan Crawford is a cripple woman . A terrible secret originates taking on each other . The confrontation will be creepy and scary .From the beginning to the end the suspense and tension are continuous . The script of the film is very warped and the final has an extraordinary surprise . In the movie there is intrigue , mystery , violence , taut , terror and though being mostly developed on interior stages is neither tiring , nor dreary , but entertaining . The runtime is longtime , two hours and some approx. but it happens a lot of events and that's why isn't boring . Interpretation of the main actresses is first range , as Bette Davis specially , she with his make-up and hysterical acting is the real madness . Both actress will continue playing similar roles as ¨The anniversary¨ and ¨The nanny¨. Bette Davis was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in this movie . Had Davis won, it would have set a record number of wins for one actress . Davis and Joan Crawford had a lifelong mutual hatred, and a jealous Crawford actively campaigned against Davis winning Best Actress . The support cast with Victor Buono is outstanding . Robert Aldrich's direction is excellent , even the same realized a sequel : ¨ Hush,Hush sweet Charlotte ¨ ( with Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland and Victor Buono) . Black and White cinematography by Ernest Haller is rightly made and Frank DeVol music (Robert Aldrich's habitual musician) is stimulating .Rating : Above average . This is a definitely movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Fave "Baby Jane" quote) - "You mean all this time we could've been friends!??" To be honest, I was all set to despise this "Comedy-of-Horrors", venomously, the very minute I sat down to watch it. But, that all changed within the first 15 minutes as I quickly became quite engrossed in the contrasting character portrayals given by its 2 lead, veteran actresses, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford (both in their mid-50s at the time).I know that a lot of people rave approvingly about Davis's grotesque make-up and all of her "scenery-chewing" antics as being the highlight of this picture - But, personally, my vote for most outstanding performance goes to Crawford as Blanche Hudson, a prisoner trapped in her own tailor-made hell.I'd say that Crawford's riveting "Please.... Help me!" scene clearly put all of Davis's over-the-top shenanigans to absolute shame.Yes. This tragic tale about madness, pent-up resentment and living a life of long-faded dreams definitely has its fair share of glaring flaws - But, all the same, it certainly does hold up quite well, 53 years down the road.I definitely give film-maker, Robert Aldrich, a lot of credit for his competent direction of this picture. I can't begin to tell you how thankful I am that he didn't allow its storyline to ride right off the rails into utter mayhem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is perhaps the best movie of Joan Crawford's and Bette Davis' career! Both actresses turn in the performances of a lifetime. I feel that it was such a shame that Joan's performance in this film was underrated by the Motion Picture Academy, and therefore NOT nominated for the coveted Academy Award. Bette's over-the-top performance WAS nominated, but Joan's subtle performance, which was much harder to accomplish, was overlooked. The redeeming factor in this award drama was the fact that Bette lost the award to Anne Bancroft, and Joan Crawford accepted it on her behalf! This horror classic is a MUST-SEE...so, IF you haven't seen...RUN..don't walk...to the nearest video store and rent it or purchase it...You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane was a movie I once saw about 7 years ago, and in all honesty some of it traumatised me not just the purposefully grotesque make up but also the snarl-and-shriek chemistry between the two leads. Watching it again, the film maintains its chilling and shocking values, but there is also under the surface a sadness, compassion and campiness(in a good way) that I didn't notice as much previously.What Ever Happened to Baby Jane is essentially a must see movie. The production values are superb, with beautiful yet atmospheric cinematography, well-tailored costumes, well-constructed/chosen sets/scenery and above all the grotesque yet brilliant make-up. The music never detracts from the atmosphere which is resolutely chilling albeit with moments of pathos as seen Davis' and Crawford's envy, the script shocks, amuses and delights and the story is well-paced and never less than interesting. Aldrich directs superbly, and while Victor Bueno is wonderful, it is the performances and hair-raising chemistry between the two leads that takes centre stage. Joan Crawford is superb, but Bette Davis has the meatier role as a very over-the-edge character and gives a portrayal that is both terrifying and heartbreaking.Overall, a must see film especially for the leads. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Whatever Happened To Baby Jane" is, on the surface, a horror movie about two elderly actress sisters who live together and terrorize one another... but there is much more going on here.First, the movie is an excellent psychological horror picture that has stood the test of time. Brilliantly shot and directed it uses sometimes-subtle, sometimes-outrageous gags (and you will gag) to scare you and keep you on-edge. We as an audience relate to the Joan Crawford character- paralyzed, helpless, at the mercy of psychotic Bette Davis- which turns us into victims and amplifies the terror. Bette herself turns in one of her boldest performances and in spite of the fact that she's got curls instead of fangs she is surely playing one of the scariest monsters in cinema history.Much has been made of the camp value in a movie that features two legendary actresses being so openly ugly in front of the camera and becoming parodies of themselves. That's the second layer to the movie... art-imitating-life. Crawford &amp; Davis were two of the strongest, most vocal Hollywood actresses of the Golden Age, and so of course many considered them female dogs. That aspect of their lives and careers is embraced- if not exploited- in "Baby Jane" as we get a look at what strong, angry actresses can do when the roles are hard to find.And so we move to the third layer of the movie... it was unprecedented when Bette Davis campaigned in the 1940's to break free of her contract to Warner Brothers... She wanted the freedom to work at different studios on different films, films she could choose for herself. When she won the landmark case it cast the first blow against the Hollywood studio system. The studio system was simple: actors were owned by studios like property and churned out three, four, five movies a year with little control over the choice and content of their pictures. It sounds a lot worse than it was, because it kept actors, writers, techs, etc regularly employed, and the average quality of a movie was high. Without the system actors were as they are today: free-lance, forced to pick their own projects and take an active role in getting movies made, packaging deals, etc. The new Hollywood also meant a studio could give any female role to whatever young, pretty starlet had arrived in town that morning... there were no financial obligations holding them to the Crawfords and Davis' anymore. Ironic? Maybe a little bit.And so Blanche and Jane fight in a claustrophobic old house- broken-down, deserted, abandoned. They fight because the world has forgotten them and the way they used to perform. They fight because they're jealous and bitter and because they refuse to accept that their time has passed. They're at odds with the world around them and the death of their careers and so they turn psychotic. In turn we get a movie that plays like a good nightmare... campy, shocking, funny, black, dramatic, suspenseful and sometimes silly. "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" is just as vital a movie today as when it was made... a dark masterpiece. Don't pass up a chance to see it for yourself.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of its kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pairing of these two great stars (who were, famously, not the best of friends in real life) set off a whole fad during the sixties: Gothic melodramas featuring older female stars from filmdom's golden age (the thirties and forties). While this trend lasted, a few stars saw their careers revived. However the reputations weren't necessarily enhanced. Baby Jane was the first, and the best of this strange genre. The film is beautifully photographed, well acted, the the script, though containing a few potholes, keeps the viewer's attention. Especially notable for a great debut comic performance by Victor Buono as a creepy sycophantic "musician" with a phony British accent. Subsequent outings by both Crawford and Davis, (who never worked together again)were not nearly as successful as this one. Joan, especially, was amazingly controlled as sister Blanche Hudson. No retelling of the plot is necessary here, but I do think the director, Robert Aldrich had a little fun with these two dragon-ladies of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Stars Who Never Set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1917, pretty blonde preteen "Baby Jane" Hudson is a wildly popular child star. She performs her signature song, "I've Written a Letter to Daddy" and sells her likeness in dolls. Tearfully jealous dark-haired sister Blanche gets lost in the shadows, off-stage... In 1935, the stars have turned. Beautiful and sexy Blanche is a wildly popular adult actress. Wowing audiences and critics in several films, she makes a lot of money. Washed-up and wearing her bratty attitude thinly, the adult Jane repeatedly bombs at the box office... Then, a horrible accident ends Blanche's career? In 1962, the retiring sisters are living comfortably in a Hollywood mansion. Joan Crawford (as Blanche) is an invalid, mostly confined to her bedroom, in a wheelchair. She worries about the mentally unstable and increasingly alcoholic Bette Davis (as Jane), who is planning her "comeback" as an elderly "Baby Jane" entertainer. A successful television retrospective of Ms. Crawford's 1930s movies increases Ms. Davis' drive, and jealousy. Davis hires pianist Victor Buono (as Edwin) to manage her "career" while making Crawford a terrified prisoner in her upstairs bedroom? "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" made Davis and Crawford box-office stars again, and opened up a successful new film genre for "Golden Age" actresses. Previously celebrating their 50s in the '60s with the models initiated by Garbo (saying "no murderesses" in retirement) and Hepburn (waiting years for the meager well-written roles), they were now free to get bound, gagged, or swing an ax! There were many imitations, but Bette and Joan are the mothers of them all. Directed by Robert Aldrich, this also happens to be an excellent film. Nobody could do it like Crawford and Davis.The scene with Davis' "Jane" placing her liquor order - "Six bottles of scotch and three bottles of gin" - reminded me of taking the legendary actress' own liquor order while working as a kid in "Greenblatt's" in the late 1980s. She called the Sunset Boulevard deli regularly, ordering various alcoholic beverages (no scotch, the day I spoke with her). I wasn't the delivery boy, but persuaded him to let me help carry the bottles. Davis was living in an apartment in the West Hollywood area and was not able to easily make-up and come to the door - but, she was as sharp and delightful as ever.********** What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

I was 13 when I saw this movie, and again I was blown away. They just don't make movies like this any more!I have seen this movie numerous times and have it in my movie collection. I would say that this is one of my favorite movies. I became a fan of Bette Davis when I saw Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte (Since then I have seen her other performances)and I believe she was one of the finest performers of all time. Now,add Joan Crawford and you have got yourself a knock-out production. The whole plot is so deep and well portrayed by Bette and Joan. Whats adds to the realism is the fact that in real life these two "Grand Dames of Cinema" detested each other, making the interaction between the two in this film incredibly real. Again, as in Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte", you are right there until the very end without knowing the whole story. Every character in this movie was portrayed magnificently, from Mrs. Bates and her daughter Liza next door, the maid Elvira,and Victor Buono and his mother. Bette takes the cake, of course, again she truly IS Baby Jane Hudson with her ghoulish make-up to her sadistic treatment of her sister. Poor Joan, I would imagine it couldn't have been easy working opposite Bette! This movie is a masterpiece, and can be seen time and time again. It holds it's own and is definitely worth adding to your movie library!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all time favorites. Each scene is so well crafted that I enjoy watching how well it is filmed and acted. I like the scenes showing different time periods, 1917 when Baby Jane is a child star. Then, on to 1935 when Blanche is the big star and we see scenes from Bette Davis' old movies as a lousy actress. Then, to the present 1960s Los Angeles. The contrast between what's going on in the house of these two aging has-beens and the outside world, ordinary next door neighbors, Bette's trips to the bank or the newspaper office dressed up in old, dated clothes driving a 1940 Lincoln convertible. Just fun to watch.Then, there are those priceless moments as when Jane is being viewed from outside Blanche's bedroom window with a sad look on her grotesque face and then she brightens up as she turns and says "But ya are in that chair, Blanche. Ya are". Another scene has Jane picking up the silver lunch tray as she leaves the bedroom and the camera goes down to show her kicking the door closed with her high-heel shoe. How many times did Jane climb up those stairs carrying that heavy lunch tray and make it fun to watch each time?When the maid, Elvira, shows Blanche the discarded fan letters and suggests that Jane might know that Blanche is planning to sell the house, Blanche says "We're sisters Elvira. We know each other very well". Joan Crawford was excellent with a more subtle role and she delivered. For those who say Bette overacted, she was perfect as an aging former child star, who failed as an adult actress, thought she crippled her sister in a car accident and had to spend the next 30 years taking care of her, and was a alcoholic to boot. The part did not call for subtlety or to be underplayed. Bette ranged from childlike to mean and abusive to flirtatious to hysterically funny. I loved when she impersonated Blanche's voice on the phone. The only odd thing was why would Blanche live in a 2 story house when she had to use a wheelchair and did she ever leave the house before all the trouble started?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sibling rivalry takes a turn for the worst in this blow-out evaluation of creeping madness. Two Hollywood greats in peak performance; each try out-bitching the other. Bette Davis set a standard unequalled in the portrayal of ruthless, callous women bordering upon psychosis. Check out her one-eyed tour-de-force in 'The Anniversary'. Nobody did it better. Joan Crawford invariably played a less ferocious manipulator, but equally dangerous even so. Here, Baby Jane Hudson was a childhood star who shone twice as bright for half as long, and is now completely forgotten. Pampered and spoilt beyond infant reason, she herself has never lost the passion for centre-stage. Her sister, Blanche, meanwhile enjoyed her own success as a mature actress before a crippling accident brought it to a premature end. Years have passed and the two women have lived together all this time as spinsters. One remains bed-ridden, whilst the other waits upon her every needs. Throughout their relationship, a mutual resentment has simmered beneath the surface of co-operation. Then, one day, the local TV network begin a season of Blanche's old but worthy movies. Flowers arrive, and fan mail. And Baby Jane's latent jealousy begins to seethe. Jane's crippled sister isn't just her patient; she is also her prisoner. And soon Jane finds ways to demonstrate her burgeoning evil passions. Meal service and menu deteriorate alarmingly. The scenario has a great deal in common with Stephen King's much later 'Misery' featuring an unhinged Cathy Bates and helpless James Caan. In both movies the patient is held incommunicado. Their presence or availability is denied. Whilst all the time they are psychologically and later physically brutalised. Eventually, when a suspicious outsider does get in, each is murdered without hesitation. In the excess of her derangement, Jane Hudson believes that she can also recapture her lost glory. But she's an old woman now, not a child, with an ugliness that only Bette Davis could make manifest. Her efforts are both frightening and tragic. Because it seems that she has been labouring all of these years under a false guilt, into which she was deceived by her seemingly-innocent crippled sister. I won't tell you what that is. This is essentially a movie about just two people. Beyond the divas' fees it must have been pretty economical to make. Locations beyond their house are few and far between. We concentrate on the utter tragedy of their lives and relationship. It is a measure of its spell-biding direction, lighting and the utterly absorbing fidelity of the stars, that just they two alone can seize our attention and put it through the mangle for almost the whole movie, never letting us flag.For generations raised upon a diet of air-head bimbettes, and blonde, silicone-bagged twenty-somethings with vaginal pouts, here is a pair of real women, going at the business of acting like a pair of stokers. They ain't pretty; you wouldn't want to sleep with 'em; but - my God - do the movies need women like this today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute dramatic &amp; gripping classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredible adaptation of Henry Farell's novel in which two sisters, now in their latter years, live together in the same house. The house paid for by their years of work in stage &amp; film.Most of the film is spent within the house and revolves around the sisters relationship, with brief interruptions by a neighbour, a cleaning lady and a songwriter. Great material for a stage play, the basic grounding for this story enables vivid exploration into the womens characters, and opens the opportunity for some outstanding cinematography &amp; music.Remarkably a cross section of movie genres are covered here and at points has a "Hitchcock" feel to it. Combining theatrical suspense with hysterical intensity, both actresses dominate with absolute clarity and individuality.Bette Davis plays the reminiscent title role with a mesmerising performance, apparently taking care of her sister Blanch (Joan Crawford) who is now wheel chair bound due to a car accident. Crawford suffers through most of the film in her bedroom while Davis displays a fascinating set of split personalities. The two are brought together every meal time with drastically varying results.Though there are few other characters in the film, they are absolutely crucial to the movement of this story and all parts are played extremely well, especially Victor Buono who plays songwriter Edwin Flagg, who through we briefly glimpse another story.What this film achieves where others fail is an instant understanding and clarity to emotions and reactions. Instances of loving &amp; caring with glimpses of comedy are also there, as well as fear, loathing, manipulation and jealousy.The closing beach scene gives Davis the opportunity to show a final depth to her character and makes this quite an extra-ordinary film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Whatever Happened To Baby Jane is supposed to be some "cinematic masterpiece," so it's probably "too good" to be considered a camp-classic, but it certainly had the feel. I'm not insulting it though. I heatily enjoyed this dark tale of a bratty former child star who grows up a has-been while her sister, who was "plain" as a child became a star later in life...until she mysteriously got paralyzed. The twisted relationship between Crazy Jane and the more sane Blanche is fun to watch as it develops, but nothing is quite as entertaining as when the flashback when Jane was still nauseatingly refered to as "Baby Jane" and is throwing a tantrum right in the middle of her adoring public, who of course act all horrified. Great stereotype of child stars. Great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Who's happy?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has a habit of treating worst those who love it best. And this is part of the reason that since the collapse of the studio system American movie production has been locked in cycles of irony and self-parody. Motion pictures tended to imitate the life around them, and in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? you have, played out on screen for your enjoyment, the sorry states of two grandes dames of cinema - Bette Davis and Joan Crawford - and the much-maligned producer-director Robert Aldrich.The two leading ladies famously had a longstanding rivalry, and it's often commented on how this fuelled their performances. Maybe this is the case, but it's interesting how their portrayals here relate to their offscreen personae. This is among Miss Crawford's finest turns, and in fact one rough way to guage the strength of her acting is in how amiable she comes across, since it's fairly well-documented that in real life she was conniving, selfish and abusive to her children. Funnily enough though I don't think Crawford realised the irony of her warm screen image - she probably believed she was a nice person. Compare this to Davis, who was wryly aware of her reputation for bitchiness both on screen and off, and very knowingly pushes that image to its credible limits as Baby Jane. It is perhaps her most exaggerated role, but also appears to be one of her most effortless as she hams beautifully on the cusp between realism and caricature, in a performance that matches that garish crust of makeup.And makeup is really integral to Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, in an era where such things were not highly considered (for example we only have only had an Academy Award for it since 1981). Bette Davis is a startling sight, with cheeks like chalk and enough mascara to sink a battleship, inadvertently accentuating her age rather than concealing it. It might seem a step too far outside of a comedy, but it's worth bearing in mind that makeup is for women a primary means of expression and even a form of defence and self-denial, and there are plenty of women in real life who look just as ghastly as Davis does here. And for proof of that one need look no further than co-star Crawford, who since the early 40s had perpetually sported her trademark pencil-eyebrowed, thin-lipped, ghost-faced visage, an unintentionally macabre look if ever there was one. Appropriately however, Crawford's slap has been toned down for this picture, and in one or two of the later scenes we see her looking very natural, and incidentally the most beautiful she has appeared since the 1930s.As far as I know producer-director Robert Alrich never wore makeup, but he is an intriguing figure behind this little drama nonetheless. He had been on the scene since the early-40s, directed several pictures of varying quality in the mid-50s, and became a Hollywood exile after helming the controversial drama The Big Knife. After shooting a couple of flicks abroad, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? was his comeback. Rather than going wild in the more liberal post-studio system industry, he shows his technique to have matured and refined in his years away. There is a bit less of the shameless attention-grabbing of his earlier pictures, but still that deliberately odd and slightly detached look to each shot - god-shots, low angles, foreground clutter - which is simply ideal for this intense (but not totally mindless) melodrama.To be honest though Aldrich was always a better producer than a director. Although he rarely took a writing credit he appears to have taken a hand in post-production structuring, and one of his neatest touches was to always have the opening credits several minutes into the picture, creating a prologue and leaving the grand opening to announce the real beginning of the story. He was also great when it came to assembling production teams. Here the crowded art set decoration of George Sawley is complemented by the grimy cinematography of Ernest Haller to create a musty, decaying look to the Hudson's mansion. It's also worth remembering that while Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is adapted from a novel, it was Aldrich that made its commentary on Hollywood politics far closer to the bone by deciding to cast Davis and Crawford.Is this picture then a vicious attack on the fallout from the star system, as was The Big Knife? If it was, it was a bit late, since Hollywood no longer worked in quite the same way. Besides, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is far more affectionate, almost nostalgic in tone. Davis in particular probably regarded it as rather fun - after all she had been playing washed-up, ageing actresses since Dangerous in 1935; at least this time round she had the chance to inject a bit of over-the-top of absurdism. And Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is after all verging on comedy. True, the only aspect which is truly funny is the supporting part brilliantly played by Victor Buono, but the overall feel is one that suggests that joking could occur at any moment, and in fact it is this slightly bizarre tone that keeps this unusually lengthy suspense thriller as spellbinding entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sibling rivalry taken to the extreme...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane" is a polished "A" picture that would be reduced to the sensationalized tabloid hash of a Lifetime made-for-TV movie today. The story, when stripped to its core, could have been played for pure camp value (and indeed, some make an argument for this): washed-up child star 'Baby' Jane Hudson (a grotesque Bette Davis) looks after her sister, Blanche (Joan Crawford) in their father's decaying Hollywood mansion; Jane, still living with outlandish delusions of resurrecting her long-faded star, enlists a young musician (Victor Buono) to accompany her show-tunes of yesteryear. But the further Jane crawls into her crumbling psyche, the more she tries to hide her fearful sister's existence."What Ever Happened to Baby Jane" is a film that explores sibling relations/rivalry in a manner that is at once heartening, subtle, prone to explosion (or, in the case of Jane Hudson, IMplosion), and--finally--self-destruction. By the time we are watching Baby Jane encircled by a group of onlookers on the beach she went to as a child, while Blanche lays dying on the sand, we actually feel a certain amount of pity in spite of this deluded woman's appalling behavior. That might be the biggest trick up "Baby Jane"'s sleeve--while we side with Blanche, we also see her as a passive, fearful person based on her physical confinement; the dynamic of their relationship is confounding and surprising, but never as clear-cut as we'd like.I have had my experience living with both wacked-out roommates and a screwed-up sibling, and "What Ever Happened..." shows the gray areas of such volatile situations. Who truly takes the blame for how we wind up? Jane is no less a villain than her passive mother and vicarious father, who--to her demise--put her on stage as a child, resulting in a delusional addiction from which she never recovers (when she sings the song, "A Letter to Daddy," so many years later, it carries a chilling resonance). As for Blanche, who is all talk and no action, she presents the dilemma of the mature, responsible elder who is extremely aware of her situation, but sees herself trapped in a corner where any action she takes will simply make things worse (there is an exquisitely suspenseful scene where the crippled Blanche makes her way to the downstairs phone, only to have Jane walk in on her). As deranged, delusional, and cruel as Jane is, her extreme efforts to keep hers and her sister's existence a secret is indicative of a strange sort of compassion. Like David Lynch's "Blue Velvet," "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane" is another film that presents love as an ailment, rather than something ethereal.The black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous and sets a fitting mood that is by turns blackly humorous and filled with impending dread. The old mansion and all it contains delivers ample atmospheric chills (take note of the barred windows in Blanche's upstairs room), and draws favorable comparison to the house in "Psycho." The performances are stunning and filled with conviction--Davis and Crawford, who had a notoriously bad working relationship, portray their individual madness and hope with stunning realism; Victor Buono's young musician provides some light comic relief, but also acts as an outsider eye into the bowels of the mansion and the broken souls contained within. Robert Aldrich directs the film with a confident hand, and keeps things speeding along, jacking up the suspense with great frequency that even at the climax, where things seemed to have calmed down, we still find ourselves unremittingly tense from all that has gone on before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, Dark, Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? tells the story of Baby Jane (Bette Davis), an aged child star and her disabled sister, Blanche (Joan Crawford) for whom Baby Jane 'looks after'. Using black and white instead of color sets the dark mood. There is a cleverly done sequence at the start which explains that there was an accident without showing any faces. WHTBJ is a very well done movie. It's kinda scary without really meaning to be. It's disturbing. Your heart beats. But why is your heart beating? It's just a movie. Perhaps it's because the characters are so well done. You like them, you even like Baby Jane despite her possessive, harsh behavior. You feel quite a bit of sympathy for her... she just wants to be loved, something we can all identify with. Baby Jane's embarrassing rendition of "I've Written a Letter to Daddy" makes you realize how much she longs to be loved, adored, worshiped. It's a magnificent movie. It's funny, disturbing, dark, fascinating, sad, tragic... you can really feel the tension and electricity between Bette and Joan. Excellent performances by all, excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying, twisted black comedy is Bette's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This warped Gothic shocker is the ultimate Bette Davis movie. She is absolutely brilliant is the demented, sadistic, unpredictable Baby Jane, going so far over the top that she seems truly insane. Just look at her--a grotesque caricature of a Shirley Temple-style child star, complete with blonde ringlets and clownlike white powder caked onto her haggard face, trying to add a coy little-girl inflection to her cracked, boozy voice. Remember how Norman Bates was scary because he seemed so "normal" on the outside? The exact opposite is why Jane is so frightening. She is obviously, entirely sick and capable of anything. The scene of her croaking "I've Written a Letter to Daddy" in a darkened room is one of the most haunting, chilling moments in motion picture history.Also great is Joan Crawford as tortured sister Blanche. She really makes us care about the character, so much so that we can forget what a monster Joan was in reality. The ladies are perfectly accompanied by Victor Buono, Oscar-nominated in his best role. The black-and-white cinematography is flawless and provides the perfect atmosphere, and the imagery is unforgettable. The entire film is deeply disturbing and gloriously capped by the bizarre finale. An essential for cult aficionados, with Bette giving the best performance of her long, illustrious career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>about as subtle and sophisticated as a 2x4 upside your head!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Subtle"? No way. "Well-crafted"? Not exactly. "Sleazy and captivating"? YEP, you betcha!This is definitely a "guilty pleasure" movie. You know, one that you love to watch but is certainly not sophisticated or subtle. Though a psychological drama, the movie is loud, loud, loud to the extreme--and therein lies most of its cult charm. At her most dramatic and bellicose is Bette Davis--who plays a totally insane and vindictive wench. And, believe it or not, Joan Crawford UNDERPLAYS her part! I know to lovers of classic cinema this seems impossible, as Ms. Crawford might just be one of the biggest over-emoters in the history of film! No, this film is really Bette Davis' film from start to finish--Crawford is just there as an object to be tortured and tormented by our anti-hero, Bette ("Baby Jane"). According to one biography I read about Ms. Davis, she really DID torture Ms. Crawford--walloping the crap out of her on several occasions during filming and then claiming it was all an accident!! So, if you are the type person that loves Shakespeare, Jeeves and Wooster or documentaries about the plight of the Eskimos, then this film probably isn't for you. If instead, you like over-the-top, silly and somewhat scandalous films about insane people doing really nasty things, then have I got a film for YOU! PS--While I enjoyed this film, similar films from the era that I actually enjoyed more are Davis' follow-up HUSH, HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE and Crawford's STRAIT-JACKET. HUSH, HUSH was more intelligently written and subtle and STRAIT-JACKET was much more over-the-top and campy.</fullReview>

The combination of perfect casting and a twisted storyline defined a very special and popular genre of 1960s horror that is as mesmerizing today as it was over 40 years ago.

		<shortDescription>A Wild Ride for Film Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fans of cinema, atleast American cinema of the 30's, 40's, and 50's, "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane" will not disappoint. Whatever the intentions of the filmmakers, whether they were attempting to create a dark comedy, a horror film, or just a thriller with those elements, the film is an intense ride. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, well-known in that era as opinionated actresses (often read bitchy) are here in top form. Bette Davis gives her best sister-from-hell performance as she hides behind coats of crusty make-up that adds to a rather dead look. Joan Crawford plays well the startled and shaken victim of Davis' character's twisted imagination. This is one weird and disturbing film (especially for its time) and almost a precursor to "Night of the Living Dead" and the Crawford-like "Mommie Dearest". Its thundering musical score keeps the heart-pumping and the material keeps the viewer well on the edge. It's no surprise this one is a cult classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be at least a 9 out of 10 with 45 minutes of cuts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baby Jane Hudson (Bette Davis) was a child star with a sister, Blanche (Joan Crawford) who felt left out. Later in life, however, the tables were turned, with Blanche as a big movie star and Jane as a has-been. Most of the film, however, is set when they're in their late 50s or early 60s. Neither is very famous any longer and Jane must take care of Blanche. The only problem is that Jane is slightly off her rocker.Whatever Happened to Baby Jane is the first of two Bette Davis films, with Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) being the other, which have a number of similarities. They are both psychological horror/thriller films, directed by Robert Aldrich, adapted from novels by Henry Farrell, with screenplays by Lukas Heller, both filmed in black &amp; white in the early 1960s--a time when that began to be more of an artistic than a budgetary decision or necessity--and both very similar in tone, with Bette Davis as a "crazy old bat" in a big old house, interacting with a female rival, with major supporting characters as maids and men who are around as more submissive love interests, and so on. For many viewers this is the better film of the two, but for my money, I much preferred Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte. Even though my scores for the two films are close, the difference in quality for me was greater than my ratings would suggest, with Hush a 10 for much of its length--a slow, somewhat meandering middle section brought the final score down?-while Baby Jane never really rose above a 7, instead occasionally threatening to end up with an even lower score.The main problem for me was that the slow meandering that was a flaw with the middle section of Hush is the norm in Baby Jane. I'm almost never someone who believes that a film should be shorter, but this is a rare case where a lot of liberal editing--say cutting the film by 45 minutes (the film is 134 minutes long)--could easily bring my score up to a 9. Of course, it also shouldn't be necessary to fix the film at that later stage, and we might just as well blame the looseness and pacing on the script. Some viewers might also find a problem with a few logical points in the script, but I think they're explainable if we were to spend time delving into psychological backgrounds and motivations of the characters. Whatever the cause, as it stands, although there are some horror and/or thriller aspects to the film, it is really recommendable only to viewers interested in realist drama material, and even then, only to viewers who like that genre slow and relatively uneventful. (Although another point of interest to horror fans is that it's easy to see a number of at least superficial similarities between Baby Jane and Stephen King's Misery, which was made into a film in 1990.)The performances are good. Davis is exquisite enough to make me almost wish that she had only played loonies and psychos throughout her career. Crawford has the difficult task of playing a complex, understated, physically challenging role. She goes through a number of subtle transformations, and somehow manages to look beautiful even when she's black &amp; blue, bedridden and not wearing any make-up. Victor Buono, as composer/pianist Edwin Flagg, is able to convey a tragic underdog and provide comic relief at the same time, despite his relatively small amount of screen time. The performances are the crux of the film and the reason it receives as high of a score as it does. But they cannot carry the whole film. Despite a number of very good and occasionally horrific scenes, the biggest tragedy may be that film wasn't tightened up more. If you like Baby Jane at all, be sure you also check out Hush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What shall we do with the elderly ladies ? late in their careers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What ever happened to Baby Jane" is ? hands down ? the movie that had been sitting in my must-see list for the longest time. Since many years I've wanted to see this classic, and I even had the opportunity a couple of times already but it were never the "right" circumstances. I didn't want to see the film dubbed in French or via a heavily scratched and damaged disc from the local library, and thus I'm extremely happy that I patiently waited until now and saw this terrific film the way it was meant to be seen: a 35 mm format projected on a giant screen during a genre festival, in a theater full of people with a similar interest in wonderful milestone movies from the old days! And, as you can probably derive from this totally personal and irrelevant little introduction, there wasn't the slightest chance that I could remain objective during such a highly anticipated viewing experience. Right from the opening sequences, a flashback set in 1917, I instantly knew already that this one was going to get a flawless rating 10/10. "What ever happened to Baby Jane" is unique, period. It was unique, courageous and groundbreaking in 1962, and it still most definitely is unique more than 50 years later. Director Robert Aldrich's idea to cast two diva actresses that reputedly could drink each other's blood was genius and the concept of washed up elderly actresses fading away in their decaying Hollywood mansion (although predated by "Sunset Boulevard") is still the most melancholic and saddening one I've ever seen. But most of all, "What ever happened to Baby Jane" is also the most disturbing and unsettling thriller of all time, and that is largely the accomplishment of the astounding Bette Davis who depicts with "Baby" Jane what is perhaps the most psychopathic and eccentric film character in history. Joan Crawford gives an equally astounding performance, but her character Blanche is the complete opposite, namely integer and inconspicuous, and thus slightly less memorable. The Academy Award committee even shamelessly overlooked Mrs. Crawford's splendid performance, but she definitely deserved at least a nomination for best lead actress as well. Baby Jane Hudson was an incredibly talented child star in the 1910s. With her cherubic looks and her angelic voice she brought entire audiences to tears when she sang her biggest hit "I've written a letter to daddy". But in the 1930s she quickly got pushed to the bottom of the popularity lists because she wasn't mature and plausible enough for serious roles. Her sister Blanche, who stood in Baby Jane's shadows for two decades, became a massively popular star in the 1930s, but her stardom abruptly ended when she became crippled in a freaky car accident that her jealous younger sister allegedly caused. By the year 1962, they are both living in oblivion and the bed-ridden Blanche entirely relies on Baby Jane for everything. But Baby Jane grew insane and tyrannical over the years, still desperately believing in a glorious comeback and spending the family fortune that is exhausted a long time already. Jane gets madder and more dangerous every day, preventing Blanche from having kind of social contact (in spite of the attempts of their maid and neighbors) and hiring via a newspaper advert a lowlife to get her dead career back on the rails. I mentioned already that Baby Jane Hudson is arguably the most psychopathic and loathsome character in the history of (horror) cinema and that is definitely not an exaggeration! She's a self-centered, repulsive, whiny, irresponsible and downright dangerous hag, but at the same time she's also pitiable and obviously mentally unstable, so it's quite difficult to develop any kind of sentiments for her. Blanche, on the other hand, gains your immediate trust and compassion, but as the story unfolds itself more into detail, her darker side gradually comes to the surface as well. Victor Bueno's character's Edwin Flagg is fascinating as well, as he's a greedy and semi-perverted mommy's boy in search of an opportunistic escape. I don't want to sound whiny, but film characters like here in "What ever happened to Baby Jane" simply don't exist anymore nowadays. A lot of praise and recognition should also go to the people of the costume and make-up departments. Mrs. Davis was only 54-years-old around the time of shooting, but with her exaggeratedly thick layers of make-up and pathetic old baby doll costume, she looks exactly like the deranged old witch she depicts. To illustrate just how influential and relevant "What ever happened to Baby Jane", in fact, was and still is: this movie kick-started the trend/sub-genre of "Grand Dame Guignol" movies or ? slightly less flattering ? "Hagsploitation" flicks. These are movies in which deranged elderly ladies are the protagonists, and thanks to the popularity of these films, many elderly actresses who were struggling to get any film roles suddenly received plenty of offers again. Quite often they also shamelessly imitated the title of the original classic, like in "What ever happened to Aunt Alice?", "What's the matter with Helen?", "Die! Die! My Darling", "You'll like my Mother" or "Whoever slew Auntie Roo?" Bette Davis and Joan Crawford themselves also starred in many more of these "Grand Dame Guignol" movies, like "The Nanny" and "Dead Ringer" for Davis and "Berserk!" and "Strait-Jacket" for Crawford. Director Robert Aldrich teamed up with Bette Davis and Victor Bueno once more, in the almost equally brilliant "Hush? Hush, Sweet Charlotte".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful story of envy, bitterness, malice, insanity and torment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Powerful story of envy, bitterness, malice and torment.Two aging sisters, Blanche and Jane, share a large house. Jane was once a child star and Blanche was, in adult life, a star of the silver screen. Blanche's career ended when she was left paralysed from the waist down in an accident involving Jane. Now Jane looks after Blanche in the house, though not very well. Filled with bitterness at her own cinematic career never taking off, envious of Blanche's career and money, an alcoholic and a touch deranged, Jane goes out of her way to torment her sister...A very well made thriller. Starts off slowly and is more a relationship drama for a while. Over time, however, director Robert Aldrich ramps up the intrigue, tension and malice. It is soon apparent that this isn't going to be resolved simply by dialogue...Quite Hitchcockian at times in the tension and intrigue...and menacing undercurrent.Great twist towards the end and a powerful conclusion.Bette Davis is superb as Jane, providing just the right level of menace and insanity. The result is one of the scarier characters in cinematic history. Davis got her 11th, and last, Oscar nomination for her performance. Quite astounding that she didn't win.Joan Crawford is solid as Blanche, and is the perfect foil for Davis/Jane. Victor Buono puts in a good performance as Edwin and provides the movies best comedic moments. He got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an instant classic, filled with terrific (and appropriately campy) performances. Bette Davis as Baby Jane Hudson is definitely one of the scariest evil female characters ever, and her performance is chilling. Joan Crawford gives a very solid and convincing performance as well; this is no surprise, considering these are two of the most talented actors in history, and (even considering they hated each other) they had great on-screen chemistry. The scene where Jane serves Blanche her dead parakeet was creepy enough, but when it was a dead rat, it was just too much. Her evil laugh in the sequence and Blanche's reaction made it one of my favorite scenes in the film. Victor Buono was great as well, and might I add that his expressions were priceless as he played the piano to Jane's "Daddy" song. I felt really bad for Elvira though, as she was a sympathetic character. Her death was unfortunate but needed for the thriller, and Jane's childish behavior before and after doing so made it even more chilling. I'd recommend this to people who appreciate classics, and all in all a great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neurotic and Hypnotic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears to be obvious that certain movie stars displayed considerable antipathy towards one another being ruled by jealousy and simple human weaknesses. Sometimes, these feelings had an impact on the screen. There may be many films which can boast of that emotional authenticity and tensions barely acted but there is hardly any film compared to WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE by Robert Aldrich where two women are able to almost hypnotize the viewers for more than 2 hours' time.Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, as much as they hated each other in real life, deliver something unique here. Both are former stars, both used to be famous but it is only Blanche (Joan Crawford), now living a miserable life in a wheelchair who can still receive certain tokens of gratitude and admiration from some people. No one, indeed no one remembers who this Baby Jane (Bette Davis) actually was. This drives her mad...The neurotic behaviors of Baby Jane, once a star at the peak of popularity, now in absolute oblivion (which she, naturally, cannot accept), are the sole reason to see the film. Bette Davis portrays a sophisticated character of pretense, cruelty, regret, schizophrenic ambitions, unfulfilled dreams of fame and, above all, the lack of reality's awareness, perhaps caused by her alcohol addiction. In her scenes at the mirror, she appears to stick to her growth stage that she stopped at as a child and occurs to see herself still as a beautiful, sweet dolly singing for her daddy and sending kisses to his address which is heaven above. She has an acting talent as a character imitating her sister's voice on the phone. In her scenes with Joan Crawford, she is neurotically insane, cruel, pretentious, extremely bad tempered skidding on the verge of lunacy. Mind you a very brutal scene of kicking and an equally insolent moment as she gives her a rat for lunch.Joan Crawford portrays a character to be pitied. She remains calm for most of the scenes, especially those furies of her sister that she has to stand, and embodies deep suffering. One of the most unforgettable moments of hers is when she climbs down the staircase to call a doctor for help. Consider her gestures, she plays with all her body. Probably less understood near the end of the movie, Ms Crawford absolutely equals Bette Davis, which makes the two leading women deliver brilliant performances.The supporting cast are worth considering, here, primarily I mean Victor Buono as Edwin Flagg and Marjorie Bennett as his mother Dehlia. Sarcastic as it may seem, the movie here draws parallels to the best thematic concern of the time in cinema, something that prompted the desire to psychoanalyze the characters (one of the pioneers in that matter, at the time, was the Master of Suspense). Edwin is a mother's pampered boy in the true sense of the word. There is a hilarious scene as his mother calls to the advert on behalf of her son, her sweetie looking for a job, presenting herself as his secretary. Edwin appears to hate his mother, yet, she is the only person in his life and, at the same time, the one who does not allow him to commit himself in any affairs with women. Therefore, the encounter of Baby Jane as a daddy's girl and Edwin Flagg (no matter how ambitious and educated as he may seem) as mummy's boy is an emotional, dramatic, comedic highlight of the movie.It is also important to mention music score, haunting music score and the cinematography that correspond to the bunch of emotions appearing in viewers.The fascination of this film, the thrill and a bit of fear it may create have stood a test of time. What ever happened to Baby Jane is something no one seems to care but truly remarkable thing has happened to the movie, it has got richer in its thrill and effect. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just happened to come across this film on TCM during their 31 Days of Oscar celebration. I read the plot summary: A former child star torments her crippled sister in a decaying Hollywood mansion. This peaked my interest and since it was at least nominated for an Oscar (to my knowledge), it may be worth watching. And so the feature presentation began...WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is probably the most disturbing thriller I have seen thus far. The story is compelling, dark and suspenseful. Bette Davis' performance as the spoiled former child star is chilling. Joan Crawford's performance as the rising new star Blanche is a perfect contrast to Davis' Jane. Together, Davis and Crawford are perfect as rivaling sisters. The story is original, captivating and thrilling. I was glued to the screen wondering what would happen next.Overall, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is a great film full of suspense with great storytelling accompanied by amazing performances. I highly recommend watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely disturbing campy horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" is pretty damn macabre. Although Davis is frequently hilarious, she's mostly a nightmarish vision of sadistic cruelty. The scene where she cackles like a banshee, her clown face horribly contorted, after giving Blanche yet another 'inedible' dinner certainly sticks out as one of the most disturbing and iconic images of the film. The increasing amount of control Jane exerts over her helpless sister as the film progresses is terrifying and as a viewer you feel really quite claustrophobic when Blanche has a full-blown panic attack in her room, wheeling around in tight circles like some caged animal. There are so many great moments where Davis really shines it would be impossible to discuss them all here: the scene where she sings one of her hits in front of the mirror in that creepy child's voice then steps under a bright light so that her decrepit face is revealed; the freaky way she mimics Blanche on the phone to get more alcohol delivered to the house; and those first few scenes, when Jane is a bit more 'with it' (albeit with a cabinet full of empty scotch bottles), where we see that vintage Davis swagger and hear some of those caustic line deliveries (made all the more delicious, of course, by the fact that Davis and Crawford famously hated each other).Knowing just how bitter the Davis/Crawford rivalry was makes "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" all the more disturbing, and hilarious. Davis apparently kicked Crawford in the head for real in one of the more violent scenes in the film, leaving her with several stitches. Meanwhile Crawford filled her dress with weights in a scene where Davis had to drag her off a bed, causing Davis to pull the muscles in her back. As far as I know both those takes were the ones used in the film so listen out for Davis groaning as she tries to lift an unconscious and extremely heavy Crawford down the hallway.Despite Davis' brilliant performance, however, there are still a few things that let "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" down. I read a comment from someone on here recently saying that the direction is 'lumpy' and 'elephantine'. I didn't really notice this on first viewing, probably because I was so in awe of the decaying Davis, but a second watch really brought it to the fore. In a way the melodramatic music and direction suit the histrionics of the film but there's no getting away from the fact that some elements are just poorly developed and badly thought out. There are several times, for example, when Blanche could have got help. The relationship between Edwin and Jane also felt confused and underdeveloped; he's too wooden and unnatural in his actions, and more could've been made of him being an everyman looking in from the outside on Jane's insanity. As the film progresses, Edwin becomes more of a plot device than a character, used to advance and twist certain elements of the story. The sub-plot of him being a struggling musician who still lives with his mother is also pretty weak, and his relationship with his mother is not given enough attention to warrant it being included in the film. Overall a lot of the scenes with Edwin just felt like a needless distraction that took away from the morbidly fascinating relationship between Jane and Blanche.It's mindboggling that Davis didn't win an Oscar for her role in this film. I haven't seen "Dangerous" or "Jezebel" yet (the two films for which she did win an Academy Award) but "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" will take some beating. Its legacy cannot be underestimated; it's spawned numerous clones and hundreds of spoofs over the years but nothing has come close to matching it's campy horror. With all the black humour, hysteria, outrageous make-up and diva antics (both in the film and on set) it's easy to see why it has become such a cult classic in drag culture. Davis' performance is still as fresh and razor sharp as it was in 1962 and, despite a few drawbacks with direction and plot, it deservedly remains a landmark in the psycho-thriller genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Ever Happened to Such Classic Horror Thrillers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich's What Ever Happened to Baby Jane begins in 1917, where our eponymous Baby Jane Hudson is a child vaudeville star, getting all the rapturous attention for her on-stage acts. Offstage, she's a vicious brat, dominating her plain, inhibited sister Blanche and preening parents. We quickly cut to 1935 and note the sisters' reversal of fortune, with the dark, mousy Blanche blossoming into a major movie star, while Jane has been reduced to a pathetic has-been - an unbankable drunk largely due to her eccentric behavior. We then move with a cruel thud ? a hazily presented car accident - to the present day to find the now elderly sisters live in a decaying Hollywood mansion. A booze-addled and increasingly cruel Jane (Bette Davis) begrudgingly tends to a crippled Blanche (Joanne Crawford), now confined to a wheelchair due to the aforementioned accident, an incident believed to have been perpetrated by a jealous Jane who was so drunk that she can't even remember what happened that fateful night. When Jane learns that her wheelchair-bound sister is planning to sell the mansion and put her in a sanatorium, she wages a war of espionage and psychic terror against Blanche. Soon Blanche finds herself living in hopeless isolation, always nervous about her resentful, drunken sister's demented malice as Jane begins an escalating campaign of terror - intercepting her mail, cutting off all contact with outsiders and putting dead birds and rats in her meals. At the same time, Jane sets about restoring her own career by reviving the old Baby Jane character for the stage once more by enlisting the services of an ungainly lout Edwin (a wonderfully off-beat Victor Buono), a young pianist who sizes up the situation's opportunities and goes along. The film then suspensefully builds its way to a thrilling conclusion that puts a new spin on the dynamics between the two sisters.Robert Aldrich crafts a taut and chillingly hysterical horror exercise that also doubles as a Hollywood tale so bleak it makes Sunset Boulevard look all sweetness and light. The on-screen fireworks of the two lead stars were reportedly fueled by off- screen hatred, but the chemistry between the stars is unquestionably hair-raising and ups the stakes to Gothic camp shock levels. Joanne Crawford gives a quiet, remarkably fine interpretation of the crippled Blanche, held in emotionally by the nature of the role. But Aldrich hands the film to Jane's character on a silver platter without hesitation, and Bette Davis grabs it with both hands, delivering a deliciously demented performance. While Crawford wisely underplays her part, Davis chews up the scenery as one of the most bizarre, depraved villains you'll ever encounter. With the veneer of propriety stripped away, Bette Davis' Jane Hudson is a fully- fledged screen monster. Macabre and transfixing: you can smell the rotting house and relish the sweet richness of good overacting. What Ever Happened to Baby Jane is star wars, trenchantly served!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich's What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? has a suspenseful title even for people who haven't seen this movie before even though I really liked the movie I sort of felt that I have seen this before after watching Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), and Demme's The Silence of the Lambs (1991) because they are all psychological but the difference to me is the storyline, with Psycho it was about a secretary who steals a lot of money from her bank goes to the Bates motel and gets murdered by a man dressed as a woman while taking a shower, Silence of the Lambs was about a training FBI agent who negotiates with Hannibal Lecter to find a serial killer, and this movie has the perfect ingredients for it's genre. This particular movie tells the story of a psychotic former child star named Baby Jane Hudson (played by Bette Davis in an Oscar nominated performance) who tortures her crippled sister Blanche (played by Davis's bitter rival Joan Crawford) out of jealousy (because Blanch was a much better actress than Jane was) in their Hollywood mansion that is not aging well, and also their maid Elvira(played by Maidie Norman) is mistreated by Jane who about a few days after Elvira is on strike Jane puts an advertisement in the local newspaper for a free piano lessons and the particular person who gets the piano appointment is a young man named Edwin Flagg (played by Victor Buono in his film debut and in an Oscar nominated performance) in which for them it's love at first sight, until his mother tells him that Jane is trying to kill her crippled sister Blanche who stays upstairs in the bedroom 24/7 until he sees Blanche for himself and finds out that she is dying goes goes running out of the mansion to find help for her (also the maid Elvira tried the same thing and was killed by blunt force trauma to the back of the head with a single blow from a hammer). Davis (1908-1989) and Crawford (1905- 1977) gave solid performances but the only thing that i don't understand is why they didn't become friends while making this movie and stayed enemies until Crawford's death in 1977 that we'll never know the only rivalry similar to the one between Davis and Crawford was between Olivia De Havilland and Joan Fontaine (until Fontaine's death in December 2013) but the unfortunate thing between them was the fact that they were siblings. But in the end it was an excellent movie to begin with sending a message that all people aren't as nice as they seem to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond a shadow of a doubt (Hitchcock allusion intended), Bette Davis's ghastly "Baby Jane" is one of the creepiest murderesses to ever grace the screen- and her wheelchair-bound victim is none other than MOMMY DEAREST herself. It's Joan Crawford's long-winded "confession" on the beach at film's end that makes WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? a Nine instead of a Ten by my reckoning. (The same type of thing happened at the end of PSYCHO, with the psychoanalytical speech by Simon Oakland; or the laugh-out-loud ending of THE BAD SEED, where the Evil Child is actually struck by lightning, etc; filmmakers sometimes just don't know when to leave well enough alone...) (Note: Victor Buono as the "accompianist" looks exactly like Norman Bates the way Robert Bloch described him in his novel, PSYCHO, and it's always fun to see him bolt from the house upon discovery of the bound Crawford.) Robert Aldrich was one of my favorite filmmakers and this is one of his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first rate chiller starring two screen legends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich, a director primarily known for making macho action films and working with male actors, had one of his greatest triumphs as a director working with two of the greatest actresses to ever grace the silver screen in the 1962 classic Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?This bizarre and macabre absurdist vision stars the legendary Bette Davis as Baby Jane Hudson, a former child star who still has dreams of reviving a career that ended decades ago, but until then, she spends the majority of her time torturing her sister Blanche (Joan Crawford), also a former actress, who is now confined to a wheelchair. Just as Jane's menacing of her sister has reached a fever pitch, she encounters a third-rate musician named Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono)who Jane petitions to help her get her career going again and decides that with her career on the fast track again, decides she must eliminate Blanche once and for all.This film is fascinating as we finally got to watch two legendary actresses, who had never worked together before and allegedly couldn't stand each other IRL, work together for the first time and legend has it that the ladies did not get along at all during filming, but if that's true, it only worked to the film's advantage, as the characters they play are enemies, sisters, but enemies nonetheless and if these two screen icons really hated each other, they were professional enough to make this bizarre story one of the most entertaining films of 1962.Bette Davis received her tenth Oscar nomination for her performance as Jane, a performance so off-the-wall and over the top that you can't help but be alternately terrified and amused by her. Davis pulled out all the stops to make this insane character work. Joan Crawford was also nominated for an equally effective performance in the less showy role as Blanche. Crawford infuses so much internal pain into the character of Blanche but never allows Blanche's character to fade into the woodwork opposite the outrageous Jane.Watching these two cinema legends work together was a such pleasure, especially under the guidance of a skilled director like Robert Aldrich. You can't help but be in awe in watching these two work together and be reminded of everything they have done for the art of cinema, especially when both Jane and Blanche are observed watching film clips of Davis and Crawford in some of their earlier work. The black and white photography is also very effective, adding even more creepiness to the bizarre proceedings. The film was remade for TV about 30 years later with Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave, but this is definitely a case of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aged in Wood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a big hit when it was released in 1962 thanks to the prospect of watching two aging stars (who were only in their 50s!) battle it out with each other. If the project smacked of exploitation, that didn't hurt its chances at the box office. In fact, this slugfest turned out to be surprisingly better than many people might have expected.Now that the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford means little to today's audiences, what remains is a rather well-crafted, incisive study of the detritus left behind by Vaudeville, Hollywood, and those in pursuit of the dream of stardom.Davis is fearless in appearance, looking haggard and dissolute, and chews the scenery like the old pro she was. Crawford gives an uncharacteristically low-key performance that is just as cleverly calculated. Their professionalism elevates what could have been a mere stunt into something quite profound. The script cunningly incorporates clips from the two stars' earlier careers. The settings and costumes reflect the faded glory in which the sisters dwell. The third main character, Edwin, is adroitly handled by the unforgettable Victor Buono. "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" was made at a time when true artistry prevailed in all aspects of film production, which is why it holds up so well. The only weakness I find is the overall length, which can be so demanding that by the time the denouement comes, you're too beaten and worn out to fully engage it. Repeated viewings will help to unravel all that takes place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Ever Happened to REAL Actresses?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis had several phases of her career where she changed her image. Pre-1934 was her "tryout" period where she proved her metal in a series of "B" movie leads and mostly forgotten programmers that are of interest only to film historians. Post 1934 ("Of Human Bondage"), she slowly worked her way up to becoming the most successful actress in movies up to that time with only Katharine Hepburn on her trail for shear strength of the variety of characters she played. By 1950, she was still at the top, the most prized veteran star still working, and moving from contract player at Warner Brothers to freelancer, she scored her biggest success yet with "All About Eve". A variety of films and unique parts kept her name in the limelight, even if some of the movies were of mediocre quality.So what does one do in their mid 50's to keep their name in the minds of movie producers? Doan pasty white make-up, a fright wig, and kick around the other veteran still hanging in there. What comes out of it? Her tenth Oscar nomination, that's what! "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" may be considered a camp classic today, with both Davis and Joan Crawford imitated by drag queens, but back when it first came out, it gave a hope to many veteran leading ladies that they could still work in movies, even if it was in the old hag horror genre.The film starts off as a flashback with young Jane Hudson the self-centered vaudeville star, very much a "Bad Seed" like pretty little girl with the manners of a demon child. She's horrid to her mother and sister, gets everything she wants from daddy, and when vaudeville dies, she gets her come-uppance and pretty much dies as an entertainer, too. Sister Blanche (Crawford) goes onto become a very big movie star, getting her revenge, but she isn't content with just upstaging her sister.Years pass, and thanks to an accident, Blanche is in a wheelchair and Jane is a harpy who likes to get drunk while counting the mice in the cellar. When Jane finds out that Blanche intends to sell the house and possibly put her into an institution, she does all she can to stop this from happening with the goal of continuing her "career". To get her feet wet, Jane hires an assistant (the opportunistic Victor Buono) and keeps Blanche locked in her room. Suspicious housekeeper Maidie Norman and nosy neighbor Anna Lee are also involved in Jane's continuous aggravation, and all of Jane's arrested development comes out in a rage, leading to murder, ice cream cones at Venice Beach and much to Jane's delight, her presumed comeback.The pairing of Davis and Crawford was itself enough of a headline, even though their careers had crossed paths back in the mid 40's at Warner Brothers. An apparent feud has been overly disguised and embellished, and sometimes it seems like the two stars almost made it up to make things more interesting. Their differences in acting styles are very apparent, and Joan underplays her role wisely so Bette can harp it up in her scariest makeup since the ending of "Mr. Skeffington". Sometimes, though, hamming for the camera works, and Davis is completely unforgettable. Victor Buono also delivers an unforgettable performance as the bemused Edwin, with Marjorie Bennett very amusing in her few scenes as his beloved mama. To give a scary personal connection to the proceedings (considering the future), B.D. Merrill (later Hyman) plays Anna Lee's daughter. It's just too bad that Christina Crawford wasn't in there somewhere! You can't watch this film today and not think of the camp element. Director Robert Aldrich goes way in over the top to make it unforgettably macabre and melodramatic, utilizing wisely black and white photography to add to the atmosphere and unapologetic close-ups for the two stars whose careers together at this point totaled 75 years. They would go on to make some majorly bad movies (almost re-teamed in the not as camp classic "Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte") but this is what started it all, not only for them, but for Barbara Stanwyck, Tallulah Bankhead, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Gordon, Geraldine Page, Shelley Winters, Debbie Reynolds, Ida Lupino, and oh, so many others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Suspenseful Story That Captivates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of this film shares its DNA with Hitchcock's "Psycho". And it might remind you of "Misery" or "Sunset Blvd". Released in 1962, "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" is a classic in the horror genre, shot in B&amp;W and featuring two of the screen's larger legends.The film is a two-woman tour de force, with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford portraying two elder sisters who live together. Crawford is Blanche Hudson, a paraplegic who must rely upon her sister to run the household, fix her dinner, etc. Davis is Jane Hudson, the sister who was always envious of Blanche's success as an actress.It would be a shame to reveal much of the plot. Both actresses are in top form and totally committed to the suspenseful story. The filming, the score, the set--all contribute to a claustrophobic feeling that drives the action in this memorable film.</fullReview>

Of course, as with any myths, it's hard now to distinguish between what is real and what is imagined in this feud, but as for the film itself, both are amazing. Of course, this kind of material gives more for Davis to do, and she nails it. She perfectly devours and chews all of the meat off her role for everything it's worth, and it's such a joy to watch her do it. The film is also pretty great, although seeing it now, around 50 years later, you can pretty much predict the whole thing. Still, it doesn't take anything away from it.

		<fullReview>Influential and memorable thriller with Bette Davis playing a former child star who torments her crippled sister Joan Crawford. Obviously this is a classic and needs little hype. Bette's performance deservedly receives a high amount of praise. But Joan also gives a great performance, although much quieter and more subtle. Without Joan playing "straight man" so well, Bette's overt-the-top theatrics wouldn't work the way they do. This is a terrific film. It never drags and keeps your interest the whole time. This is Bette and Joan's only movie together, as they notoriously hated one another. This is also the last great movie for both actresses. Bette made a few more decent movies, particularly horror movies, for the next 20 years. But Joan only made some schlock before retiring a decade or so later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted sisters in classic 1960s nail-biter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well there certainly ain't nothing' to like about Baby Jane, that's for sure! From precocious, spoiled, all singing, all dancing brat, to hateful, spiteful, drunken, crazy woman, Bette Davis pulls off the insufferable Jane Hudson with glowering panache. She stomps, she scowls, she shouts, she rants, she simpers, she pouts and, if that weren't enough, takes great delight in tormenting and torturing her crippled sister, Blanche (whose paraplegia she caused in a drunken rage). There is nothing to touch the aging Jane with her ever so scary make up and bi-polar-esque personality. Blanche (played by Joan Crawford) is also a tour de force in this movie, but as her life is spent almost entirely 'under the thumb' of Jane, she exudes 'victim' and often a rather simpering, precious one at that, which, even if intentional, is a bit annoying to say the least. The sisters' twisted life stories have lead to their current situation with Baby Jane's career fizzling out at a very young age and Blanche's acting career taking off in young adulthood and leading to much success, fame and financial stability. Although, without question, Baby Jane, is a movie classic, watching it with a modern (and possibly jaundiced eye) one cannot but spot numerous plot inconsistencies and clunky screenplay. Why, I ask myself, would Blanche ever, have acquiesced to her bedroom being upstairs?? She's not only a blinking cripple for crying out loud, she's now an imprisoned one! Or has Blanche spent so much of her life deferring to her sister due to pity for the poor dear's failed career, nutso personality, drinking problem etc that she simply can't be assertive? . It's hard to tell, but there are certainly times when one wants to ring Blanche's neck and scream 'stop being so bloody nice to her! She's a ruddy psychopath for Chrissakes!, demand a room downstairs!'Finally, however, Blanche does wake up and smell the roses; she attempts to 'talk sense' to her demented sister about her (Jane's) 'illness' and the fact that their money is dwindling and shouldn't Jane see a doctor and stop spending so much? This sensible advice, plus Blanche's attempts at seeking help from the outside world, are the catalysts that drive Jane to ramp up her torture routine, and seek ways to bring in some cash of her own. She morphs quickly from shuffling, angry, blotto eccentric to simpering, 'controlled' (but actually madder-than-ever-woman. Blanche finally cottons on that her life might actually be in danger (about time too, you fool) but let's just say her efforts are non too successful . The ending to this movie is a tad confused, baffling and rushed, which is a shame because overall it really is a riveting horror/thriller. Both Davis and Crawford excel in their performances and it's unquestionably a 'must see' for any self-respecting movie buff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but with plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't relate the entire story, as several reviewers have done that.I will say that at best, this is a powerful psychological thriller with terrifying moments and unexpected twists.The problem for me is the exaggerated helplessness of Blanche. She is depicted as unable to use her legs, but otherwise capable, and it's the stuff she does NOT do which makes you (or maybe just me) crazy.Her bedroom window, for instance, overlooks the drive and neighbors' property so closely she could speak to anyone out there in a normal tone of voice. Alas, she never does, resorting to a dopey, wadded up message.When she finally realizes her life depends upon getting downstairs to the working phone, she could have thrown the chair down first, worked her way down, as she did, get back in her chair, and go out the front door. None of this would be simple, but otherwise-capable wheelchair-bound people learn to get themselves around and recover back into their chairs if they fall out.This would have given the character much more dimension and reality, and the viewer could believe she is both desperate and resourceful.When she does get to the phone, instead of calling for help from a friend or the police, she calls the doctor's office, which makes practically no sense, and then rambles on, incoherently, without saying she is in danger and needs help. That is by far the worst part of the movie. The following scene, in which Jane finds her, is as powerful as any in a movie of that era.These things could be fixed in the screenplay, and given them, the movie is marvelous. I absolutely bought the loony, bitter Baby Jane, played at, but not over, the top by Bette Davis. The wig and thick makeup and childish costumes work perfectly for the character.Blanche is underwritten, but Joan Crawford plays her as she is. I agree Victor Buono and his mom are superbly crafted, fascinating characters.Shooting this film in black and white, which was evidently Bette Davis' idea, is also perfect.I also loved the ending, in which Jane has completely lost touch with reality.This is a terrific movie if you can keep yourself from shouting at the screen when Blanche just keeps NOT doing anything to help herself.</fullReview>

The movie reflects how people can unexpectedly be an evil or an angel in different periods in their lives, how sometimes the attention one seeks happens finally in a very miserable way, how obsessions precludes one from reaching love and respect, how masses of people lifts an artist or a figure to a higher or a lower level without caring about the feelings. Moreover, acting is very nice and natural, and odour is almost legendary. Having abundant irritating themes which almost torture viewers throughout the movie depicts a very modest and realistic touch of art.

		<fullReview>This movie could easily have become just another corny, hokey parody, but that was not the case. Instead, this movie became yet another cinematic masterpiece for two of Hollywood's greatest players, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. Both actors deliver superb performances as two sisters embroiled in a sibling rivalry that spirals out of control. The story is excellent and the cinematography captures the grotesque nature of the sisters' twisted relationship. Sibling rivalries do occur and this movie pulls no punches in conveying in the starkest way a cruelty fueled by simmering anger and resentment. This movie dramatizes what can happen when someone loses control and rationality is replaced by overwhelming hatred. This movie is a study in emotionalism in the extreme and how it can twist an mind and cause someone to do awful things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Bette Davis only!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been enshrined as a paragon of Hollywood's most notorious divas' rivalry both on and off screen, the Davis Vs. Crawford feud, but if parrying away all the trivia and anecdotes and detaching them from their real-life images, the film itself epitomizes a fierce and taut thriller in a rarely-tapped terrain and its deceptive prelude invites us to witness a one-sided mental and physical torture between two over-the-hill broads, and buries a plausible answer in the slightly hasty but honor-bound ending, to pander for a reasonable explanation to their irrational behaviors, and director Robert Aldrich and dramaturge Lukas Heller fairly map out a melodrama- fest with B-movie mania and craziness.Betty Davis' Jane, what a performance! Sports the oversized child costume with a powdered-up makeup, thoroughly dominates the film from her very first scene to the soppy end. Naturally we all root for Crawford's wheelchair-trapped Blanche, seeing that she ostensibly is the victim of her sister who deliberately maimed her legs and now is under her abuse, it seems that Jane is scheming step-by-step a deadly murder plan which is insinuated along the story, but Davis can single-handedly alter our repulsion when her despondence and delightfulness alternatively bobs up, she is half a wicked soul and half a development-arresting baby girl, whose mindset has been permanently stalled in her heyday, when she was Baby Jane Hudson, a child starlet and the bread-winner, unlike her physically confined sister, what is trapped is her mind, such a couple of damaged goods. But when Jane's viciousness gradually excruciates and even fatally destroys poor Blanche's ultimate chance of striking back (with extra casualty included), one has to wonder what is behind the story since a mainstream film scarcely dares to veer to an unconventional track when evil actually triumphs, thereof the curiosity presides over and it persists until the final unveiling of the truth, a guilty-ridden goody-goody and a delusional spinster, it is a merciless coda, but at least it diverts the film into a morally-correct direction which grants a wider appealing and acceptance.Joan Crawford has been entirely overshadowed by Davis out of the plot's necessity, it is less a duel than a capitulated punishment; a plump Victor Buono (who also earns an Oscar nomination alongside Ms. Davis) as the only male-interloper into their lives, vividly impresses us with comic-relief nuances, also extends himself as an odd pair with Davis. Heavily scored, the film anticipates our mood turbulence precisely which can also be deemed counterproductive by overdramatizing the tension, but anyone who adore great performances should not miss this film, out of a touch of humanity, Betty Davis teaches every performer a textbook lesson - how to embody cruelness and render empathy in a perfect unison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible thriller with two wonderful actresses. A must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. What can I say about this movie? The premise is ridiculous, but it's so well conducted that it turns out this is a very good movie with a very silly plot. I admit that some of the situations are very tense, but the whole thing is so absurd that half of the time I wasn't able to take this seriously. Some of the scenes made me jump from the chair or feel very tense, while others left me with a feeling of indignation, sometimes even like the movie was mocking me with its absurdness.Joan's acting is prime, but her character is so dumb that, despite all the harassment, you won't be able to feel any sympathy for her (well, maybe in some moments you can, but most of the time you won't). Although the ending might explain some of her character's behavior, something doesn't really quite fit and it ends up looking like she's dull and apathetic for the course of the entire movie (and seeing that this is a very long movie, this is something that will bother you until the very last second). Believe or not, this is my first Betty Davis movie. Her character is clearly the most interesting, specially when you compare the two sisters. I think she nailed down her unstable and problematic character, and I enjoyed her performance very much (and I'm really eager to see more of her movies).The thing that was most displaced in the plot was the neighbor. She doesn't really have a part to play in the story (well, maybe once or twice), and I don't wish a neighbor that stupid to anyone. Overall, the acting, editing and soundtrack for this movie are really impressive, and I really don't understand how they made a plot like that into a very nice movie. This is really its biggest accomplishment, turning a very absurd and silly premise into a exciting thriller. If you watch this movie you won't regret it, and you'll see its 3 hours fly by.Rating: 7,5/10 (I round ratings down)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie even if a little lengthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying the power in the performances of both Joan Crawford and Bette Davis as they spar off each other throughout this brilliant thriller. My only complaint is that the 133-minute running time could have been cut down by trimming some of the fat off the edges.Two sisters live together in a large house in the heart of Hollywood. Ex-child star "Baby" Jane Hudson is forced by circumstance and guilt to take care of her crippled ex-movie star sister, Blanche. "Baby" Jane begins to descend into madness as she reflects on her loss of celebrity. She takes her frustrations out on Blanche in many maniacal and cruel ways. The handicapped sibling must find a way to escape the clutches of "Baby" Jane before it's too late.The black and white picture gives it a moody atmosphere it wouldn't have achieved in color. The shadows and camera angles are key to the tone each particular scene is trying to evoke. The movie stretches itself a little thin at times and could have been a bit shorter. A great ending, elegant cinematography and disturbing performances by the lead actors more than make up for that shortcoming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have to say much more than other people have said, other than it brilliantly was able to combine the disturbing, grotesque and tragic with the comical so seamlessly, OTT characters on paper made believable by the incredible performances. The script is absolute genius, as is the twist in the end. I will never forget the image of Jane Hudson dancing on the beach with 2 ice creams deluded that people still adore her. Bette Davis should have won best Oscar, but i suppose it may have been too much for the early sixties. I can think of no modern actress who could have done what she did in this film. And it is one of those movies that don't become less disturbing overtime. THATS ALL!! Just watch it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the last and best examples of the old Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently saw this gem again for the umpteenth time, and enjoyed it as much as the first. There's so much to praise here, and there is little I can say that better analysts and sharper observers haven't already said, especially about the behind the scene tensions and feuding between the two mega-stars. But I would like to add, and suggest that future viewers look for, the imaginative and innovative use of lighting as a dynamic element of the storyline. Director Aldritch cleverly did a kind of reverse film noir, with slabs of light bathing Bette Davis' mask of death makeup and decayed curls, while Joan Crawford (who should be praised for a subdued performance to accent Davis' over the top emoting) is often shot (and dressed) in various greys. The lighting (film blanc?) is a presage to the film's final denouement. Overall, the praise this film has received is well-deserved, and a kind of tribute to the last of the old Hollywood greatness before the emergence, just a few years later, of director-driven panning and editing that underlined the alleged originality of newer visions of society. WEHTBJ is one of the last shining examples of what Hollywood used to do so well, adhere to well-established and standard categories of the human psyche and explore its nuances according to standard rules of scripting and visual set up, as if everyone shared the same grounded Freudian codes that allowed the public to share the meaning of characterisation, shot setups, lighting and flashbacks (narrative development) with the craftsmen behind the cameras. Watching this film now really is watching a bit of history, and not only for the great names and great virtuoso performances involved. They really don't make films like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitter Enemies Bette and Joan at Their Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, both in career slumps and who were bitter enemies, were paired in this over-the-top dark tale of sibling rivalry and made box office history. This is the movie that started the fad of major movie stars in horror movies. With as many reviews as this has already, I don't why I'm reviewing it. But I am.Baby Jane Hudson (Bette Davis later on) was a child star and was a spoiled brat, being the center of attention and daddy's favorite. Blanche (Joan Crawford) just tries to stay out of trouble and tries to stay in good with daddy. But she can't seem to, no matter how hard she tries. Mother asks her "to please treat your sister better she's treating you now." Fast forward: the sisters are older and movie actresses, but Jane is an alcoholic too. But for every film Blanche makes, she makes the studio give a film to Jane to star in, even though she stinks. (We see Bette and Joan in real movies they made in their early years.)Then a mysterious accident happens. One of them runs over the other who had to get out and open the gate to the grounds.Fast forward again, present day: we see Bette Davis and Joan Crawford older with Joan in a wheelchair. She depends on Jane for everything, but there is much bad treatment that goes with it. A lot of what could have been is involved here, as we are allowed to see by the end of the film what really happened in the accident. The unpleasantness does hamper one's enjoyment of the film, but the acting of the pros is incredible, especially Joan, who incidentally didn't take a salary but took some of the gross profits. When Bette heard this, she hit the roof. But in a small way, she got revenge with an Oscar nomination when they were announced.Costarring Anna Lee and Victor Buono, this is a ground-breaking film that is simply one of the best of its kind. I would recommend "Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte" too. What happens to Baby Jane and Blanche? See for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>over the edge, NOT the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who calls Bette Davis' terrifying yet heartbreaking portrayal of Baby Jane Hudson "over the top" either knows nothing about acting or was made so uneasy by her performance that they must try to trivialize it into something from which they can distance themselves. The spoiled child star Baby Jane is over the top, but only because the on-stage Baby Jane is a grotesque contrast to the willful brat that is the real Jane Hudson. But the grownup (or at least aging) Jane as portrayed by Bette Davis is a character over the edge, steeped in unbearable truths--liquor-soaked, vicious, old, jealous, terrified and above all, so lonely. This is a movie about needing to be seen, yearning for love and living with the acid knowledge of being utterly forgotten. Blanche needs to be seen, too, for the same reason Jane does--to save her life. Watching Jane slowly dismantle all of Blanche's links to the outside world makes for a harrowing two hours.And still it's very funny in spots. My mother, never one to be put off by the macabre, used to howl with laughter at some of Jane's juicier antics. I'd be peeking through my fingers and sleepless for the next week, so disturbed was I by this movie, but even a chicken like me could see the dark humor of Victor Buono's hatred for his slatternly mother or his ill-concealed revulsion when he first encounters Jane in person, Jane's pitch-perfect imitation of her sister while on the phone to the liquor store, the obscenities that she mouths under the insistent, piercing ring of Blanche's summoning buzzer, the appalling number of drinks Jane knocks back on an average day, and on and on. Chilling and hilarious, sad and ultimately compassionate, "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sisters Tearing Each Other To Pieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich's adaptation of Henry Farrell's novel 'What Ever Happened To Baby Jane' is an exceptionally crafted disturbing psychological thriller. It's been often mislabeled as a 'horror' flick but that's just wrong. 'What Ever Happened To Baby Jane' explores sibling rivalry at its most extreme that, in this case, forces two sisters to shred each other apart.While there's always an air of tense and creepy atmosphere, there's plenty of black comedy that support the depth of the writing. Many have claimed that the film didn't 'age' well but I disagree to that because it had me hooked and I had not seen the final twist coming. The story is full of layers. Many of the twists and turns may have been used in numerous thrillers that were made thereafter but 'What Ever Happened To Baby Jane' manages to maintain its element of suspense.Many have mentioned that Bette Davis's acting was over the top. I couldn't disagree more. She successfully gave the impression of a washed out faded actress whose bitterness and alcoholism reeks of failure but at the same time she tries to hold on to that 'star' image. What's also disturbing is the way Jane's sociopathic personality is displayed. Even after some 40 something years, in her mind she's still Baby Jane. That arrogant, spoilt little child star who has never grown up and who blames her sister for stealing her stardom. Davis is simply amazing. Her chilling rendition of 'I Love You Daddy' is scary to say the least.Joan Crawford is one of my favourite actresses of the time and her Blanche is a contrast to Davis's Jane. She definitely gives the feel of a concerned sister who, at the same time, is terrified of her and helpless because of her own handicap. The spellbinding Joan Crawford plays her part with grace.Both actresses were very believable as sisters and it is they very much carry the film. Frank DeVol's music is very good. The interior of the Hudson sister's mansion is also well designed as it adds to the characters' personality.For me, 'What Ever Happened To Baby Jane' is right up there with classics like 'Psycho', 'Charade' and 'Arabesque'. It's probably one of the most disturbing thrillers of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of the macabre that has aged beautifully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films that were great back at the time of their release don't fare so well when watched many years later. Films that were seen as, for lack of a better, cool at the time are kind of cheesy or dated by today's standards. This is true of a lot of Horror films. Some of the classics like the Universal monster movies and others like 'Rosemary's Baby' may be tame by now, but because they were so beautifully done at the time they have held up very well. Others like 'The Legend of Hell House' don't hold up nearly as well, though that one is still pretty good. 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?' is of the tradition of Grand Guignol, a sadly neglected theatrical movement. It was a hit then with critics and audiences, but how does it hold up today nearly fifty years since it's release? Pros: Dynamite performances by the two stars and good work by the supporting cast. Great concept. Brilliant screenplay. Director Aldrich does a masterful job of creating and maintaining suspense. There's also a great deal of tension. A grand score. Beautiful, crisp cinematography. After a slow start, the pace moves along steadily and there's never a dull moment. Quite creepy and there's no shortage of disturbing goings on.Cons: At times predictable.Final thoughts: Having grown up on modern Horror it's refreshing to go back and visit a classic such as this. It truly is a shame that films of this kind are hardly made anymore because this one is truly a knockout. I like blood and gore in Horror as much of the next person, but that can only go so far. Real Horror is watching someone go completely mad and harm those around them.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Davis and Crawford Make it a Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)*** (out of 4)Classic thriller (not horror) has two legendary rivals appearing in the same film and this gimmick is the main reason to watch. The has-been Baby Jane (Bette Davis) runs over his sister (Joan Crawford) after she becomes the biggest star in Hollywood. Thirty years later the two are still living together but Baby Jane has decided she wants to have a comeback and keeps the crippled sister locked up in her room, slowly killing her. This is one of those legendary films that I stayed away from for quite a while and I must say that I was rather letdown as "The End" came up. This is certainly an entertaining film but after hearing all the hype I can't help but call it overrated. With that said, there are a couple great things here but I personally can't overlook some rather lackluster direction and a screenplay with one major plot hole after another. I'll start with the screenplay, which is so far fetched that it was hard for me to take any of it too serious. As a thriller the film doesn't work because to me there wasn't any suspense due to all the plot holes. I can't help but wonder why no one seems to ever check on the crippled sister after thirty years. I can't help but think why the sister didn't tell her friend, the maid, to get the police or some type of help. I can't help but wonder how no one would be suspicious of what's going on with the weird Baby Jane. I believe in suspending some common sense for a movie but this one here asks way too much. I also didn't believe any of the nonsense dealing with Baby Jane's comeback and the mama's boy who comes to the house and expands the running time. I personally could have done without any of this and I think the editing running time wouldn't have hurt. Even the ending at the beach, the crippled sister is sitting there among dozens of people and yet no one notices her? With that out of the way, the two stars make this a classic and they're the main reason to watch this. For years I had heard about the "ugly" Bette giving an over the top performance but I must admit that I thought she was quite straight. Sure, she's crazy but that's what she's playing. I didn't think she was over the top and to me she was just playing a truly nutty character who does one crazy thing after another. The song and dance Davis gives is classic as is the scene where she begs the near dead Crawford for help. Crawford doesn't get the flashy role but she too is very memorable as the tortured sister. The B&amp;W cinematography is top-notch and the music score is nice but those things aren't going to bring people to this film. It's going to be Davis and Crawford and those two deliver the goods and made way for the "psycho old women" genre, which the couple would take part of for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only ever seen two movies with Bette Davis: What ever Happened to Baby Jane? and The Nanny. And in both I have to say she is positively scary in a very real way. Its not just her appearance, it is the way she so deeply seem to enter the deranged minds of the characters she is playing. There is no blood or guts involved. No ghosts or gruesome visuals. Just a very very very scary deranged woman. She had already turned my stomach with fear in The Nanny and I have to stay that while both are amazing, Baby Jane is definitely a step further from The Nanny. In the end, the Nanny was a a good woman who lost it after going through two traumatizing events on the same day. But Baby Jane is as evil as she is mad and sinks deeper and deeper into true horror. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Occasionally TOO over-the-top, but quite good, and very entertaining. If you are a Bette Davis fan, and hate Joan Crawford with a passion (No, I don't wish to ignite all those Bette Vs Joan threads again!), then this is the film for you. Not only does Bette, as the former child star of the title turned alcoholic maniac, get to bound and gag her famous enemy, but she gets to serve her "din-dins" in the shape of a rat. It's all a heck of a lot of campy fun, but also disturbing too, as we see just how fame and jealousy has ruined the two sisters. Robert Aldrich was obviously very inspired by "Sunset Boulevard" in making this film, which has Davis and Crawford living in a decayed old Hollywood mansion together, with Davis attempting a pathetic comeback to stage stardom. The lurking shadows and grotesquerie amped up by Aldrich remind me very much of "Sunset". Davis one-upped Crawford by bagging an Oscar nomination for a performance that only she could make great. When Bette is bad, she's so damn awesome to watch! Crawford, with those ghastly eyebrows, seems to be begging the audience for pity as the wheelchair bound Blanche, but she never elicited pity from me. Maybe because I know Joan better?! The final revelation on the beach really wasn't surprising for me, but the beach scene is effective because it's one of the few exterior-lit scenes in the film and brings all the dirty secrets out into the light of day. Like I said earlier, it's sometimes too OTT, and it has some problems with pacing, but on the whole it's nice work. Victor Buono is also very effective as the creepy, would-be musician whom Davis thinks will assist her comeback</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there are some moments of sheer absurdity, there are many more of sheer mayhem in this clas-sick thriller."Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" is on many levels an old school Hollywood film. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford display a genuine disdain for each other in this psychological horror in some memorably upsetting scenes.Look for Bette Davis feeding Crawford a dead bird, a rat, kicking the living crap out of her and slapping her around some in a drunken, envied frenzy. It was amazing.A few questions though: When Blanche is up in her room, how come she can't yell to the neighbors out of the open window, but when Jane is leaving the house to go to the bank, she calls out after her? That just made no sense to me. Also, when Jane finally gets to the phone, why does she call a DOCTOR and not the police? Again, implausible.The coolest thing about this flick is the twist at the end, I for one did not see it coming. All in all a brilliant film and I recommend it to horror movie buffs. There are moments that will no doubt freak you out.8 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Very Entertaining &amp; Absorbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all that more recent movies have taken similar themes much further, and for all that it does have a few flaws, "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" is still as entertaining as ever, and it still offers an absorbing story that also provides a few insights into human nature. The period settings in the first part of the movie still work well, and the (then) contemporary setting still feels current, excepting only the kinds of technological details that would now be different.The off-screen tensions between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford no doubt added to their portrayals of their characters, and most of the time it seems to have brought out the best in their acting. There is real tension, dislike, and fear between the two sisters, and it gives weight to even the most minor of their confrontations.The two main characters are also very interesting in themselves. Jane and Blanche both have shortcomings that are common to many of us; they simply have them to an exaggerated degree. Jane's emotional inability to live in the present and Blanche's false sense of outward control also make for a good contrast. The supporting cast is solid, but except perhaps for Victor Buono's oddball character they are usually only there for Davis and Crawford to play off of.The story is imaginative, and it nicely combines familiar elements with some clever turns. Objectively, it is probably a little too long, but the weird world that it creates is so interesting and believable that there's really no rush at all for it to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has some surprisingly good camera work by Ernest Haller, who often makes the most out of scenes that could have been workaday, some exceptional scenes of dialogue between the two screen titans, and some well and judiciously placed scoring, by Frank DeVol. There are some trite scenes and moments, as well as some repetitive scenes. For the former, see the murder of Elvira, where the viewer just knows that when she lays down the hammer she has doomed herself to a braining by Jane. For the latter, see the scenes showing Jane taking Blanche out of their home in a wheelchair- just as she had with Elvira's corpse. Also, the scenes with the sisters' neighbor, played by Anna Lee, add nothing. Another annoyance are several scenes where Blanche and Elvira are 'racing against time' to do things before Jane returns in her car, but are things which would take only a few seconds to accomplish versus the reality that Jane's errands would take her far longer to accomplish. This missynchronicity rents the 'realism' that the film, by and large, hues to.But, other than that, this film largely succeeds, and rises well above the claims of campiness that have dogged it. What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? is not great filmmaking, but it is not a B film, nor schlock. From the obsquiouusness of Buono's Flagg to the taut fear and control neediness of Crawford's Blanche to unexpected shots that subvert expectations, the film has simply terrific moments that derivative films that followed it, like Aldrich's later Davis vehicle, Hush?Hush, Sweet Charlotte or Rob Reiner's Stephen King penned ripoff, Misery, cannot touch. My recommendation is that anyone coming to the film, for the first time, avoid reading too much about it, as well as any of the volumes written about Crawford's and Davis's egoistic battles, and just let What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? wash over them. Yes, many people will, like critics and fans, imbue their own misinterpretations into the film. But, for that small group of people with a clear mind and an appreciation for great things, even if sandwiched between mediocre moments, the film will be a revelation whose joys reach into not only one's heart and wit, but also into one's mind, that place where humanity begins and ends. Just ask Blanche Hudson. Da Lady done knows!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What ever happened to movies like this ? ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They don't make films like this anymore" ? definitely! Today, even the most despicable female villains must be sexy enough to compensate their lack of morality, what do they call that? Redeeming qualities? Three-dimensionality? I don't know ? I don't dislike it either, but it became such a cliché now that I really miss these old-school villains, over-the-top and hateful enough to be feared but played with a convincingness that makes you take them very seriously. And 'Baby' Jane Hudson is one of these villains that you can never forget ? My experience with the Hudson sisters' story is quite peculiar, I saw the TV version first when I was 11, I wasn't traumatized but that was a close one, and even though I saw the movie only once, I've never forgotten some particular scenes, nor did the creepiness of Baby Jane's face fade in my memory ? this ugly make-up, this weirdness that contrasted with Blanche's personality ? well, I was disturbed and I was probably more scared of Baby Jane than any other villain, she was creepy in every meaning of the word ?And then, cinematic maturity growing on me, I knew this was only the TV remake starring two real-life sisters, which I thought made the film stronger and more believable ? but that was until I learned that the original starred two rivals, two legendary actresses that notoriously hated each other. So if the first (which was the second) interaction was driven by love, in the 1962 classic, it was a hatred so convincingly disguised as love that you wonder if it was not a true sisterly hatred disguised as love in the film. Not that it adds a level of complexity, but it's a fascinating aspect that sure elevated this film to its cult status: Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, two stars whose rivalry is the only thing that opposes them with (however) the same level of vanity that makes them so bitchily appealing.And Jane is sure a bitch with a modern authenticity delightfully combined with campy 'Disney-esque' manners; it's a real-life Cruella, Evil Queen, Medusa that would have scared the hell out of everybody if she wasn't so heart-breaking in her lucid moments. Baby Jane is a tragic figure and the story is about a victim who's not necessarily Blanche, the crippled sister, and an evilness that doesn't just inhabits Jane's twisted mind. The real and forgotten antagonist of the film is time, this implacable enemy that transforms the most beautiful creature into a hideous scarecrow, the cruel passing of time that contaminates hearts with the same cruelty. And time is so unfair it doesn't annihilate youth with the same zealous attention.While Blanche maintained a bit of beauty and dignity, Jane, the fictional Shirley Temple of an era so prehistoric women wore hat high enough to bother the audience, drowned the loss of her stardom in an alcoholic ocean, prematurely ravaging her face until becoming the shadow of herself. The lost beauty is symbolized by that ugly doll with a broken face: was she already ugly or did that deformation make her so? In Jane's case, her soul was precociously ugly and time didn't help. So the solution was to freeze her image into the eternal figure of a little child. Jane was a star as a Baby, and she would forever be Baby Jane.And the memories of this lost Golden Age are incarnated by the blue look of this doll whose cynical immobility reminds of an era that will never exist anymore. This fatality is the torment that poisons Jane's heart with jealous bitterness commanding to sequestrate her sister in their mansion. Blanche will carry Jane's grief for her whole crippled life. These considerations contribute to form one of the most appalling villains ever, a woman so tortured that her only way of expression could be a sort of unconsciously sadomasochistic torture: sadistic, because as sisters, Blanche had to suffer as much as Jane think she did, and masochistic, because she made herself ugly living in the false hope that the good old days would be back.And this is where the troubles start. As if her evil nature wasn't enough, Jane developed the ambition to resurrect Baby Jane Hudson, a myth nourished in her mind so long it disconnected her from the reality where Baby Jane Hudson sunk into oblivion as soon as she revealed her spoiled personality. These signs of craziness, mixed with cruelty make an explosive cocktail that will ultimately draws a progressive feeling of claustrophobic paranoia, like a "Misery" in black and white. This paranoia we start sharing through the eyes of Joan Crawford as Blanche Dubois, so venerable it highlighted the ugliness of Jane, and so vulnerable, it made the bitch scary.How ironic that the actress that acted more a la Baby Jane in the context of the Awards ceremony following the film, was Crawford ? not that Davis was a victim, but sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction. And in this case, it perfectly served the film by transcending the suspension of disbelief. We believe in this antagonism because it existed, and we believe in this madness because of the setting's incredible realism and the way it didn't try to glamorize the two characters. And maybe it didn't because they were not that glamorous after all, not at that time anyway. This is a heavy film that carries so many hidden realities that it sure takes more than one viewing to enjoy it ?And the irony is that Robert Aldrich distorted a deep psychological drama into an entertaining thriller that flirted with horror through such simple tools as a buzzer, a phone or stairs ? the thrills are enough to appreciate and enjoy the film, but the love-and-hate relationship is just the extra push that made this film a classic thriller and a masterpiece ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The winner by a knockout......The viewers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this film in ages,so it was with some trepidation that I watched it with my better half recently.Would it be dated?Would it seem boring?No,it is a cracking film and holds up very well today.We all know that there was this intense rivalry between Bette and Joan,but this just makes the film more compelling.You are constantly trying to find signs,little details really,about their apparent loathing for each other.So who comes out tops?An honourable draw I'd say.Bette Davis has by far the more showy part and boy does she relish it.She may chew on a pretty thick slice of ham at times,but her performance glues you to the screen.By contrast,Joan Crawford underplays her role as the wheelchair bound Blanche and this makes for a well balanced film with many terrific scenes.I won't give anything away here,but though the film may seem a little twisted,there are still parts of the film that may shock.It Isn't all about the two stars as Victor Buono scores as a slightly camp piano player and he reminded me a lot of Oliver Hardy in his build and mannerisms.This film should really be in the top 250 and it amazes me that it Isn't.Two Hollywood greats in fierce competition makes this a gem of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever Did Happen to Baby Jane Hudson? ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in anything she did, the late Bette Davis proved herself to be adept to horror.As the long-washed up child actress, Baby Jane Hudson, Davis pulled no punches in creating a memorable brilliant characterization which led to still another Oscar nomination. It is said that Davis was extremely disappointed when she lost the award.She does so well in terrorizing her invalid sister played with an anguish by Joan Crawford. What the made the movie so good was that in real life, Davis and Crawford loathed each other and they took this hatred out on the silver screen as well.Throwing her sister down and serving her a rat is all in Davis's master plan to do evil. Her rendition of "I've Written A Letter to Daddy" is memorable.Gothic horror beautifully realized by an ever effective Davis with remarkable support by Crawford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette and Joan, Joan and Bette - this movie is a classic! Every part of the picture works in concert with the others - the actors are truly fascinating, the set is perfect, the theme of neglect - all are portrayed with finesse.So many great things come from this film - the trudging up the stairs of Jane three times a day, every day of the year carrying heavy silver service meals - the fact that Blanche's movies are shown on TV and are hailed while Jane's movies languish in the dust bins - well, it goes on and on. There is not a moment that isn't fascinating in this film. The public feud between Davis and Crawford just adds to the portrayal of two women who are thrown together day after day after day.This is surely one of the Top 10 movies of all time - a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie, I can watch again and again is my criteria for a great film!! Baby Jane('62), fits that category... I enjoyed when first opened in theatre, and am enjoying repeatedly on video. Bette Davis mastered this role... She should have won her 3rd Oscar for it..Crawford was excellent also in the more sympathetic role of Blanche...The entire cast worked very well !!Don't take it seriously just sit back and enjoy. The behind the screen stories of this film are now Hollywood legend. I wish I could have been a fly on the wall of the Baby Jane set...Can't wait to watch again, I need a good laugh ! Its 10/12/01, and Antrhrax is all over the news...This is the diversion I'll need tonight, and I recommend for others as well</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never seen Joan Crawford act, and in fact, my only exposure to her was Faye Dunaway's portrayal of her in MOMMIE DEAREST, I caught this flick on American Movie Classics and after 5 minutes was absolutely enthralled by her performance! I had read her daughter's book as well, and thought that Joan was just an off-the-wall screwball, but no more! I still feel that she was a little off center, but her acting in BABY JANE was absolutely flawless! I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie, and will look forward to seeing it again. I am now looking forward to the next Joan Crawford movie I come across. BABY JANE is a definite, absolute Classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but riveting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite movies, a camp classic. On the surface it's a thriller, but deep down it's a homage to failure, a poignant ode to all the forgotten and washed up people that litter our big cities. Baby Jane is a rotten cookie, a faded star. She has no friends, no future, and is full of bitterness and envy. This film is much more effective than "Sunset Boulevard". I like its everyday atmosphere, its trivial aspects: a trip to the bank, the maid getting a day off, the fat piano teacher, icecream at the beach. The nightmare and the beautiful dream mingle. The writing is very fine, unpretentious and unobtrusive. There is no standard theatricality. Money figures prominently. In today's world, it is the life-blood without which nothing can be accomplished. Everything and everybody must be purchased. Smiles and compliments require hard cash. There are no loyalties, no affections. Pure alienation. Yet we don't get sociology, we get art. What makes the film beautiful is its freedom from agenda or comment. It just invites you to stare at life's gargoyles, and challenges you to find the beauty in it. Yes, there is beauty even here. This is one of the most beautiful films ever made, visually ravishing. The black and white is very effective. The film's surprise ending reverses the moral situation. Thus moral parity is achieved, and a beautiful transcendence. I have no idea how far writer and director intended this deeper meaning, but intentions don't matter. The film is far from flawless. It has plenty of scenes one is tempted to cut, particularly the first half hour showing baby Jane as a child and young woman. I would also cut the scene in which the pathetic pianist talks with his mother. It is irrelevant to the plot, though highly comical. And the violence could also be removed as gratuitous. But if one starts tampering with this crooked film, it falls apart. Enjoy it's weirdness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knowing that this had the "Camp Classic" status, I knew I had to see it, and I was not dissapointed. Davis is at her campiest as Jane, who tortures her sister(Crawford), when she has to take care of her, Jane was a former child star, who had the spotlight stolen by her sister. Great direction by Robert Aldrich(The Dirty Dozen), and a haunting score add to the thrills. Its a little overlong, but still great. Fans of movie classics will love this entertaining and thrilling film. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess we can tell it now, but the story goes that what caused Joan Crawford to turn on her kids was that she wanted Bette Davis as her love and when Davis ignored her presents that she sent to her, she went on a rampage, not only everyone around her, but her kids as well! Even B.D. admits to Crawfords feelings for Bette in her autobiography "My Mothers Keeper"! So, the way this movie started out to be made has many versions, but one of them was that Crawford always wanted to work with Davis so when she found this book "Whatever Happened To Baby Jane", she immediately visited Davis when Davis was playing on Broadway in Night of the Iguana. So, in marches Crawford into Davis's dressing room, and Davis, impolitely says, "I'm in a hurry to leave the theater. What do you want?" And Crawford says, "Darling! I've always wanted to work with you, and I've found this story and it's wonderful! It's perfect for the two of us. Please read it and let me know what you think?" So, as Crawford glides through Davis' dressing room door; Davis says to herself, "This woman is full of it" which is the closest thing that I can write here as to what she really said, but she picks up the book and on a train she reads it, and when finished Davis says to herself, "Well, it might work! It's all there! Crazy Bette; phony Joan!" So, Davis contacts Robert Aldrich; Peter Lawford gives up his role to Victor Bono because Lawford was involved romantically with someone in the Kennedy family, and the rest is history! So, Bette Davis is on the Johnny Carson show one night stating that Warners wouldn't take a chance on those to has-been old broads and Crawford writes a note on brown stationary with brown ink to please not refer to her as an old broad and later Davis relates this on another one of Carsons show, laughing, and saying that Crawford has lost her sense of humor! There was another incident where Davis called Crawford a movie star and that she, Davis, was the real actress, and Crawford commented back, "I'm not an actress and she is? Take away her clipped speech, the bugged eyes, and the puffing on the cigarettes, and what do you have?" Unfortunately, the games between them kept on going until Crawfords death, and when Bette Davis heard of Crawfords passing, she said, "Well, they say you should say something good about someone when they die - - - So, Joan's dead? Good!" We will never see the likes of these two again, and they are the perfect example as to why I've said, over and over, there are no more of these wild, creative, off the wall genius' like these two in the movies; and there never will be! They are the ones who made and created Hollwood for the actors and actresses in the future. We owe them a great deal of thanks, respect, and admiration! Hail! To Bette and Joan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent classic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sixties were responsible for many of the classic horror films that are still highly revered today; and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is certainly one of them. Playing out with all the tenacity of the American classics of the golden era of Hollywood cinema; the film is a resounding classic all the way. And what else could a film that features the awesome talents of two of the greatest actresses to ever live be? Joan Crawford and Bette Davis take the lead roles as a pair of sisters. Bette Davis plays Jane Hudson; a former child star (once known as Baby Jane Hudson) who was eclipsed by her sister Blanche (Joan Crawford) as she got older. After a terrible car accident (that may or may not have been 'an accident') that left Blanche crippled, the two sisters have been forced to live together in Blanches house. Blanche lives as a prisoner in all but title, in the upstairs bedroom, and all this time alone with only someone she hates for company has ensured that Jane isn't feeling very well mentally.The film is very melodramatic throughout, but this doesn't hinder the film as although it could have done so in the realism stakes - it doesn't, and it actually adds to the madness and horror of the tale. The film echoes the likes of The Apartment and Sunset Blvd on numerous occasions, and it's nice to see the atmosphere that those films breathed being moulded onto the frame of a horror movie. It's the stars that are real highlight of this movie, however; and both the leads are incredible. Bette Davis is repulsive as the nightmarish Baby Jane. She really lets you buy into her performance and it's easy to believe that the woman on screen really is the aging actress that she is portraying. Joan Crawford has less to do, but she is still excellent in her role as the crippled sister of the pair. My only slight gripe with the film is the ending, which seems to take a little bit too much from Sunset Blvd and offsets the originality and suspense of the film thus far. It just seems out of place. Still, this is a first rate horror movie and one that fans of classic film will no doubt enjoy. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting in this film about an abusive, sadistic relationship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie from 1962 is a highly suspenseful thriller based on a longstanding sibling rivalry that descends to the level of an abusive relationship. The two characters are the Hudson sisters, played by Bette Davis as Jane and Joan Crawford as Blanche, who in life were movie icons going back to the 1930's. The hatred of Jane towards her disabled sister Blanche is so intense that the audience is left gripping their seats from one sadistic scene to another. Davis is outstanding as the alcoholic sister, now faded from childhood stardom, who takes comfort as the perpetrator of evil and Crawford exhibits an intense fear and loathing of a sister who is bent on a continued pattern of psychological torture and violence. Hollywood insiders say this is really about a true life rivalry between the two stars. If so, I can appreciate the extra edge it seems to have given to their acting. The film-making seems to alternate from a dark, dinghy house to the sunshine of the outdoor scenes and the well landscaped Art Deco houses of the neighbourhood where the sisters reside. When the story moves outside we feel relief to get out of the prison that Blanche inhabits. This contrast works nicely with the sepia toned film I saw on TCM. The black maid Elvira, played by Maidie Norman, tried to rescue the Blanche character as she realized the extent of the abuse Blanche was suffering. Her character was a strong note of humanity in the otherwise sad and macabre plot. Victor Buono, who is hired as a piano player for Jane, delivered a capable performance as the Mamma's boy, who is quite ready to put up with Jane's sorry singing routines for some ready cash. All in all, the movie delivers a great story of the faded glory of a childhood star, her alcoholic decline and her sadistic backlash against her sister. It's a great movie but once seen is enough; it's not one I'd care to revisit anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I knew I was in for some good acting when I decided to watch whatever happened to baby Jane, I mean Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. I'm not a huge Joan Crawford fan, really because of the woman she was in real life and the kind of mother she was, but I must say that her performance here is good, and boy so is Bette Davis's. Davis was not afraid to show her ugly side in baby Jane, and she sure did show it well! The chemistry between Crawford and Davis is electric and it really works well in the movie. The costume design is great, and academy award winning I might add. The writing is rather impressive too, the writing really shows janes crazy side, and it makes it blatantly obvious exactly what makes her go absolutely crazy. Seeing her sister Blanche excel in her acting career and her own film career burning out played the major factor is Jane Hudson's snap. I think this film is directed and filmed beautifully too, the camera angles are impressive, especially for 1962. Baby Jane has a couple slow spots, and the pacing is off on a couple places, but overall it's not a huge issue. With all of that considered I give whatever happened to baby Jane a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie years ago when i saw an episode of The Simpsons called "Smart and Smarter" which involved, Lisa as Baby Jane and Maggie as Blance. Since then, I have been wanting to see the movie for years but with thanks to Putlocker, I was finally able to watch it as I wasn't able to watch it until tonight!I really thought the film was quite sad and frightening at the same time. I honestly didn't know what to expect with Baby Jane, man I'm glad she ain't my sister otherwise I would be screwed already! I found it quite horrible that she left her sister to die. It really makes your hands tighter with anger, it's a very cruel thing to do to another human being! They should've talked like normal adults and sort it out but you know, it does reflect on real life. You would feel very angry at the person effected and also angry that you weren't successful in your career! What I found even more shocking with Baby Jane was, she killed the housekeeper with a hammer. I wonder where she put her and I wonder if the unconscious Blance was alive when the police found her lying in the sand? It raised so many questions in the end that I would've loved if the movie was running a little longer to find out what really happened! I'm so happy I finally got to see this film, it's just an excellent thriller and I bet Alfred Hitchcock was jealous that he didn't get this movie because it is just a masterpiece! I give this a 9/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a tour De force. Joan Crawford and Bette Davis play aging sisters who were former Hollywood stars and now live in the same house. Davis who was the lesser star always bullies her wheelchair bound sister. And pretty soon you sense that the bullying is pretty sinister and not everything is all right between the sisters. Their maid who is sympathetic to Crawford offers to help but is staved off by Davis and so are the nosy neighbors. And there is an interesting revelation at the end This is one hell of a disturbing film and its aged very well (it was made in 1962). I was pretty spellbound right from the beginning when they show the childhood of the two actresses. Man, the kid who played the young Davis was downright creepy.Highly recommended.(9/10) this kid and her dad are pretty creepy too. wonderful casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A toxic relationship between two siblings vying for appreciation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" is a chilling suspense thriller directed by Robert Aldrich in 1962 starring Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Davis, who plays a forgotten child star, "Jane Hudson", jealously terrorizes her sister Blanch, played by Joan Crawford, who eventually enjoyed her own rise to fame while her sibling failed. The film builds a collection of memories and events between the two sisters that play out and resolve in the present time, and in some of the most unpleasant of ways as well. What stood out to me the most in this film is its particular style of mise-en-scene, the flow of time throughout separate scenes, and the depth of the characters' motives and intentions.The two sisters live together in a house that, given both of their state of minds, is difficult for us to know for sure how they got there. This becomes just another one of the many piffy disputes that occur between the two sisters, and they only get worse from there. We get a feel for the setting with the particular placement of the camera in each room, particularly the front room with the stairs. From there we see that Blanch, who is now crippled in a wheelchair from a car accident a few years ago, is helplessly trapped in the upstairs half of the house, while Jane is mostly brooding around downstairs, creating a sharp divide that constantly keeps you on edge. Later in the film, Blanch tries to call for help from her doctor while Jane is away. After having the phone in her room disconnected by Jane in a psychotic frenzy, the only phone for Blanch to use is downstairs. This is where she's met with an insurmountable obstacle, the stairs. I thought this was a perfect use of mise-en-scene, as it uses the most crucial aspect of the set to create a highly suspenseful and dramatic scene.The film does a lot of jumping around in some scenes. One thing that remains consistent during them is the flow of time. Two scenes will be happening simultaneously, and this creates a building suspense as time flows continuously, leading up to both separate scenes meeting in a climax. An example of this is when Blanch calls for her doctor. The whole time she makes her way to the phone, the film cuts to a scene of Jane making her way closer to home. It shifts back and forth, showing each event that brings Jane closer to coming in discovering Blanch making the call. This is one of the main aspects of the movie that creates the most suspense.I thought the development of the characters was pretty unique as well, as throughout the movie it's apparent that Jane despises Blanch, and I started to feel sorry for Blanch over time, although the twist towards the end reveals that both sisters are just as evil as each other, making it hard to call either of them a protagonist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Baby Jane is hilarious in a black humor way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich seems to like automobile accident scandals in Hollywood (The Big Knife). I don't think this movie was intended to be funny but there are definitely light touches like the piano player.So, there must be something wrong with my twisted black humored mind but I found Betty Davis (54) hilarious in this role as a boozing delusional demented psychotic. She is dressed up like a child star with grotesque amounts of makeup on. She clearly makes the movie.Betty Davis(54) as Baby Jane and Joan Crawford (56) as Blanche play sisters holed up in a Hollywood house after Crawford becomes a hemiplegic in a car wreck. Baby Jane was a child star who couldn't make it in talkies but her jealous sister Blanche made it big until a paralyze inducing accident "caused by Baby Jane" left her in a wheelchair at the height of her career. For 30 years after the accident Baby Jane becomes increasingly delusional and mentally unbalanced as she cares for wheel chair bound Blanche. She believes she caused the accident. In the final denouement Joan Crawford confesses that she caused the accident Baby Jane was blamed for. She then apparently dies.Crawford seems to play against character as the understanding spineless elder sister until we find out the monstrosity she has caused by her lies. In the final denouement Crawford confesses to causing the accident that crippled her.It is suspenseful and fun moves well but as I said I most enjoyed having a laugh at Baby Jane and the piano player. A lot of horror movies have an underlying black humor to them.I saw this movie when I was about 14 but remembered nothing and indeed expected it to be a horror movie--not a black comedy.Gay---maybe that's why I loved it? Yes yes yes it is very realistic but it is also funny in the comedy of daily living way.RECOMMEND</fullReview>

And that's obvious by the style of her dressing her make up and her hair. although in sometimes she knowing and realizing the truth but she kept back to her small world. and at the end she become Crazy and 100% a baby child and you feel very sorry for her.For me this is the best role of Joan Crawford she is playing the innocent part ( but she isn't by the way ) in a very professional way make you feel sorry for her till the final scene.For me i just can't stop playing the phone scene and the final scene the were something like magic i can't forget Bette Davis reaction after knowing the truth and her final dancing scene she was marvelous.I still wonder how the ACADEMY didn't give Bette Davis The Oscar and how the didn't give Joan Crawford a nomination for This Role!!!a special thanks for the supporting cast: Maidie Norman,Anna Lee,Victor Buono and Julie Allred who played Baby Jane in 1917</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this for the first time when I was about 10, on TV one night back when there were only 3 networks. I liked scary movies. But by the time the opening credits were rolling over the face of the broken doll, I was off the couch and looking for my mother in another part of the house. Tried to get her to come watch it with me, but she was reading the comics to my little brother and told me if it was too scary I should just turn it off. Well, I couldn't bring myself to do that. I finished it, all alone. And it was terrifying, but I thought it was great! There's so much more going on here than classic film 'horror'. Blanche's pure helplessness... by the time she figures out she's in real trouble, Jane has removed just about any way she has at her disposal to get herself some help. The film draws the viewer right in and makes him/her experience what's going on in that house. That's a real-life nightmare that's even more terrifying because it's so realistic. It could and does happen in real life.As a child, I was unfamiliar with either Davis or Crawford... the only player I recognized was Victor Buono, from his "Batman" role of King Tut. (I'm sure that admission wouldn't excite either Ms. Davis or Ms. Crawford... sorry; it was the 70's and I was 10.) The scene when he pops out of the other room rolling himself along in Blanche's wheelchair with the doll on his lap still makes me jump.The somewhat ambivalent ending was fine with me, then as now. I always thought Blanche survived, but I can see how it could go either way.Somewhat dated but still amazing film.</fullReview>

In addition to Davis and Crawford, there is a terrific supporting cast filled out by Anna Lee, Victor Buono, Marjorie Bennett and an excellent turn by Maidie Norman as the housekeeper who picks the wrong time to put the hammer down.Bette Davis has an all-out field day chewing up the scenery as the delusional alcoholic former child star, while Joan Crawford plays it straight as her much-terrorized invalid sister. Davis was noted for not being afraid to 'get ugly' and dispensing with glamor when her characters required it. And here she effectively portrays Baby Jane as a grotesque unsympathetic character. And she makes it work.Joan Crawford is equally good, giving a nuanced performance that gives an indication of how difficult dramatic acting can be, yet making it look so easy and natural at the same time.Cynnical, frightening, humorous and fascinating, this film is a guilty pleasure...without the guilt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make a thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching old thrillers back from the days when it wasn't really being a popular and established genre yet is always interesting. It's interesting to see how certain genre elements slowly got developed and improved upon throughout the years and genre clichés weren't considered to be clichés yet. It certainly also makes this movie more original to watch than just an average, modern, genre attempt.And this movie does indeed handle all of its genre ingredients extremely well. There is suspense, there is mystery and there are also plenty of surprises and twists to enjoy in its story. I did like the twist at the end as well, though I can certainly imaging as well how certain people will say it's too much and a bit too far fetched. But that's classic film-making for you. Everything back then still was slightly more exaggerated and also even somewhat over-the-top perhaps.That particularly goes for this movie, that got done more in an '40's type of style, with its acting, visual style and storytelling. I however really liked that approach for this movie, since the story is about two sisters who formerly had a flourishing Hollywood career, in the early days of cinema. It was kind of need for this movie to have a more old fashioned style and atmosphere to it and if you would had told me this movie got made in 1942, instead of 1962, I would had probably believed you.The relationship between the two sisters is what makes this movie. They despise each other, yet they are also dependent of each other, for various reasons and are therefore also forced to live together. Jealousy is a big theme in this movie as well as aging and what could happen to a person when he or she suddenly disappears out of the spotlight, after having lived actively under it for so many years. It's therefore also nice that the two main characters are being played by and Joan Crawford, who 20 years prior to this movie were at their peak and extremely popular and well known actors, pretty much like the two main characters in this movie were as well.You could say this is a movie about the crumbling of an human being, in which one of the characters is slowly descending into madness and gets in deeper and deeper trouble because of it. It's also what makes the character and the overall movie unpredictable and gives it a true sense of tension, pretty much throughout the entire film.The 'evil' sister gets played by Bette Davis, who is being more like the evil stepmother from Cinderella. She is a true villain in her actions and behavior but what makes its scary is that she at all times still remains a human being. There is nothing unrealistic about it so to speak, which makes her performance all the more powerful and hard to forget. A great suspenseful movie, with a great straightforward story and character dynamics in it!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Together Wherever They've Gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't necessary to know that the central premise of sisters swapping dominance as they became adults is rooted in reality -Baby JUNE Hovick was a headliner in Vaudeville whilst sister Rose Louise was virtually ignored. As adults Rose Louise became headline stripper Gypsy Rose Lee whilst Baby June landed the odd role on Broadway (Sadie Thompson) and in Hollywood (Gentleman's Agreement) under a name close to the one she was born with, June Havoc - but it does add an extra dimension, especially if one had seen Gypsy, the Broadway musical based on the sisters which opened in 1959 and was filmed (by Warners) in 1962. What we are left with is two mega actresses who both dominated the screen in the thirties and forties, in their only co-starring film playing grotesque parodies of themselves in almost reviving Grand Guignol at the same time. Despite being scare-free it's well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey Blanche, You Know We Got Rats in the Cellar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" is a masterpiece of psychological and Gothic horror. Bette Davis is almost too creepy in the role of Baby Jane Hudson, a child star later overshadowed by her elder sister Blanche's fame as a movie star. Joan Crawford is Blanche,the perfect victim, crippled in an accident most people believed was caused by a jealous Baby Jane. The two are stuck in a creepy Gothic house, forced to live together.Baby Jane's hate for Blanche is only increased when she hears Blanche is going to sell the house and give Baby Jane away to a mental asylum. The reasons are clear. Baby Jane was a person stuck in the past and the days of her childhood fame. Dressed in an adult-sized version of her childhood clothes. Her face is caked with cream, her lips smeared with horrible lipstick, hair childishly curled, and a heart-shaped mole plastered on. She is a painful depiction of a lost cause.Baby Jane tortures her sister, serving dead rats and birds for breakfast and stopping all forms of communication between her and the outside world. She starves her sister while Baby Jane spends all their money on liquor and gin. Baby Jane stubbornly insists on a comeback, hiring a spoiled pianist named Edwin desperate for money to play while she performs her childhood routine "I've Written a Letter to Daddy" (A disturbing song of familial love gone wrong which sets the perfect tone for the film)Baby Janegets more and more demented. She beats her sister, ties her to her bed, and kills the maid when she discovers Blanche. Baby Jane sinks quickly. Her foolish dreams of her past returning get more and more disturbed. She acts more like a child, fondling her Baby Jane doll, throwing tantrums, and reducing her voice to a baby-like twitter.Eventually, Baby Jane's evil doings are found out about, and Baby Jane, desperate to get away, drives a dying Blanche to the beach. Fearing her death, Blanche tells Baby Jane that she caused her own paralysis while trying to kill Baby Jane. Baby Jane realizes that she and Blanche could have been friends and goes off to get ice cream. The police finds her and questions her. Baby Jane, seeing the crowd gathered round breaks into a child-like dance. She is now completely insane."Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" is a film that gets under your skin. It is painful to watch Baby Jane's descent into madness almost as painful it is to see Blanche's torment. Excellently acted, filmed, and written, "Baby Jane" is a masterpiece of grotesqueness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An apt title for the movie, as it fits the story, or actually IS the story and actually answers itself at the conclusion. Nonetheless, the movie has gaps in the chronology which leaves it up to the viewer to imagine how Jane's psychological condition veers into eventual dangerous derangement. I guess it's a combination of jealousy of her sister's success in Hollywood as an adult, and guilt about her murky role in her sister's invalid condition, but maybe there were other factors too. In any event, the movie exploits the relationship between her and her sister, escalating tension which we can only imagine has existed for a long time and now is reaching some totally fabricated critical point. Luckily, it's well enough done, almost as good as Hitchcock, (great photography, editing, and a multitude of intriguing details) and has a keen eye on not just Jane but also the character played by Victor Buono, who plays another flaming Hollywoood failure. The relationship that develops between him and Bette Davis (Jane) is a lot more interesting, with more potential, than the one between Jane and sister Blanche (Joan Crawford).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't you love it when a great actor or writer or musician comes out of a slump and gets a 'second wind' which carries them on through the rest of his or her career? They almost always have a fallow period where they are considered old hat, passé', then somehow, something magical happens and they are transformed from a has-been into one of the all-time greats. I've never understood exactly how or why it happens, but in movies, it happened to Bette Davis with 'What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?' Actually, it wasn't the first time she had emerged from a lean period, but it might have been her greatest comeback. It was certainly her most audacious. Was there ever a less glamorous role than that of Baby Jane Hudson, with her ghastly pallor accentuated by layers of white pancake makeup and smeared on lipstick? Joan Crawford got to play straight-man to Davis' crazy Baby Jane. It gave her a boost too, though not as big a one as her co-star. But apparently, each of them were aware that the movie offered them a huge opportunity to revive their stagnant careers. Crawford's Blanche Hudson is the audience's surrogate in the film; the one trapped upstairs and totally dependent on the whims of her drunken mad sister. These two sisters are former stage and film stars, well past their prime and living in semi-seclusion in an old two-story house. Blanche was the bigger star, something she and Jane are well aware of, and she's now confined to a wheelchair, essentially trapped in her second-floor bedroom. Jane waits on her, going up and down the stairs, and drinks a lot. It is rumored that Jane ran Blanche down in a car, crippling her, years ago. Now, Blanche and their once-a-week cleaning woman, Elvira, are becoming increasingly concerned over Jane's erratic behavior. Blanche plans on selling the old house and moving someplace where she isn't dependent on her sister for everything, but she knows Jane won't like the idea and is afraid to tell her. As Jane intercepts all the mail, she is aware of it anyway and has no intention of allowing the place to be sold. Slipping further into insanity, Jane plans to resurrect her career and hires an accompanist, Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono) to help her rehearse her old stage act. She has new costumes made. Then she begins starving Blanche and fires the cleaning woman. The house becomes a chamber of horrors for her sister. Despite a solid performance by Crawford, hers is clearly the secondary role here. It's Bette Davis' show all the way, and she gives a wildly flamboyant and ghoulish performance. It is alternately hilarious and frightening, as when she slaps and later kicks Crawford mercilessly. It must have also been quite physically grueling for Davis, as she not only is constantly walking and running up and down those stairs (Roger Ebert quite correctly said that staircase is almost another character in the film), but she also must lift and carry Crawford several times over the course of the story. In the end, knowing she will be discovered any moment, Baby Jane takes Blanche to the beach, then delusionally imagines it as a normal outing to walk along the shore and play in the sand. Blanche lays covered in a blanket grotesquely on the beach while Baby Jane makes happy talk. Dying, Blanche tells her it was she who tried to run Jane down in the car all those years ago but broke her spine doing so; Jane was so drunk at the time she didn't remember. When the cops finally arrive, Baby Jane is dancing, in her madness giving an impromptu performance for a crowd of confused beachgoers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.....doesn't come until the closing minutes of this classic drama, when one character comes out and speaks the truth about events decades prior. The opening prologue sets the stage for a series of events, and features fine performances by Anne Barton (anguished face) and Dave Willock as the parents of 2 lovely daughters, the successful child star "Baby Jane" (Julie Allred, outstanding) and on the sidelines, her simmering sister Blanche (Gina Gillespie, excellent). What follows will transfix you for over 2 hours, with exemplary support from Anna Lee as "nosy Mrs. Bates", Maidie Norman as a concerned housekeeper, Marjorie Bennett as the overbearing mother of a rotund musician, the eclectic Victor Buono. Last, but not least, are two extraordinary roles for the stars, Bette Davis as drunken Jane, grotesquely made-up, domineering, sadistic and hoping for a show business comeback, and equally matched by Joan Crawford as demure Blanche, comparatively well-groomed, restrained, grounded, yet almost behaving like the eye of a hurricane. Direction of Robert Aldrich is masterful, music by Devol compelling, cinematography (especially when branching out to the "light" in the final beach scene) arresting, dialog is penchant. Never to be missed, and worth repeating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first and likely the best of the low-budget thrillers made in the 1960s when a lot of the old-time Hollywood actresses were reduced to making these kind of films. Davis &amp; Crawford are extremely entertaining and successful as the once-famous Hollywood sisters who now live in seclusion, where whack job Baby Jane (Davis) now torments her crippled sister Blanche (Crawford). Funniest sequences include Davis singing and serving Joan some grotesque dinners. It is also fun to watch this film, since in reality the two women hated each other tremendously during and after filming. **** out of **** for this one, don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A camp field day for a macabre Bette Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This undisputed camp classic of the thriller genre will no doubt please generations to come. Even given the fact that it's in many ways a "cheap-jack" film, it merits countless viewings due to the one-and-only legendary teaming of the two greatest movie divas Hollywood ever knew: Bette Davis &amp; Joan Crawford. The film deserves its cult status. As the demented alcoholic slattern Baby Jane Hudson, Davis frankly shocked the public and critics alike with her fearless portrayal of a grotesque misfit who can't forget that she was once a child star in Vaudeville. It's fitting, by the way, to show Blanche as the older sister in the prologue: Davis was a full four years younger than her screen rival in real life. The film goes on and on in a light dimmer than necessary, and the cop-out ending isn't exactly Hitchcock, but the performances are indeed striking. The wig Davis wore for her interpretation of the title role was an old bleached-out wig reputedly once worn by Crawford in either a twenties silent or in the 1939 fiasco ICE FOLLIES OF 1939: no one seems to know for sure. As the wheelchair-bound crippled Blanche, Crawford wisely underplays Davis, and her performance is admirably restrained - if a mite deceiving: she's not all sugar and spice, it turns out! During the filming, director Robert Aldrich had to contend with each actress individually griping about the other: somehow he drew two nicely contrasted performances instead of totally letting the two icons chew each other up &amp; spit each other out. The house in which the film was shot still stands in the Hancock Park section of Los Angeles. Maidie Norman and Victor Buono are terrific in their roles of Elvira the maid &amp; Edwin Flagg respectively. Anna Lee has a cameo as the nosey neighbour, Mrs. Bates - whose daughter is played by Davis's fourteen year-old daughter B.D. Indeed, talent must skip a generation...</fullReview>

More gruesome than frightening, Bette singing is probably the scariest thing in the picture. She could ward off any burgular with her make up alone. The burning question here is not whether pet canaries and dead rats make good appetizers, but what in the world possessed anyone to give this project the thumbs up. It's an un-nerving look into extreme decadence. If Sunset Boulevard was about isolation and loneliness, I would hate to think what this represents. And I'm one of the sick many who enjoys watching this repeatedly. (Spoiler? The final plot twist manages to reverse the thread of the whole story.)Should be seen if only for the brave performance of Ms. Davis, cackling and chortling her way thru the torment.

		<fullReview>In their only appearance together on film - they didn't have any scenes together in the 1944 wartime moral - boosting film HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN - Davis and Crawford each sparked their quickly fading careers by doing this excursion into the macabre. The picture isn't exactly Hitchcock, and it goes on and on in a light dimmer than necessary, and the climax - when it belatedly arrives - is rather something of a cop-out. However, this low - budget film which was directed by Robert Aldrich has achieved cult status, because the acting impresses those who relish it. Bette Davis is absolutely amazing in her characterization of a misfit who can't forget that she was once a child star in vaudeville. Bette had just been through what she termed her "ten black years" when this movie thrust forward her screen stock and again made her a bankable star. Joan Crawford plays the role of Blanche, a wheelchair bound cripple and former movie star who lives in constant torment due to her sister's shenanigans. Crawford, (who is considerably better groomed than Davis) wisely underplays Bette and director Aldrich drew to nicely contrasted performances from two actresses the likes of which we'll never see again. Davis is astonishingly grotesque in her playing of Jane and the public ate it up in 1962; it was the runaway sleeper hit of the year.If these two legendary stars did indeed have a feud, there certainly aren't many juicy stories connected with it in books; it is probable that they respected each other enough to succumb to such drudgery. It is well - known that Joan enjoyed Pepsi spiked with vodka, insisted that the set be kept at fifty degrees and would say "bless you" for "thank-you". Bette was her unaffected opposite and walked around the set in slippers and an old robe with make-up on the collar. Victor Bouno plays obese mama's boy Edwin Flagg and his acting is at once grotesque and brilliant. That's Bette's fourteen year old daughter B.D. playing Anna Lee's daughter; she would marry in real life two years later and the marriage is still going strong; in 1985, she would pen her infamous "expose" MY MOTHER'S KEEPER. Davis received her tenth (!) Academy Award nomination for this macabre classic and footage from two of her vintage films PARACHUTE JUMPER &amp; EX-LADY (both 1933) were used to show what a lousy actress Baby Jane was as a young woman - the old movie in which Blanche watches herself with genuine fondness at is a 1934 MGM flick entitled SADIE MCKEE. 10/101962 134 minutes Rated: R CC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich did what no one said he could do in 1962. He made two old actresses like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford box office magic. Aldrich gave the two women parts that were like nothing either had ever done before. Davis plays a crazed, ugly woman looking like she did when she was a huge child star. Crawford plays her famous movie star, crippled sister. The story revolves around Baby Jane's desire to recapture her fame amidst her growing separation from reality. Aldrich creates a great deal of suspense by building the film up scene by scene through tension. Davis is simply wonderful. She captures the essence of the role. She can convey malice in a scenend then childish eagerness or uncertainty the next. Her performance was truly worthy of the oscar nomination she received(and would have been worthy of winning it as well). Crawford is acceptable in her role too, but let's face it. She was no match for Davis when they were younger. They are clearly no match in 1962. The rest of the cast is adequate with Victor Buono stealing his scenes as a roly-poly pianist looking to cash in on a hasbeen's ambition to return to show business. Director Aldrich, however, really makes the film memorable with the bird scene, the rat scene, and the final beach scene. The pathos created in that scene is very moving, strangely awkward, and thoroughly enjoyable. Some old clips of Davis and Crawford's films are used to great advantage in the film. Great suspenseful fun and frolic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bizarre tale of sibling rivalry gone to excess and of the pitfalls of childhood stardom that probably should have been required viewing for the cast of `Different Strokes' before they started that series. Davis goes from kiddie star to nutty termagant and Crawford goes from magnanimous sylph to crippled victim. Obviously an inspiration for `Misery'.The film is a keeper because of the two famous starlettes, but also for a strange sort of intensity that is keeps well paced. And interesting technique adds to the atmosphere such as the juxtaposition of the neighbor's home (that looks modern by early 1960s standards) and that of the sister's gothic house. The overhead shot of Crawford spinning in the wheelchair was also compelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this film was great. It dragged in a few places, but I honestly found myself cringing at several parts. However, the story rings more familiar today than it did in '62. Reminiscent of the Brat Pack of the 80s, and Whatever Happened to Ringwald, Hall, Estives, Nelson, and Sheedy, among others. What really pulled my involvement into this film, among so much great acting from Davis and Crawford, was the language that was involved for such an old film. I watched this one right after viewing "Spartacus" on the criterion DVD, which included the pages that the MPAA wrote to Universal in 1958 about the explicit contents of the Kubrik film. I noticed that they strictly prohibited the used of the word "damned". And it surprised me that they went from that to Davis calling Crawford a "bitch" in just four years. It really caught my eye, and made me question what else they could fit into this movie. I wasn't let down. This was a truly freaky movie and more-than-deserving of its box office success in '62 as well as its spot on the AFI's 100 Thrills List.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to watch this movie because I was looking for an exciting psychological thriller and I like to go back to the older movies as they often proved to be excellent in this particular genre. Baby Jane felt like it will be exactly what I was looking for. However, I was deeply disappointed.First off, I love Bette Davis (Jane) and Joan Crawford (Blanche). Nonetheless, their characters really got on my nerves because they were so over the top, both of them. Bette with the excessive "crazy person" look and Joan with the excessively polite person behavior. The movie wasn't thrilling at all - it's more of a drama than anything else. I don't think there was one moment that held me on the edge of my seat, except maybe the one where Blanche is trying to get to the phone downstairs. At the same time, though, I was irritated by it. Every time Jane would go out to run errands she would be away for a long period of time, giving Blanche enough time to seek help in many ways. Yet all she did in that time was one or two activities like eating candy or trying to get down the stairs. What, this took her hours? I know she was in a wheelchair but come on! If you're afraid for your life you'll frickin' drag your body down the stairs if you have to. And you'll do that as soon as your abuser left the house, too.Another thing that really irritated me was Blanche's complete incompetence. What, she couldn't scream out the window when she saw the neighbor? She couldn't throw things out to get somebodies attention? It's not like they were living in the woods, away from all forms of civilization. Imagine you're being held captive in your own house and you manage to get to the phone AND call for assistance. Would yo beat around the bush or scream "come help me right now, my sister is crazy! Come NOW!!!"? For me, the whole movie is totally unbelievable. I don't blame the actresses but the director, producers and scriptwriters. The movie's full of plot holes and poorly executed storyline. That's why I give it a 6/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Davis and Joan Crawford two of the bigger stars of the movies co starred in this film produced and directed by Robert Aldrich. Aldrich had previously directed Joan Crawford in the very fine Austumn Leaves at Columbia. Victor Buono who was a Warner Bros. contract player used by WB in several of their TV shows also appears in this film. WB at first had such little promise for the film the farmed out the production to a rental Producers Lot on Melrose across from Paramount Pictures. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were both gracious per Aldrich during production and worked well together. Mr. Aldrich's use of great black and white photography gave a sense of a old Hollywood feel to the production. Bette Davis is superb but then so is Joan Crawford who gave a great performance, perhaps more nuanced than Bette Davis'. I feel Joan Crawford deserved a nomination but that was a great year for actresses: Katharine Hepburn, Lee Remick, Anne Bancroft, Geraldine Page, and Davis thus no room for Joan Crawford.Joan Crawford yielded billing to Bette Davis saying "Bette's earned it" As the movie premiered the studio realized it had a box office smash. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford both playing has been stars of the silver screen frankly cared little for each other personally and things got edgier when Bette Davis nominated for the Oscar saw her rival Ms. Crawford glide across the stage to accept the Oscar for Bette Davis' competitor Anne Bancroft. The gloves came off and the feud started. Bette Davis carped over Joan Crawford until she died that Ms. Crawford sabotaged her hoped for 3rd Oscar Win. Joan Crawford along with Miriam Hopkins, Faye Dunaway, Susan Hayward and of all people Lillian Gish were on Bette Davis' hate list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has parallels to "Sunset Blvd.," as a forgotten star of yesteryear lives in a dilapidated mansion and plots a comeback. While not in the same class as that Billy Wilder classic, this is an entertaining black comedy. Davis and Crawford are ideally cast as the creepy sisters sharing a house in an uneasy alliance. Davis is completely over the top while Crawford is comparatively restrained as a woman confined to a wheelchair (although she does have a scene where she loses it). It's campy but it works here. The fact that Davis and Crawford did not get along off-screen only adds to the intrigue. Aldrich creates an appropriately creepy atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Twisted Portrait of Outlandish Cruelty Utilizing the Infamous Rivalry of Two Great Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this twisted portrait of outlandish cruelty opens, six-year-old Baby Jane is a flourishing vaudeville star while her older sister, Blanche, lingers humbly in her shadow. She is resentful of Jane's success and the attention she gets from their father-manager but, in concern for their conflicted mother, she keeps her feelings suppressed. As the two become adults, however, Jane fades into anonymity while Blanche becomes a prominent film actress. At the pinnacle of her career, she is paralyzed in an automobile accident for which the alcoholic Jane is held to blame.These two characters are played by lifelong nemeses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. One could go on and say that it doesn't matter which one plays which character, but this is a tell- tale showcase of the distinguishable strong suits of both actresses. Davis plays Baby Jane, a more and more deranged has-been child star, a character that seems almost without inhibitions, just the sort of outlandish grand guignol for which an older Davis is perfect. Crawford plays an equally dramatic role, but one that requires more self-control and humility, neither of which Crawford supposedly had as a person but could somehow muster for the good of a part. Really this is a significant moment in both careers, as they managed to come together as bitter rivals for the sake of what would make a great film. Did they put their differences aside during shooting? No. Did it help? Oh yes!As the years pass in the lives of these two terribly tragic characters, they become recluses in an old manor home, where Jane "cares for" Blanche. When she learns Blanche is planning to sell the house and maybe place her in a home, Jane holds her a captive and victimizes her with sadistic neglect and maltreatment. When Blanche tries to make contact with a neighbor, Jane foils the effort.Really, there are several things Blanche could do to escape her situation, and though there are things she does to free or vindicate herself, she really does not do all she can, but despite this, Robert Wise's demented shocker is still unbearably intense and blood-boiling. He creates an insulated world the works as a chamber for the excruciating struggle between the two has-been stars. When we see their neighbor, played by Anna Lee, it is in some way an elation because juxtaposing her life only ten feet away is so normal and peaceful, which reminds us of how appalling and abnormal and extreme the life of these two fussy failures really is. At the film's end, we realize just how pivotal this effect really is.As the companion piece for Wise's other grand guignol film with a masterfully over-the-top Davis, Hush?Hush, Sweet Charlotte, Baby Jane does not simply share the same spirit, style and shock value. Baby Jane actually takes different risks rather than the matching ones. During the harrowing exertion between unhinged sadism and long-anticipated vindication between two sisters, he will give us belly laughs conjured from a twisted sense of humor, as when Davis belts the song that her character as a child performs at the beginning of the film, sounding as if she hasn't sung since. She hires a fat and frustrated English pianist played by Victor Buono to accompany her in a comeback. He is clearly intended for screwball laughs as his chubby face reacts when she proves talentless, agreeing to stay on since he will be paid a commission.Each time I see a film by Robert Wise, he is forging ahead of his time with Gothic, startling visual gimmicks and effects. He does not reach the degree of Otto Preminger and George Stevens, other directors of his era who challenged its convention, but with Kiss Me Deadly, Hush?Hush, Sweet Charlotte and What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? On one's resumé, you most certainly have talent and vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing! Definitely a masterpiece. A must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Astonished, you will be completely astonished after watching "What ever happened to Baby Jane". It's definitely a masterpiece. No doubt! And if you think this movie has been shoot in 1962, 56 years ago, with no special effects, just black and white and 2 wonderful actresses, well, this will make you appreciate this movie even more. It's a splendid analysis of the human psyche, described wonderfully. Bette Davis is absolutely amazing, no doubt she won an academy award nomination, it's probably the best performance of her carrier. And the end will leave you completely astonished, and will make you think how dangerous and complicated the human psyche is. A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never quite knew what to make of this movie. Was it horror? Camp? Comedy? Noir? I just couldn't make sense of it, and so I dismissed it as something of a joke, as many people did at the time, and a BAD joke at that.Well I just saw it again this morning and I was astonished by how good this movie is. It is gorgeously made, in spite of a limited budget and a fast shooting schedule, masterfully edited and shot, every detail of set design, costume and makeup just exactly right, gorgeously acted by every single person in it, with perhaps the exception of Davis' daughter, BD Merrill (now known as BD Hyman, "Christian" teacher) who is excruciatingly bad in her tiny role. Everyone else is spot on, blazingly, terrifyingly honest and truthful in every single scene, even Crawford, who could be awfully phony sometimes. Davis's performance is a miraculous tour de force, brilliant in its technical mastery, acting with her entire body (she DID study dance with Martha Graham after all!), her face, her eyes, her voice, her hands, always true to the character and the moment, but still playing with a sense of style, which is the character's but also is the actor's. I don't think there's anyone now who could pull off something like this. Actors today lack the technique to do it, most of them.It's all done so well, with such utter seriousness of purpose by everyone involved, that I still didn't quite get why! One comment here, by one Robert Glass, explains it for me. These people were making an honest film about the Hollywood they knew, about PEOPLE they knew, about what that crazy level of fame does to the people who have it and the people who crave it. They were all of them familiar with this scene, they all knew people who had sunk into it or crawled their way out of it. This accounts for the almost documentary-style photography, with no cheating, no gauze filters or flattering lights. This accounts for cinematographer Ernie Haller, Bette's favorite, following her around for days with his camera, sometimes in the back seat, as she tooled around Los Angeles as Baby Jane in that gorgeous 1940 Lincoln convertible, in full "Jane Hudson" makeup and costume, just right for the character as written. Davis said, "She's the kind of woman who doesn't wash her face, she just puts on another layer of makeup!" And you know her through Davis' compassionate interpretation, and know why she is the way she is.Davis had looked at some of this before, giving a good, unflinching performance in "The Star" ten years before, but not as deeply and in not as good a film. Crawford had never done anything quite like this and she doesn't come across as honest with herself or as insightful as Davis does, though she is pretty honest (for Crawford) in the way she dresses and looks the part.But everyone else matches Davis's honesty, shot for shot and line for line and approaches this with the same utter seriousness. And now I know why.I'd suggest to everyone that they look at this picture again with all of this in mind. There was a reason, beyond the surface chills and thrills, why this picture was such a hit in 1962.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a definite classic and should never be remade. Nobody can do what Bette Davis did for this movie. This movie was extremely funny and bizarre. I have no way to exactly put it... You'd be shocked how good it is regardless of the era you were born. It's chillingly hilarious, creepy, sinister, bizarre ...but overall funny as all Hell. It really is good for it's time. This may not be for all horror fans as..But it is a great classic in that genre. If you like lot's of blood..of course this isn't what you want to see...This is my kind of movie. Very psychological and fun. Old movies of course have odd scenarios and too many quiet scenes. But it couldn't have been better in any other time. One of the best movies i've seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" blends "Psycho" with "Sunset Boulevard" to compelling effect. The film's story and the behind-the-scenes story of the film have both become legendary. The early 60's setting has dated, but it is still a very entertaining movie even today. Don't expect any real chills or scares, but rather more of a dark comedy with some psychological insight. Robert Aldrich excelled at this kind of lurid melodrama when not doing macho action films. His was an interesting and rather schizophrenic career. But whether action film or melodrama, he always seemed to go b---ls out with everything he had, and this movie is no exception. Bette Davis is absolutely wonderful. Her career had been spotty since "All About Eve" twelve years earlier and you see her just tear into this role like a starving animal. Yes, she's over-the-top and campy, but always self-aware and giving the role everything it calls for. If she had toned it down, I don't think anyone would remember the film today. She has several great moments, but my favorite is when she sings "I'm Writing A Letter to Daddy" and that shattering moment at the end when she realizes what a wreck she has become. Its only a moment of self-awareness, though, and she goes right on with her maniacal, misguided "comeback" and creative culinary endeavors. Joan Crawford, surprisingly to me, is actually quite good also. Her looks are not as cringe-worthy as Miss Davis' in this film, but there's no effort to glamorize or beautify her. I always thought her hairstyle and dresses make her look like she's playing the Wicked Witch of the West. For the most part, though, she's quite restrained and effective. She really does give a convincing portrayal of someone who is starving and dying without overacting. There are also some fine supporting performances by Victor Buono as Bette's slimy accompanist, Maidie Norman as Crawford's loyal maid and Marjorie Bennett as Buono's smothering mother. Don't watch this movie expecting anything more than a well-made melodramatic Hollywood potboiler giving two great stars one of their last chances to really shine and you will be happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of the best lines in a movie EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Crawford is watching an old movie of herself on television. A neighbor comes by who had watched one of her old movies the night before on TV. She brings flowers to the back door. Bette Davis answers looking like a real bitch. The neighbor goes on and on about how great Joan Crawford is, and how she and her daughter would love to meet her. Bette Davis replies- My sister is not fit to receive visitors and never leaves the house. She then sends the neighbor away.She goes upstairs to bring her invalid sister her breakfast. She hears Joan Crawford watching one of her old movies on TV. Just before she enters the room she says- Enjoying yourself? Oh why yes Joan Crawford replies. Bette Davis walks to the TV and then hits the off button. Joan Crawford jolts-I was watching that. Bette Davis turns and jolts back with jealousy- THEN YOU'RE AN IDIOT! That sets the whole mood for the film. You'll find yourself laughing and falling off the couch.This movie ROCKS! It is so ahead of it's time. It is quite controversial in my opinion. Even to this day. It deals with issues of codependency, toxic relationships, fame, reputation, female power struggles, addiction, alcoholism, denial, insecurity and redemption. You name it this film has it. I really have to give the women in this film A lot of credit. No woman in Hollywood today would ever allow themselves to be filmed so unattractively. I know Charlize Theron did for Monster. I'm talking about older actresses.It was very, very bold of Bette Davis to be filmed in such bad lighting and such hideous makeup. She allowed every crag, wrinkle and bag to be seen. And quite closeup I might add. That takes some real balls to do that. Hell, not even male actors nowadays would allow that. This movie is a frightening portrayal of what happens to the ego once it collapses. All she has left are her distant memories of her heyday, and now those are not even enough to keep her afloat. So what does she do? Drowns herself in booze and tries to drag everybody down with her. This movie is tragic, funny and frightening all at the same time.I think we all see Baby Janes in our society nowadays. Ehhh emmm, can anyone say Michael Jackson, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Liz Taylor? And I'm sure we'll see plenty more to come in the future. Madonna, Britney Spears, Courtney Love. Now those are gonna be some really frightening Baby Janes. Madonna is almost there! Perhaps one day when Lidsay Lohan and Hilary Duff are old they'll be confined to a house together left to destroy each other. Only if there's a God. LOL! Then we will all finally be vindicated.I highly recommend this movie. It will freak you out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Done Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite as campy as one might think, despite the presence of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, as aging drama queens. In fact, Joan is remarkably restrained in her role in this movie. If you're expecting her to jump around and scream (a la "Mommie Dearest"), forget it. That aside, she is very good in her acting here, probably one of her best roles.Miss Davis, on the other hand, is totally out of control, and that's what makes this movie so fun. Her 'imitations' of Joan are total camp, and very funny. Her character's downward spiral is really effective, and fascinating to watch. She really goes through a range of emotions, and tops herself in scene after scene. Her kicking Joan around the floor, is rather uncomfortable to watch. Makes one wonder how much of that was real acting.The storyline with Victor Buono is kind of a bore. He's great as usual, that part just goes on a little too long. Though, despite it's over-two hour length, this film moves along at a rather brisk pace. If you're a lover of 'cult' films and horror/suspense, then yes, you should seek this one out. There's a reason why it's generally considered the 'grand dame' of camp films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love it for Mostly the Wrong Reasons...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane" is a great picture from the early 1960s. The funny thing is that I've never ever liked Joan Crawford one bit but have always loved Betty Davis. This film is one of many Betty Davis movies that proves that she had no problem playing an unglamorous role. Here she's downright mean, nasty AND ugly! And if this picture had to star both Davis and Crawford, there's no way Crawford would ever have played "Baby Jane"! So what are my wrong reasons for liking the movie? Well, because of how poorly Davis' "Baby Jane" character treats Crawford's Sister Blanche character! I know it's just a movie, but I'm as big a Betty Davs fan as I am an "un" fan of Crawford's. Betty would do anything to look the part of whatever character she played. Sometimes that meant she was stunningly gorgeous, and sometimes, well, she looked like Baby Jane! My only complaint is with the makeup. While it really does a great job of appropriately making Davis' Baby Jane character one ugly woman, they could have backed off of the "white wash" a little. Shot in beautiful B&amp;W, it looks far too much like they double-dipped Betty's face in a full bucket of white primer! Both stars are great here though. Crawford actually made me feel sorry for her, but my money's still on Betty. She should have won the Oscar that year, but legend has it that Ms. Crawford did her best to make certain that didn't happen . . . and whatever it was sadly worked. Anyway, Davis looks ugly and acts even uglier while Crawford's character is the sympathetic goody two shoes. And as a huge Betty Davis fan, it's what I call perfect role reversal!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic and will forever stick with anyone who watches it. Disturbing in many ways, especially for an early 60's flick.Bettie Davis was to me better in her later movies than she was in her "glory days". She seemed to be the best person on earth to play Baby Jane cause she has a very evil look to her. I think the casting was perfect in ever way, one of the best scripted movies ever in my opinion. The acting was superb.I always felt a great director could've added so much to this film, but the story and acting makes up for it. Its good, but it lacked so much also. It should've focused more on how evil Jane was, it could've made me as a viewer feel more sorry for Blanche (sp).It was 1962 and it was nice to see the occasional gem such as this come around. I will recommend you watch it if you like the lifetime movie of the week style of thriller, I say stay away from it if you are wanting some psycho deranged mad woman, because Baby Jane doesn't pull that off well....There's a thin line between psycho and crazy. Norman Bates is Psycho, Baby Jane was the latter.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy psycho thriller that's become a camp classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's kind of hard for me to review this film. I can't quite get my thoughts about it in order. Please bare with me. Well, after viewing it once I felt it was supposed to be seen as a psycho-thriller. It certainly seemed to be that way; the whole film was just very creepy. And yet, it's not hard to see why it's viewed today as a camp classic and has attracted a large cult audience. The big reason is undoubtedly Bette Davis's performance; in her whacko portrayal of a crazy former child star, she goes completely over-the-top and obviously relishes stealing scenes from her old rival, Joan Crawford. It isn't hard for her to do; Crawford doesn't have much to say or do except break down whenever she gets a dead animal served to her for dinner and be frightened of and yet totally dependant on her crazy sister, Davis. Still, Davis is creepy, espicially in the last couple of scenes when she suddenly starts acting like a little kid and you know she's completely gone. I found a lot of similarities to Sunset Boulevard. The same story line (star of an old, dead entertainment form lives in the past, goes crazy thinking she can make a comeback, and completely controls the people closest to her), although Baby Jane "lives in the now" a lot more than Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis had a lot more freedom than Blanche. Also, the last scenes of both are very similar. (I may write some spoilers in the next couple of sentences.) Jane dancing on the beach reminded me of Norma getting ready for her closeup. Both have killed that person closest to them (I think it's safe to say Blanche died) and will no doubt be arrested, but both think everyone's come to watch them in their "new picture" or "new act" and have no idea what's going on. In other words, both have met pathetic ends. But Sunset Boulevard was a better film; this one is overlong and after a while gets to be a bit much. If you choose to watch it, view it first for what it is: a creepy psycho thriller. Then, view it as a camp classic and cult movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane Hudson (Bette Davis) a faded film star and her wheelchair bound sister Blanche (Joan Crawford) live together in a huge mansion. Jane is slowly but surely losing touch with reality and despises her sister Blanche. Jane starts to mentally and physically torture Blanche. How will Blanche escape?I don't think this film is a camp classic--there's nothing even remotely funny about it. It is basically a horror movie about two sisters. As we all know now, Crawford and Davis HATED each other and it actually helps the movie--Davis' hatred REALLY shows. Also the movie was wisely shot in black &amp; white (Davis said she insisted on that) giving the film a very dark, gloomy tone and look. And Crawford and Davis are both great in their roles. Crawford has never been nicer and Davis never meaner. It's well directed by Robert Aldrich and there's an interesting supporting performance by Victor Buono. I love the film but I realize it IS unpleasant. The violence is (by today's standards) tame but it's shot in a way that puts you right there and it's not pleasant seeing Davis go after Crawford. So, I highly recommend this film but I can't see how anyone can call this camp. I'm giving it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Cinema; Queen Bitch at Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always disliked Bette Davis, not just because of her pronounced personality defects, which rose to prominence after her daughter's autobiography appeared, because I was familiar with her work before that. I simply feel that she was a mediocre actress, who gained a reputation early in her career and then produced only average work for the remainder of it. Maybe I was just born a generation too late.Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, however, was indeed a marvelous performance by Davis, one I never got around to seeing until 2003. I don't know if it was worthy of an Oscar, but probably was worthy of the nomination it received. It might even have served to change my opinion of her, except that, in light of her malicious and malignant psychological traits, I don't believe it was acting. Davis was simply being herself, an obsessive, manipulative, vindictive queen bitch who did her best to destroy everyone around her; cinema reflecting real life. She, like Baby Jane, lived in a glorious past disconnected from her present reality, and only this wrinkled, hollow shell remained.Robert Aldrich was lucky to have such material to work with, but I have to agree with another poster, and say that I too would prefer to see Hitchcock's hand on this. Maybe then the maid would have at least turned around in time to see the hammer fall, and a few other plot defects might have hit the Cutting Room floor. Still, this is a movie well worth watching, and it held my interest throughout. Just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Joan; Over-the-top Bette (as always)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A flawed but disturbing and entertaining Hollywood classic for many reasons despite the lack of acting skills on Miss Davis' part. What this film really shows (to those who know of such things, that is) is that while Joan Crawford was a fine actress, Bette Davis was a one-note purveyor of bravura (if you want to see Davis 'acting', watch Jezebel). What was needed in this film was director Alfred Hitchcock (whom Joan originally wanted when she first discovered the project) to bring Bette's histrionics down to Earth. I have always thought this would have been a truly remarkable film it this had been the case. And, when Bette was nominated for an AA, one can understand why Oscar Levant cracked the line "I now know for sure that these awards are rigged!".Most people realized that this was a sympathy nod to an actress who was sadly past it when it came to talent. Sadly, Davis would continue for years giving the same type of performance she started giving in the mid 1940s (Beyond the Forest, Stolen Life, The Star, etc.) and also continue to treat people so badly that, unlike Crawford, she ended her life without friends or family.Nevertheless, this film is a must see for the pairing of the two stars, for the film noir type of lighting, for a great supporting cast (Maidie Norman, Victor Buono and Anna Lee) and for one of many remarkable acting jobs from Miss Crawford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Alfred Hitchcock´s "Psycho" (1960) is the origin of the modern horror film Robert Aldrich´s masterpiece is the grand mother of all psycho thrillers, full of subtle suspense and a menacing dark atmosphere. But it´s even more than that: "What ever happened..." is a brilliant film noir as well as a dark comedy and a sinister drama. Also the lead is stunning: Joan Crawford is pretty good as paralyzed and despaired Blanche Hudson, but Bette Davis´ performance is over the top, her part rules the whole film! Her role even may be the prototype for every female maniac in a movie! No matter what Rebecca de Mornay or Jennifer Jason Leigh did - Bette Davis did it already before! And, of course, it wouldn´t be a good psycho thriller if it hadn´t a really macabre solution at the (un-)happy end... Yes, this one´s another treasure of cinema!</fullReview>

The sheer intensity of the sisters relationship makes this picture compelling throughout.....sure its over the top but justifiably so.... and..there is an excellent supporting cast....the "noisy" neighbour....the "coloured" maid...(naturally called Alvira!)..the "odd" English teacher...brilliantly portrayed...and his mother.....

		<shortDescription>Film about insanity swings uncertainly between humor and horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it a horror comedy? Not quite, but "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" has camp followers who will swear it's a howler. I didn't see much humor in it, except for Bette Davis' over-the-top performance and wild make-up job. Based on the novel by Henry Farrell, Bette plays an aged ex-child star tormenting her sister (Joan Crawford), a former star herself who made more of a mark as an actress before a tragic car accident left her crippled. The film has but one plot-twist and an awful lot of talk (Victor Buono's role as a nutty mama's boy is tiring); however, it's a one-shot deal to see Davis and Crawford together, and a few of their shared scenes do live up to all the Hollywood stories which have now become legendary. The black-and-white cinematography and creepy set-designs are fantastic, as is that old car Davis tools around in. Overall, "Baby Jane" just misses classic status, mostly due to the indifferent handling. Everyone seems to be making a different movie. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the perfect blend, of eeriness, plus psychosis. There was plenty of the eerie, with the black and white, simply a shot of the house gives goosebumps. And the psychosis of both sisters is well developed. It is a disturbing film without a doubt. Bette Davis' performance was flawless, completely engrossing as the perverse, disturbed Baby Jane. Joan Crawford's acting was almost as good, although she lacked a depth of character that's only revealed at the end, but should have been present through the film. While actors definitely don't want to play the third act, at the end, after the final twist, everything should finally make sense and fall into place as the credits start to roll. Instead, Baby Jane left the audience wondering and confused, since there was nothing in the whole of the movie, most noticeably lacking in Joan Crawford's performance, to make it make sense in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's what happened: She grew old, ugly and bitter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time in the days of silent movies there were two adorable, talented sisters who both had careers as child stars. Baby Jane Hudson, the "bigger" of the two stars soon was consumed by her stardom and couldn't handle rejection once cast-off as a has-been at the brink of puberty. Her sister's career, up to that point always in Baby Jane's shadow, seemed to blossom in early adulthood.Here's the twist: An accident involving both sisters following a wild party left Baby Jane's sister paralyzed. Through some scheming she is able to convince Baby Jane (who was drunk and unaccountable) that it was her drunk driving that rendered the sister a paralytic for life. Guilt ridden Baby Jane sees it her duty to care for her disabled sister.40 years pass. The bitterness and mean spirited goings on are a daily thing. The wheelchair bound woman eventually fears for her life, as the sinister Baby Jane goes off into a fantasy of being a child star once again. A housekeeper in whom the sister confides wants to help, but is quickly done-away with, as she could have "blabbed". Baby Jane pulls out all the stops, and even as the sister, with her dying breath reveals the dark secret she had kept for so many years, Baby Jane is in a trance, giving a swan song performance for her "fans" who have gathered around to see her taken away as a lunatic.This is a Classic! Both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford give performances of a lifetime. The music score is also a nice touch, giving you the "teen scene" of the early 60s rather than "grandma's favorites". There is a 45rpm single vinyl record version of Bette Davis and another performer singing "Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?", extremely hard to find, but a definite winner! Fans of the stars will devour this Hollywood candy of a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maudlin acting. Manufactured coincidences. Even the premise was improbable: A woman agrees to live with the sister who maimed her? I don't buy it. The main thing the movie had going for it would have been the general plot line I was prepared to give the movie six or seven stars when I thought it might have been the first with that plot line. But it was at least 12 years too late. "Sunset Boulevard" had a similar plot line, and the differing details in "Baby Jane" weren't interesting enough or even plausible enough to justify another 195 minutes of film about aging Hollywood divas luring innocent dupes into twisted plans to regain fame.</fullReview>

Funny, after 43 years, one surgery and I found myself the victim of my mother and my sister who definitely have and will always have "Baby Jane Syndrome". They did the same to my Grandmother without me realizing it at the time. Not only is this movie a psychological thriller ---- it needs to be out there for those like myself, so it is recognized as a very real, very scary, and sometimes, cultivated disease to fit the needs of psychologically and socially impaired individuals. Definitely something I didn't think would ever be visited in my life when I first watched it as a teen, but very glad I did. A 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous Movie, A Real Gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so excited when I found out that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford made a movie together. I ended up getting it at the library, not expecting anything all that great. I was extremely wrong! This movie is fabulous. Bette Davis plays Baby Jane Hudson a child vaudeville star. During her childhood, her sister Blanche is ignored and pushed aside while Jane gets all the glory. When they get older Blanche gets a movie contract, but in her contract it says that for every movie that Blanche makes, her sister Jane must make a movie as well. Blanche become a big star and a great actress. Jane on the other hand, does not. One night there is a car accident and Blanche becomes paralyzed and is in a wheel chair. The movie then moves forward to when Jane &amp; Blanche are in their mid to late 50's. Jane has become a little crazy, and an alcoholic and does awful things to scare her sister who she keeps upstairs in her room all the time. I don't want to say much more and give away the movie, so ill stop there. The acting in this movie is really marvelous. Bette received an Oscar nomination, but I think Joan should have gotten a nomination as well. This movie shows no blood, or guts, like so many modern movies. It relies of the talent of its actors to convey the sheer horror and panic that Blanche is going through, and the personal demons that are affecting Jane. This movie is a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A former child star (Bette Davis) torments her crippled sister (Joan Crawford) in a decaying Hollywood mansion.This is generally considered a classic, no doubt because it pairs Crawford and Davis, both actresses who were huge but probably considered beyond their prime years. It is also often lumped in the "horror" category, which is silly, because there is really nothing horror here.Personally, I did not care for it all that much. It was good, sure, but not the masterpiece it seems to be made out to be. It is like a mix between "Sunset Boulevard" and "Spider Baby", but not as great as either of them. And, this is just my opinion, I think Bette Davis is terribly overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1917, Baby Jane Hudson is a spoiled child star brat on vaudeville. Her sister Blanche suffers with bitterness. In 1935, Jane is a mess and Blanche is the star. Blanche forces the studio to keep Jane around. One night, one sister tries to run over the other sister with the car. In the present day, Blanche (Joan Crawford) is wheelchair bound while Jane (Bette Davis) controls her life. Blanche is still living her glory days. The Bates moved in next door six months ago but they never see Blanche. Only the maid Elvira Stitt (Maidie Norman) ever sees Blanche and she's concerned about Jane's treatment of Blanche. Blanche is planning to sell the house and Jane is mentally deteriorating.There are two great performances here. Bette Davis gets the showier part and deserves all the accolades. She is masterfully grotesque. Joan Crawford has the more subtle character and is a good foil to Bette. It also helps for them to have such an animus relationship off the screen. It can't help but bleed onto the screen.</fullReview>

It was trend setting hit that inspired countless imitations over the next decade in addition to have been nominated for 5 Academy Awards and was remade for television in 1993. Two sisters locked away in their decaying mansion engage in a deadly war of wills as madness takes hold, sending their lives spinning out of control. Davis is particularly fine as the psychotic senior haunted by her past, earning a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her legendary performance. A genuine classic and one of the best horror films to come out of the 1960s. Based on the novel by Henry Farrell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Example of Fame Corrupting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know Miley Cyrus, Dakota Fanning, Drew Barrymore, child stars that just at times seem way too fake, as if they're hiding a secret behind their acting careers? And with most child stars, when they grow up, by the time they pass age 30, they aren't so popular? Well, in 1917, everybody in the States knew Baby Jane Hudson, or formally Jane Hudson, a blonde, blue-eyed little girl dressed all in pink, who sang and danced on stage in front of fans of all ages, her act partner being her own father, a man who used to love his family until his daughter's fame went to his head and made him care about only making Jane happy. His depressed-looking wife and neglected daughter Blanche watch on from behind the stage as Jane does all her performances, then her dad offers the merchandise for sale, most commonly the doll modeled to look just like Jane. After each performance, behind the stage and glamor, the troubled family is seen. Jane is a very spoiled brat who gets anything she asks for, but she does care for her sister, trying to persuade her dad to buy Blanche some ice cream. When Blanche tries to be polite and says she doesn't need any, her father snaps at her. Blanche's mother tells her privately that the tables will turn one day...In 1935 Blanche is a new and popular adult actress and is doing high-rated movies. No longer a cute and charming child star, Jane is a fat alcoholic who often goes home and sleeps with men she doesn't even know, basically a free prostitute. Being a kind person, Blanche tries to get her agents to allow Jane to play small roles in some of the movies, but most people think Jane is a lousy actress and that her talent faded as she got older. One night a mysterious car crash happens, Jane is heard screaming, and somehow Blanche is paralyzed in the crash.By 1962 the sisters are both retired, living off their acting money in a large house in the suburbs of California. Blanche never leaves the house, the neighbors remark. The only one to ever leave the house is Jane; she often buys groceries, and loads of alcohol. A maid comes in every day to tidy the house. Behind closed doors, Jane is a violent and sadistic drunk, doing nasty things to Blanche like killing her pet parakeet and throwing her fan mail in the garbage barrels. The maid (Elvira), has a conversation with Blanche in secret about how Jane is reaching a psychotic state of mind and should be sent to a mental asylum, but Blanche can't do that to her. Jane is severely depressed, often hallucinating herself as a child doing her acts again but then seeing her older self in the mirror, which drives her more towards the breaking point. As the movie progresses, Jane goes to more and more extreme lengths to make sure all attention is on her the way it used to be. And since Blanche is in a wheelchair for life, she can't even leave the upper floor of the house without Jane.This movie was pretty shocking and sad, did have some comedic moments, but also some moments that really revealed what can happen to a child when they are always spoiled. The soundtrack was great and the movie is fictional but based on a novel by the same name. It stars Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, both great actresses. One of the most shocking moments in the film was the beach scene, when the mystery of the accident that paralyzed Blanche is revealed. Blanche had tried to kill Jane when she became an annoying and inconvenient burden, but Jane got scared and ran away, leaving Blanche instead crashing into a fence and not killing Jane, which is my she was paralyzed. Jane then remarks, "so... all this time we could have been friends?" and her remaining sanity deteriorates to the point where she is acting like a child in public, trying to play with other children on the beach and excitedly begging for strawberry ice cream. Jane is depicted as a disgusting and sadistic drunk monster though the film, but towards the end it is hard not to at least pity her.Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is not only creepy and bizarre, but very thought-provoking and disturbing, in some ways like the 1956 film 'the Bad Seed'. It's unforgettable, and definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

The character reminded me of Mrs. Danvers from Rebecca(1940), and also of Annie Wilkes in Misery(1990)The movie was surprising at all aspects, the change of tone, the shades of character was so beautifully woven together by the great Robert Aldrich. The starting was unique of its kind, a mix of jealous and selfishness within the atmosphere of cheerful and cute moments. There was always some new revelations going on, new characters being introduced, new shades of characters revealed.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true happening - Davis vs. Crawford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teaming up caliber actresses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford - or better: unleashing them against each other - clearly was a struck of genius. It is more than a rumor that the grand dames didn't particularly like each other, and in "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" they made the very best out of that, teaching each other lessons on how to deliver memorable performances. It's really impossible to tell which one was the more convincing player, Bette "Baby Jane" Davis with her acid portrayal of the villainous sister or Crawford as the crippled wheel-chair bound, helpless, more and more despairing Blanche. But this shouldn't be the viewer's loss. The juicier part with the more memorable scenes (and there are aplenty!) undoubtedly goes to Davis in her role as the inventively insidious sister, but the film as a whole wouldn't work as well without Crawford's fragile soul shattering little by little in the face of the open hatred she's confronted with.Aldrich's thriller about this sibling rivalry of the different kind is dark and macabre, an exemplary black comedy with shocking images, twists and turns, all the way nail-bitingly suspenseful - in short: an instant classic. "Baby Jane" is also one of those films that are impossible to imagine in color as the black and white cinematography for one is part of the story, which stretches over decades, and furthermore it adds considerably to the absorbing mood that is being created, to that other side of the coin of Hollywood fame long gone by, detached from reality. What remains is an entirely surreal world ex-celebrities are living in, complete with the crazed downward spiral we're invited to witness. What happens in or around the limelight when egos clash ever so often is based on false hopes, envy, lies and deceit - but the good thing about it: You can grab a seat and watch the showdown!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the earliest examples of what I like to call the nut-case film, many great ones like Fatal Attraction, Misery and One Hour Photo came after, but this one is different because it is within a family, and having seen bits and pieces of it I was sure it would rank the same quality of entertainment of other nut-case films, from director Robert Aldrich (The Flight of the Phoenix, The Dirty Dozen). Basically, 1917, Baby Jane Hudson (Julie Allred) is a successful vaudevillian child star who dances and sings on stage in front of large adoring crowds, she is also very spoilt by father Ray (Dave Willock), and her sister Blanche (Gina Gillespie) is very jealous. In 1935 they are both movie stars, but their roles have reversed, while Blanche has a successful and fabulous movie career sister Jane's film have flopped and she becomes an alcoholic, and one night after a party one of them is next to a gate, while the other is in the car and drives fast to smash into her, we do not see which sister was at the gate and which was driving. Years later, present day, both Blanche (BAFTA nominated Joan Crawford) and Jane (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bette Davis) are retired, they live alone in their mansion, and Blanche stay in the house due to her being crippled, supposedly by Jane driving the car those years ago. Jane is supposed to caring for her sister Blanche, but with her drinking still a problem, and her beauty and cuteness now faded to hideousness, she only uses her vulnerability and helplessness for her own gain, to mock and psychologically torture her. This isolation is only interrupted by cleaning woman Elvira Stitt (Maidie Norman) visiting every week and the occasional interventions by next door neighbour Mrs. Bates (Anna Lee), but these people are always sent away or fooled by the scheming of Jane. Blanche is planning, without her sister knowing, to sell the mansion and place her psychologically deranged sister in a home for sick people, of course she finds out and only increases her nasty intent towards her, and cuts off any source of help, including taking the telephone from upstairs and keeping her a virtual prisoner. Jane meanwhile is wanting to have a career again, and has a few adult version costumes from her former fame, and hoping to get somewhere she places an advert for a musician to help her practise, and it is large unstable man Edwin Flagg (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Victor Buono) who answers. He is secretly appalled by her ludicrous and terrible act while he plays the music she gives him, but he pretends to be enthusiastic so that he can be paid and get the money to leave his mother Dehlia (Marjorie Bennett). Blanche finally gets her chance to try and struggle with her immobile body downstairs to telephone the doctor to collect Jane, but she catches her, slaps her, and drags her back to her room upstairs. Elvira comes to do the cleaning, and is surprised to be fired by Jane, but she knows that something is going on, and waits for her to leave and investigate what has happened to Blanche, and when the horrible sister returns she only unlocks the door with the threat of her calling the police. Elvira is shocked to see Blanche trussed to the bed with tape on her lips, and Jane comes up behind her to murder her with a hammer, and that night, after getting the body into the car, drunken Edwin comes back, brought by the police. When the police have gone, he is demanding the money that Jane promised him in advance, and he hears the noises that Blanche makes to get attention, and he runs straight out to get help after seeing the woman haggard and helpless. Jane knows that authorities will be coming for both of them, so she unties her sister and they drive to the beach to go unnoticed for a day out, Blanche lying on the sand with a blanket over her. Thinking that she will die very soon, Blanche makes a shocking confession to Jane about what really happened all those years ago to leave her crippled, she did it to herself, she was the one driving the car and crashing to hit Baby Jane, and the slamming snapped her spine, and she dragged herself out to look like she was hit. With her mental condition seemingly helped by the confession, Jane goes to get an ice cream for both of them, and that is when the police spot her and demand she take them to her crippled sister, and totally deranged she dances her way to Blanche lying on the sand, whether she lived is not concluded. Also starring Anne Barton as Cora Hudson and Robert Cornthwaite as Dr. Shelby. Davis is extraordinary as the grotesque and disturbed formally famous woman who resorts to torture and violence, and Crawford is equally brilliant as the sister who cannot escape the horrible situations and thinks her sanity is fading in the process, together they make some memorable (for the wrong reasons) scenes, and their hatred on screen was apparently fulled by their disagreements off screen, which makes it more believable. There are many disturbing moments throughout the sibling rivalry, the impersonations to fool others, the dead bird and rat courses served for dinner, the tying up and abusive stuff, and much more, it is a marvellously chilling and must see psychological Gothic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound. Baby Jane Hudson was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, Joan Crawford was number 10, and Bette Davis number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 63 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills.

		<fullReview>The where are they now? People who were famous now live in obscurity is always something. Living the high life, enjoying the fans, then "poof!" they are has-beens. In "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?", fame and fortune isn't all that glamorous. "Baby" Jane Hudson(Bette Davis) is a former child star who is not at her prime like she used to be, thanks to her now famous sister Blanche(Joan Crawford) who is now the famous one. Then one night, Blanche is crippled in a auto accident, and blames her sister Jane for the debacle. Now that Blanche is crippled and her fame is slipping, Jane takes care of her sinisterly. I liked the part where Jane served Blanche a dead rat, and that to me is crazy. Then when Blanche tries to get help, Jane kicks her like a rag doll. Then the truth is out, Jane was outcast by her own sister with a lie about the accident. Maybe Blanche's envy lead her to her own undoing. Now the real outcasting is about to unravel. Jealousy, envy, hate and revenge, that's the price of fame. This movie plays it out very well. Watch it, it'll be worth your while. Rating 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the strengths overcome the weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters, the 10-minute prologue to WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is one of the most unsubtle expositions in film history, but hang on and you will be gripped by this deeply flawed but powerful melodrama. First, it's obvious that the filmmakers had to work hard and fast on a limited budget. One example: In Davis's first contemporary scene we hear her say "Gemini" while checking her astrological forecast in the kitchen. But her lips haven't moved. Something definitely wrong here. Later when Crawford writes a note, she recites it word for word, including the signature! I can't help thinking they just couldn't be bothered to shoot a close up of the typewriter keys banging on the paper or especially Crawford's pen writing the postscript. But both Davis and Crawford act their way out of these potholes with aplomb. The chief weakness in Davis's performance (which might have cost her the Oscar) is that some of her most entertaining bits - when she's imitating her sister's voice - are obviously lip-synched. Which says to the audience: "This I cannot even attempt and for this I need technical help." Too bad. It's the only false note in an otherwise ravishing and consummate performance. There is far more than personality tics on display here. People complain too much about Davis's mannerisms as Baby Jane; they are PART of her performance but not her whole performance. Narratively, the least plausible scene is when Crawford, realizing her sister has gone over the top and is now a mortal threat, timidly whispers out the window to her neighbor who is gardening by the driveway. Why does she go to the trouble of writing a letter instead of screaming or even throwing a heavy, blunt object like an ashtray out the window - anything that will get the lady's attention! But Crawford is so primally convincing in her anguish that you willingly suspend disbelief. *** SPOILER*** The only possible rationale for her behavior is that she knows she is the guilty sister and is subconsciously setting herself up for punishment. But pointing this out would dilute the impact of her plight and rob her of the audience's sympathy. The addition of Victor Buono's character as the pianist allows Davis's character to reveal her underlying vulnerability and humanity; and Buono uses the opportunity to further enrich his own character. When the two get together, you find yourself wishing they could actually resurrect Baby Jane's act and continue as a team, or at least become friends. But then you realize it cannot be: Baby Jane is too far gone. And you feel the tragedy of both of their lives. Nice touch: The way we are introduced to Buono as he slumps over his piano, lazily slurping milk and biting into a sandwich the way an overfed grazing animal might nibble a leaf, as he sloppily circles the want ad placed by Baby Jane. And a final nod to Joan Crawford, whose personal life has made her one of the most reviled movie stars of all time. Her performance is just as powerful as Davis's within more subdued (and wheelchair-bound) circumstances. She too was perfectly capable of playing a cold, cruel bitch (see THE QUEEN BEE or THE WOMEN) but here she expertly embodies victimhood and physical deprivation. Davis, on the other hand, gets to act aggressively with her whole body, several costume changes, extreme make-up, shifting locations and several acting partners. Crawford is confined to two acting partners, one phone call, a few rooms in the house and eventually a blanket on the beach. Sadly, this was the final cinematic glory for Crawford whose subsequent leading roles were in the lowest grade of trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darker side of sibling rivalry...excellent support by Buono...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traces of SUNSET BLVD's darker vision of Hollywood celebrity and other noir style films of the '40s and '50s hang over WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? It's Robert Aldrich once again conjuring up a classic sibling rivalry tale that takes place mostly in a dark and decaying mansion where two sisters must confront their dark past.While the performances of BETTE DAVIS and JOAN CRAWFORD are above reproach, it's Davis' pathetic scenes with VICTOR BUONO that really stand out for me. Just watch his face as he changes expressions at the piano while Davis twirls around in a child-like trance to offer him one of her biggest numbers as a child star--"I've Written A Letter to Daddy." It's a priceless performance that both of them give and Buono did deserve his Oscar nomination in a weirdly offbeat supporting role.Davis wrings as much pathos from the role as possible, but the harsh make-up and the cruel situations make her seem like the sinister daughter of Cruella deVille at times. Crawford deliberately underplays a less showy part, but does so very effectively.Maidie Norman is excellent as a maid suspicious of Davis' behavior toward Joan, but her character should have known better than to turn her back on Davis when coming to Joan's rescue. Sharp-eyed observers will notice Ernie Anderson (from Bette's IN THIS OUR LIFE) as the ice cream vendor on the beach.A little editing here and there would have been wise, for the story does drag on for too long a length before that dazzling conclusion on the beach, which conjures up images of SUNSET BLVD.'s final moments.Obviously easy to see why fans of Davis and Crawford are so eager to embrace this as the ultimate in viewing pleasure--but personally, I preferred the later Southern Gothic tale, HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE, which Crawford walked out on after filming began. I think it had more Grade A production values and was an even bigger showcase for its well-known supporting players.However, deVol's haunting use of music here is just as effective as the one he wrote for CHARLOTTE--which was very good indeed and there is excellent camera-work by Ernie Haller.Summing up: Absorbing story, gripping performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good film, sprung out of Hollywood's "Golden Era" (mucch like Sunset Boulevard). Bette Davis plays a former vaudeville star, who is no longer the starlet she was; Joan Crawford is the crippled former adult star.In many ways, one has to suspend disbelief here -- the script, the story line teeter on the melodramatic, on being over the top. Be willing to believe that Joan Crawford (Blanche) cannot escape Bette Davis (Baby Jane). This is central to being caught up in the film!Both actresses give excellent performances. Bette Davis, in Oscar-nominated turn, plays Jane as a bitchy, insecure former star, whose costumes replicate her childhood image. It's a brilliant performance! But it is offset by Joan Crawford, who contrasts so well with the Bette Davis character. Her performance, in my opinion, is gold! It's not over the top (or as appealing ?) as that given by Bette davis, but it works!Her Blanche is long-suffering and understated, and generates audience sympathy. The two women create a chemistry which sparks and sparkles on the screen. It's a classic, which deserves to be seen.A good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bette Davis's finest performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is amazing, not only do you have two of the greatest stars together in a film, but also a great storyline. Although the film is not as scary as some people might say it does give you the creeps a couple of times, like the scene where Blanche calls the doctor while Baby Jane goes to pick up her costumes and returns only to spot her on the telephone and she just stands there and starts to kick her that's the scene that frightened me the most.Also Bette Davis delivers an amazing performance, maybe you cannot compare to other amazing performances like "All About Eve" and "The Little Foxes" which is my personal favorite, but I would put this performance as one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, flawed and irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much ink has been spilt over what a cult classic WEHTBJ is, and to an extent, it's true. Davis chews up the scenery and Crawford gives a typical Crawford performance, albeit turned up to 11. Sure, it's camp and black humor and all that, but WEHTBJ fails on one key point: even camp has to have a foundation of believability, and this it does not.* SPOILER ALERT *When Crawford first is faced with the possibility that her sister doesn't have her best interests at heart, she tiptoes around that possibility with a saintly discretion, for fear of letting Davis know her suspicions. When this happens the fiftieth time, it gets to be annoying and absurd. When the chance to contact her neighbor for help presents itself, she slowly types a note to her, wads it into a ball and throws it out the window at her--INSTEAD OF SIMPLY SHOUTING "HELP! CALL THE POLICE!" At this point, you may--like me--give up any pretension of caring what happens to Crawford. When the cleaning lady, who sees that Crawford has been hogtied and locked in her room by Davis, goes in to rescue Crawford, she suddenly becomes oblivious to the threat that Davis so obviously poses. C'mon, folks--that's beneath our dignity.The rest of the film is occasionally intriguing hokum, but--other than the performances--it's a lot of rubbish. If you're interested in seeing what the hype is all about, by all means, watch WEHTBJ, but don't expect too much of it. Then watch Sunset Boulevard to see a far superior blend of black humor, great performances and a similar theme.</fullReview>

You always know that noone will ever stop Baby Jane before the end of the movie and you also know that Blanche won't die before time(BTW: I don't think she died). Both need to be together to let the show go on.Blanche's character changes from bad to good without any real explanation. Similarities to SUNSET BOULEVARD are evident.

		<shortDescription>...Baby Jane is Superior Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top notch performances highlight this dark tale about two former movie queens sharing a house together with outrageous consequences. It's common knowledge by now that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford give exceptional performances in this superior black comedy bordering on the macabre. Although Davis was Oscar nominated and worthy of the award she lost to Anne Bancroft who was brilliant in "The Miracle Worker". To bad it wasn't a tie since Davis wanted to be the first actress to win 3 Oscars. The film directed by Robert Aldrich was nominated for 5 Academy Awards including one for its impressive black and white cinematography. The fine supporting cast includes nominee Victor Buono who is hilarious in scenes with his mother played by the delightful Marjorie Bennett. Also effective are Maidie Norman as Crawford's assistant, Anna Lee the next door neighbor, Dave Willock as papa Hudson and Julie Allred as the young Jane Hudson warbling "I've Written a Letter to Daddy". Thank goodness Davis and Crawford finally made a film together and eventually left us "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" to relish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The famous feud reaches its peak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Crawford and Bette Davis were famous for their off-screen rivalry in Hollywood from the 1930's through the 1970's, when Crawford died. Having only appeared together in one film before ("Hollywood Canteen", wherein neither shared scenes with each other), "Baby Jane" was a perfect film to bring them together. Both deliver top-notch performances, but Davis easily upstages Crawford as "Baby Jane" Hudson, a former child star who has withered away and been forgotten by the world. While only Davis was nominated for an Oscar, Crawford should have also been bestowed with a nomination. While she isn't as wild and amazing as Davis, she does the tortured bit very well as Blanche Hudson, forgotten movie star held hostage in her own home by her sister Jane. Look for Bette Davis' real-life daughter B.D. as the teenage girl next-door. The subplot of Victor Buono as a fat pianist who lives with his mother is forgettable and why he was nominated for an Oscar surprises me. He isn't that good and is annoying, if anything. Of the two sisters, I feel that Jane is more sympathetic. Her mind slowly deteriorates and the audience can't help but feel pity for her when she tries to revive her childhood stage act in vain. Davis steals the show, hands down! How could she not? She's Bette Davis! In my book, both Davis and Crawford were equally talented; both were better at some roles than the other. While not a horror film in essence, this is more of a tragic drama that should appeal to those infatuated with either Davis or Crawford and is recommended to those with a fondness for old-time Hollywood and no-holds-barred acting. Watch for scenes from Davis' 1930's stinkers "Parachute Jumper" and "Ex-Lady" early in the 1935 part of the movie and scenes from Crawford's "Sadie McKee" seen on television by Crawford and her neighbors!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a lot of fun, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane is worth seeing just for the cast. Bette Davis is very much in her role, as she seems to take out years of aggression against Joan Crawford. These two leading ladies, who were never known to be the best of friends, playing two washed-up relics of a previous era, makes this film great fun to watch, even if its Gothic suspense plot is fairly overdrawn.However, even with its cast, the film fails to capture the passing of the golden era of Hollywood, like "Sunset Boulevard" did. It also lacks "Sunset Boulevard's" humanity, with Davis especially coming off as some comically overdone Gothic villainess. We get a fascinating look at a bizarre woman, but she's too bizarre to see her as any sort of real character study, and the film passes up its opportunity to comment on the golden age of Hollywood. Baby Jane may be a frightening character, whose terrorizing of her sister is fun to watch, but she's no Norma Desmond.</fullReview>

The sister were in showbiz. Jane and Blance! They were the Hudson sisters. After a accident "Blance" ends up in a wheel chair. As the years go by Jane Hudson drinks. Her drinking puts her in an alternate universe. Blance (who is now in a wheel chair) is trying to get help. She is a prisoner in her own home. At every corn-or Jane is there to stop her from getting the help. If you rent this also watch "Mommie Dearest". Make it a double feature. I highly recommend this movie.

		<fullReview>Bette Davis always had a sinister air to her, but nowhere more so than in "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?". In this movie, she gets as nasty as can be, as a former child star keeping incapacitated sister Joan Crawford in captivity. And I mean REALLY keeping her in captivity. Watching this movie, you're very likely to feel as though you're the one in captivity. The black-and-white cinematography helps to accentuate the eerie mansion where they live.I know that there are probably going to be comparisons between this movie and "Hush...Hush...Sweet Charlotte". The truth is, they're both good, creepy movies. You can watch either one first and they're still just as creepy. But I don't really recommend Bette Davis's later horror flick "A Watcher in the Woods". Just stick to these two, and you'll get nice and chilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you interested in comedy?Focus on a goofily-attired Bette Davis who could have changed the name of this movie to Guess Who's Coming To (Be Eaten For) Dinner--Eat your heart out, Martha Stewart!!!And her song and dance act in which she becomes fiftysomething going on five.Are you interested in a character study of how unresolved issues coupled with problem drinking can erode a family relationship?Or how about what kinds of dysfunction might result when one sibling seems to be favored over another?Then, there's the guilt that Jane must have felt when she sobered up and realized (though she was actually incorrect in this assumption) that she had crippled her sister.Her love-hate relationship with her sister left little windows where tenderness and compassion make flickering appearances but there's more instances of resentment--resentment of now being saddled down to care for her now-helpless sister (though guilt making her feel extra obligated to do so) coupled with resentment that Blanche is so popular even after being out-of-the-public-eye for many years.Then, that scene at the beach where Blanche and Jane realize what they've thrown away of what could have, instead, been a close and loving relationship between the two sisters.Cult film or not, there are plenty of thoughtful and serious issues that can be thought about while watching this movie.Then, there's just the plain old eerie parts--the once fine home left to the sisters by their parents (especially, the Daddy who once encouraged, spoiled, and accompanied Baby Jane on his ukelele back in more innocent and carefree vaudeville days and now had that sung-about address in Heaven above).This home matched the health of the two sisters, because, as they were, it was now deteriorating.It was a Spanish-style home, and that style has a way of looking especially eerie when deteriorating.And the inside of the home was kept dark and in a state of being stuck in the past like Dickens' Miss Havisham and her surroundings while the rest of the world moved on ahead.The home didn't have a basement but a cellar (more spooky sounding)--and one with rats, no less!!!In this watch-it-again-and-again movie, you get at least three movies in one: a comedy, a character study, and a horror movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mean, spiteful, former child star Baby Jane Hudson (Bette Davis) is the primary care-giver for her invalid sister Blanche Hudson (Joan Crawford). They live in a dilapidated Spanish style house, decorated in early Munster. Blanche, who was the real movie star of the family is confined to a wheel chair, after a mysterious car accident while leaving a fashionable Hollywood party. Baby Jane was blamed for the accident that injured her sister, Blanche, which sets the stage for her life as Blanche's personal slave. Not knowing how to knit, Blanche loves to watch her old movies on her television set. In between commercial breaks, Blanche uses her bell pull to let Baby Jane know that she's hungry and wants her din-din, and she wants it NOW!Baby Jane, annoyed at being her sister's servant, mouths an expletive, while plugging in the coffee pot to brew another batch. Poor Baby Jane looks like the victim of a bad fashion make over courtesy of Michael Jackson (another child star), and dresses in her dowdy, frumpy, old child star clothes from her vaudevillian days. Pretty she ain't.As the days go by, Baby Jane gets stranger and stranger (hard to believe but it's true!) and starts tormenting her sister, Blanche. First she doesn't give her sister flowers from their nosey next door neighbor (think Gladys Kravits) and then she doesn't give Blanche her fan letters that come pouring in from adoring fans. Insert "Gasp!"Baby Jane decides to revive her extinct career as a former child star. Who wouldn't want to see a 60 year old bag lady sing "I've written a letter to daddy?" But Blanche is being more annoying than usual. So Baby Jane decides to cook Blanche's beloved parakeet (not named in the credits) as Blanche's main course one night. That didn't bode well with hungry Blanche, and the next day Baby Jane cooks up a gourmet meal ala "We have rats in the basement." This results in the most famous line of all moviedom:Blanche: "You couldn't do all these awful things if I wasn't in this chair!"Baby Jane: "But you are in that chair, Blanche you are!"This literally sends Blanche into a tail spin in her wheelchair. Famished, Blanche sets out to find food while Baby Jane is out running errands. Surprisingly, she finds candy (meant for Blanche) in Baby Jane's bedroom, along with handwriting samples of Blanche that Baby Jane has been practicing with. She greedily gobbles down the chocolates, accompanied by really terrific "someone eating frantically" sound effects. To sum up the remainder of this movie, Baby Jane imitates Blanche on the phone so she can buy more booze, bonks their occasional sweet as can be housekeeper over the head with a hammer, bitch slaps Blanche, and kicks her when she tried to call the police, ties her up in her handicap equipped bed, and finds a money hungry producer to revive Baby's career. Finally, she takes Blanche to the beach for some much deserved ice cream, all the while eluding the police who are now searching for the infamous Baby Jane Hudson! But while Blanche lays dying on the beach, out comes their nasty family secret, Baby Jane didn't injure Blanche, but that Blanche did it to herself!Upon hearing this news, Baby Jane (more deranged than ever) does a strange little beach dance while eating her ice cream cone as strangers from the beach gather around to gawk at her. Maybe she's ready for her close up after all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie years ago and viewing countless parodies since, I had forgotten just how entertaining this movie was! I recently saw this movie again and I enjoyed the complexities that I overlooked the first time around. Bette Davis is in top form as a frumpy, frowsy, increasingly crazy ex-child star who finds life in the past preferable to her present life as her sister's keeper. Who else would have dared to play such an unattractive, unsympathetic role other than the magnificent Bette?? In less-capable acting shoes (i.e. think almost any actress today), this role could be rather one-note. That is NOT the case here. From the subtle way that Bette drags her feet in her house shoes to the pasty white make-up, Bette was a master at SHOWING how guilt, disappointment, and dissatisfaction can tear a person down over time. There is a weariness to this character that the viewer can actually FEEL. Yes, this role, and certainly the make-up, could have just seemed comical in less-capable hands (no remake please Ms. Roberts); however, Bette's nuanced portrayal of the brash and boozy Baby Jane should be studied by those wishing to become actors. By the end of the movie, she achieves the nearly impossible: she moves her character from one hated by the audience to one pitied. We see that crazy Jane who had bullied her sister quite cruelly and unforgivably was a victim herself. She was over-indulged by a father that wanted success more than a well-mannered daughter. Jane was a victim of a fickle society that moves callously on to the "next big thing", forgetting those that came before. She was also a victim of her sister who silently tormented Jane by leading her to believe that she had been the cause of her accident. Blanche acknowledges a physical change in Jane when she says that Jane used to be so beautiful. Lastly, as stated earlier, Jane is a victim of her own guilt and disappointment. I don't hate Jane in the end; I find her pathetic and sad. How easy it would be to dismiss this character as a cruel monster. Instead, Bette made her more complicated and interesting than that! Bravo, Miss Davis! I still miss you and the days when actresses could ACT! By the way, the only person in this movie that was unlikable and one note was, ironically enough, Bette's own real-life daughter, Barbara. She came across as petulant and bratty in her minor role. No wonder she didn't act in anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some rough spots, but overall a very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? has a lot of clunky spots. Even the acting is sometimes strained. Both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford have moments of extreme overacting, even though they are mostly great. The script also has some poor spots, especially the fate of the maid. Te final revelation is disappointing also and adds nothing to the film. That's especially poorly done. And one of the major flaws of the film is that the musical score is intrusive and often completely wrong for the film. However, most of the film is quite excellent. It overcomes its flaws quite well. As I've said, Crawford and Davis have plenty of good scenes. Victor Buono, who plays Edwin Flagg, a pianist whom Jane hires to work for her, is especially excellent. He has a couple of scenes that are just hilarious. The film itself contains more than half a dozen scenes that can be described as nothing but brilliant. Robert Aldrich's direction is amazing at times. The photography, by Ernest Haller, is beautiful and adds a horrific mood to the film. The film is very much worth seeing. If you liked it, may I suggest the other Robert Aldrich film I've seen, which is quite a ways above this, actually, Kiss Me Deadly. It's not the same - it's film noir. But the direction is similarly great. 8/10.</fullReview>

Maybe THE classic movie by which ALL others should be judged! You will not see the like again. Those who see it as horrific are missing the entire point! To begin with - it ISN'T! This is a psychological study of two sisters, one of whom harbors a terrible secret. Not even THIS matters though...it is the PRIVILEGE of watching these two great actresses tearing themselves to pieces through the safety of their respective roles. Read the book BETTE and JOAN...the whole behind-the-scenes expose lets it all hang out! This is the most wonderfully engrossing film with dialog to remember all your life ("But y'aa Blanche, but y'aa!") Have you ever seen anything more poignant and difficult to watch, than Davis trying desperately to recapture her childhood memories and appeal, as she croaks "I've Written a Letter to Daddy?"To try to rate this masterpiece is to insult it. Shocking perhaps for its day, it is now an indestructible time-capsule. Never again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's my opinion that "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" is Bette Davi's best film. She gives such a inspiring preformance filled with humour and madness. But when it comes to Joan I agree with what Bette said that she can't act her way out of a brown paper bag. How true that is. In this film it's about two sisters who once used to be famous, Jane was a kind of Shirley Temple child start but is now a washed up dried up alcoholic and Blanche was a thirties screen siren but now is cripled through a car accident. Jane looks after Blanche but is insainly jealous of her fame. Over time it shows how Jane's mentality weakers and she goes mad. She abuses Blanche, she hits her, starves her and ties her up. This is an excellent kind of horror film. I wish I could have been on the set whilst this was being filmed as it was a well known fact in Hollywood that Davis and Crawford loathed eachother. But of course the world was on Bette Davi's side. Knowone liked Crawford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that "WHtBJ" has become such a cinematic icon within the gay community is completely irrelevant to its worth as a film-- ANYONE who appreciates expertly-crafted suspense films would undoubtedly enjoy this movie.And, considering its age, this movie has held up REMARKABLY well, a fact that ultimately must be credited to its two stars, Davis and Crawford. The elements of psychological torture that are exuded so flawlessly from these monumental talents give "WHtBJ" a foreboding atmosphere that more recent suspense/ horror films can only hope to imitate-- and which they all imitate rather poorly.There are few, if any, actresses working today who could carry a film so brilliantly as do Crawford and Davis here-- their interplay, although its off-camera foundation has been well-documented, throughout this film is unparallelled more than 30 years later.Rating: 8 out of 10. It's campy and fun, but incredibly intense at the same time. Incredible performances by two film legends. Heterosexuals (like myself) should not deprive themselves of a film such as "WHtBJ" because of some myopic and ultimately irrelevant "stigma" that the movie may or may not have developed. Brilliant direction, and a vicious manifestation of one of the most passionate fueds Hollywood has ever seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Side Of The Moon Of Shirley Temple.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two sisters grow up together in early Hollywood. One is Baby Jane (Bette Davis), a spoiled little blond who has a successful act, is the darling of audiences, and is loved by her father. The little tyke's signature song: "I've Written A Letter To Daddy." The other sister is dark and jealous Blanche (Joan Crawford), disdained by her father. Both develop movie careers as young ladies but Crawford's eclipses Davis's. The bitter competitiveness persists.Then one night the two sisters arrive home. We don't see the faces but it's clear that one of the sisters watches the other get out of the car and begin to open the gate to their splendid home. (Splendid by Hollywood standards of the time, meaning it looks like the inside of the Bronx Botanical Gardens.) The driver releases the emergency brake and guns the car into the gate, apparently smashing the other one up.Cut to the present, thirty or forty years later. Both are long forgotten. Crawford is paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair and bed on the upper floor. Davis, her caretaker, is still dressed and made up like a child star and she looks positively ghoulish. She "takes care" of Crawford alright. She insults her at every turn, serves her rats and dead birds on her dinner tray, rips out her phone -- and it gets worse. She's determined to keep Crawford a secret prisoner and torment her and the abuse turns physical.As always in these movies, there are one or two peripheral characters who visit the mansion from time to time and may find out about Crawford's increasingly desperate state. One is a sympathetic maid. Another is the flabby and imposing Victor Buono as a manipulative piano player pretending to help Davis get her career revived. As usual, they fail to rescue Crawford, after a great deal of cross-cutting between Davis returning to the house and the intruder creeping around and peering into nooks and crannies. Compare these scenes with Vera Miles investigating the old house in "Psycho."It must have had a lot of popular appeal because it generated a couple of imitations with names like "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte" and "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?" But what it is, fundamentally, is a kind of feminine version of torture porn. If a human being could be insulted to death, Crawford would have died long ago. I prefer this kind of torture to the masculine kind because it's less violent, though it's no less unpleasant.That brings up the question: Who the hell would want to watch stuff like this? It's not particularly well done for its type, though it was one of the first. "Misery" was more gripping if you were willing to subject your aesthetic apparatus to a posologically unsound dose of Novocain. And "The Collector" by comparison seems profound. But this? The initial shock of seeing Bette Davis made up like a kid at Halloween aside, it's all deeply depressing. It's full of clichés. After a monumental effort, Crawford manages to reach a downstairs phone and she doesn't call the cops. She calls the busy family doctor. And when she tries to explain that her sister is about to kill her, she turns to jelly and begins speaking vaguely and says things like, "I can't explain it right now." "My life is at stake" consists of five syllables and she can't organize them. Even the Big Reveal from the dying Crawford at the climax -- it was Crawford driving the car and she missed Davis and smashed her own spine when she hit the gate -- is, as far as I can tell, utterly pointless. What was keeping her from telling Davis the truth after the accident? Why did it take Crawford thirty years to finish doing her penance? Of the principal actors, Bette Davis must be said to have the most guts. Boy, does she look awful. Not many actresses would put up with that kind of make up and that kind of part. And it wasn't the only time. She looked plain awful in "The Virgin Queen" (1955). That's sacrificing ego for art.Certainly Crawford would never have done it. She had a personality of chrome steel, though a complete professional, and had two modes of expression on the screen: (1) suffering (eg., "Mildred Pierce") and (2) dominating (eg., "Johnny Guitar"). That was it. As for her acting, F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote: "you can never give her such a stage direction as 'telling a lie,' because if you did, she would practically give a representation of Benedict Arnold selling West Point to the British...." Maidie Norman is effective as the maid who is too inquisitive. Anna Lee is as charming as ever as the friendly next-door neighbor. The award for best performance goes to -- wait, let me open the envelope -- Victor Buono as Laird Cregar, the sly, effeminate, exploitative, effete pianist with the face of a Turkish pederast who hates his domineering mother. That harsh and unlikable mother might be the most original touch in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth and Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich, by then rather more competent in making Westerns and War Movies than intimate films, staged 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' without squiggles, straightforward and with an almost steadfastly camera. Its substance is the intensity of the terror between the two leading actresses. Superficially 'Baby Jane' is the evil part who tortures her sister 'Blanche', but the secret of the hate lies somewhere else.It is a fascinating, self reflexive play that broke Hollywood's most important narrating rule: the separation of reality and fiction. It is not only about the prosed content, but also about two ageless stars, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Both did not have to play the rivalry between them, they hated each other. Their careers were much too resembled. They proved their proficiency in many films before and won several Oscars. Their zeniths were exceeded by that time and they received more or less moderate offers now. 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' counts for being the last artistic climax for both. In interviews Davis and Crawford stated with hearty attacks on each other. A plus for the film, which made the conflict much more plastic and horrifying.Bette Davis, dancing, with a stub in her mouth and finger thick make-up in her face, shambling through the house, is superb. As well as Joan Crawford whose torn open eyes are mirroring all the horror and the loathing for her film sister. Rarely was a film so congenially casted, rarely two actresses dared to bring up their lives into that film so unsparingly and clearly - lives of two glowed out stars in the shadow of Hollywood. With that film both, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, manifested their true grandness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as empty as any other Hollywood thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The flow of events is not natural and "fluid". There is no surprise before the last 10 minutes. I have wasted my 2 hours on a lifeless thriller and after every Hollywood movie I watch, I become more convinced that hardly something expressive or creative comes out of Hollywood. Few reasons: 1-Why the conflict between the main characters elevate to an acute level within a day is not conveyed very convincingly. 2-The "unspoken mystery" (unexplained car crash)is revealed by the musician's mother in a few sentences towards the end with no explainable motive or enthusiasm. 3-The "unknown truth" is revealed by the main character within the last few minutes without any foreshadowing or consequence. 4-The victim could be more convincing in trying to make contact (like Cary Grant matchbox scene in North by Northwest) 5-"Forgotten star" performance could be more convincing (as in Sunset Boulevard). 6- All surprises were predictable. 7- Victim's efforts to reach out were not convincing (why not cry out when the music teacher can easily hear you), 8- No human drama but just overt expressionism (Last few minutes could easily justify an intense communication or character breakdown if handled by Fellini ) Watch something by Hitchcock, Polanski instead. By the way;Joan Crawford's eyes are more expressive than Bette Davis'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A so well built plot led by one of the greatest stars in the world, Bette Davis. Looking at her it seems to become a movie&gt; director is an easy task. Her fit grimaces and authority, the right voiced and voiceless scenes. Master of actors and actresses, all the cast around her outstands too, but never shines as much as she does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defines "Campy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One comment on the IMDB characterizes this movie as a "gay icon," and many others call it "campy." Since some people don't seem to understand this drift of thought, I'll try to give my two-cents worth of interpretation. There is a certain kind of gay male sensibility that loves the kind of over the top humor that predominates in "Baby Jane." I never thought of this movie as a horror movie, though it could fit the genre. But, really now, horror depends on a certain level of credible realism, as in "Psycho" and all of Hitchcock's films. That's why it is scary. Even modern horror films with monsters, UFOs, etc, rest on the premise that these are real phenomena and the movies ask us to suspend our disbelief within the context of the movie."Baby Jane" is completely different, and that is why it is campy and humorous. Elegantly serving your invalid sister a rat for dinner is just too much! Over the top. Unbelievable. Outrageous. Histrionic. Bette's makeup, ditto. Joan's completely loving and devoted manner, ditto. In other words, in spite of its literal horror aspects, "Baby Jane"--in its details--is too ridiculous to believe. Only a demented sicko (Bette's character) could possibly come up with these ideas, and only an equally demented and deluded sister (Jane's role) could find Bette in any way lovable or redeemable. Both roles are such exaggerations, such extremes, that they are funny, hilarious in fact. Even the sadistic treatment by Bette of longsuffering Joan is absurdly out of kilter. One can only laugh at the histrionics.Of course, so much of the camp aspect of the movie depends on our previous knowledge of both these famous actresses. Especially important, is the long history of venomous lines uttered by Hollywood's most superbly bitchy star, Mme Davis. "All About Eve," of course, is the locus classicus for Bette's campy, dishy humor. It is another gay classic, one described elsewhere on the IMDB as "every drag queen's favorite movie.""Baby Jane" is definitely a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The difference between an actress and a star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to comment on this film as so many others have done so. But there is one thing I feel I can add. In the movie you see two of Hollywood's best known names in films. Here is the difference between them. This is only MY opinion. Bette Davis was a great actress, Joan Crawford was a great star. That is shown without a doubt in this film. Bette acts with the fearlessness of a great actor, taking chances with the role of Baby Jane Hudson and coming up trumps. Joan Crawford gives an excellent performance, but it is the performance of a star. She does not take the chances in her acting choices in the role that would make it truly bravura. The final scenes in the movie could have been that much better if Joan had been willing to open up and really act the part. Bette went for some excellent choices in the final scenes and made me feel so sympathetic for her. I felt very detached watching Joan. All in all, though, a superb film with a great cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Camp, Low Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A kitsch lover's wet dream.Bette Davis prances around wearing pancake makeup and Little-Bo-Peep dresses while her invalid sister, Joan Crawford, quakes and cowers upstairs. Jane is mad, you see, that her sister is (or was, before an "accident") the more popular actress of the two, and Jane's mission in life is to torment her sister by serving her dead rats for lunch. Better than live rats, I guess.So began the period of Davis's and Crawford's careers when they appeared in one schlock-fest after another, the juicy legitimate roles for actresses their ages having disappeared (or never existed). Crawford was always better in these star vehicles than Davis was; one could sense that Davis couldn't ever quite get over the knowledge that the roles were beneath her, while Crawford committed herself to her's wholesale. "Baby Jane" would have been an eerie case of life somewhat imitating art (if the feud between Davis and Crawford indeed existed) except for the fact that in real life Davis was by far the more successful of the two, and by most accounts would be considered to have had the more acclaimed career.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it seems every time i view this film, some hidden nuance in the demeanor of joan crawford's blanche reveals itself to me and convinces me that it is indeed miss crawford's performance which makes this film so memorable, apart from the sheer box office genius of pairing two such high profile cinema legends under one roof. one of my two favorite moments (among many memorable ones) involves the scene where blanche enters jane's bedroom to suddenly discover, after searching jane's dresser, proof of jane's check forgery as well as a surreal glossy of the real 30s joan with the face all scratched out by a jealous jane. by the way, how fabulously surreal to encounter all the hidden references to joan's mgm heyday in this movie, especially the scene where joan watches herself on tv as 'sadie mckee.' however, the actual 'revelation' of subdued acting comes when blanche finds a box of chocolates in the same drawer and then proceeds to devour some of it with marvelously ravenous relish. it is one of the most fantastically well acted and realistic portrayals of utter physical hunger i have ever seen. the expressions on her face are pricelessly conveyed by the master of facial expressiveness. one almost feels compelled to applaud. this is just one of those moments in this movie when you realize joan's performance steals the show right from under bette's nose. the other tour de force scene comes when blanche later attempts ever so precariously to make her way downstairs to get to the phone by supporting herself on the stair rail, her hair all disheveled and her face portraying consummate anxiety and despair.it appears that, while bette relies much too heavily on 'make-up and mannerisms' to do the acting for her, joan has only her very own beautifully expressive face to convey every subtle emotion in the book. that's the real difference in my opinion. bette used her ghoulish make-up as a 'prop' while joan literally had to 'act' out what was, in reality, a much more demanding role as blanche. there are also certain scenes where bette's timing seems to be oddly off for some inexplicable reason, as in the scenes where she's required to let out those hyena-like bursts of demented laughter. don't get me wrong, i do appreciate bette's jane on occasion but, as a whole, i enjoy it much more on a campy (i.e., overly mannered) level. i feel the way this movie has been perceived is all wrong. i'm inclined to believe that, while joan was in fact supposed to play a sort of 'straight man' to bette's outlandish antics in this film, joan manages, in fact, to turn the tables and make herself the real 'acting' focus in this duo, rendering bette's jane a mere 'counterpuncher' at times. part of the blame for this unexpected turn of events, of course, is due to what must've been bette's overwhelmingly insecure desire to upstage, upstage, upstage!!! at all cost and make herself a much too obvious 'look at me' target throughout this film.also, joan's wonderfully conveyed despair and horror in her swirling wheelchair after the infamous 'rat' had been served to her, brings to mind shades of a louise howell, a tragically mentally troubled crawford role from the 1947 noir classic 'possessed' which earned her a second oscar nomination.at any rate, as in 'grand hotel,' where joan steals the show from garbo, so too in 'baby jane' she steals it from davis. i guess there is always a hidden and easily incurred danger in turning an 'overt' character like that of jane's into a one dimensional, cartoon-like 'monster' of camp, which is, sadly, all we get from bette. joan, however, knew better. she knew that it was blanche's role which actually offered the most 'acting' potential and she exploited it most effectively. in retrospect, it appears much too much has been made of bette's real chances to win the oscar for her turn as 'baby jane.' after repeated viewings, one realizes that bette's highly 'campy and shock value' portrayal deserved nothing more than a nomination, and that is perhaps being too generous, in all honesty. joan's subtle turn as blanche, on the other hand, would've been the perfectly nuanced role to celebrate with 'at least' a nomination. after all, it only seems fitting to have nominated both ladies if any was to be nominated at all. to have only nominated bette for her campy orgy of overacting as jane was in itself a horrendous affront to joan's real talent and career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to see comments that judges the film for its own sake,not because it includes two of the greatest 30's stars and neither because it serves as a showcase to portray some of the real purported rivalry between them.Many reviews are based judging a film by the history it makes,sometimes much too meaning assigned to them(a case in mind seems Mullholand Dr.).So forgetting Hollywood implications I found the film quite good on its own.However,it lacks a bit of pace sometimes,which further creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.Only at the end it seems to go on full gear.The acting is restrained as well as over the top sometimes. The film goes awry in certain aspects.Bette Davis is relentlessly cruel to her sister,the only aspects of her character seem to reminisce the past and ridicule her sister.Joan Crawford is unnaturally stoic.Further there is little comic relief,the characters of Buono and even his mother appear too grim at times. It has often been compared to horror classics like Psycho,but I feel Norman Bates had more complexities going for him. However,the acting by both the leads are great and that alone is a compelling reason to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Could Have Been Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film gets off to a powerful start. On stage as a child, Jane Hudson painfully and deceitfully belts out the drippy song "I've Written A Letter To Daddy". It's directed to the naive audience in the theater where she performs. But to us, as viewers, her performance is a hint of things to come.In later years, out of jealousy and frustration, adult Jane (Bette Davis) will physically and mentally abuse her more talented, but crippled, sister, which is the basis for the movie. Bette Davis gives a performance only she could give. Joan Crawford's portrayal of sister Blanche is suitably ... restrained.As enjoyable as the film is, it could have been better if they had dumped the cruelty; played up the contrast between the past and present, using flashbacks and melancholy songs from the past; and given more screen time both to the doll and to Victor Buono. The result: a serious, more realistic, and cinematically balanced character study of a former child star, and her tragic decline.But in that case the film would be something altogether different from what it is now. And I think viewers enjoy this film specifically because of its cheap cruelty, its tacky dialogue, and its overall campy style.So I guess I'm talking about two movies ... the one that exists now and is fun to watch, and the one that could have been, with its powerful opening and potential for greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really can not understand why two wonderful actresses would have anything to do with this movie. They can not redeem this sort of pretentious horror soap. If your age exceeds 5, you are bound to find the story completely unbelievable and hilariously grotesque. Many parts of the plot are irritating, as they are evidently directed at an audience in desperate need of a brain. On the plus side: the facial expressions of Bette Davis are quite scary.Who says this is a masterpiece? This movie is not even decent. Disappointing and grotesque: C at best.</fullReview>

I watched maybe 1hr, and then abandoned this over-rated, over-long, confusing mess of a motion picture. Won't list/name flaws ... I can't count that high and, IAC, am limited to 1000 words per IMDb Guidelines!But seriously .... I've sampled plenty of similar-genre flicks or TV episodes from the late 50s/early 60s ... and there are LOTS better.

		<fullReview>S P O I L E R SThere could be no worse way to envision hell than to actually sit through this overrated, joyless, tedious film. You could age as badly as Bette Davis while waiting for two or three classic campy line readings. Joan Crawford as a spineless pushover is absurd. The arrangement of a Gothic horror house immediately adjacent to a perky, dumb suburban 60s family (with a car port) is just one of the movies off-genre puzzles. Just where one might reasonably expect some denouement, a completely unwelcome sub-plot involving Victor Buono appears, lingers, and doubles the already unbearable running time. This movie is a feat of endurance. Watching it actually is no better than hearing a drag queen repeat it's over-exposed lines for an easy laugh. The bizarre anti-climax in which the two biddies end up on the beach, and Joan dies (apparently of chattiness) is a head-scratcher.The strange, uneven sequel Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte is the better of the two as entertainment.</fullReview>
