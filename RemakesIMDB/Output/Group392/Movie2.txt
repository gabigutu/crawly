		<shortDescription>It's Norman's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this as one of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen. I enjoyed the story, the dialog and above all I enjoyed the atmosphere and the actors. All of them are great but to me Fredric March is outstanding. Norman/Alfred is a wonderful character: frail, undignified, touchy, weak and able to love Vicki/Esther so much, with all his heart. Fredric March brings all of it on the screen, providing one of his best performances here.If you would like to become an actor, I believe you should watch this movie and Mr. March's way of acting. Pay attention to his eyes, his hands, his face and his moves, especially when he interrupts his wife thanking everybody for the Oscar she got and claims he deserves three statues for the worse performances. He is overcome by himself and starts dying. I just shivered. To me, this version can't be compared to its remakes. The allure and the fascination of Hollywood have been perfectly represented here, together with an unpleasant and creepy feeling of emptiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply wonderful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not watched this movie until today, passing up each opportunity over the years to view it, as I feared it would not live up to the 1954 blockbuster starring Judy Garland and James Mason.I was right, it does not; it far surpasses the 1954 remake. Judy Garland is my favorite all-round entertainer, favorite singer, and the songs in the 1954 movie are classic treasures, and James Mason never disappoints in any film. However, in the 1937 version the story is told more sensitively, with more shading. Janet Gaynor is perfect as the home-grown farm girl seeking to make her mark in Hollywood, and Fredric March is very convincing as the has-been who cannot cope with his declining value in Hollywood, especially since he caused much of it himself.I had thought that I might miss the music in this earlier version, but I found after having watched it that I didn't miss it at all. The movie was engrossing from beginning to end and stood on its own merits. I was moved by this film in a way that I never had been by the later remake.SEE this film if you love a good story; don't put it off for years the way I did. Simply, simply wonderful...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fredric March gave a magnificent performance, probably the best of his career, as Norman Maine, the actor whose career is in the descendant as that of his wife, Vikki Lester, is in the ascendant in this, the first 'official' version of "A Star is Born", (the 1932 film "What Price Hollywood" roughly told the same story). March displays just the right degree of brashness, of knowingness, and a combination of ego and a real actor's almost complete lack of ego. It's a miraculous piece of work.As Lester, Janet Gaynor is touchingly blank but the star quality she is meant to display seems conspicuously absent; (in the 1954 musical remake Judy Garland was almost too much a star). It seems inconceivable that she could eclipse March on screen (even with his drinking). If Lester is a star and possibly a great actress Gaynor keeps the secret to herself.The script for this version was partly written by Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell and it shows. It's an acerbic and, at times, savage movie about the movies, quite cynical for a major studio picture of it's day. It is very well directed by William Wellman who draws first-rate performances from the supporting cast, in particular Lionel Stander as a heartless, slime-ball studio hack. This remains the best of the three versions to come thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>colour stardom of Esther Blodgett</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Janet Gaynor plays Esther Blodgett beautifully, a girl who leaves for Hollywood with dreams of film magazines and the blessing of her granny. Once there she finds it tough-going until meeting Norman Maine (Fredric March) at a party. We've already seen Norman drunk at a theatre but here he charms Esther and actually gets her into the movies before marrying her and watching his own career crumble. March is excellent in this, and the look of the film is surprisingly modern with its lovely technicolor and gadgets (I particularly like the shower in the motor home Esther and Norman take on honeymoon). Esther's move to become star Vicki Lester, Oscar-winning actress, is unbelievable but as her real-life tragedy unfolds, compelling. And who can stay dry-eyed at the end? Remade with music and Judy Garland in 1954 (very well) but this first version is a jewel amongst other 30s classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see this masterpiece, remember that more than 65 years have passed since it debuted on the big screen. How many contemporary films will dazzle and delight in 2065?Sure, we have seen this story before, but this was the first incarnation. Sure all films are in color today, but notice the rich, full-rigged use of color here, only a decade after talkies began. Dialogue sound familiar, well many of the lines originated here (thanks Dorothy Parker).First caught this in the movie theatre around 1975 as this David O. Selznick production had been out of circulation. Judy Garland's troubled but ultimately engrossing and hugely entertaining remake was already familiar to me. So how does a classic compare to its first version. To me, it is one of the 1930's masterworks.How perfect to cast Janet Gaynor in the role, an Oscar winner herself at 20 --- that child-like voice unforgettable. Fredric March, like Gaynor already a star and early Oscar recipient, world weary and helpless. The art deco, lavish production, haunting music, and scene after scene of "behind the scenes Hollywood", well they sure worked for me. "Kitsch" an old friend labeled it, but to me, memorable.I love watching this movie --- hope you enjoy it as well. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the all-time greats, A Star Is Born (1937) is a classic Hollywood story of power and love and the fickleness of fame. Janet Gaynor has her great talkie role and Fredric March has one of his best as the star-cross lovers, Esther Blodgett and Norman Maine. Both had already won Oscars, but both were worthy of wins here. Gaynor is wonderful as the country girl who yearns for Hollywood fame. She is a great comic actress, doing impressions of Hepburn, Garbo, and West while serving snacks at a party and trying to get noticed. She is also heartbreaking in her famous finale, "This is MRS. Norman Maine." March, who had a tendency to be hammy, strikes just the right balance between Norman's vulnerability and his pomposity. You never doubt that he loves Esther. The supporting cast is peerless, with Adolphe Menjou, May Robson (one of her best roles), Andy Devine, Lionel Stander, and Edgar Kennedy all good. The color photography is, although maybe a tad washed out now, still striking in its use of shadows. Great script and direction. One of the best. Gaynor and March deserved their Oscar nomination, but May Robson was robbed by not being nominated. Her character was left out of the 1954 remake, but she is the anchor of the 1937 version. A Star Is Born is a must for all film buffs, especially for those who have only see Gaynor is silent films, including the great Sunrise (1927).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the two later versions of this tale, it was a surprise to find the original one, even if it doesn't compare with the 50s remake with Judy Garland. This one is worth a look because of the great cinematography and the use of color for a film made in the early years of its invention. William Wellman deserves credit for his direction of a Hollywood story about itself.The mere idea of young and very naive, Esther Blodgett making it big in Hollywood, is stretching the imagination big time. This girl from the heart of the country yearns to be somebody in the pictures that are her escape from the dreary life she leads. To even think that she would have a chance in becoming a bit player, is a stretch of the imagination, but to have her become a star in her own right with her unsophisticated looks, is even harder to believe. Hollywood of those years was a factory of dreams where many went to be part of it, but for one Esther Blodgett, there were thousands who were rejected.We watch as Esther is transformed into Vicki Lester, a star larger than life, who captures the public's imagination and goes to eclipse bigger stars such as Norman Maine, her discoverer, and the man she falls in love with. Norman's decline is very fast, while Vicki's ascent into glory is even faster. His drinking habit will get the best of him at a time when help agencies such as A.A. didn't exist. Unfortunately for Vicki, she ultimately has to pay for her own meteoric success.The cast is superb. Not being a fan of Janet Gaynor, I have to confess that she strikes the right note with her Esther/Vicki role. She is totally believable even though we never even see her take an acting class, much less see her waiting tables to help herself. Frederick March brings an intensity to Norman, the self destructive star, that makes us pity him.Adolphe Menjou is the studio head who sees a winner in the young, aspiring actress, and gives her the chance. Most surprising of all is the star performance of Lionel Standing as Matt Libby, the studio publicist who is behind the creation of the new star. Andy Devine, May Robson, and the rest are equally satisfying.This film was a happy surprise in many aspects and will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps my favorite movie from the thirties. The writing, the acting, the directing, the music are virtually perfect. It is a rare kind of movie. The dialogue is sharp, smart, witty, compassionate, mature and incredibly contemporary. It could have been written last week. It is not afraid to deal with real life: alcoholism, drunk driving, failure, success, suicide. The characters are real. The drama is firmly anchored in real life. The writers are obviously good people who feel and think deeply. This movie was blissfully free from the usual contrived plots. What a breath of fresh air! The music alone makes it worth HEARING again and again.I loved the fact that the movie didn't try prove anything. It just tells a story in an esthetically satisfying manner. It is of the same high quality as "The Best Years Of Our Lives". I haven't seen subsequent versions, but they cannot possibly be as good.This the the most wonderful homage Hollywood ever paid to itself, to all those ordinary folks who became stars, or who valiantly tried and failed, or whose goals were more modest, and who achieved fulfillment behind the scenes.This is the Hollywood epic standing proud and tall, and it is impossible not to shed a tear of admiration and affection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Star Born, One Star Fades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Star is Born has had two remakes since this 1937 version, but when this film is discussed this is usually the version that stands out. I guess if the story has a moral to it, it's that for one star in 'shimmering firmament' to be born one has to die. It can be a funny end like what happens to Lina Lamont in Singing in the Rain or it can be a tragic tale as what happens to Norman Maine in this film. But Kathy Selden and Vicki Lester do go on.Esther Blodgett as played by Janet Gaynor is a symbol for all the young people, women in this case, who dream of seeing themselves on the big screen. Encouraged morally and financially by her grandmother May Robson, Gaynor goes to Hollywood and experiences all the frustrations of a young hopeful. But fate is on her side in the person of leading man Norman Maine, played by Fredric March in one of his best screen performances.Though Gaynor and March were both nominated for Gaynor the part of Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester was no stretch for her. She'd been doing the part of fresh small town girls for most of her screen career, this being the best of them. For March however, he has to play a weak character, something he had not really tackled before.I guess Hollywood knows itself better than anyone else and films about the industry can be scathing. The star is a creature with a fragile ego, one moment a whim can move mountains, a slip in public affections and no one wants to know you. March as Maine has been slipping for some time and he catches on, way too late. But as March is going down, Gaynor is on the up escalator and they meet mid point and fall in love. How they deal with their joint careers or lack thereof in one case is what A Star is Born is all about. March and Gaynor get good support from Adolphe Menjou as an understanding producer, Andy Devine as Gaynor's fellow boarder at her place of residence and most of all from Lionel Stander as the cynical press agent who inadvertently puts the finish to March's career.Gaynor's final moment on the screen is one of the great classic events as she proclaims to the world she's Mrs. Norman Maine. And why March does what he does is will start an endless discussion of speculation. Watch this film and come to your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She is a fresh-faced young star, rising in the Hollywood firmament. He is a downwardly-mobile leading man whose fondness for the bottle has ruined his career. The story is one of love and self-sacrifice within this most selfish of all industries.Roughly once every 20 years, Hollywood remakes this paean to its own heartless glamour. James Mason and Judy Garland starred in the 50's version, and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson on the 70's rendition, but for sheer emotional impact, this 1937 original is still the best.Technicolor was taking its first faltering steps with this picture, and if the colour is a little sketchy in the first half this is forgiveable. Dorothy Parker had a major hand in the screenplay, and in this movie about Hollywood artifice and the illusion of cinema, intelligent use is made of an actual script at the beginning and end, showing dialogue and screen directions.Janet Gaynor is very appealing as Esther Blodgett, the naive North Dakota country girl who makes it as Vicki Lester, megastar. She combines a wholesome girl-next-door charm with a strong talent for humour, running through a string of funny voices in the Acme Trucking Co sequence, and providing good impersonations of Garbo, Hepburn and Mae West.The leading man who falls for her gamine innocence, Norman Maine, is played with dignity by Frederic March. He does the drunk scenes realistically without hamming it up, and conveys the pain of a man who knows he is hurting the woman that he loves.Hollywood's celebration of itself extends beyond the self-referential use of a shooting script. We see planes, trains and buses bringing wannabe's to Hollywood (and this is where the Technicolor really comes into its own). The pavement outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre features prominently, and the screen test captures the bustle of the assembly-line studio mentality. Vicki jumps at the crack of the clapper-board, as if the Hollywood monster is to be feared. William Wellman's direction contains knowing ironic elements, such as the 'wipe' which imitates the closing elevator doors.The stark shadow half-across Esther's face in the first love scene is dramatic, and symbolises the tenuous nature of the relationship, with Esther in awe of the big star while Norman is all too aware of his fading powers. The scene in the night court is excellent in its restrained realism, as a line of drunken derelicts is paraded before the magistrate.One small fault that came to my attention is the clumsy edit over the end of a reel as Vicki removes her puritan mobcap. Other than that, the film is a flawless and accomplished piece of work.In the end, after the great 'sunset over the ocean' scene, Vicki decides to go on, rather than be that thing that no American can ever agree to being - a 'quitter'. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Cast &amp; An Interesting Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early version of "A Star is Born" is well-performed by a good cast, and an interesting story. The basic idea is fairly simple, but filled with potential, and it is done skillfully.Janet Gaynor and Frederic March work very well as a Hollywood couple whose careers are headed in different directions, with March's performance being especially good. The rest of the cast rounds out the picture nicely with good performances of their own. While the inside look at Hollywood is interesting in its own right, the heart of the story is the way that the couple's marriage and relationships are affected by her career taking off at the same time that his is crashing. It's the kind of story that only works with believable characters, careful writing, and convincing acting, and all of those are present here.While overshadowed by the lavish 50's remake, this earlier version is still quite worthwhile in its own right.</fullReview>

But there's a difference between dreaming and doing. The dreamers just sit around and moon about how wonderful it would be if only things were different. And the years roll on and by and by they grow and they forget everything, even about their dreams. Oh yes, you want to be somebody, but you want it to be easy. Oh you modern girls give me a pain! ''These lines say it all. This story is about our struggle to fulfill our dreams and the sacrifices we have to make for them. This is about how we can reach the unreachable by fighting for it, not by sitting on the sidelines watching it all fade away in oblivion. This is about the cruelty of love, making us vulnerable and weak. Great themes that'll never get old. Of course other flicks had the same themes, but this one really shows the pain and the effort that has to be put in it to fulfill any dream.I really liked this movie for its ironic vision on fame and how it alters the personality of the stars in a negative way. We see a man getting pushed aside because of his own destructive behavior and attitude. Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan,Amy Whinehouse, they weren't the first stars that went down in oblivion and they most certainly won't be the last ones. Those who want to survive in the cruel world of the showbiz must fight and stay clean from booze and other addictions. Only the strong survive!

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film but March steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young country girl named Ester Blodgett (Janet Gaynor) arrives in Hollywood filled with dreams of becoming a famous movie starlet. However, she gets nowhere until she's noticed by famous movie star Norman Maine (Fredric March), a performer on his way down in terms of popular appeal. The two fall in love but just as Ester's star, under the stage name Vicki Lester begins to rise, Maine's begins to fade.The best thing about this film is the performance given by Fredric March as actor Norman Maine. He nails the inner emotional turmoil going on inside his character and makes him always sympathetic to the viewer even as Maine falls in and out of sobriety. It's Maine's character that proves most interesting to the viewer here as March completely steals the film away from star Janet Gaynor.Gaynor doesn't prove quite as appealing or convincing in her lead role as Ester Blodgett/Vicki Lester and honestly it's hard to see why the public should favor her so. Maybe this was to symbolize the fickleness of the public in that they should prefer a pretty new face over a talented older one. Who knows? Nevertheless Gaynor just doesn't ever prove as appealing here in her role as she should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notable mainly for March's great performance but inferior to the Garland remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but I can't get on the bandwagon here of glowing adjectives to describe A STAR IS BORN with mousy Janet Gaynor in the Esther Blodgett role--a girl swept into big time stardom by a man whose own career is on the descent.FREDRIC MARCH plays the alcoholic Norman Maine (modeled after someone like John Barrymore) who meets Gaynor at a party, is presumably dazzled by her enough to get her a screen test, and that's how the career of Esther Blodgett starts. This would make sense if Gaynor had the sort of charm and personality suggesting she could be turned into a major star and win an Academy Award. Gaynor's screen persona here is dull and naive. Period.But somehow, that doesn't matter as much as it should because all the other characters are much better realized. The second half of the movie builds up some dramatic intensity completely missing in the dreary first half. And for some reason, the Technicolor improves as the film goes on. The interior scenes in the first half are darkly lit and look like primitive use of color.The touching ending is well handled, but I can't believe Janet Gaynor in the role of a girl whose talent is so arresting that she immediately is scooped up into the frenzy of film-making. The role should have been played by a girl in her early twenties who looks the part and has the out-sized talent needed to convince us she could be molded into a star of Vicki Lester proportions.Summing up: Disappointing, especially when compared to the Garland/Mason version, but worthwhile for Fredric March's performance as Norman Maine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had real fears about watching this film because the 1954 remake is one of my ten favorite films, and absolutely perfect in every way. It stars Judy Garland and James Mason, in my opinion two of a handful of truly great actors, and Garland's own tragedies gave the story an extra frisson and force. It makes the greatest ever use of Technicolour, intense, excessive and emotional; and its subject matter shook George Cukor out of his habitual gentility into his best direction, unafraid for once to be vulgar. It is a melodrama, it is a musical and I love it to bits. So you can imagine how initially this original felt inferior in every way. There was no musical numbers to take the load of emotions too intense to be verbalised. Janet Gaynor seemed like a mouse compared to Judy's tornado. Fredric March was a wonderfully versatile actor, particularly good in comedy, but James Mason, behind his trademark suavity, sadism and insanity, always had a sadness and resigned loneliness, a great generosity of spirit that was just right for Norman Maine. Worst of all, Wellman's direction was far too discreet and distant, making the storyline seem rather childish.And yet, as it began to build momentum, A STAR revealed itself to be a very wonderful film, quite different from its remake. For a start, it's as much a comedy as a tragedy, and there are many funny lines. The film is very bitter about Hollywood, and the sacrifices necessary for fame, as one might expect from a script co-written by Dorothy Parker, although it lacks the attention to detail that would have made the film truly corrosive. There is a seething cynicism that provides an interesting counter point to the film's weepy elements, without ever betraying them: the film opens and closes as a script, laying bear the artifice and manipulation we are about to see, mocking us for succumbing to the very canker it wants to expose. There are subtle attacks on Hollywood anti-Semitism - the very ethnic Henckel becomes WASP-worthy Norman Maine. Lionel Stander ('Moidah' Max from HART TO HART) is a very bitter publicity agent whose treatment of Norman towards the end is truly hateful, yet, we must admit, very funny.Far from being childish, the film is very mature, and is the most sensible and sensitive film about alcoholism until LEAVING LAS VEGAS. There is no judgmentalism, no trite explanations. The great tragedy is precisely this mystery: why should Norman - so attractive, so talented, so popular - give up everything at the height of his powers. It suggest demons that are way out of the depth of conventionally pat Hollywood narratives. Also sex is quite frankly present, and they got the shower sequence - where March is quite clearly naked - past the Hays Office is a mystery and a delight.A STAR is a sublime melodrama, building up to an unbearable tragic pitch. Even if you know what's going to happen, it's hard to resist the tears. This is principally due to the magnificent acting. Gaynor is truly great, convincingly maturing from a callow, ambitious, small-town girl, to a great actress who must helplessly witness the dissolution of the man she loves. March is truly heartbreaking, a worthy partner to James Mason. Norman is so patently warm, amusing, loveable, loving, that it's unbearable and unfair to watch his decline, his loss of control. As forces beyond his control topple him, he may lose his public dignity, but never our respect. Our world can't be all bad if it can find room for this masterpiece and its even better remake. Well, until we remember Mecha Streisand that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been done three times: this one in 1937, then in 1954 and finally 1976. I've now seen only this original, and only because I wanted to see a young Janet Gaynor for the first time. Beware, however: a 2012 version is now in pre-production; although, as we all know, it may never be completed ? Hollywood being what it is.Of course, this story ? rags to riches in the acting business - was done first by others ? principally Katherine Hepburn in Morning Glory (1933) and, oddly enough, again in Stage Door (1937), and again with Katherine Hepburn ably assisted by a host of well-known Hollywood actors, including the tireless Adolphe Menjou who never seemed to mind playing a Hollywood boss, in this and many other similar movies. The difference with Star, of course, is it's maybe the first movie to dig into Hollywood screen acting and make an attempt to lay it bare.So the story is banal, as most rags to riches fantasies are. Equally, however, it's an exceptionally well-done narrative that strips the gloss off Hollywood ? in a genteelly, low-key manner ? to show 1937 viewers just what it took to claw your way to the top. And, let's face it: being released in the dog days of the Great Depression and as America geared up for war, audiences of the day lapped it up. Hard times and war drums were on the way again: the people needed to see rags to riches in action, needed to know that hardship and sacrifice were just around the corner. And, failure was not an option.Today's mainstream audience, on the other hand, would probably laugh at the perceived and implied naivety of the 1930s crowd.The acting ? from Frederic March as Norman Maine (the main actor in the story ? such an appropriate name!) who is already on the slippery slopes to alcoholic and acting oblivion just as he meets and falls in love with Janet Gaynor as Esther Blodgett as the aspiring Hollywood wannabee; and both ably assisted by Adolphe Menjou as Hollywood producer, Oliver Niles ? raises it to the level of simplistic melodrama and without descending into bathos, fortunately. And that's largely due to March, who is outstanding ? literally and figuratively ? as the actor with everything to lose. Menjou does his usual, highly professional turn ? and never misses a turn or beat. And Gaynor? Well, I'd say she was perfectly cast as the newcomer who makes good, to a point: her down-to-earth, home-spun, wide-eyed trusting nature is personified with her looks, tone and carriage ? almost to the point of outdoing Shirley Temple.Oddly enough, though, Gaynor made her last movie in 1938 and did not reappear until 1957, with a guest appearance in Bernadine with Pat Boone, whom some would remember.This production of Star, in color, certainly appeals to the visual senses, displaying the lavishness that beckoned neophytes and to which stars become accustomed, all too easily. In contrast, it also shows ? with comedy or gentle satire ? the daily grind of making movies and is, perhaps, the genesis of the much over-use of out-takes, bloopers and so on in some of today's productions. Photography, editing and script ? particularly the last ? are all up to scratch, as you would expect from a Selznick/Wellman venture. Dorothy Parker ? who wrote the screenplay and who was one of literature's bete noire of the 1930s set ? constructed some of the most memorable lines in Hollywood history, especially those from Menjou. Worth seeing just for that alone, in my opinion.Interestingly and coincidentally, Nathanael West ? one-time Hollywood screen writer ? published The Day of The Locust in 1939, a novel that takes the Star story and twists it into a horrific nightmare. Not until 1973, however, did John Schlesinger direct a screen version of the same name that has not been repeated; see that one and find out why. Not to be outdone, David Lynch, film noire auteur extraordinaire, has gone one further with Muholland Drive (2001), arguably the ultimate screen statement to date about the prostitution of screen art in the pursuit of fame and fortune, and one of the grittiest horror stories ever put to film. Considering some of the scenes of both, I wouldn't at all be surprised if Lynch has seen this version of Star.As a significant piece of Hollywood history, this 1937 version should be seen by all film lovers and the starry-eyed. Highly recommended.Then, come down to earth with The Day of The Locust and deliver a coup de grace with Mulholland Drive, both of which I've reviewed for this site. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less is more; a simple, sparkling version of the oft-told tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Hollywood love story, with the participants at cross-purposes in their respective careers, and alcohol a constant troubling factor. Though not profound--and steeped in sentiment, besides--this initial version of "A Star Is Born" makes a direct connection with the audience based on empathy for its characters, not songs or razzle-dazzle. Janet Gaynor, though a very big star in the 1930s, hasn't attained a large latter-day following for (most likely) the very reason she became an attraction initially: her giving, unselfish nature makes her a prime victim for love's heartaches, and one longs for her Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester to mature on-screen. However, the set-up for this collapseable union doesn't allow for grown-up emotions, and Gaynor remains a noble, twinkling doormat for fading actor Fredric March. If you can get passed the tearjerker angle (which also permeated the 1954 and 1976 remakes), this look at early Hollywood is surprisingly canny and sharp, and the deep, rich Technicolor makes it a marvel to look at. Story idea lifted from 1932's "What Price Hollywood?", with a screenplay worked on by at least ten different writers (some credited, some not). **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me a long time to get round to seeing this classic and perhaps my expectations were a little unrealistic but I struggled through this film. May Robson plays the role of grandma admirably enough, but the beginning was unbelievably corny and the dialogue throughout the film is not particularly sophisticated apart from a retort or two from Fredric March. Without March, I don't think I could have made it through to the end of the film. And I'm prepared to accept that Janet Gaynor is a great actress but she's so underwhelming as Vicki Lester. Judy Garland might not have been a stunner but as soon as she opened her voice to sing, all was forgiven. And I think Gaynor's casting makes the whole film's premise extremely difficult to believe. I remember reading more than once that this film is still one of the most accurate portrayals of Hollywood at the time and it definitely touches on the cruelty of the star system which sees one actor catapulted into the stratosphere while another falls from great heights into the gutter. However, I think there's a more cynical side to this movie's message. And that was to keep feeding the audience with the mantra that anyone can make it in movies, however "average" your looks or talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perky aspiring actress Janet Gaynor (as Esther Blodgett) leaves her small town for Hollywood; instead of extra work, she finds work as a waitress. Ms. Gaynor breaks dishes; imitates Greta Garbo, Katharine Hepburn, and Mae West; and meets alcoholic actor Fredric March (as Norman Maine). Mr. March likes Gaynor's sweetness and sincerity; he arranges a screen test for her, and the two become romantically involved. Then, Gaynor becomes Hollywood's newest star sensation (as "Vicki Lester") while March (as "Mr. Lester")'s star sets...David O. Selznick's version of "What Price Hollywood?" (among others) is beautifully photographed (W. Howard Greene) and directed (William A. Wellman); especially noteworthy are the location scenes, with its near-final "sunset" providing an excellent thematic statement.Few of Gaynor's contemporaries could have played the early scenes with the same sincerity (which parallels her character). She is terrific as the na?ve young star; most importantly, she is believable as a woman who steps from obscurity to stardom. March is perfect as the eclipsed movie idol; it would have been nice to know more about his character's history of, and reason for, drinking (amusement is a given reason). Lionel Stander (as Matt Libby)'s portrayal of a prickly publicist stands out, among the supporting cast (Adolphe Menjou, May Robson, and Andy Devine).This film was heralded as realistic depiction of "Hollywood" stardom; and, there are cute, clever, and realistic details throughout. Nothing too extraordinary is revealed, however. The film barely scratches the surface; and, it is curiously more asexual than previous cinematic trips down the walk of fame (it was affected by the "Hays Code", no doubt). Still, due to its strengths, this version of "A Star Is Born" compares most favorably with subsequent versions. ********* A Star Is Born (4/20/37) William A.

		<shortDescription>The tragedy of Norman Maine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fredric March and Janet Gaynor co-star in this early 30's Technicolour film. It is one of the best of it's era, and was justifiably nominated for a swag of Academy Awards.Gaynor portrays small-town dreamer Esther Blodgett, who comes to Hollywood courtesy of assistance from her sympathetic, determined grandmother. Trying to break into the movies, she gets a job waiting at an A-lister party, where she happens to meet alcoholic matinée idol Norman Maine (March). Despite his drunken, foolish state he finds her inherently appealing in a sweet, attractive manner, and arranges for her to get a screen test. After a name change (hello, Vicki Lester), make-over and acting lessons she is soon starring with Maine in his latest picture, and garners enormous public and critical praise. Inevitably, as these films go, Esther and Norman fall in love and marry. However, as Norman starts to achieve great personal happiness his career goes down the plughole, and even Esther/Vicki is powerless to stop his decline.March is terrific in a challenging role. He handles Norman's decline brilliantly; March was always terrific at accurately capturing a character's emotional state. It is one of the best portrayals of an alcoholic that I have seen, because March focuses on the pain, the resentment, that causes him to drink, rather than just the ugly aftermath that a binge leaves in it's path. He makes Norman more than a superficial Hollywood star- he makes him REAL. There's no Method applied to his work, it's just darn good skill at characterization. March could play comedy equally well as drama, so Norman is not a one-dimensional, tragic star in March's hands. Rather he is a multi-dimensional, charismatic, lovable yet ultimately flawed individual caught up in the money-hungry giant that is Hollywood.One is reminded of John Barrymore in the character of Norman Maine. Barrymore was also a big-shot whose career declined heavily in the 30's because of his alcoholism. It was no secret in Hollwyood as to what he was. March, a smart actor, would have drawn on this in his portrayal.Ganyor, the winner of the first Best Actress award, is also very good as Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester. Her natural sweetness and quite nature give Esther a unique spirit. Esther is not just a wishy-washy, typically 'nice' girl- she is strong and willing to stick by Norman because of her faith and her faith in their love. Gaynor also does rather funny impersonations of Garbo, Hepburn and West at a Hollywood party that reveal a knack for comedy. Yet, it is almost impossible to see Esther/Vick's 'star' qualities in this film. Gaynor certainly keeps them under wraps, and one has to stretch the imagination to imagine that Gaynor, as capable an actress as she was, could possibly out act the great March.Nice supporting work from Adolphe Menjou as a Hollywood producer, and Lionel Stander is just poisonous as the vile Libby, who, while justifiably fed up with March and his chronic drinking and star tantrums, has not a sympathetic bone in his body. May Robson as the Grandma is good also, but a little tiresome after a while (I think it's more how her character was written than her acting abilities). A nice bit of trivia- she was a native Australian! The early Technicolour looks quite good, but it is slightly primitive, so one must overlook this fact to appreciate the film properly. There are some wonderful sequences here- March's outburst at the Academy Awards, Esther and Norma's first meeting, March's final scene. The film loses a bit of class in the parts March is not present. This is understandable, as he was such a dominant presence and magnificent actor. Gaynor perhaps couldn't carry a film by itself at this stage in her career, which is ironic as her star was actually sliding in real life, not March's. He was enjoying the best success of his career; she would only make a few more motion pictures before retirement from the screen.A satire on the entertainment industry and also a heartbreaking character study of a marriage ravaged by the effects of alcohol and one partner's growing dissatisfaction with life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dying star's story far more interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie's title was "A Star Slowly Dies," I would have probably given the film a better rating because the parts about Norman Maine were far better than the parts about Esther Blodgett.The central problem with the movie is that there is NO evidence that Blodgett became a star because of her talent. In the 1954 movie, James Mason's Maine is blown away by the singing ability of Judy Garland's Blodgett. In this version, Fredric March's Maine makes Janet Gaynor's Blodgett a star because he wants to get her into the sack. I'm not making this up.The start of "Star" sets us up for an Horatio Alger story ? an ordinary woman who takes a huge gamble to become an actress despite most of her family's wishes. I waited for a scintilla of evidence that Blodgett had any acting ability or experience. Did she act in a community theatre? Why did she think she could be an actress? These questions, and others, are never answered.Blodgett's story is supposed to be inspirational. Instead, it is depressing. After moving to Hollywood, she gets a job as a waitress at a gathering of entertainers. There, Maine, a huge star, meets her and finds her really hot. Subsequently, he dates her and then gets her a screen test and a co-starring role in his next movie although he's never seen her perform.This narrative is depressing because she became a star as a result of Maine objectifying her, and a plain-looking woman with talent would have failed.In a good story, the writers would have shown us that Blodgett was a great actress. Instead, we're just told that she is. We're shown approximately 10 seconds of her first movie, and she spends most of that time kissing Maine. But, we do hear critics lavishly praise her. By contrast, the 1954 version SHOWS us that Blodgett/Garland is a terrific singer.As I watched the first half of the movie, I was tempted to label it a failure. However, it gets much stronger in the second half as it focuses less on Blodgett and more on Maine. Once a star, he declines as she rises. His alcohol-fueled psychological breakdown riveted me.In short, Maine's breakdown was portrayed far better than Blodgett's rise. The movie also has an interesting, sardonic take on the phoniness of the movie industry and how it treats even its stars with a total lack of respect.Interestingly, one of the problems with the 1937 version of "Star" is that it is too short while the 1954 one is far too long. This is partly because the 1954 movie is a musical while this one is not. This version should have spent more time developing its characters.I gave "Star Is Born" a 6, balancing the 4 that I gave Blodgett's story with the 8 that I gave Maine's story.ZWrite</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great three-story film of hope, love, heartbreak and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw all three versions of "A Star is Born" in the past, and enjoyed watching this original and the 1954 remake again after so many years. What superb acting by Frederic March as Norman Maine, Janet Gaynor as Vicki Lester/Esther Blodgett, and all of the rest of this excellent cast. After many years between viewings, I was struck by the uniqueness of this film. Two aspects in particular stand out. First, that it is really three movies in one, with distinct stories. Second, that it has at least three major messages. The latter are so carefully woven into the script ? and so well acted out ? that most viewers may not be consciously aware of them. So, the genius of the script is in its putting all of this together in a most enjoyable and watchable story, without hitches or glitches.Most movies have a single story, with the different characters and roles as part of it. Usually, they center on the hero or heroine, the romance of the two, or a major plot of war, crime, intrigue or adventure. But, in this original, we see first, a story of a young small-town girl, Esther/Vicki, who dreams of becoming a movie star. The opening scenes set the stage for her "escape" to Hollywood. The message is about taking risks to chase one's dreams (as her grandmother counsels and relates of past family history). The next scenes show her difficulties in trying to break into the movies. She is behind in her rent and finds odd jobs as she looks for a break. We see the hopelessness and little likelihood of someone making it in Hollywood (one in 100,000, the woman at the acting agency tells her). But, we also see her determination to keep trying.Now the second story begins to unfold. Only, we understand that the male lead's story (Norman Maine) has been going on for many years in Hollywood. He has reached his peak, and while still near the top, he has become a headache and problem to his studio because of his drinking the past several years. We don't know why he apparently has never married, but it's clear that his career has been his obsession. Now he is becoming a big publicity problem for the studio. By coincidence, these two people meet, and the third story begins. A deep love blossoms between the two with their ultimate marriage. Lester's star rises and the first story fades as her dream is fulfilled ? she has become a star. The male lead's story and the love story are now tightly (no pun intended) intertwined. In his love for her, and awareness of his drinking problem and acting decline, Maine bows out of films and stops drinking. Over time, he becomes distant as he realizes that he is no longer recognized. Finally, after a messenger boy calls him by his wife's stage name ("Mr. Lester"), he snaps and goes back to drinking. After more run-ins with the law and drying out in a sanitarium, Maine is set to return home. But a chance encounter with the studio publicity man, Matt Libby (excellently played by Lionel Stander), spells doom for Maine. He can't stand the PRs insults about being supported by his wife, and after a brawl, he steps up to the bar to resume his drinking. The next scenes show Lester and studio head Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou) worrying about where Maine is after four days. They get a call and Lester gets a judge to release Maine to her care. The courtroom scene is a great example of the humiliation of the man, now having sobered up, standing with other drunks, many of whom may live in the gutter, and being further embarrassed by having his wife appeal for him. Back in their California beachfront estate, Lester and Niles have put Maine to bed. They think he is sleeping but he hears them talking in the next room. Because of her love for Maine, Lester tells Niles that she is quitting the movies, and that she and Maine will go away together. Maine can hear Niles urge Lester not to give up her career at its peak. We can see the anguish and torment on his face. In Maine, we have a real story of conflict between the man, with his ego and no longer being revered as a movie idol, and his deep love for his wife and genuine respect and hopes for her success.I won't describe the last scenes ? of Maine and Lester. His story ends on a tragic note. And the love story ends on a sad note. The subtle messages become clear. First, stardom, wealth and success don't buy happiness. Remember the veranda scene when Maine tells Lester that she now owns the world as they look out over the city lights below? And then he says that he has never found happiness with success. Second, that pride and ego can destroy love when one person can't humble himself and struggle to rise above his failings for himself and that love. Even as an alcoholic, Maine was able to quit once ? with help. But now he doesn't want to try again. Third, we should not be fooled by the allure of Hollywood and success that come mostly from phony build-ups and PR (i.e. the fictitious bio and lies by the studio PR guy to the press and public). I couldn't help but think of the adulation so many still heap on the movie stars and celebrities of today. And, how so few of them seem to have real happiness and love with their wealth and worldly success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poignant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good film with a great cast. I've seen reviews stating this film pales in comparison to the remake, due to the fact that you get to 'see' that Judy Garland's character can sing, but you don't get to 'see' that Janet Gaynor's character can act. This is where I think the point of what this story is meant to portray is being lost by the viewer. The title isn't referring to the 'meteoric rise' of the female character, it is referring to the tragedy she endures, and how she chooses to overcome it that brings the birth of the 'Star'. In a way, Norman Maine gave his life for his wife to be born, he felt he was hampering her career and her life, so he wished to free her. Janet Gaynor was a star long before this movie came out, so it is really unfair to state that one can't believe she didn't appear to be someone that could have made such an impact in Hollywood. She'd been playing the naive type for quite some time, she played it well here, but she, also, portrayed her progressive maturity quite well and quite believably. As for me, this version shines far above the remake, because of the main character portrayals and for the outstanding supporting cast. This movie focused on the Gaynor character's experiences influenced by those around her, mostly with March's character. The remake seemed, to me, to focus mostly on the Garland character a little too much, not really getting the feel of those around her other than James Mason's character, but even it wasn't as deeply explored and conveyed as the Norman Maine character of the 1937 version. This is not taking anything away from Mr. Mason's performance, because there's no doing that, he was a great actor. However, the Frederic March portrayal was more compelling due to the fact the script allotted him to be, plus, Mr. March was a wonderful actor, one of my all time favorites. Then, you, also, have Adolphe Menjou, May Robson, Lionel Stander, and Andy Devine, all giving stellar performances. When you have a great cast like this, with a script this well written and a great director like William Wellman (whom had some very, very great pre-codes under his belt), it's a win-win situation. This movie deserved it's best picture award. And just reading comments on this movie, especially, in regards to the ending of the Norman Maine character through to the end line, I tear up, so corny, but true. This was, and still is, a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Should Have Been Called "A Star Falls"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It struck me that the focus was a bit off in this movie - a focus established by the title, which seems to put the spotlight on Esther. Janet Gaynor was excellent in the part of Esther in what was basically a very good movie - but nothing (not even the title) should have implied that Esther was the focus of the movie. Esther as a character just really didn't make that much of a connection with me. I didn't care all that much about her.Esther was a naive and innocent country girl - dazzled by the movies; attending the "moving pictures" in town, and reading all the gossip magazines. She harbours a dream to go to Hollywood and become a star herself. Her family is either amused by her dream, or they're disdainful of it and even antagonistic toward it - except for her grandmother, who finally gives her the cash to travel to California. Once there, Esther doesn't have much luck finding acting jobs, and money is hard to come by. But one day, working as a waitress at a big Hollywood party, she meets movie star Harold Maine (Fredric March), who is smitten with her and arranges for her to star opposite him in his next movie. Renamed Vicki Lester, Esther becomes a huge star. It's a success story, a story of following your dreams. And that's fine - except that the focus of this really needed to be on Harold.First, March was absolutely superb in the part. But more than that, Harold was simply the more interesting character. His career was on the downswing by the time he met Esther. Parts were getting harder for him to find, the reviews were getting worse and he was starting to drink heavily. I was sympathetic to him, as I watched his entire life crumble around him. I was embarrassed for him as I watched him stumble from one drunken public escapade to another. He loved Esther, but even then he found himself overshadowed by her, to the point at which he was barely recognized, and referred to as "Mr. Lester." March's concluding scene (after he's heard Esther say that she's going to give up her career to help him) is powerful. There's a marvellous message sent by director William Wellman as, during that final scene, he has Harold staring out the window at the sun setting over the ocean, and you know what's coming: an act of self-sacrifice, so that Esther won't have to give up her career to care for him. March's performance and the character himself is powerful; at times riveting.There's also a lot of reflection on the idea of "stars" - the publicity machine that makes them but just as easily spits them out; there's an early look at a sort of paparazzi frenzy around Harold; there's the adoring fans who pester Esther for an autograph - while she's leaving the church after Harold's funeral!It's a very well done movie. I just thought that it was a mistake to have the title focus on Esther, when the power of the movie was Harold's fall and ultimate demise. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Mind if I take one more look?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director William Wellman notoriously hated actors. It seems bizarre then that the one time he wrote his own screenplay it was a rather affectionate look at the lives of the stars. Hollywood didn't do introspection all that much, but here was woven a tragical drama that was absolutely in tune with the Tinseltown ethos, even as it brought to light its more troubled aspects.Wellman was, for the biggest part of his career, a director of action movies. And even though A Star is Born is a drama centring on a female character, he still films it with an emphasis on dynamics and rugged impact. Janet Gaynor is introduced with a rapid dolly-in as she comes through a doorway. In the scene that follows everyone is spitting out their dialogue. The scene ends with a close-up of Gaynor, after which she swiftly exits from the frame, leaving the screen totally black. And this is very much the pattern for the rest of the picture. It's a neat approach which gives things a fast-paced and punchy feel.As to the actual stars of this movie, Gaynor and Fredric March were two of the most experienced players around who were still in the right age and popularity bracket to get lead roles. Janet Gaynor was one of the more subtle and realistic performers of that era. She has such earnestness in her eyes, and despite actually being at the end of her own illustrious career, she utterly convinces as a keen youngster taking her first steps in the industry. March is much more theatrical, but he has an intensity that makes him very watchable.A Star is Born seems to have become a kind of touchstone story of Hollywood stardom. It's been remade twice for different generations, and a fourth version is reportedly in the works as I type. This first version is not quite the best, but it lays down a story that will remain timeless for as long as Hollywood continues to thrive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First One is still Best.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fredric March is one of my very favorite actors, and almost all of his movies are quality merchandise. I've not seen them all, but of all that I have seen, they all rate high in my book. This version of "A Star Is Born" is very special...it was made just a decade after pictures converted to sound. If we put the action 'right in the moment', one wonders how Norman Maine could have been washed up in less than a decade...especially if he passed all the rigorous criteria to make it into the talkie era. But we must suspend common sense for a time, in order to get into the movie. His star is fading even as we are introduced to him. Wine, women, song, and the theatre of the bombastic have all taken their toll on Norman. Everybody is back-biting him as being washed up in the business...and all seem to know it ...except Norman, that is. Meeting aspiring starlet from the Midwest, Esther Blodgett, is a bit of serendipity for both of them...though with different outcomes. He arranges a screen test, even twists the producer's arm to star her in a vehicle, which is a success. As her star rises, his continues to fade and fade until he is practically dead in the business. If he had problems when he was still a star, you can imagine what horrors he must have endured as his career is eclipsed by that of his wife, now known as Vicki Lester, who has begun to appear in her own highly acclaimed movies...even winning a coveted Academy Award (which Gaynor did in fact win some years earlier...the first actress to be awarded in her category). Humiliation is piled upon humiliation for Norman. Vicki loves him so much that she decides to put the brakes on her own career to take care of him. Norman now sees that he has lost all that he had, but cannot endure this selfless sacrifice his wife is making. If you have not already seen the movie ( are there aliens living amongst us?) or one of its several derivatives, I will stop there, and let you see the movie for yourself. The performances are sensitive, and this was probably one of Hollywood's first efforts to look at itself with some measure of honesty. The viewer connects with Esther Blodgett and her aspirations, and they want her to win. Fredric March draws out the true tragedian that Norman Maine represents, and his performance shows how pitiful one can become when one's life is shattered and dreams and ambitions disappear like snowdrifts in the springtime. Kudos go to Adolphe Menjou as producer Oliver Niles, Lionel Stander as the no-nonsense PR man ( what a contradiction in terms), who has no sympathy for Norman and contributes to Maine's ultimate decline...and to May Robson. May we all have a Granny like her to come to the rescue in our darkest hour. This version of a "Star Is Born" is best because it is the most dramatic and most honest of the numerous versions. It is raw and gritty, yet it never loses its focus or sensitivity. See the other versions of the movie if you feel you must, but do make an effort to see this one first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star is Born, A (1937) **** (out of 4) I guess the story of this film is familiar to everyone but this is the first version of the story that I've actually watched. A country girl (Janet Gaynor) goes to Hollywood to become a star but hits hard times until she meets the famous Norman Maine (Fredric March). Maine gets the girl into a movie and she shoots to the top of Hollywood's A list but it comes at the same time as his fall from grace. I read a couple reviews of this film and it seems to take a lot of beatings today because of the story but I think it's important to note that this was the first one so you really can't blame it for having a familiar story. I thought the movie was great from start to finish and like most great movies this one here has just about everything going for it. The performances are great, the story is both tragic and funny and Wellman's direction is top-notch. The Technicolor also does the film a lot of good making it appear all the more epic. I thought the stories of Gaynor and March were both perfectly done. The start of the film deals with her rise to fame and thought they captured a lot of mood and feelings. The second half of the film is even better as this is when the drama of March's character falling apart comes into play. I guess you could say you knew what was going to happen but I still found it quite dramatic and rather heartbreaking. Adolphe Menjou, May Robson and Andy Devine are all terrific in their supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Esther Blodgett (Janet Gaynor) goes to Hollywood to become a star. There she meets Norman Maine (Frederic March) who was big but whose alcoholism is destroying his career. They fall in love and get married. Esther quickly becomes a big star while Norman's career disappears. Will their marriage survive? Familiar story but beautifully done. It was shot in rich Technicolor and won a special Oscar for it. It also won an Oscar for Best Story. The two leads are great in their roles and the movie moves at a quick pace. Everybody knows how this story will turn out but it's so well-done it won't bother you. It was redone twice--once with Judy Garland in the 1950s and then Barbra Streisand in the 1970s. The Streisand one is terrible but the Garland one is great. This is just as good as the Garland one. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannot Compare to Judy Garland Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1937 version of "A Star is Born" is wedded to its era in the declamatory, over-the-top acting style. While Janet Gaynor and Frederick March are good in the leads, the ensemble is weak in its old-style, ham acting.The film attempts to chronicle the rise of a young actress in opposition to the decline of the actor who has assisted her on her ascent to becoming a Hollywood star. Gaynor is especially delightful in the naive starlet. March is less convincing as the alcoholic, self-destructive Norman Maine.The film begs comparison with the 1954 film that featured James Mason and Judy Garland. In that version, the actress is also a singer, and the film showcased the unlimited talents of Garland. By contrast the Gaynor-March film was bland and non-engaging. The 1954 film also featured the talents of director George Cukor with stunning widescreen cinematography.Both films capture the smug and cutthroat world of Hollywood. But in the Gaynor-March version, once the young actress Vicki Lester has become a star, the momentum of the film is lost. The 1937 version of the film simply has not stood up to the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William A. Wellman's 1937 masterpiece "A Star Is Born" was one of the first movies to focus on the vicissitudes of fame. Janet Gaynor plays a farm girl who moves to Hollywood with the aim of becoming an actress. When she finally does, it happens as her lover's (Fredric March) career falls apart.The odd coloring helps to give a sense of the underbelly of all the glitz and glamor. It's inevitable that for one person's career to rise, another person's career must decline. The 1954 version starring Judy Garland and James Mason was much flashier but still managed to retain the original's spirit (I haven't seen the 1976 version starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson).This movie is undeniably one of cinema's all-time classics. Janet Gaynor and Fredric March are perfect in their roles. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She had her priorities straight; His were straight out of the bottle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What price does Hollywood cost? Five years after Lowell Sherman and Constance Bennett asked that question, a new film, unofficially based upon that almost forgotten classic, came along, and created a legend which has (thus far) spawned two remakes, one even more famous than itself. Hollywood has always created dreams that turned into nightmares, not only for the young hopefuls who came out from the middle of nowhere and ended up jumping off the Hollywood sign, but for those who had made it and were branded "has-beens". Think of the fictional Norma Desmond and the Hudson Sisters. Think of the real life sign jumper Peg Entwistle, as well as dwindling stars like John Barrymore, Ramon Novarro, Montgomery Clift and others who couldn't handle the pressures that hit them for various reasons and ended up with somewhat tragic finales. Hollywood can present much beauty, but for those inside the business, it is a living hell.Esther Blodgett (Janet Gaynor) is a young hopeful from hundreds of miles from Hollywood who longs to come to "Tinseltown" and work with the legends like the fictional Norman Maine (Fredric March), an Oscar Winner slowly falling down the ranks thanks to bad publicity, bad films, and especially, way too much booze. She struggles for months even just to get the rent paid and is on the verge of quitting when a miracle happens. By chance, she meets Mr. Maine who takes a liking to her (having earlier "shusshed!" her at a concert) and presents her to movie mogul Oliver Niles (Adolph Menjou) as a potential new star. She's fresh and unique, likable and talented, perky and sober. In short, she's everything Norman Maine is not. Her rise will mark his downfall, and yet nobody knows other than a few people that it was his confidence in her which helped build her star even brighter than his own."Esther Victoria Blodgett!", press agent Lionel Stander shouts, aghast. Cutting out "Blodgett", Niles comes up with "Vicky Lester", telling everybody to shout out "Say Vicky Lester!", to which Stander cynically replies "Vicky Vicky". But a bit part isn't enough for her, and at Norman's request, she gets the female lead in his newest film which is a smash for her but a critical slap for him. His pictures continue to bomb, and hers are hits, winning her an Oscar which results in his public humiliation. By this time, Norman and Victoria are married (under their real names), the offended Stander is outraged, and the stage is set for a finale both tragic and triumphant.As much as we have been warned about Hollywood success, we haven't learned that only a few rise to the top and stay there without any type of scandal. Norman Maine, whether being Lowell Sherman's version in "What Price Hollywood" or March's or James Mason or even Kris Kristofferson, can't bear a morning shoot without a drink, and for each drink he takes marks another notch towards his downfall. Gaynor, pretty much a has-been herself after being replaced at 20th Century Fox with Shirley Temple taking over the "leading star" spot, needed a hit like "A Star is Born" and is outstanding. She's comical (imitating a variety of stars at a Hollywood party) and touching, while March is profound, even in Norman's most drunken state.Playing a film studio owner/lead producer much like Selznick or Goldwyn, Menjou is a gentle patriarchal figure, loyal to March's Norman but unable to help him get another leading role thanks to the proved failures of his past. Stander is gruff and even nasty, letting his vile towards Norman spill out so evilly that you know that even the strongest person fighting to stay sober would be tempted to break their pledge. Andy Devine is amusing as Gaynor's confidante, with May Robson authoritative as her beloved grandmother and an unbilled Clara Blandick dominating every moment of the opening scene as the movie-hating aunt.Everything about this film is outstanding, with excellent Technicolor photography and a structure which has the film open and end as if it were the visions inside the opening shot of the first page of the screenplay and its last as the film wraps up. William Wellman was a master of storytelling and utilized Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell's screenplay to almost become a "Hollywood Bible" to indicate the ten commandments of becoming a star with "Hell" being big stars becoming has-beens for breaking these rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Price Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The David O. Selznick production of A STAR IS BORN (United Artists, 1937), as directed by William A. Wellman, is a Hollywood story, one of many perhaps, with that all too familiar theme of fame and fortune not always bringing happiness, yet regardless of its timely message ("tragedy is a test of courage"), there's no doubt that this adaptation ranks one the finest in the lot. Janet Gaynor, a star who was born a decade ago during the silent film era, and being the first actress to win an Academy Award (1928-29), is appropriately cast in her best screen role in a sound film in what might have been Gaynor, "a star reborn," this time in glorious Technicolor.Opening with the final shooting script with description of Scene One, fade-in to farmhouse in Fillmore, South Dakota, the plot gets immediately underway with Esther Blodgett (Janet Gaynor), an avid movie fan, returning home from the theater with her little brother Alex (A.W. Sweatt). Because of her love for the movies and wanting to become an actress, she is criticized and ridiculed by her father (J.C. Nugent) and especially Aunt Mattie (Clara Blandick). As for her grandmother (May Robson), she believes in Esther. After being offered her life savings, Esther takes the next train bound for Hollywood where she is to seek fame and fortune, even if it "breaks her heart". Esther registers at the boarding house run by "Pop" Randall (Edgar Kennedy), applies for acting jobs at numerous studios, and while one good natured receptionist tells her she has a thousand to one chance of ever making it, Esther believes she's that one who will. After an introduction with co-director Danny McGuire (Andy Devine), who lands her a job as a waitress at a Hollywood party, Esther meets Norman Maine (Fredric March), her favorite movie idol who becomes attracted to her, so much by her beauty that whenever she exits, he asks, "Do you mind if I have just ... one more look?"&nbsp; Norman talks producer Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou) into giving Esther a screen test, followed by a motion picture debut under a new professional name of Vicki Lester, cast opposite Norman in "The Enchanted Hour." After Vicki and Norman marry, Vicki's career reaches great heights, to a point of being voted best actress at the eighth annual Academy Awards, while Norman's popularity declines to the point of being terminated from his studio and turning to alcoholism that puts a tremendous strain on their marriage.With Janet Gaynor in a well deserved Academy Award nominated performance that might have paved the way for stronger performances, she's retired from the screen by 1938. Co-stars Fredric March also gives a great indication of a has-been actor that, too, earned him a best actor nomination, and May Robson, whose character appears during the opening and closing segments, was good enough to even get nominated in the supporting category. Other performers worth noting include Lionel Stander as Matt Libby, the gravel voice press agent; Elizabeth Jeans as Norman Maine's domineering escort; Jed Prouty as columnist for "Cinema Sidelights," Franklin Pangborn and Guinn Williams in smaller roles.Aside from the fact that things happen so fast in A STAR IS BORN, the story gives the impression as being set solely in 1937 rather than a five or ten year span considering that much of the sets, womens fashions and hair styles appear to be the same throughout. The only notable change is Gaynor, whose character changes from young hopeful to a maturing movie star.The popularity of A STAR IS BORN did lead to musical remakes from Warner Brothers: 1954, with Judy Garland and James Mason; and in 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. Because of&nbsp;the Garland remake, the original version was kept out of circulation until around 1974-75 when it finally began appearing regularly on television, much to the amazement of a new generation of movie watchers unaware that the 1937 original ever existed. While many may argue the Garland version surpasses Gaynor's, which it does in some ways, the earlier screen treatment is more logical as a dramatic story rather than an overblown musical. The Vicki Lester portrayed by Garland is that of a great singer whose talent much better serves Broadway than Hollywood. Gaynor's Vicki belongs in Hollywood because she's strictly an actress. Regardless of several alterations, the first two are classics in their own right.With its availability on video cassette, DVD, and presentations on various cable TV networks, ranging from Nickelodeon's "Nik-at-Nite Movie" prior to 1988; American Movie Classics (1990s) and Turner Classic Movies, A STAR IS BORN, a soap-opera with some doses of humor, remains a realistic look at Hollywood's Hollywood that's still timely today. Regardless of whatever flaws, it' worthy of repeated viewings. "You mind if I have just ... one more look?" (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>March and Gaynor give a good account of themselves here, overriding the naive, cliched tendencies of this standard Hollywood story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those directly or indirectly involved in the entertainment field, will find 1937's "A Star Is Born" somewhat laughable and hard to swallow. Mired in cliches, this version is a couple of notches below the superior Judy Garland/James Mason 1954 remake and a couple of notches above the Barbra Streisand/Kris Kristofferson second remake (1976). Well respected upon its initial release, it was a major Oscar nomination grabber come awards time. In fact, the movie's dramatic script, probably the film's weakest link, went on and won an Oscar nevertheless.On the plus side are the lead performances. Janet Gaynor plays a verrrrrry naive but determined mid-western country lass, Esther Blodgett, who defies small town mores and a typically narrow-minded family to seek fame and fortune in Tinseltown. With apparently no acting experience whatsoever, our heroine struggles valiantly for at least a few months (with granny's help -- the family's sole supporter) before happening upon Frederic March's Norman Maine, a former matinee film idol on the decline. Maine meets Blodgett at a Hollywood party (she's actually the hired help) and takes an immediate romantic interest in the starry-eyed girl, so much so that he winds up getting her a studio contract on her sweet, winsome looks alone -- experience be damned! If stardom were only that easy. Ah well, if Lana Turner can be discovered sipping a soda at a malt shop (or so they say), why not this?Anyway, while Gaynor as Esther Blodgett-turned-Vicki Lester is quite winning, she has a full-time job overcoming the triteness of this obvious rags-to-riches story and narrowly succeeds by the skin of her teeth. Unlike Garland's Vicki, we never truly get to witness the genius of this supposedly innate, Oscar-winning talent Gaynor's Vicki has, save for a small stale bit with Maine at their film premiere. March (whose looks and voice is startlingly reminiscent of Gene Kelly here) comes off much better as the dipsomaniac star who has seen better days, although James Mason gave a far more trenchant and terrifying portrait of self-destruction in the Garland remake.Adolphe Menjou who created the Charles Bickford studio executive part and, especially, Lionel Stander as the publicity agent later played by Jack Carson, shine in their subordinate but finely tuned roles, helping to counter-balance the banal tendencies of the script, while May Robson's spiky but wise, benevolent granny, Clara (Auntie Em) Blandick's acidulous aunt, Elizabeth Jenns' actress paramour, Andy Devine's true-blue friend, and Edgar Kennedy's pop get caught up soundly in the film's cliches.Hollywood 'realism' has never been more obvious or watered down than here, yet the film still manages to give off a quaint charm and appeal that makes it bearable today. The first half of the movie is especially hard to take, but as the dramatic unfoldings take place, you'll find yourself caught up.It's worth a look just for comparison's sake.</fullReview>

That is the Almost Slapstick Humor like the Screen Test and the Makeup Scenes and the Downer Side to the Story, that of a Fallen Star. It is Careers in Contrast and the Collision and the Result is an Uneven Mix of Satire and Melodrama.Fredrich March is by Far the Best Performance while Janet Garynor is Consistently Unconvincing both as a Starry Eyed Starlet and a Bonafide Star. She sounds like Minnie Mouse and Broods a lot. It is Heavy Handed, Dated Stuff and even in its Day was Probably as Over Praised as it is Today. Sure it was the First Version of this Thrice Filmed Tale and it is in Early Thirties Technicolor (very rare), but the Conflicting On Screen Styles of Humor and Tragedy are Over Baked and don't Blend Well in most Respects. The Side Characters, except for Adolphe Menjou as the Producer are Obnoxious, Cartoonish and Loud.Worth a Watch for its Place in Film History, the Classic Story, the Technicolor, the Awards, the Accolades, and Friedrich March's Restrained Role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best version? I agree!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This said though, the 1954 Judy Garland film is still a fine film with timeless songs and Garland's best ever performance. Both are streets ahead of the 1976 Barbra Streisand version where the only outstanding things are three of her songs and her singing, the rest is an example of a film with a couple of other small pluses and too many big minuses. This version from 1937 is wonderful, it is too short and it is a case of the second half is better than the first half(though this is more an even better rather than a significantly better) but there's still plenty to love. The early strip Technicolor is ravishing, and the film looks just as lavish as the 1954 film with a real Hollywood behind-the-scenes feel. It's beautifully scored too, you don't have those truly great songs from the 1954 which is a pity in a way but when everything is done as well as it is you don't miss them either. The screenplay has since become classic status, and with dialogue that is vibrant, witty, heart-breaking and caustic along with one of the greatest ever last lines it is very easy to see why. It is the story mainly where this scores a little over 1954(very close together these two are), the pacing is more fluid, the storytelling is perhaps more sensitive and I found myself moved more, the ending is genuinely poignant. The drama is hugely compelling in the second half, aided by William A Wellman's intelligent direction, the first half is not quite so much but unlike the 1976 film hardly is it a slog either. The performances are top-notch, Adolphe Menjou and Lionel Stander coming off the best in supporting roles, of the three films it's this version with the most well-fleshed-out characters in my opinion. Janet Gaynor is eclipsed by Judy Garland, but does wonderfully in her own way, her character is the kind that goes on a journey(literally and in character) and Gaynor captures that youthful naivety developing into maturity very well. Best of all is Fredric March in one of his finest performances, a more meaty role than Gaynor's but one done with great theatrical command and touching nuance. One of the best things about this film absolutely. The two do have good chemistry and you do at least believe what the two characters individually and together are going through, it's done a little better in the 1954 film but you don't get any of this at all in the one from 1976. To conclude, poignant, lavish, beautifully performed and superbly written, a great film and the best version. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Gaynor has neither the looks nor the charisma needed to make it believable that a movie star would fall flat for her or that the movie-going public would make her an overnight sensation.

		<fullReview>Perhaps, it's because of the crackling of the film, but the 1937 version of "A Star is Born," doesn't hold a candle to the musical version of 17 years later.Janet Gaynor, as Esther/Vickie, doesn't hold a candle to Judy Garland's interpretation of the same role. Fredric March is wonderful, but even he was eclipsed by James Mason in the Garland version.Gaynor seemed rather too shy for the part and there is a total lack of dramatic intensity on her part which was sorely needed.The 1937 film was in black and white and this may very well have been appropriate to set the moody dramatic stage. With the musical version, you needed the necessary color to highlight not only the musical numbers, but the emotional heartbreak as well.</fullReview>
