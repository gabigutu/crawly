		<shortDescription>Musical miscarriage ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this: Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up, followed by another two-and-half-minute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand -- striking a Christ-like pose -- behind the closing credits. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra's distinctive visage dead center, filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record.Or think about this: The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars, yet, while Streisand's songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar Kris Kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Nor, though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties, do they actually sing a duet.Or consider this: Streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times, including taking credit for "musical concepts" and her wardrobe (from her closet) -- and she also allegedly wanted, but failed to get co-directing credit as well. One of her credits was as executive producer, with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser, Jon Peters. As such, Streisand controlled the final cut of the film, which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. What it doesn't explain is how come, given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good, their efforts only make Streisand look bad. Even though this was one of Streisand's greatest box office hits, it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance.Anyway, moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sex-drugs-and-rock'n'roll, Streisand plays Esther Hoffman, a pop singer on the road to stardom, who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristofferson's John Norman Howard, a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Has-beenville. In the previous incarnations of the story, "Norman Maine" sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer "Vicky Lester" achieve her success. In the feminist seventies, Streisand &amp; Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man, so the trajectory is skewed; she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; he's a burden she must endure in the name of love. As such, there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher, but almost ruthless, while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit.Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance, and oddly it serves his aimless, listless character well. Streisand, on the other hand, exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems, if not too rehearsed, at least too controlled. Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. The two have no chemistry, making the central love affair totally unbelievable. You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence, though at age 34, Streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive. The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. And, indeed, had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way, to make Streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain, the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist.But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim; they don't seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points: note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos. And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman, yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from "Esther Blodgett" so that Streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive. So much for ethnic pride.The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary, so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie, with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the film did serve its purpose, producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes (including the Oscar-winning "Evergreen" by Paul Williams and Streisand). But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be, a vanity project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third and least workable version of the classic Hollywood tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The anticipation for this musical film was huge. It seemed the perfect star vehicle for Barbra Streisand and she hadn't had a hit for almost three years ("The Way We Were"). Janet Gaynor and Judy Garland were superlative in their creations of the classic tale of the Hollywood couple -- one star on the rise, the other on the skids. Could Streisand put her own indelible mark on this material as well and reestablish herself as a triple-threat performer?Nope. Not even close. This third version (actually fourth, if you include 1932's "What Price Hollywood" starring Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman) stalls early in the game by transposing the dramatic setting of Hollywood movie-making to the brash, uncouth pop/rock music scene... and it is only one of many fundamental mistakes this movie makes.The rags-to-riches story of Esther Hoffman Howard ain't believable for one second. Streisand the struggling artist? She plays Barbra the hard-assed star from the very first scene, lacking the courage or ability to immerse herself into a fully-realized character. She brays and bullies from the onset, showing no emotional colors whatsoever in a performance bereft of weakness, vulnerability and, as a result, sympathy. Ironically, she played this part to perfection ten years before -- as Fanny Brice, the gawky chorus girl who became a Ziegfeld Follies legend. Well, somewhere in those ten years, is a big star who has forgotten how to laugh at herself.Its been said that Elvis Presley was briefly considered for the part of John Norman Howard, the singer on the skids, but turned it down for fear of being upstage by Streisand. All the same, one wonders what "The King" might have done with a too-close-to-reality role like this. In the hands of Kris Kristofferson, he tosses in a performance so lackadaisical and careless that one wonders if he was sober at all during the film's shoot. They appear to be performing in two different movies. Neither one interesting.The screenplay is hopeless trite and corny, fueling some of the most unintentionally funny scenes in recent memory. Streisand's fight scene with Kristofferson after she catches him in the sack with some chippy and her emotional cassette-ripping scene in the mansion after John Howard's death are just plain embarrassing. If she's such a perfectionist in real life, how did these two scenes ever get by the editor's scissors.The one thing Streisand did right in this movie is the one thing she can never do wrong. Sing. Possessing arguably the finest vocal instrument known to man, she weaves absolute magic in her singing scenes, notably "Woman in the Moon" and especially her heart-breaking finale number, "Are You Watching Me Now." Here, and only here, does she seize an emotional connection to Esther that evaded her throughout the film.Alas, it is not enough to save this film dud. But, if you must see this, I'd advise you to skip the acting scenes and fast-forward to each Streisand number. Better yet, buy the CD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Wallow for Barbra-philes...Watch Closely Now as the New DVD Has Solid Extras</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirty years after its initial release, the third version of "A Star Is Born" finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand. That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem "Woman in the Moon" from this 1976 film. Easy to dismiss, the movie's career-polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywood-style clichés that variations of it exist in other films including Streisand's own "Funny Girl". This time reset to the then-contemporary music scene, the timeworn plot follows self-destructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deep-dive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big break.Troubles dog their courtship from the outset, as John Norman (both names please) responds to grasping fans and bloodless DJs with random acts of violence (from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution). To John Norman, Esther represents his last shot at happiness, and in turn, she is drawn to the innately decent, creative musician underneath the façade. In the movie's most pivotal scene, he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert, and her career takes off. Inevitably, he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success, and if you are familiar with any version of this story, you know the rest. Directed by Frank Pierson (although Streisand's budding directorial talents are obviously on display), the film still manages to draw me in, even though I know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative. It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws.Although Streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star, her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly. The same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer Adult Contemporary-oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock. From the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the Oreos, she can't help but come across as an established star. I can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent, but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes Esther more strident than poignant when John Norman's woes become overwhelming. This creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than Esther's response to it. This is capped off by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics John Norman's style toward the end.Kristofferson, on the other hand, gives a superb performance throughout, managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love, pride and resentment toward Esther. He makes his vodka-soaked onstage growling work within this context. Otherwise, what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn't exist unless they were interacting with the two principals. The only ones who register are Paul Mazursky as John Norman's level-headed manager Brian and Gary Busey as his cynical band manager Bobbie. Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print. A big seller in its day, the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970's - some songs still quite good ("Everything", "Woman in the Moon", "Watch Closely Now"), some that have moved to kitsch ("Queen Bee", Kenny Loggins' "I Believe in Love") and of course, the inescapable "Evergreen".The print transfer on the 2006 DVD is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering. Streisand's participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature-length commentary. She gives insightful information about the genesis of the film, the casting and the reportedly troubled production. She is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of Jon Peters, her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie's producer, and her dissatisfaction with Pierson as a director. I just wish she could have provided more scene-specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen. She also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her, e.g., it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of Peters. I think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her.There is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970's clothes, especially Kristofferson's mixed-fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt. There are also twelve deleted scenes included with Streisand's optional commentary. One is a comic bread-baking scene which reminded me how much I like Streisand in farcical comedies. Another is an extended scene in which she plays "Evergreen" on the guitar in front of an awestruck Kristofferson who then falls asleep. The most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts, which I agree with Streisand should have been used. Fittingly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of "A Star Is Born" are also included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enduring Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Transferred from the world of Hollywood to the world of rock music, this latest version of A Star Is Born lacks the glamor of the other two, mainly because the field is a less glamorous one. Nevertheless the role of Esther has attracted only the best of players, from Janet Gaynor to Judy Garland and now Barbra Streisand. That's a hat trick hard to beat in any field.In the other two versions, Fredric March and then James Mason, are a pair of self destructive drunks who when we meet them are on the downward side of their careers and have only one ennobling virtue, their love for Gaynor/Garland. Kris Kristofferson however is a multi-substance abuser and because we're talking about the rock scene has the groupies attached to him. Unlike in the other two versions, Streisand catches him with one and the whole thing about the pure love loses its potency because of it. However the incident does set him up for his final moment of self destruction.All the supporting characters from the other two versions are completely eliminated. Gary Busey has a nice role as Kristofferson's music arranger who fulfills many of the functions that eliminated characters from the other versions have. The rest of the film's supporting parts are very undefined which makes this version weaker than the others.But for those who are interested in hearing Barbra sing, A Star Is Born will more than satisfy you. The film got an Oscar for the song Evergreen which Kristofferson and Streisand duet and it became one of her best selling records. Judy Garland was similarly served in her version with The Man That Got Away although that song was nominated and did not win.A Star Is Born is an enduring tale and I don't think we've seen the last of it. May the next group of players do the story as much justice as the three pairs of co-stars I've cited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch too closely now...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this 70's remake of the marvellous Judy Garland / James Mason classic from the 50's (itself a remake, film snobs) more than I expected without accepting that one isolated minute in it was better than its counterpart in the predecessor. A rocky update of the story is a decent idea and in fact lends itself well to the story-line and if the execution is a bit clunky and now dated, that's both pardonable and understandable.Things I liked - well let's start with Kris Kristofferson who, with the more difficult part, certainly convinces as a hell-raising rock star, fuelled by drugs and alcohol, aware of tastes and fashions passing him by but with enough perception to see Streisand's Esther as the future. It's fun trying to pick out rock prototypes for his John Norman Howard character - I'm between Jim Morrison and Leon Russell myself, the latter married at the time ironically to sultry singer Rita Coolidge who herself gets a brief cameo appearance, while Howard's behaviour at Streisand's little night club where he "discovers" her recalls an infamous out of control episode in the "lost weekend" period in John Lennon's life, if memory serves. A pity they couldn't have trusted the writer of classics like "Help Me Make It Through The Night" and "Me And Bobby McGee" to contribute some of his own songs to the soundtrack and certainly his signature song here "Watch Closely Now" gets done to death.I also quite enjoyed the soundtrack. I'm no fan of La Diva Streisand's singing or indeed acting but at least in her vocals she exercises some restraint and delivers a surprising variety of material demonstrating at least some versatility on her part, from the title-theme ballad "Evergreen", (the gorgeous music to which was, surprisingly enough written by her), light Labelle-type funk of "I Believe in Love" and the big torch ballad "The Woman in the Moon" which while beneath Judy's "The Man That Got Away", covers the same territory in a still acceptable way.Things not to like - Streisand herself does a reasonable job and initially tones down her trademark "kooky" and "sensitive" personae a bit but you never really believe in her as a real person. Unfortunately as the film progresses so does her profile and we get embarrassingly lame scenes with the couple coo-ing at each other in various locations including a candle-surrounded bath scene, Streisand overacting furiously as she argues with a cassette-tape of Howard's voice after he's done his James Dean-type exit from the planet and worst of all that single long shot of her singing the finale medley, which is when you appreciate that yes, it's just another Barbie vanity exercise after all (especially when you see her name down as executive producer).The dialogue is pretty rock-star cliché throughout and some of the situations come across very second-hand too (Howard snorting up before every show, his assaults on a critical dee-jay, Streisand's MOR music somehow wowing a crowd of rock 'n' rollers at a benefit gig) and of course the familiarity with the story reduces the surprise element of some of the plot developments.All told though, long as it was, there were far worse films than this made in the 70's. By the way, what a pity they never released the version of "Evergreen" with Kristofferson harmonising on the middle section - it works a treat and adds to an already very pretty melody.</fullReview>

I know everyone makes fun of Barbra's hair in this one, but I think she looks and sounds great! ...And I seem to remember a number of women who copied that permed look at the time! Also, the bath tub scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is just so sexy! The music is great as well. This is the groovy 70's Babs at her best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am and was very entertained by the movie. It was my all time favorite movie of 1976. Being raised in the 70's , I was so in love with Kris Kristoffersons look and demeanor,of course I am no movie critic,but for the time era,I think it was very good. I very much like the combo of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I have seen the movie many times and still love the two of them as Esther and John Norman. I am a very huge fan of Kris and see him in concert when I can. What a talented singer song writer,not to mention,actor. I have seen him in many movies,but still think back to A star is Born.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Streisand's feminist re-thinking of a classic movie story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbra Streisand brought her own vision to A STAR IS BORN, the third version of this classic Hollywood story about the romance between an up and coming star and her alcoholic husband whose career is fading into oblivion. Streisand put her own stamp on this movie, making the story more acceptable to her and more accessible to 1970s film audiences. She changed the setting of the story from films to the world of music, making her Esther Hoffman a struggling singer who is discovered by an alcoholic, self-destructive rocker named John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson)who grooms her for stardom while his own career falls apart. We all know this story and have seen either of the previous versions and some were unsettled by the fact that in this version, John Norman doesn't commit suicide, he is killed in a car accident instead, taking away a lot of the power of the story. The point of the original story is that the actor sacrifices his own life so that his wife won't give up the career she's worked so hard for. One of the most amusing parts of the original and 1954 versions is the whole episode about Esther changing her name so it looks better on a marquee. Here, our feminist heroine, Esther Hoffman, refuses to change her name and for me, this small but vital plot points diluted a lot of the power of this story. This production is overblown and uneven. It should be understood that Streisand was just on the edge of insanity while making this film. She was involved at the time with future film producer Jon Peters, who was running her career and her life. Peters butted heads with leading man Kristofferson as well as credited director Frank Pierson, who pretty much directed this film in name only...Streisand and Peters had the last word on everything regarding this film, much to its detriment, due mainly to Streisand's complete trust in Peters, who really knew nothing about film-making at this time. But no matter what else she does, this movie comes alive whenever Streisand sings. Highlights for me were "Queen Bee", "Woman in the Moon", "With One More Look at You" and, of course, the Oscar-winning "Evergreen." With all the hats she was wearing while making this film, needless to say, Streisand was not very focused on her performance here, which can be described, kindly, as uneven. Kristofferson, in a role originally offered to Elvis Presley, is strong and surprisingly sexy as John Norman Howard and Gary Busey also scores as John Norman's manager. For hard-core Streisand fans only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personnaly I really loved this movie, and it particularly moved me. The two main actors are giving us such great performances, that at the end, it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters.The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is marvelous, and the song are just great the way they are. That's why I didn't feel surprised when I learned it had won 5 golden globe awards (the most rewarded movie at the Golden Globes), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. A great movie, that has often been criticized (maybe because Streisand dared to get involved in it, surely as a "co-director"). Her artistry is the biggest, and that will surely please you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was beautiful and timeless. Whether Streisand Fan or not, the chemistry was perfect and they both did a great job. The music was amazing and if you want a movie that is worth taking the time to see, this is it. I have watched it many times over the years and never get sick of it. Like Love Story, you know the characters well and feel you are there with them. Like a good book that you won't want to put down. Of course, the classic The Way we were was amazing too. Streisand is an amazing artist all the way around. Many would say love stories are chick flicks...but not for those who are in love or ever have been. I still consider this a modern day love story. Everyone should have this love once in a lifetime. Other titles you would love if you like this one or others I have mentioned in this review are, Out of Africa with Meryl Streep and Bridges over Madison county with Streep and Eastwood. Finally an unlikely love story that was very entertaining is Mr. &amp; Mrs, Smith of course. I love stories that have many emotions and make me believe..again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes. A star was born in the American film 'A star is born' directed by Frank Pierson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been observed on many occasions that ordinary people and amateur viewers have the habit of comparing films. This might not be the ideal method to explore some good qualities of a film. Each film is unique as it presents a story using best possible actors as well as technicians. It is by using this yardstick that one can take the decision of not comparing the two previous versions of 'A Star Is Born' with this 1978 film which has some of its own moments of sublime grandeur. Actor, Singer Kris Kristofferson plays an important role as an eccentric rock star whose excesses also seem to cause him extreme discomfort. His romantic chemistry with Barbara Streisand is a great joy to watch. One can easily sense the disappearance of selfish attitude in their performances. Both actors perform nicely as they enable different artists to appreciate each other. It is interesting to watch how an artist is able to appreciate other people's feelings. Barbara Streisand is absolutely amazing as a shy musician who is unable to understand the world of her rock star husband.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A convincing human drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always been many people's dreams to become famous. Who could resist having tons of fans, lots of money and being able to do anything you want? It's a big change for anyone who makes this transition and most of the time, they end up cracking under pressure. Once this happens, frequently, the newly discovered celebrity will turn to drugs and other means to escape reality to find peace among themselves. But how often does someone discover the right person that'll keep him or her from going down the wrong path while in this state of glory? Now a days, it happens often enough that nobody thinks about it. Back then though, probably was a different story.Audiences will be introduced to artist John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson), an entertainer who's stardom is beginning to die among his fans. He takes drugs, drinks constantly, and sings the same hits every time he's on tour. Until one night, he goes out on the town, decides to sit at a local bar and discover someone who can sing just as good if not better than him. That singer is Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand), a girl just trying to make a living, seeking love and hoping to make it big in show biz. It's John who's going to help her get there. Thus allowing Esther to as John puts it - "Getting small piece of the American Dream". Ergo the title of the movie.The movie is directed by Frank Pierson who also wrote for Cool Hand Luke (1967) and Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Pierson also wrote the screenplay with two other writers who formed a fairly solid story. The only weak point is the unclear characterization Kristofferson's character. There are some motivations of John Norman Howard that aren't exactly explained. He'll do actions that should require explanations to but doesn't give one. It's understood that he's a wild and free man but every action has a motive behind it. They don't just go unexplained. Other than that, Kristofferson's performance is well acted. It's even more coincidental that a lot of the scenes displayed throughout the running time depict rather closely to what Kristofferson himself was going through at the time of his life.Barbra Streisand also puts in a good performance as the unknowing upcoming celebrity that is forced into the life of popularity and paparazzi. Of course, when Streisand and Kristofferson are together, their chemistry feels natural. This is also displayed when these actual artists perform together as well. Audiences should appreciate that Streisand had the singing scenes filmed without voice-over work. It makes the performances and singing that much more believable and emotional. There's also a few other actors who pop in from time to time. Tony Orlando and Kristofferson's future spouse Rita Coolidge have a scene together. A very young and what appears to be sane Gary Busey plays John Norman Howard's head collaborator. Even Robert Englund from A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) has a brief scene.Although the films running time is about as long as your normal Michael Bay summer blockbuster (which may bore some viewers), these last few pieces help make the film as entertaining as it can be. Assisting to condense the movie as much as it could and make scenes flow was editor Peter Zinner who also edited for The Godfather (1972). Then there's Roger Kellaway's score to the film, which does try to keep the emotions high. However, it's not always present because half of the emotion is shown in the singing done by the main leads, which should satisfy most score aficionados. Lastly is Robert Surtees' cinematography where he captures very large concert audience shoots and some very beautiful rural landscape. It's an entertaining human drama with some flaws.It lacks a little characterization and might be long for some, but the actors portray raw emotion and real performances to boot. The story is also a good representation of how quickly popularity can fall or soar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just for Streisand fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, granted the story of the born star is about Streisand's character, but the love story alone is fairly universal. Can love survive when one partner is seen as more successful than the other? Both Streisand and Kristofferson give solid performances. These characters are in love but are clearly on different trajectories. The music is important for the forward movement of the film, but it's not really a musical, per se. Both Kristofferson's and Streisand's performances are great (so get the soundtrack if you don't have it). I think this movie still holds up even almost 40 years (can you believe it?) later. The messages in the movie seem to be stronger once you've lived life, had success, had failure, been in love, and lost love. Overall, do you need to be a Streisand fan to like the movie? It helps. If you don't like her, you won't likely enjoy the movie, but she doesn't come across as the sole focus of the movie. Her story, his story, and their story seems to be told in equal measure. Haven't seen it? Do. Saw it years ago? See it again soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She is such an extraordinary singer, who cares about anything else!!!! That final scene is one of the best moments in all of show biz - bar none!! I'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves that iconic status - such is the power of the voice. I first saw this film when I was five and it had a huge impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some of the flaws (like Esther wanting to leave the Grammy's right as her award is being announced).But some of the other user comments are just plain false - I mean, where is the gratuitous nudity - maybe we saw different films??? Streisand's singing ability is monumental, and if she has a big ego - fine! She's earned it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great song. Lousy movie. TERRIBLE hair!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into an overnight singing star. Esther's star rises while John's goes into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive-red-converible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway thing. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song, "Evergreen." Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as an up-and-coming star, when she is *already* a star. The very first time she appears, singing in a back alley bar, she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night, not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career. She is too confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page out of "Apartment Living," not some hole-in-the-wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live.Kris Kristofferson handles the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role like...well, like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent. The direction is tepid, the story is slow and dull.But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, or the lame direction, or the slow story. It's the hair! After staring at Kristofferson's and Streisand's awful 70's hairdos for 2+ hours, your eyes hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental favorite; surpasses the previous versions in many ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A blockbuster at the time of it's original release (it was the second-highest grossing film of 1976), the third screen version of A STAR IS BORN has always divided critics and fans alike. The film open to scathingly negative reviews, however, $5.6 million-budgeted picture went on to gross over $150 million at the box office and won an Academy Award and five Golden Globes. It's not without some irony that Streisand's most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial. For every ten fans who state that STAR is Streisand's best film, there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography. Although both sides have some merit to support their claims, it should still be noted that the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that Hollywood ever produced. For my money, it's the best version of the often-told tale.The film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing. Changing the setting from the old Hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea, and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters' romance and their careers. This is the main area that the 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN actually surpasses it's classic predecessors. For example, the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the never-ending phone calls that interrupt Kristofferson's songwriting attempts. This version of the story is also more believable in it's portrayal of the lead characters. For example, the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and self-sacrificing that they came off as saints. On the other hand, Esther, the female lead in this version, is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate, but also flawed and conflicted. This makes her feel more "real" than the Janet Gaynor or Judy Garland characters felt in the previous films, and makes the story that much more effective.The performances are all on target, even if some of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough. If you're looking for an actress/singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance, Streisand is definitely the girl you want. She's one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural, and, as usual, she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer. Simply put, her Esther is a fully-realized, three-dimensional human being. Kris Kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laid-back characterization, however, he's always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career. Kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from NEWSWEEK, TIME, and even the NEW YORKER's usually vicious Pauline Kael. Gary Busey and Paul Mazursky also give believable performances, but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen time.The film's soundtrack recording was also a massive success, hitting the #1 on Billboard's Hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the US alone. The Streisand-composed "Evergreen" (with lyrics from Paul Williams) is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop, brought to even-further life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from Streisand. The rest of the film's original songs (mostly composed by Williams and Rupert Holmes) are pretty good as well, and Streisand sounds fantastic - her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded. Streisand's vibrant performances bring "Woman In The Moon" and "With One More Look At You" to thrilling life, and make even sillier numbers like "Queen Bee" work far better than they have the right to. Kristofferson's solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless, however, that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline.Though naturally dated in some respects (it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made), the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN still holds up remarkably well. The film is well-mounted and slickly produced, the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine, and Streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective. In conclusion, A STAR IS BORN is not only entertaining and moving, but it also transcends all criticism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SOME SPOILERS** Very likely the schmaltziest of the three or is it four versions of the movie "A Star is Born" has super rock star John Norman Howard, Kris Kristofferson, self destruct right before our eyes as his old lady or wife Esther, Barbara Streisand, rises to to top of the pop music world without as much as breaking into a sweat or note. John who already was on the way down when he met Esther as a member of a bi-racial womens singing trio "The Oreos" and discovered as well as later married her while he was still sober. Before the poor and suffering from the DT's John knew it Esther became the biggest hit in the world of music with him becoming a helpless drunk and speed freak.Despite her amazing success Esther still stuck by her man John and did her best to get him back on his feet and wagon but his pride just got in the way. The final straw was when John found semi nude "Rolling Stone" reporter Queint,Marta Heflin, taking a dip in his swimming pool who asked him for an exclusive interview. It's when a shocked Esther found John and Quint buff a** naked in bed and under the covers she blew a fuse and practically kicked him out of the house. What really ticked off the outraged Esther is just how the drugged out looking Quint acted as if there was nothing wrong in being in bed with John as she was interviewing him. John who by now had lost all his self respect and dignity continued to make a complete fool of himself in public at the expense of his wife Esther by falling down drunk at an award "The Grammies" show that his wife Ester was invited as a guest speaker. Drunk disorderly and and out of control a semi conscious and smashed out of his skull John in the end let it all go and went along with it. Taking a drive in the desert with his hopped up red sport car that in it going over 100 MPH overturned and killed him.Unlike in the other versions of the movie where the husband ends it all by walking nude into the Pacific Ocean and drowning himself in here he took the land or scenic route to do himself in so to keep from getting himself wet and not having his body washed away out at sea. In fact John's death unlike the previous movies was more like and accident instead of a suicide which made it less, for what it's worth, tragic.A devastated Esther who had since made up with her drunk and philandering husband John came back out of hiding to belt out a song at a memorial for her late husband who's singing brought the roof down as well as caused her to suffer what seemed like a major emotional as well as psychical breakdown. As Esther struggling to regain her composer seemed to lose it on the stage as well as at times forget the lyrics of the song she was singing! With her turning all the colors of the rainbow as the movie ended in an eerie freeze frame before she was given any sort of medical attention. Despite the movie's many faults it turned out to be one of the top money makers of 1976 doing some 80 million dollars in ticket sales.Which showed just how powerful Barbara Streisand's star power was even when she was given a turkey of a role as well as movie to perform in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is my number one guilty pleasure as far as movies go. Yes, the critics were right about everything: Streisand's pop songs sound more like her usual, Broadway show-stoppers; Streisand's character's instant stardom is contrived, to say the least; Kris is an excellent songwriter, but he, uh, can't sing a note (yet he didn't write any of the songs in the film); and (getting a little mean here) even with a beard, Kristofferson is prettier than Babs. So why have I seen this film at least 100 times? Well, it was extremely entertaining despite it's many clichés and the other things I've sited. The music is also good, as cheesy as Babs' songs are and as poorly sung as Kris' are. I'm apparently not alone--in 1976, only Rocky made more money at the box office (not bad for an R-Rated movie in a year that had many great films, such as Taxi Driver, Network, All the President's Men and The Omen, The Bad News Bears, to list a few. Very dated today, but I still want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember when I first learned of "A Star Is Born", but I eventually learned that the first version was the 1937 one starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, then there was the 1954 one starring Judy Garland and James Mason, and lastly there was the 1976 one starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. Now that I've seen all three, I can say that the original was a masterpiece, the second one was OK, and this third one was the lowest of the three. Watching it, I felt as though Streisand made it as a vanity project. The really interesting character is Kristofferson's burnt-out rock star who watches Streisand's nightclub singer overtake him.The previous versions were indictments of Hollywood's star system, while this one makes it look as though the problems are all of one's own making. Another noticeable change is what happens at the end. Due to the women's movement, it would've been outdated for the woman to identify herself as the man's wife. In the end, I'd say that it wasn't a bad movie. Even though it was more of a star vehicle for Streisand, it still tried to do something good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third A Star is Born, but also the least successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did see this 1976 version not because of its reputation but because I've always really liked Barbra Streisand's voice and the 1937 and 1954 versions are very good indeed. Unfortunately I can't put this version in the same league. It is not a disaster, Streisand sounds absolutely heavenly and sings with such control, the songs Evergreen and particularly With One More Look at You are beautiful and really moving(Woman in the Moon is also lovely but not quite with the other two's impact) and Gary Busey makes the most of his too-limited screen time, even though he's only on screen for about 15 minutes his character is one of the more interesting ones. The scenery and technical aspects are also professional enough, liked the intimacy of how With One More Look at You. However, while Streisand's singing is top-drawer her acting isn't, at times she's too on-edge and in others she's too confident. Whether Esther was meant to be sympathetic or self-absorbed I never was sure as Streisand didn't convey either of those effectively. Kris Kristofferson looks out of his depth and gives the impression that he doesn't want to be there. His complete lack of chemistry with Streisand doesn't help, nor that his songs are too brash and done with zero emotion. The dialogue is continually corny and I never could invest in the story, the love affair between Esther and John was completely lacking in any kind of passion. No matter how technically good A Star is Born is, the lacking-in-finesse 70s fashion styling and terrible hair gave the film a rather dated look(not just now but even on release too). The choreography was overblown and didn't give us any time to connect with the characters or the drama, and Streisand's breakdown was so embarrassingly forced. To conclude, just falling short of average here, not terrible but very problematic and the least good of the three A Star is Born films(my personal favourite is 1937). 4.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I swear when I first saw this movie,I cried my eyes out! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites,and Queen Bee is such a fun song. Also I love the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that,she's a beauty.). A Star is Born is my number one favorite movie. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end.</fullReview>

The way he looks at her and he is so proud.I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like est-her I even have the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she wore. this came on TV on time and I got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to.

		<shortDescription>A must for my collection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbra Streisand is a tour de force in this Hollywood story. Her performances and the songs are one-of-a-kind and are special in the halls of great movies. The scene where she is introduced to the unexpecting audience by Kristopherson, against the crowds' wishes and hers, only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of "Woman In the Moon" is one of the best examples on film of how well a great performer can win over an audience. It's real. The scene where she records Evergreen ranks with the best in the business.. all live, no lip-sync, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a Diva, but she delivers on this one. She is majestic singing "With One More Look At You. She deserved the Oscar she and Paul Williams got for Evergreen. Kristopherson had his moments too, far above most of his movie appearances. This version of the "Born" franchise ranks with the first one of 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic March)although I will always enjoy Judy Garland and James Mason musical remake of 1954. I haven't seen the DVD yet and don't know about its quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word: terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater. As I watched it for the first time I was expecting another romantic, tear-jerking Barbra Streisand film; Something like The Way We Were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters. There wasn't anything romantic about it. Streisand's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast-forward button. At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies. Parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on, and I kept asking myself when it was going to end.The death of John Howard was completely predictable. There was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie, and when he died I felt no emotion whatsoever. It wasn't a tragic accident, it was him basically being an idiot. Not to mention throughout the movie I was distracted by his hideous beard.The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The ending of the movie when she sings "With One More Look At You/Watch Closely Now" was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3/10. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWESOME movie!! Just watched the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 16 when I first saw the movie, and it has always been a HUGE favorite of mine. Of course, you can't deny the appeal of Kristofferson in the movie - HOW FINE IS THAT MAN???????????? Sheesh. He still is. He's the bad boy every woman secretly wants. His acting is flawless. He played a drunk/druggie only the way someone who really had gone through it could - and he had - in '76 he finally got on the wagon, so it was all very real.The music is GREAT and even though in later years I thought Streisand was somewhat not the right person for him in a physical beauty sense, I think it's more a problem for male viewers than female. Us gals are just looking at Kris - and naturally the guys are looking at the female interest - my husband cannot watch the movie b/c of her - he doesn't like her looks. But I did make him sit through just the red Ferrari scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well done it was - the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music blasting - you should have seen it on my 50" plasma - WOW!!!! And lastly, the transfer quality was GREAT - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all film.Brought back some great memories of my mom and I loving this movie together, I bought a copy for her for Christmas. Would have loved to watch it together with her last night.I have tried to sit through the original with Judy Garland, but I guess seeing this one first, I just can't get into the earlier era. Watching all the concert footage in the '76 version was so much like what I was living at the time.I am working my way through the commentary by Streisand, but she seems to only talk about herself and the songs, so far she has barely even mentioned Kris or details about scenes in the movie. Her voice sounds EXACTLY the same now as then.Check it out, if you grew up in the same era as me (born in 1960) you will love it.Wendy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horrid disaster of a film. From beginning to end, it's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing. The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand, because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson's character at his peak or Streisand's character struggling. The first should be seen in decline and the second rising. The final Streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finales in film, if it was directed and edited properly. The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. Had the band, audience and wide shots of the stage been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout. The only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with this movie? The title!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the Janet Gaynor/Fredric March dramatic 1937 classic many times and the Judy Garland/James Mason musical 1954 masterpiece also quite a few, I went into my viewing of this (my second time, and first in many years) a bit cynical. I proved my cynicism to be part wrong but mostly right. But what I realized why this version has no real impact is that the title implies something that really doesn't work. The two stars have fantastic chemistry, Streisand allows herself to go low down (even into the mud), and the movie does take you into the wild world of rock. The problem is that I never believed Kris Kristofferson to be a rock star even though it was obvious that he was emulating a few performers of the time. This is sort of the "Mahogany" of the rock world, like "The Eyes of Laura Mars" was of the photography world. Then, there is the problem with Streisand. She is way too big to be believable as a nobody when Kristofferson first meets her in some Los Angeles dive and takes her under his wing. Even though Garland's talent was big, she was able to transcend the fact that her version of Esther Blodgett had not yet been lucky. Lacking Garland's vulnerability, Streisand's Esther Hoffman seems like someone who by her mid 30's should have been doing live concerts in Central Park like "Mahogany's" Miss Ross.So the beginning of the film does really stretch the line of credibility, but once Streisand's rise begins, she begins to become a bit more believable. What I see here in Streisand as compared to her earlier performances and more recent film work is a desire to command focus. This was also apparent in the previous year's "Funny Lady" where a lot of the heart was missing from her Oscar Winning performance in "Funny Girl". The intensity of Streisand's drive really works in the dramatic scenes, and there are some adorable romantic moments between Kristofferson and Streisand that inject comedy into the romance. I just can't believe either character lighting dozens of candles to place around the huge bathtub in their desert home before their love scene, nor did I feel any emotion at the end where Kristofferson takes drastic steps to ensure his wife's future.A better title for the film could simply have been "Evergreen", the title of the Oscar Winning song that describes the romance between the two. This version becomes more like "A Star is Delayed". In a sense, too, I have to also call this version a mistake, not only because of much of the mediocrity and the multiple feelings the film makes an attempt to express, but there is something cutthroat about the world of rock music where this obvious build-up to soap opera just doesn't make you really want to care about the characters. That world would be much better explored a few years later when Bette Midler got ahold of it and played a performer much like Janis Joplin in "The Rose". Its total lack of sentiment actually made you care more about her; In this "A Star is Born", it feels too forced, and left me cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star is ... Bored?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 20 when this film originally opened in theaters, and it certainly was not Barbra Streisand, her singing, or her musical composition that drew me to the theater. It was Kris Kristofferson, and I'm relatively certain that Kris Kristofferson drew most of the female audience to the movie. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see much of Kris because we were supposed to believe the unbelievable, IE. that 1.) that a man like the character Kristofferson played would ever be attracted to a woman like Streisand played - it just wouldn't happen; 2.) that Kristofferson's character would find Streisand's character's type of campy lounge act interesting or promotable; and 3.) that a control freak like Esther Hoffman with all her complaining and judgment would ever go along with the reckless and slightly bored likes of John Norman, whom she irritatingly reduced to "Johnny" throughout the film, as if that tall, beautiful, visceral free spirited icon to male sensuality could ever be reduced to the name of a small pet. My favorite scenes were of Kris Kristofferson changing his shirt. Otherwise, it appeared his role was to stay out of sight so Barbra could be in more shots. More interesting than the film itself was the back story on all the in-fighting that went on, and the fact that Streisand complained that Mr. Kristofferson was too organic in his approach to acting, IE. that he was actually naked in the bathtub scene. In fact, Kris seemed very comfortable in his skin as John Norman, and Streisand seemed, well...tense, with her attempts at being "cute," "perky," "comical," with her campy one-liner ad-libbing. I felt no chemistry between the two, even though I admired Kristofferson's efforts which are shown in the extremely gentle way he touched Streisand, when he actually did touch her, in the film. Kristofferson actually cried in the fighting scene, and Streisand had to have tears artificially induced with menthol vapors according to an interview given by the director. That's not acting. In fact, I found Streisand irritating and dreaded seeing her face on the screen because she seemed so tense. No argument here that the woman has an exceptional voice, and the song Evergreen deserved recognition as an exceptionally beautiful composition. But, having recently watched the film at 57 years old, it's hard to believe that the film won so many awards. Gary Busey had about 15 total minutes of screen time, and he was the only other interesting character in the film. All the support cast was barely visible, and so we saw a lot of Barbra climbing to stardom, and the rugged, yet self-destructive Kris fading to black. And, due to the fact that Barbra retained the right of the final edit of the film, most of Kris Kristofferson's scenes showing his process of downward spiral and the emotions ancillary thereto...were cut, in order to show more of Barbra's scenes. The two main characters were such bipolar opposites, one can't help but wonder why Streisand wanted Kristofferson for the part unless she was already bored with her hairdresser-cum-filmmaker boyfriend Jon Peters, and needed the extremely masculine Kristofferson around for entertainment. After all, even a star gets bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was terribly disappointed with Barbara's version of 'A Star is Born'. I grew up in the 70's but was too young to appreciate the drama. As an adult I was looking forward to the flick and found Kris Kristofferson a huge disappointment as a singer. Producers choose to dub in all but one of Audrey Hepburn's song's in 'My Fair Lady' (1964) and the same should have been done for Kristofferson who is yelling in a microphone. Streisand of course shines with a number of remember able songs including Academy Award winning 'Evergreen'. I found it hard to like John Norman Howard (Kristofferson), he was such a jerk and therefore did not buy into Esther Hoffman's (Streisand) love for the man. I was happy to see the Esther Hoffman concert at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful remake of touching love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering 'A Star is Born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production, the latest remake has a freshness about it that can be attributed to the fantastic chemistry between the entire acting ensemble. A viewer could be forgiven for believing that Kris Kristofferson &amp; Barbara Streisand were a couple off screen as well as on, with their incredible displays of pure affection towards one another.The film has been described in the past as a 'Barbara Streisand concert on film, set to a soap opera storyline' however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive - A Star is Born is well worth the hiring price.With its incredible soundtrack, flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true frailty of life; A Star is Born is a film that draws you into the world of Esther Hoffman &amp; the love of her life John Norman Howard.A film for anyone that sees the beauty in real love - the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For lovers of BS (of both kinds) and 70's kitsch fashion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of music artists fall in love, the only trouble is that she is on the way up while he is on the way down.I don't know the number of times this movie has been made, but it goes beyond the official count because so many people have used this template (Breaking Glass is the punk rock version of it!) The plot is actually nothing more than a gilded frame in which to put a star, and if they have star quality it will shine out.Judy Garland's version is hardly more than a variety show with bits of acting: and like this, has no real interest to those that have no appreciation of the central star. This is no "messing about with a classic", just a modern use of a stock theatrical device.Let us put the positives first: Babs is a first class musical artist (you try getting a concert ticket at face value!), even as a non fan I can safely say that she has one of the best voices in the history of music and when you see her give a powerhouse delivery of a classic (some of her own creation such as Evergreen) then you are seeing something special. Here she is singing live, but you barely notice so good is the vocal performance.Sadly too many songs are clearly just a showcase of her voice (start with a whisper, build to a roar, then finish with an everlasting final note) rather than proper life-of-their-own songs, but that is what "stars with great range" get dumped with.Yes BS does polarise people and I thank the living lord I don't wake-up next to her each morning, but I think she does have something rare and unique. Admirable even. If Elvis (once touted for the co-star role!) had a bit more of what she has he would not only would he have had a better career, but might even be alive today.So she is pushy and look-at-me-look-at-me, but so what? Show-biz is not for introverts. When was the last time a male actor was slagged off for not getting a nose job? Most of her films are mediocre - as is this before I get too carried away - but they are never unwatchable. Ok, with my soapbox moment over let us get back to the movie in question.Credit Kris Kristofferson for playing second fiddle and acting the role of my ultimate nightmare (man in love with the great profile) but he is not egotistical enough. He looks too happy to play his second fiddle and besides, when did his beardy countryfide soft rock (displayed here in all its dazzling mediocrity) ever top the charts? As an actor he looks younger than his years - quite a feat with a full beard - and he looks like he enjoys a party, but self builder of a ranch house? They play around with a earth mover and in the next shot they have a fully formed dream home - I wish it was so easy! Everyone else is a walk-on beyond Gary Busey who is a kind of laconic "best friend" muso who hands out the coke like some people hand out hankies - which, given his personal history, must have been a stretch. You could sum up his whole role as "looking on with care." Indeed ditto the whole cast bar BS and KK. If you are up for two hours of Babs in a love triangle between herself and old beardy, then this is the movie for you. She may look like a drag queen for large parts of this movie with her 70's fashions (the fully unbuttoned side cleavage look I had almost forgotten about!) and frizz perms; but I'd love to find a drag queen that could actually sing like her. Boy would I like to be his manager.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new look at a great story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched the '54 version of this film with Judy, and while i appreciated the story and music, i found that the film failed to hold my attention. I expected the '76 remake to be the same story, except with a Barbra twist. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and the price of it all. This version is so much more real than the '54 one, with arguably better music, better acting, a more gripping plot line, and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is on the American Film Institute's top 100 list, while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic's list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No stars are born, but two go into decline . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a preteen, I had an older, Streisand-obsessed sister and was forced to endure everything about the Babs version of "A Star is Born:" the poster, the soundtrack, and ultimately, tragically, the film itself. As a movie, it's easily as bad as some of the great "camp" musicals like "Can't Stop the Music" or "Lost Horizon." It is largely forgotten today outside of the Streisand cult because unlike those other cinematic atrocities, it has very, very little entertainment value. Some of the songs are nice and hummable, but that's about it. The mighty Babs herself doesn't even get many of the good "diva" moments that might have inspired drag queens for decades -- when she's not onstage, belting it out, she's just kind of kvetchy and whiny (you'll want to slap her until those damned eyes uncross when she's complaining about the loud guitars during the recording-studio scenes). As for Kris Kristofferson, he doesn't even look interested enough in the proceedings to turn in a bad performance. It's not that he's underacting, it's that he's barely acting at all. Whether he's inciting a concert crowd to riot, putting the move on Babs in the hot tub scene or getting the heave-ho from his unscrupulous manager (played by an embarrassed-looking Gary Busey), Kristofferson looks way too stoned to care what's going on around him. Which may be appropriate for the character, but is hardly compelling to watch. In fairness, he does manage to bring some enthusiasm and conviction to the scene where he's sharing the recording studio with Babs as she warbles "Evergreen." He's probably smirking about the fat paycheck on its way, but in context it resembles passion.One suspects that the most interesting aspect of this bland saga happened offscreen. Who convinced La Streisand that she could pull this off? Was it Jon Peters, the opportunistic, talentless hack who had affixed himself to her and was "executive producer" of this disaster? A lot of us have had a hard time taking this genuinely talented woman seriously for the past three decades, and this ego-trip of a film began her downfall. And why did Kris Kristofferson ever try to act? He's stiff and mumbly and has about as much charisma as a bearded mannequin. It's a tragic loss, really -- he's a brilliant songwriter (check out "The Pilgrim, Chapter 33" or "Sunday Morning Coming Down") and if he'd just concentrated on writing great songs instead of making lousy movies, today we'd be mentioning him in the same breath as Bob Dylan or Neil Young, not sneering at that silly poster with a post-electroshock Babs. Finally, "A Star is Born" is a harbinger of MTV. It took this entire overproduced and underwritten theatrical release to push "Evergreen" to the top of the charts. Economics and logic dictated that future promotional clips for singles and LPs should be much shorter and preferably on videotape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, draggy, but has its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What to say about this movie? First the good: the live performance scenes are fun. The helicopter landing over the huge festival crowd, the "Indian benefit," the montage of Babs on the Road, all pack more energy and excitement than the heavy-handed dialogue and love story. And Babs has some pipes - no denying that - although her style of music is not my favorite.Kris Kristofferson does as much as could be done with a thankless role. Why anyone would be attracted to this already-at-the-bottom drugged out loser is beyond me, much less someone who seems as "together" in a 70s-kind-of-way as Esther Hoffman. He seems to take the only possible acting choice, which is low-key to the extreme. Kristofferson's best scenes when he tries to "make up" with the obnoxious D.J., and when he goes back to find his old band mates moving on, shows the heartbreak and anger of someone who simply can't control his own life.Opposite Babs, whose acting style is turned up to "11" in almost every moment, she and Kristofferson seem to be in different planes of existence. Babs has a few charming moments, but her self-regard throughout seems to limit her ability to play anything other than Strong Woman. The basis for the characters' love and respect for each other is not well established from the start, and never is on firm ground. As for the music, I'm not crazy about the songs they gave KK to sing--I'm used to him more as a country singer, and the country "rock" style just doesn't work for me; however, the producers choose rock, I guess, to justify the huge fame and success the character has had. As for Babs, she has some great numbers. She has an amazing voice, Evergreen and several others are lovely songs, and if you're a fan of hers you will enjoy. The final song (as others have mentioned) take a long time and meanders about a bit much for me. A final note on the hairstyles and clothing. What a time capsule into mid-70s style! The high- waisted bell-bottom jeans; the long sweaters; the central cleavage exposure with the burn- you-bra-look; not to mention the spiral perm! Go Babs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, we ARE watching you now...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1976 remake, with the musical scenario switched from showtunes to rock, concerning a star-crossed marriage with one career on the upswing and the other in decline. Despite updating the milieu (which gives this new version some groovy pizazz for awhile), the time-worn plot is still heavily narcissistic, with masochism built into its formula (everyone suffers and swoons with such relish!). Barbra Streisand, after catching hubby Kris Kristofferson in bed with a female reporter, spits at her spouse, bites his lip, and claws his bare back, all the while whispering, "I hate you...I hate you..." finally turning into "I love you...I love you." Cut! Dissolve to a scene where the two are now riding horseback in the desert! Streisand's songs trump the show-biz clichés, and her dramatic closing number is a magnificent (if grand-standing) show-stopper, but the movie loses its focus in the second act, straying into the Arizona sunshine and staying there forever. We get glimpses of stardom--the high life--but the focus is much more on the melodrama. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a long-standing Barbra fan, any posting like this will be biased. That aside, this film ranks as a classic. It has it's flaws (emphasized in other postings), but gives a glimpse of a time (late 70s) that will never be there again, and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen.Streisand fought hard to make this movie her own. I don't think she was ever satisfied. But it gives her fans a new Barbra (for the time) with LIVE singing, a young fresh appearance, and some very heavy-duty acting.The story is rough, but exciting, and holds your interest throughout. The extended one frame "finale" is hard for most non-Barbra fans to sit through, but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so have no means of comparison. Also, it's been some years, but I found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating. The movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn out, disillusioned rock star on the decline, embarking upon a romance with a fresh, talented new singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline.The lead actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me. The film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect, Streisand's beautiful rendition of the Oscar winning song 'Evergreen'. She truly has a powerful and magnificent voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a little back story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. I grew up in Scottsdale and I went to Arizona State and really enjoyed seeing locations where I spent so much time. I remember at the time thinking that Barbara's venture into more of a rock sound (actually R and B-to my ears) was a successful one. I was never a fan of Kris's singing until his last effort for New West. As a songwriter and an actor, though, he has serious chops, IMHO. I think it is a fine romance. I like it better than the Judy Garland version and never saw Selznick's Janet Gaynor original. I do believe that they made some changes in this long-awaited DVD release. Among other things, I recall the helicopter shot which reveals a packed Sun Devil Stadium being longer and more dramatic. I wish they had done a better job writing music for Kris or God forbid, put some of his original songs in there. Along those lines I have some information from a primary source that says that the music was a problem for Kris and Barbara. While doing interviews for my own new music documentary, Rocking the Boat: A Musical Conversation and Journey, I interviewed Stephen Bruton, a fine singer/songwriter/guitarist with close professional and personal ties to Kris, Bonnie Raitt, and Delbert McClinton, among many others. Stephen was in "Speedway," the John Norman character's band. Kris was having a real hard time turning what was essentially a pop score into something that could pass for rock. Stephen was and is Kris's friend and long time band member. There was tension on the set and at one point the band was barking at Kris in Barbara's presence. She remarked to the effect that the band shouldn't talk to him like that. Kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they WERE rock and roll! In the end, Barbara came around and decided to use Kris's band's live performances in the movie and specifically sited Stephen's role in making things work. I gained even greater respect for her as an artist upon hearing this story. Much is made of her as a diva. What she is is a pro. And I am not gay. Not that there is anything wrong with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...but film is wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes if you ever watch David Letterman's "Late Show", you'll hear him joke about how they waste videotape at the program.Well in this case, film was wasted on shooting this movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Streisand's music and she did indeed do a fabulous job in this film. But the flaws of the film itself I find a turnoff.It's a slow tempo film with a lot of shots that could (or should) have been edited out. I didn't care for the scene where Esther and John are exchanging the "I love you" and "I hate you" lines. two or three times of that would have been OK, but by the 6th or 7th time I was ready to shut it off. I almost did...The car scene at the end... I knew what was going to happen, but good grief no special effects? No sounds of a crash? No shots of a car flipping? I was hanging for that and was rather disappointed with the lack of it. I don't think I've ever seen a film before where you didn't have special effects for these scenes.Finally I just have to comment on the 5:00+ minute still shot of Streisand singing at the end. That was a terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE idea! There should have been more camera angles on Streisand while she's singing, and there should have been panning shots of the audience. I don't know how they expect us to sit through an unchanging camera shot like that for a performance as good as that was. The lack of a musical band behind her didn't help either. I got the impression she was lip synching, regardless of whether she actually was or not.I would also give this film a 5.0 rating. It's good in some aspects but it has a lot of flaws.</fullReview>

I am not denying Barbra Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I am not acquainted with Kris Kristofferson's other work and therefore I can't pass judgment on it. However, this movie leaves much to be desired. It is paced slowly, it has gratuitous nudity and foul language, and can be very difficult to sit through.However, I am not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better.

If you like some pretty decent acting, some great concert scenes, and some pretty good music, then you will enjoy this third remake of "A Star is Born".

		<fullReview>This was an okay movie to look at. The plot was thin, but a lot of the songs were great, especially two of the songs Kris Kristofferson sang. The only thing is that I wonder what would it have been like if Bab's original choice for the role of John Norman Howard, Elvis Presley himself, would have taken the role. Of course, many people know the official reason for Elvis not being in it was because Col. Tom Parker, the biggest crook in rock and roll, didn't want Elvis to have second billing to Streisand. However, given the state of Elvis' personal life at the time, it might have been a case of art imitating life. By 1976, Elvis was an overweight drug addled mess. If he had taken this role, it wouldn't have been much of a stretch for him to play a drug addicted has been like John Norman Howard. Maybe the "good colonel" was saving Elvis the embarrassment of playing what would have been a semi-autobiographical role. If that's the case, then it would have been the one decent thing that crook ever did for his charge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third film version of the often recycled story is given good treatment and receives a change from the world of acting to the popular music scene. The film's production values are overblown and sometimes a bit garish, but given the setting (the drug-induced rock world of the 70's) it seems to work. Kristofferson, though a competent actor in many respects, is completely miscast here. He is completely unsympathetic, his actions come off as asinine, and he can't even sing!Although her character is poorly defined by the screenplay, Streisand comes off much better. Although her motives sometimes seem silly (why would such a nice gal love such a loser in the first place), she nevertheless gives a commanding and compelling performance as Esther.The music in the film could be a bit better. All of Kristofferson's tunes are horrid misfires that all sound the same. Streisand sings three really good numbers, "Evergreen," "The Woman In The Moon," and "Everything," but some numbers, such as "Queen Bee" and "I Believe In Love," fall flat.Even though I've payed more attention to the movie's shortcomings, it's not a bad film, though it could have been much better. The strength of the central storyline and a good performance from Streisand carry the film over some of it's weak spots. However, I agree with a previous viewer that the 1954 Judy Garland version is superior on all accounts. Sill, I'd rate this film a respectable 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

After seeing it in 1976, it took me at least fifteen years before I could respect Streisand again. It's hard to believe that she was involved in this mess and then went on to do films as good as Yentl, Mirror Has Two Faces etc. Barbra Streisand defended this film after it was savaged by every critic with a brain. I'll bet she has grown to realize how awful this one is. Scene after scene of utter nonsense--When the interviewer tells Kristoferson she'll do anything for an interview and then "surprises the viewer" with the fact that she wants the interview with Streisand, I think I might have thrown up. The final song that was meant to be filled with Streisand's raw emotions is agonizing to watch for all the wrong reasons--goofy Big Bird choreography mixed with hideous changing light cues.</fullReview>

The fact that musical numbers were recorded live, and the rock concert scenes were real ,not staged makes this a true time capsule for that time.This is a tribute to Babs that she could undertake such a monumental task &amp; succeed !!! direction could have and should have been better, some scenes were poorly edited... but in 1976-77 audiences lined up for this film and it was a big success...The soundtrack was at that time the best selling movie soundtrack ever ( replaced the following yr. by Saturday Night Fever, ) and the Streisand composed Love Theme, "Evergreen" became a number one hit, Oscar &amp; grammy winner, and one of the worlds favorite love songs.... It made people cry hokey as some scenes may be,.. and it rocked an audience a big audience winter of '76-77... Maybe Streisand needed a George Cukor to direct her in this...but its worth seeing/ and the cd worth purchasing.. yes I am a fan of Babs... but far worse films have been praised... I still cant believe The Oscars awarded Clint Eastwoods The Unforgiven, people walked out on that one in droves.. yet it is praised for example..Oh well too each his own// Judy Garlands version is great/ but dont forget it was not overwhelmingly received when it first opened. it gained respect thru the yrs..
