		<shortDescription>Sing Melancholy Baby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it possible to watch this fictional story without digressing to thoughts about the real life story of Judy Garland? For me it isn't. Both are permanently intertwined. And it's not just the parallel between fiction and fact, but also the dark, brooding, melancholy mood they engender, like ghosts calling out to us from a Hollywood that no longer exists.The film's storyline is well known. I won't belabor it here, except to say that it communicates an honest and introspective indictment of the entertainment industry as it once was. The story can be thought of as a kind of archetypal Hollywood memoir, expressed as a musical.But musicals are supposed to be upbeat, lighthearted, fun. This one isn't. Moments of humor and joy are swept away in a cascade of emotional pain and tragedy. Fiction mimics real life. How appropriate that the film's signature song "The Man That Got Away" is one that is so uncompromisingly serious, poignant, and smoldering ... a perfect vehicle for Judy Garland.Some say she had the greatest singing voice of any entertainer in the twentieth century. This film lends credence to that assertion. Every song she sings is performed with such consummate verve, such emotional commitment that she seems to be singing not just for her contemporaries, but also for generations to come. Indeed, she is. My personal favorite is the "Born In A Trunk" segment, all fifteen minutes of it. Surrounded by sets of true cinematic art, she belts out one tune after another, including, of course, the poignant "Melancholy Baby".Judy's singing and the music itself are what make the movie so memorable. But she also demonstrates her considerable acting talent. And the acting of other cast members is fine, especially the performances of James Mason and Jack Carson. I do think that the film was, and still is, too long, the result of an overly ambitious screenplay.That Judy Garland was denied the Best Actress Oscar is poignant. But her talent was so massive, her uniqueness was so special, maybe fate required a compensatory level of pain and tragedy, as a prerequisite of legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be sure to see the restored version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been written about this movie (to extremely great length) in other reviews, so I'll try to keep this fairly brief and concise.First, the restored version runs at 176 minutes. The movie originally ran at 181 minutes, but was cut to 154 minutes when theater owners complained that they were losing money due to the excessive length. The cut destroyed the integrity of the movie - director Cukor never saw the movie again. However, the restored version contains stills to replace some of the cut footage, and gives a better sense of the film's power and scope.Second, all four major studio versions of the story (including "What Price Hollywood?") have their own merits and differ greatly from one another. If you like the story, see them all and compare for yourself. It's quite fun to compare!Third, definitely see this version for Judy. Sure, Judy's "The Man That Got Away" may be the greatest musical moment on cinema, but it's her dramatic performance that will keep your attention over almost three hours. James Mason is on target, and the supporting cast is fine, but Judy just dominates the screen. It's an opportunity to see a true genius in action at the absolute height of her powers. For more dramatic Judy, see her in "The Clock".George Cukor was acclaimed as the great director of actresses, and he raises Judy to the height she deserves. I love Judy. This is a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland at Her Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1954 musicalized version of A Star Is Born is a great film. Judy Garland and James Mason (both Oscar nominated) turn in terrific performance as Esther and Norman. Like its 1937 predecessor (which starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March?both Oscar nominated), the 1954 version follows the ups and down of two people set against the vicious world of Hollywood. The newer version sticks to the basic story but adds some great numbers for Garland, including "The Man That Got Away" and "I Was Born in a Trunk." In a major comeback, Garland had not worked in films since Summer Stock (1950), and her performance here is the best of her career. That she lost the Oscar to Grace Kelly for The Country Girl is one of Hollywood's great inequities. Mason lost to Marlon Brando for On the Waterfront. Garland sings superbly and is a great comic and dramatic actress. Her Esther is more vulnerable than Gaynor's just as Mason's Norman is more pathetic than March's. I love both versions. Charles Bickford and Jack Carson play the other major parts, played by Adolphe Menjou and Lionel Stander in 1937. Two major supporting roles from the 1937 version were cut from the 1954 version: Esther's first Hollywood friend (Andy Devine) and her intrepid grandmother (the great May Robson). But Garland's musical numbers make up for their absence. Oddly, despite the great hullabaloo surrounding A Star Is Born, it was not nominated for best picture, and George Cukor was bypassed in the directing category. One of the best musicals ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Savage Story, Made Perfect in its Restored Version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year 1954 proved to be one of the professional best for Judy Garland, as she did an outstanding comeback in A STAR IS BORN, a part that if not meant for her originally when the first version of this movie was filmed as WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD?(1932), was the one which she made her own and to this day is the most referred to and remembered for the sheer emotional honesty and power to which acted the part of Esther Blodgett. That is was not awarded by the Academy in favor for a more "correct" acting by Grace Kelly is one of those great injustices that has been done, and that its competition with ON THE WATERFRONT was too tight to garner it any of the major awards was just bad timing on its release (today the results would have been different, dividing the awards), but time has eventually healed these major slips -- at least on Judy Garland's favor, the greater of the two actresses by a long shot -- and as a movie, it still holds up today in its poignant portrayal of a marriage destroyed by alcoholism and the coldness of the media closely watching its disintegration.Originally at 154 minutes, the restored, 179 minute version is the best to watch because it does effectively tie up some plot holes and the way Mason's character eventually meets up with Garland's who is wondering if he was serious about making her a star -- the transition in the first, cut version would have been too easy and unbelievable, a borderline fairytale. Both Garland and Mason tackle difficult parts flawlessly without going over the top in histrionics but giving both their characters a painful, human dignity that should not have been lost on the Academy even then, and Mason's descent into alcoholism and later, self-sacrificial suicide is one of the most heartbreaking ever committed on film, even if in reality, it was Garland who was the ravaged, addicted star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special praise for Turner Classic Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a brief getaway this past weekend, the hotel where I was staying had TCM (Turner Classic Movies) on its cable roster and, lo! and behold, there was Judy singing and acting her heart out in letterbox and stereo sound. TCM...you're the best!It was the restored version, thank the good Lord, with that sad reminder of Warner Brothers' pathetic timidity in trashing Cukor's original cut, but recalling for us his masterful use of the widescreen ratio. (A "formatted" version would be simply unwatchable, what with numerous scenes played by actors perched on the outer reaches of the screen, opposite each other.)James Mason turns in an absolutely brilliant performance, especially when one recalls the rigors of production, with filming going months over schedule, due to Judy's unhappy vicissitudes (so evident in her appearance even within the same scene!) With the very able support of Charles Bickford, as the most benign studio head ever, and Jack Carson proving why Warners kept him employed so often for so many years.Plus musical direction taking fabulous advantage of Warners' studio orchestra (and WB's sound technicians who were, for several decades running, the envy of all the other major studios), and arrangements that must have overwhelmed first-run audiences with their incredible richness.It's a must-see, all right, and is in a class by itself, among the several screen versions of this beloved Hollywood saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make sure to watch the Widescreen Version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a career of classic performances this may be Judy Garland's best role and one that certainly uses her many talents to the hilt. James Mason gives an Oscar caliber performance as well and I believe in almost any other year that he wasn't up against Brando's "On the Waterfront" performance he would and should have won. This George Cukor film features gorgeous color and beautiful cinematography, but does suffer from choppy editing that may be the result of restored footage. The project to restore over an hour of missing footage scrapped by the producers after the original length was in excess of four and a half hours may have been done with the best intentions, but is still incomplete and leaves the film disjointed and obviously lacking. I certainly wish the original footage was never scrapped, but this spotty attempt at restoration makes you feel like your watching more of a project than a classic film. Sometimes less is more and definitely in this case. Whatever you do make sure you see the widescreen version of this film that was originally shot in Cinemascope or you will only see about a third of the actual picture and I assure you, you won't want to miss any of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Oscar that got away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not without its flaws, but overall, it is a masterpiece.The quintessential story of a couple, one who's career is on the rise, the other on the decline- is made extraordinary by the performances.Ester Blodgett, aka: Vicki Lester (Judy Garland) plays the unknown talent with pipes that would put an organ to shame. Her singing in this movie is definitely a HUGE reason to watch it- especially the show stopper, "The Man that got away." Ester meets, by chance &amp; some help from the bottle, the cinematic icon, Norman Maine (James Mason.) Even though he's drunk, he is taken with her. Much later that night, he finds her at a club just "kickin' it" with the boys in the band. In what is probably the best 5 mins of music in the history of musicals- Judy lets it all out in "The Man that got away." Sincerely, I MYSELF, have never heard singing like that. So absolutely raw, almost uncontrolled and full-out and all heart that it always gives me goosebumps! And an unobserved Norman Maine comes out of the shadows to tell Ester that he TOO has never heard singing like that. He tells her, (completely sober after sleeping off a little) that she has a great talent. And he makes her believe it.She eventually gets her chance with some help from Norman, and makes a big hit movie. She starts to make a lotta hit movies. Meanwhile, Norman gets cut from the studio by his longtime friend &amp; boss, Oliver Niles. One thing leads to another &amp; even though he is happily married now to Ester, his drinking starts up again. In a scene that is almost too awful to watch, he stumbles in on her acceptance speech at the Academy Awards. I dunno if that slap was real, but it looked real. And the ashamed look on his face afterwards looks real.I won't give away the ending, but I will tell you why I liked this movie. First of all is Judy's singing. There are many memorable songs and moments. She always gives it her all when she sings. Or to paraphrase Ester in the movie, it's when she is her most alive. Her acting is terrific too. In a scene that is so well written and ahead of its time (and timeless), Ester tells her friend &amp; studio head that she is worried about what's happening to her &amp; Norman. That she hates him for the lies, for the promises to quit, and for failing. That she too feels like a failure. This scene encapsulates the ripple effect caused by alcoholism. Judy is absolutely mesmerizing as the wife who has discovered that love is not enough.James Mason delivers one of the best &amp; most convincing performances of an alcoholic on the decline that I've ever seen on screen. First of all, his charm &amp; sincerity are apparent. When Libby (his Publicity Agent) says that his appeal &amp; charm escape him, it's because he didn't see this side of him. He only saw the mean drunk and that wasn't who Norman Maine really was. James Mason is LOOKS so convincing that you'd swear he had a quick 6 or 7 drinks before the shoot. And his pain is real. In the scene where she gets him out of night court, his self-disgust and shame are vividly on his face. And the scene where he over-hears Ester &amp; Oliver talking about him is enough to make anyone reach for the hankies. He has so much chemistry with Judy that you'd swear they were really in love. Many a reviewer has mentioned this- and I won't speculate on it- suffice to say that it adds tremendously to the movie, because it seems palpable how much Ester &amp; Norman care about each other &amp; are desperately in love. Definite Oscar-calibre performance by Garland &amp; Mason here. This is the story of the Oscar that got away. In any world that was just, they both would've gotten one.All the supporting roles are well done and not too obtrusive. My only complaint with the movie is the editing. I'm happy to have the restored version, but the editing could've made a more intense, compact version of the film. I will give one of many examples: The scene towards the end where her friend from the band arrives at her house to take her to the benefit. It is a very important scene. The next scene is at the benefit location. We have several minutes of them showing the backstage bustle before Ester &amp; her friend enter. They already showed in the beginning of the film all the backstage confusion- it slows down the story. They could've cut directly to the part where she &amp; him walk in. You still get a sense of what's going on around them without that long lead-in. That is just an example, there are more. But it is a minor complaint - I have a DVD &amp; can scan when I need to. Overall this is a timeless movie with outstanding performances. A must see!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent entertainment, subtle filming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alcoholic movie star Norman Maine (James Mason) meets singer Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland) and gets her the screen test she needs to become a big star (and change her name to Vicki Lester?has any name ever so desperately needed changing?).This was not my first viewing of A Star Is Born, but it was illuminating. I certainly already believed it was a great movie, but it is far more subtle and complex than I had previously known. The movie is working on several levels at once. In one way, it's a straight-ahead musical, with some wonderful songs and production numbers. At another level, it's an 'inside Hollywood' story, and that level works remarkably well. Some of the 'events' (the opening, the Academy Awards) look almost raw in their filming style, almost like news footage, creating a powerful impression of being behind the scenes. The production numbers support that impression, with numerous bits and visuals lifted from other musicals, so that we are clued into the idea that we are seeing what "really" happened, or might have happened, on any number of film sets (at one point, An American in Paris is referenced directly).Finally, it is a remarkably honest and true portrayal of alcoholism and marriage to an alcoholic. Esther's co-dependence is seen for what it is, her pain is real, her self-flagellation is real. If anything, the movie is overly sympathetic with Norman Maine, portraying the publicist (Jack Carson) who is disgusted with him as a villain. When I saw A Star Is Born for the first time, I was in *my* one and only relationship with an alcoholic. I wept with Judy Garland and I knew firsthand how accurately her agony was depicted. All these years later, quite recovered from any desire to go THERE again, I sympathize almost as much with the publicist. Kick the bum out! A few weeks ago I saw the train wreck that is New York, New York. It seemed like Scorcese's intention was to deconstruct, while at the same time celebrating, the 40s Hollywood musical. He wanted to show the ugliness behind those magical romances, the meanness behind those amusingly bossy men, and he still wanted to enjoy the glamour. Upon re-viewing A Star Is Born, I wondered why he bothered. It's already been done, as well as could possibly be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garland's Shining Hour in a Pristine Print of Her Legendary Vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marked by a pervasive sense of melancholy, the 1954 musical version of the familiar Hollywood warhorse will forever be remembered as Judy Garland's most acclaimed work in films. Even though she would go on to a handful of films in the early 1960's, this was her last leading role in a major Hollywood production, an ironic point since she plays an emerging movie star on the rise. True, she doesn't look her best in the film, but her fulsome talent is on full, heart-wrenching display as Esther Blodgett, an obscure but thriving band singer who becomes movie star Vicki Lester thanks to Norman Maine, an alcoholic has-been movie star in career free-fall. Their love story and the opposing trajectories of their careers are tracked meticulously by Moss Hart's shrewdly observed screenplay and George Cukor's sensitive direction.The double-sided 2000 DVD provides the 176-minute restored version, which is just five minutes less than what was shown at the original premiere. Until 1983, the half-hour of footage excised after the premiere was thought lost, but film historian Ron Haver found much of it and supervised an extraordinary restoration effort that includes a necessary albeit brief use of production stills to match up with the complete soundtrack. Even with such technicalities, the resulting film is even more of a landmark musical drama, emotionally resonant in spite of certain pacing issues with the storyline. Cukor's approach is probably more leisurely than the relatively hard-boiled material requires since he includes so many establishing and lengthy shots, but his direction shows his legendary sensitivity toward actors.While he comes across a bit too robust as a fading matinée idol, James Mason vigorously captures Norman's scornful pride and self-pity. He may lack Fredric March's innate sense of vulnerability in the original, but Mason makes the character's inner torment more palpable. As for Garland, she brings so much of her own history to Esther/Vicki that her scenes feel alive with her vibrant, masochistic personality. She is aided immeasurably by the masterful songs of Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin, most significantly her torchy rendition of "The Man That Got Away", as perfect a musical movie moment as has been ever produced. While her work in the fifteen-minute "Born in the Trunk" sequence is impressive, it is really later in the film when she soars, in particular, when she segues from the tap-happy "Lose That Long Face" into a breakdown scene in her dressing room with sympathetic studio head Oliver Niles portrayed with his typically stentorian fervor by Charles Bickford.The print condition and sound quality on the DVD are superb. There are also some fascinating extras on the B-side starting with three alternative takes on "The Man That Got Away", each distinctive in presentation with costume and lighting changes, a must for Garland fans. Also included is a very brief deleted number within the "Born in the Trunk" sequence", "When My Sugar Walks Down the Street". Three vintage pieces have been gathered - a brief newsreel piece of the premiere, a four-minute clip of the Coconut Grove premiere party held after the premiere, and most interestingly, a half-hour kinescope akin to the current-day red carpet pre-shows with an amazing parade of period stars expressing little more than good wishes on their way to the theater. Lastly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of "A Star Is Born" are also included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed with many aspects of a Star is Born. The restored version of the film is more than an hour too long. There are so many drawn out scenes and musical numbers that any tension between the characters is completely dissipated by the time we come to the tragic ending. The two great scenes -- Judy Garland's night club performance of the Man that Got Away and her song and dance routine in her living room using a lamp shade as a Chinese hat -- don't make up for all of the other overly long and unnecessary (as far as the plot or the character development is concerned) musical numbers. This is a showcase for Garland's considerable musical talents, it is not a well scripted movie. It's ashame because James Mason is terrific in his scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a few persons consider "A Star is Born" to be Judy Garland's finest film, and there is, indeed, a great deal to admire in it.Among the good: First, Sam Leavitt's Cinemascope cinematography may well be the best demonstration of wide screen Technicolor photography ever committed to celluloid. His compositional balance in each frame is rarely less than breathtaking, and this also applies to the Technicolor whose chroma is similarly balanced and visually thrilling. The reds and blues achieved in the opening backstage sequence startle the sensibilities in their effectiveness.Ray Heindorf's orchestrations are the finest in any Garland film, even surpassing those of Lennie Hayton and Johnny Green. The use of brass in many of the orchestrations attains a big band blues perfectly in pitch with the rueful story about to unfold. This is particularly true during the overture where the picture's principal themes are laid out in swinging rhythms drenched in deep emotion.Art direction is similarly distinguished perhaps most evidently in the otherwise expendable "Born in a Trunk" segment.Alas, we come at last to the screenplay. Few would argue with the choice of Moss Hart as a scenarist, but despite the best efforts of those involved, the story fails to cohere.This failure has less to do with the situations themselves, than with the characters as they are delineated in both script and performance.Norman Maine is ostensibly intended to be a charming and attractive man, despite the fact that he is in the throes of a losing battle with dipsomania. However, as etched by James Mason, Norman fails entirely to transmit even the remotest appeal. Consider his opening sequence, as he smashes mirrors and attempts to pinion showgirls, not to mention a whole raft of similar offenses. Where is the charm in this? Where is the appeal? What on earth would endear him to a total stranger? Most people would be running for the hills to get out of his way. His only genuine moment comes when he describes Esther's talent to her after hearing her in the after hours club.If Mason had brought some of the smoldering appeal he had manifested in "The Man in Gray" perhaps the audience could buy Esther's infatuation. As it stands, her interest in him seems wholly contrived.Judy Garland's Esther Blodgett is a woman of considerable appeal, but the emotional instability she suggests throughout, throws the whole script off kilter. Surely, Mr. Hart intended that she provide the ballast to Mr. Mason's portrayal. After all, she is the woman who thinks she can save Norman Maine. As it is, however, she is so utterly neurasthenic in not a few of her on screen moments, that the viewer is forced to conclude that, of the two of them, Norman appears far more psychologically self possessed.Then there are simply blatant inconsistencies in the script. For example upon meeting Norman, Esther recalls working for a band, and painting her fingernails in gas station washrooms. "Wow that was a low point," she intones, "...and no matter what I'll never do it again." What kind of "low point" was it ? however, when she is later depicted working as a car hop! Musically the film serves to transition Miss Garland from MGM sweet miss to international concert diva, sometimes at the expense of the introspective plaintiveness she had displayed so often in the 40s.Presumably the premiere of her "new voice" as she called it, was the by-product of her play dates at the Palladium and Palace, where she embraced a powerhouse style of belting not found in her MGM vocals. Certainly the voice is deeper and harder hitting. How appealing the change is considered varies according to the taste of the listener.Nelson Riddle later averred that he had difficulty in convincing her to revert to her earlier style, though when he succeeded, (as in her late 50's Capital recording of "Just Imagine" )the results were enchanting.Still it must be admitted that vocally she is at her peak, both in depth of interpretation and emotional resonance.Though Garland's voice may have changed for the better, however, her appearance had most certainly not. Unlike her fellow MGM alums, Jane Powell, Gloria De Haven, June Allyson, Kathryn Grayson or Ann Miller who had changed but little during the preceding decade, Garland bears little visual connection to her Metro ingénue period. She is not helped at all by a new (very dark and very short, with nary a hint of her Metro auburn) hair-do which is scarcely flattering.Though she looks smashing in the Academy Awards sequence and "Melancholy Baby," these are the only two sequences that recall her former prettiness, or find her successfully gowned.Then, as Noel Coward (a huge fan of hers) confided to his diary after seeing the unexpurgated version, it's "interminable." The picture was in severe need of trimming, and though it's undeniably true that the cutting was ham fisted, with the removal of worthy sequences, there can be no denying that "Born in a Trunk" (yes it has virtues--such as the stunning "Melancholy Baby" with Garland in the swank gray gown with opera gloves) is padded and unnecessary, bringing the whole momentum of the story to a dead halt, and causing British critic Leslie Halliwell to conclude that the "musical numbers add very little except length." All of which probably contributed to the picture's commercial failure. Certainly, none of the blame lies with Garland, who does turn in an arrestingly emotional performance. In this connection it must be recalled that musicals were collapsing at the box office at this time, and many such extravaganzas were failing to reap back their production costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where The Rainbow Ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all intents and purposes THIS star (Garland) was born when she sang a plaintive Black and White Somewhere Over The Rainbow in 'The Wizard Of Oz' and now, fifteen years later after a lifetime of ups and downs that unique talent flowered for one last, glorious time and dazzled anyone with eyes to see. In some ways it's a great pity that she was artistically active both before Oz and after Star because together these two movies make the perfect bookends to a spectacular yet ultimately tragic career. This definitive version of A Star Is Born boasts no less than four standout performances from - in alphabetical order - Charles Bickford, Jack Carson, Judy Garland and James Mason and we shouldn't overlook Tommy Noonan's contribution to the general excellence. Playing her second character named Esther - the first was Esther Smith in the third outstanding Garland feature, Meet Me In St Louis - Garland hits every stop on the gamut and joins fellow singers Frank Sinatra and Yves Montand in displaying a superb emotional acting range. She didn't need to show how well she could SING, we knew that going in but what we didn't know - but would see reinforced in both Judgment at Nuremberg and A Child Is Waiting - is how well she could ACT. In MMISL she performed three great numbers that all transcended the film but none of the three was a Torch song and here she addresses that omission with The Man That Got Away which rightfully takes its place firstly beside The Boy Next Door, The Trolley Song and Have Yourself A Merrly Little Christmas and secondly among the all-time-great Standards of the 20th century. James Mason was an actor first and a star second and he has seldom been better than his washed-up alcoholic actor Norman Maine and Mason's artistry is such that he permits us a glimpse of just how GOOD an actor Maine really was in his heyday or to put it another way, BEFORE we, the audience, met Maine. Bickford slightly underplays Oliver Niles which makes his studio boss the more effective and Jack Carson oozes insincerity from every pore. This is really a first-rate melodrama which just happens to have some great songs in it, either way it's top drawer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh Lord, what a long, long, long movie. Rarely will you find yourself investing so much time for so little payoff. Alcoholic husband makes wife a star. Husband dies. Wife feels sad. The end.Director George Cukor thinks he's making a Biblical epic, because he uses an enormous aspect ratio and fills it to the brim with tacky Technicolor sets and costumes. Sure, Judy Garland gives a fine performance, as does James Mason, but both were better in other things and both are dwarfed by the sheer size of the production and the wispiness of the plot. And this is one musical in which I could have done with less music.A word of warning: the restored version may sound like a good idea, because it's the most complete version of the movie to be released. But "restored" means that still photographs have been inserted into the film in a simulated reproduction of certain scenes, while a soundtrack accompanies them. This wouldn't have been so bad if there hadn't been so many scenes needing restoration, and if they hadn't been quite so long, and if they had contributed anything of value to the final product.I want these three hours of my life back.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Star That Fizziled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite know that Judy Garlands star was on the decline at M.G.M. and with all fairness, not all was Judy Garlands fault, but she had goofed up by not making certain movies such as The Barkleys of Broadway, Royal Wedding, Annie Get Your Gun, and when asked to play Julie in Show Boat, her contract had expired and the part went to Ava Gardner, and with all fairness, I've heard the original soundtrack to Annie Get Your Gun with Judy Garland and Howard Keel, and without seeing those outtakes that had been filmed, it quite obvious that if Judy Garland had filmed Annie; it would have stunk-up the joint! Betty Hutton was the better choice although I would have preferred Betty Grable! So, A Star Is Born was to be Judy's comeback to the movies, but this film and others, after Star, has proved that her movie star status was on the decline, so it was better for her to do her one woman shows that would work out for her so well, but what about A Star is Born? Well, I could probably get shot for saying the following, but here goes: I know that there are a lot of people out there that have this Adulterous Star Relationship with Judy Garland and think that their Judy can do no harm, but A Star Is Born is not a very good movie. Of the two, Grace Kelly was the one who deserved the Oscar, and Groucho Marx was just being nice when he stated after the Oscars, and Judy's not winning, that "This is the biggest robbery since Brinks"! But it wasn't. Judy's acting is just, again, Judy Garland on the screen playing Judy Garland. The songs are great, but most not good for the movie or the plot. Let's start with "Gotta Have You Go with Me": This is a great song and performed well and fits into the story line very well. "The Man That Got Away": Great song! Perfect for the spot in the move, but - Judy Garland gave me a stereophonic headache. Remember that this was in Stereophic Sound. Too much screaming and yelling to make it sound dramatic. Could have been toned down a little and be more effective so that in one place in the song, she wouldn't look like she was about the eat the trombone! Now, here comes the tough one: Did they really have to have that overly long "Born In A Trunk" number in there? This number stops the show from moving forward and there's no sense in it being there. They could have eliminated this from the movie and just had a good old fashion rousing "Swanee" number like only Judy can sing it. End the film on the screen, go out of the theater and go on with the show.When hearing: "What Am I Here For? I Wish I Knew?": Exactly my sentiments since I was dragged to this movie by my family who adored Judy Garland as one of their own! "Go and Get Your Long Face Lost"? Amateur theater could do that one better. Good thing the number got axed! "Somewhere There's A Someone For Me?" Either eliminate it, or shorten it. The song would be better for a musical with Elizabeth Taylor since she has been married about 10 times and after each divorce or death, probably would think "Somwehere There's A Someone For Me"! "It's A New World"? Probably the best song in the whole movie. Now, that's the old Judy Garland who knew how to effectively put a song over! No screaming, no yelling! Just a good Ole song like good Ole Judy could sing them! The movie is too long. There are scenes that could be deleted that have no business being there. This movie could have easily been edited to a good 2 to 2 1/2 hours with no problem and would have turned out much better than it did. Long movies do not necessarily make great movies. Movie makers should watch a film like "Flame Of the Barbery Coast" with John Wayne, or even Disney Classics such as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to see perfect editing and the use of every minute and second of film that's showing on the screen! This was not so in A Star Is Born!Personally, I believe they were all sincere in trying to make a good movie, but Judy Garlands star had wane as far as movies go, and she was never again the star she was in movies such as "Meet Me In St. Louis", yes, even "summer Stock" although not a good movie, but pleasant, and, of course, the brilliant "Easter Parade"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long... and Judy Garland's voice is beginning to grate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently my Wife and I (I'm 40 and she's 31) have been watching Classic movies in HD on Sky Movies. We've watched some really good films of late, and I was keen to watch a James Mason film. Coming from the same county as James Mason, and having already seen a selection of his movies I was looking forward to this film.We watched what must have been the version where missing scenes were supplemented by publicity stills, and the original audio. After the first hour all was going well, and we both accepted the 50's plodding momentum of the film, but stuck with it. Not really commenting on the movie, we continued for another hour or so, until I said, "I've gotta take a break from this film"... my Wife said "me too, her voice is doing my head in"...We are both educated adults, and understand the definition of a musical, but this film is just too long, and if I had to listen to Judy Garland sing again, I'd have thrown my drink into the surround sound to stop it once and for all.It was a massive shame that we couldn't stick with it... but each to their own... if you love this film then that's great, but I'm afraid our fickle 2010 minds couldn't hang in there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional...but so was the 1937 version of this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: This review is for the reassembled version of the film shown recently on Turner Classic Movies. It seemed that Warner Brothers Studio decided to severely trim the film (partly to squeeze in more shows in a given day!) and threw away the edited film stock! However, the sound track remained and so for a few minor scenes, stills were inserted in this restored version as the sound fills in the rest! This is an odd film for me to watch because I almost always hate seeing remakes--and this is a remake of the 1937 Janet Gaynor film. It's also odd because the Academy chose to nominate it for six awards--and that certainly is not something you expect for a remake--especially since the original film was brilliant. Currently the original has an overall rating of 7.7 and this remake a 7.8, if you care about that sort of thing.When this movie begins, you can see an obvious difference between the 1930s and 50s versions. The original suffers from poor color--mostly because Technicolor was new and not completely perfected. Whereas the 1950s version uses CinemaScope--a color system that looks even better than real life. Sure, the colors are very, very intense but they make for a lovely film! One other obvious difference between the films is the musical angle. Miss Gaynor was not a singer and her version has her portraying an actress--and she looks more suited to the role due to her looking much younger. However, as Judy Garland was a great singer, her Esther Blodgett was changed to a singer AND movie star--and the film is much more like a musical. If you love musicals, this is an exceptional one--though I really thought all the singing and dancing got in the way of the plot on occasion. Because of this, the 1930s version is easier to watch. I'm not a huge fan of Garland's singing, so my nod would go to the less musical version---but I could really see Garland fans ADORING this film--you get to see and hear A LOT of her and this is one of her last performances where she has her 'A-game'--she sings her heart out. Sadly, drugs would take a severe toll on her acting and singing in later films. Even sadder is that MGM doctors apparently were responsible for getting her hooked on these drugs, as the studio gave her amphetamines in order to increase her film output!! Poor thing-- she certainly deserved better and she did look a bit old for this role (she looked much older than 32)--most likely due to these drugs.Despite lacking originality, you can't help but enjoy this film. Sure Hollywood didn't NEED to remake the original (it was a great film), but end result is wonderful and different enough that it can be appreciated on its own merits. The acting and direction are lovely and the story, even if it's been done before, was very good and full of charm. The same, by the way, cannot be said of the yechy remake from the 1970s which starred Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. Now THAT was a dreadful film! By the way, although Miss Garland is known mostly for this film and "The Wizard of Oz", try watching her in "The Clock"--a 'small' film that is just marvelous and highly underrated.Also, it's amusing that the in the film the studio moguls hate her given name (Esther Blodgett). The same was true in real life for Garland, as her actual given name was Frances Gumm!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece Is Restored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylistically, A STAR IS BORN is an aggressive film filled with bright colors, bombastic music, and larger than life performances. As such, it seems typical of "blockbuster" films of the 1950s and 1960s. But A STAR IS BORN uses this "bigness" to a considerably different end than its counterparts: rather than containing garish display for its own sake, it contains it for thematic purpose.The theme developed by writer Moss Hart and director Cukor (who considered this his masterpiece) is one of the various levels of artificiality intrinsic to show business, and differences between degrees of artificiality are carefully drawn in scene after scene. The audience enjoys a show--never knowing that the star is blind drunk. The set crew prepares to film an upbeat musical number--never aware that the leading lady is having hysterics in her dressing room. Guests join their hostess in watching a movie--never knowing that their host is being quietly fired in an adjoining room.The performances that drive A STAR IS BORN are perfectly in line with the film's juxtaposition of reality and artifice. Garland offers a justly famous bravado performance in broad strokes and with an undercurrent of artifice that becomes increasingly noticeable as the film builds, underscoring her gradual immersion in and consumption by the film industry. Mason, in equally brilliant fashion, contrasts her with a performance that becomes painfully realistic as the film progresses. The dissonance created is quite startling: it is easy to see why the two characters attract each other, but it is also easy to forecast how they will self-destruct.Although musical numbers abound, A STAR IS BORN is not typical of the genre, for the music does not form the primary structure of the film. Still, like most other elements in the film, the songs feed into the film's themes--and always in the most ironic way possible. Near the film's conclusion, Maine ask Vicki to sing for him while he, unbeknownst to her, prepares for suicide. The song she sings is "A New World." And indeed after Maine's death it will be all of that, a world in which unreality will go unchecked and Vicki will win applause by introducing herself as "Mrs. Norman Maine," turning her private grief into box office salvation.A STAR IS BORN is profoundly bitter film that for all its brashness operates in a remarkably subtle way to make a very dark statement about Hollywood fame: the entertainment we enjoy on screen is an illusion with a price, and that price is a confusion of reality and fantasy played out with stakes of life and death. The current DVD offers the film in its restored state, in Cinemascope, and with television broadcast footage of the Los Angeles premiere. If you're serious about film, this is a must-own, must-see.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Restoral of lost footage can never save Garland's overblown performance and overrated story of unappealing screen star's sad decline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 20 minutes into 'A Star is Born', I became thoroughly confused as to what was happening in the storyline. Fading, alcoholic screen star, Norman Maine (James Mason), has just persuaded Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland) to quit her job as a singer in a band with the promise that he'll get her a screen test the next day at his movie studio. Maine persuades Esther to take the 'chance of a lifetime' and she vows she'll never work again as a waitress, a job she was slaving away at prior to procuring her current job as a low-rent band singer. The next thing I see are a series of production stills with the film's soundtrack underneath. There are brief glimpses of moving pictures including Esther working as a car hop. I was thinking, 'what gives?'--she stated emphatically she wouldn't be going back to working in such a menial job and here she is, serving all varieties of hamburgers at a fast food joint. And what happened to the screen test that Maine promised to get her the next day?I was warned by the hosts at TCM (including Alec Baldwin) who introduced the film on TV. They said there was some footage missing but the soundtrack was intact. I didn't know exactly what they meant until I actually saw the 'restoration'. My reaction was, 'Oh my God, I have never seen anything as pathetic as this in the movies'. I had to consult Wikipedia to find out what transpired during the missing footage. Well it seems that Maine was called away early to film on location and forgot to write down Esther's address. When she didn't hear from him, she assumed that he was merely flirting with her and that's when she's forced to take the job as a car hop. Only later, Maine locates Esther and makes good on his promise to help her. Wikipedia also explains that Warner executives chopped the film to pieces after Director George Cukor left to scout locations for a new film. Somehow, the executives didn't realize that by cutting crucial scenes, the film's continuity would be seriously compromised. You would think that despite the fact that that they now had a new version of the film, the cut scenes would somehow be placed in the studio's archives, where they would at least be preserved for posterity. But no, the missing scenes are no longer extant, and I wonder exactly what became of them? Who made the decision to throw them in the garbage can? Even Wikipedia doesn't have the answers.Despite the missing footage, one can still realize that 'A Star is Born' is a vastly overrated film. Take for starters, the character of Norman Maine. We're told that he's a movie star of great import and even after his death, Oliver Niles (Charles Bickford) the studio head, states emphatically to the studio's publicist, Matt Libby (Jack Carson) that Maine was "a great guy". Why exactly is he "a great guy?" In reality, there is nothing at all appealing about the character. He's basically a self-centered drunk who attempts to undermine his wife's career out of jealousy. When he drunkenly crashes Esther's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards, that underscores what an unlikeable character he is. When he's at the sanitarium and Niles offers him a part to try and rehabilitate his career, Maine is in complete denial, and tells his boss that he has other offers pending at major studios. The coup de grace is when he selfishly commits suicide after he overhears Niles informing his wife that he's all washed up.And what about the sorry plot of 'A Star is Born'. It's so completely predictable because we know where it's going?Maine intends to do himself in. The only question is how. There's virtually no conflict throughout the film. Early on, Esther easily chooses to go for the screen test over staying with the band (she's already made up her mind after she falls for Maine's charms). Despite the fact that everyone knows Maine is a boorish alcoholic, for some reason he still has enough clout to walk into his boss's office and gets him to listen how good a singer Esther is. It doesn't take much to convince Niles to place Esther, the unknown contract player, in a major motion picture, which leads to her becoming a star overnight. Once Esther becomes a star, there are no longer any surprises. When not singing in overlong and overblown production numbers, she becomes preoccupied with her sad sack husband whose decline is illustrated in a series of repetitious scenes. I continue to maintain that 'sad sacks' who don't like themselves, do not make for good drama!Finally, there's Judy Garland, who mugs her way through the atrocious plot. The tacky storyline is simply a vehicle for Garland to throw in the kitchen sink as far as presenting one dubious song after another. The producers were so hard up that they had to dig out Al Jolson's old chestnut, 'Swanee', which proved to be Garland's best number, but a tune which seemed completely out of place in this movie. And what of the majority of the songs here? Well, the truth is that most of them do not stand the test of time?they are instantly forgettable and no one remembers them today. The question remains, was Garland as great as so many say she is? Certainly not in this movie! Yes, she had that big, booming voice and certainly her "Somewhere over the Rainbow" is a true classic. But just look at her singing and acting here in what is supposed to be her great comeback vehicle--I know many will not agree, but to me, simply put, it's corny and dated. 'Star' has some great cinematography but a storyline that features an unappealing protagonist in decline coupled with the performance of a real life star, also headed downhill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two-thirds of a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three-hour musical proved something of a swan-song for Judy Garland, who had few starring roles after this, none of them as high-profile as "A Star Is Born". Yet, this isn't quite the blockbuster fans and critics hoped for. Garland's shaky real-life lends her a naked vulnerability as Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester, but it's too taxing on the audience; she's sweet and gracious, but all too much so. Her character has no resilience, she's too easily led, too easily humiliated, and eventually our sympathies go towards her boozing, fading husband (James Mason, as curt and clipped as ever). Serves as a nice showcase for Judy's vocal talents, as there are many song numbers, but the melodrama in the music is more absorbing than the marriage stuff. Still, for the first two of the three hours, it has drive and gorgeous color. In the third hour, right about the time Mason loses his movie contract and people start calling him "Mr. Lester", the movie sinks to the bottle's bottom, in a boozy sea of pathos and masochism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, falters under its own weight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judy Garland will always be respected and honored as one of the most talented and moving performers of the 20th century. For practically her whole career, she was singing and dancing. In A Star is Born, she goes for perhaps the most dramatic of all her roles. This is certainly her most complete performance, although I would hesitate to call it a better one than that in The Wizard of Oz. Here, she goes tour de force in every way. She sings, dances, cries, laughs and gives a truly understated performance. Equally matching her is the great James Mason, perfect for the role of a has-been fading actor due to his great professionalism and mannerisms.I cannot knock the dance sequences or the set productions as they are so well-done and lavish that they almost steer the attention away from the actors. What bothers me most here is the story as it follows too close to the life of Norman Maine (and many agree the life of Judy Garland). The first half is quite good, depicting Norman's attempt to recreate his own image through the young but talented Esther Blodgett, soon to be named Vicki Lester. His loyalty and trustworthiness shines through and creates great drama for the both of them. What began to weigh down the film was when the two got married. From then on I just became more and more disappointed.The biggest reason the second half fails is because the characters go from being three-dimensional to caricatures capable only of being dictated by the script. The characters soon go way over the edge and start acting like stereotypes of a typical American melodrama. This takes away the edge and soon I couldn't believe for a minute what was happening to them. I really could not believe what I was witnessing, especially considering the great talent involved.It's obvious many others disagree with me, calling this one of the greatest musicals ever made by Hollywood and Judy Garland's finest hour. But I cannot oblige that honor because I felt many of it was just constructed to get false emotions out of the audience. The final scene works well, but not well enough because of what it followed. I do feel disappointed that Garland and Mason will be remembered for these roles when they both did much better in other movies. After seeing this, I watched The Wizard of Oz again. To see it only furthered my belief that Garland was never better as the plucky Dorothy. And she never will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let's ask for the moon--we had Judy Garland's star...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I quoted Andy Warhol in my review of Cukor's IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU!, who once said that everyone will be a superstar for 15 minutes. Cukor's earlier Judy Holliday vehicle scratched the surface of the pitfalls of celebrity, and here he is given a much bigger canvas to paint with, and he runs with it. His flawed masterpiece (it was a little too long, then savagely cut 30 minutes by the studio, some characters are overwhelming, and the famous centerpiece "Born in a Trunk" works better as a Judy Garland showcase than for plot reasons) nakedly displays the nightmare of the Dream Machine, which is almost terrifying in its honesty. But the film is as much about the mores of Hollywood as it is a tragic love story about the strengths and weaknesses of a couple living and loving on dangerous ground. Judy Garland and James Mason are phenomenal as Esther Blodgett and Norman Maine, a young up-and-coming singer who comes to the aide of his aging and fading star, and will continue to do so long after she achieves the status he once had. Their love is so selfless and so full of goodness in its potential it's truly painful to see the inevitable downfall that comes.Hollywood isn't kind to its inhabitants, and Cukor doesn't hold back any punches in his portrayal. Using his widescreen cameras, every detail and every damning characteristic of the town is put in deep focus--the casualness of how Esther's name is changed to the more marquee-friendly Vicki Lester; the lies the publicity managers feed to the newspapers to pretend everything's smooth sailing; the hoards of crowds at times of mourning just to get a glimpse of the star attraction. This film is perhaps even more unsettling if you even know an iota of Judy Garland's life; one almost wonders if Norman Maine was written with Garland's life story for inspiration.Even though it's really Garland's show, James Mason more than equals her vibrant intensity and naked vulnerability. Norman Maine may be sinking lower into self-pity, but he never loses his charm, his wit, his undying love and pride in his wife Esther. Mason's portrayal of a man who knows all too well that he's falling apart is at times painful to watch because of its truthfulness, which are both matched and contrasted with his romantic scenes with Garland--their love is so powerful because both Esther and Norman are so willing to make sacrifices for each other, and because Garland and Mason bring out the best parts in each other and their slightly self-deprecating but tender humor is so perfectly matched. Even the way Garland touches Mason's face with her hand says more words of honesty and love than any of the film's dialogue.In the film Esther/Vicki wins an Oscar for Best Actress. It's a prediction that should've come true and Grace Kelly's Oscar win for THE COUNTRY GIRL over Garland remains controversial to this day. Both were playing essentially the same roles, as the long-suffering wives to a struggling, alcoholic entertainer. I never considered Grace Kelly a great actress by any means (she only came alive under Hitchcock's direction), but you have to give her credit for being ahead of her time--she won an Oscar for dolling down, wearing little make-up, sporting glasses and a frumpy wardrobe in 1955--all of which is the perfect recipe for winning an Oscar today. However, her role (and the film) is repetitively downbeat with no hints of life, and she only seemed to walk in Georgie's shoes. Judy Garland may have been falling apart off-screen but she was a stronger actress than Kelly any day because her poignant fragility and energetic smile were combined with such an amazing grace. It helped that she had an amazing voice, but she could've--and would've--made it on talent alone. She will be immortalized with "Over the Rainbow" from 1939's THE WIZARD OF OZ, and she showcases many memorable performances in A STAR IS BORN, from the famous 15-minute mini-epic (if slightly overrated) "Born in a Trunk" to the quietly piercing "It's A New World" to the whimsical "Someone at Last," but I think her finest is earlier in the film, with Norman hiding, listening from the shadows to the towering "The Man that Got Away," shot in a single long take of Judy and her soaring voice that quivers with fragility to the happy possibility of hope. One has a feeling that that was the essence of Judy Garland: smiling through the tears, putting on a smile even when her heart was breaking.Oscars were never meant to be taken seriously, and since the greatest performances of each year are so often overlooked, it's almost a requirement for film buffs to take each award with a grain of salt. And yet, one wonders if Judy had won the golden guy, maybe she would've emerged triumphant from the film's disappointing box-office receipts and would've found both good work and the strength to continue making forceful performances. On the night of the awards ceremony, people were sure she was going to win that they build this tower outside Garland's hospital room window (she had just given birth to her son) so that she could still give a speech when her name was read. When to everyone's shock Grace Kelly's name was said, the cameramen cleared out before Kelly even reached the stage, without so much as a goodbye. Judy would later shrug it off with her usual self-deprecating humor saying that she left the hospital with something better (her newborn son), but it's clear that it was the end of the rainbow for one of the brightest stars who was in the sky for just a little too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star On The Decline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the review The Star That Fizziled with great interest. It's about time that someone has seen the imperfections in this movie and its problems. I know that there are a great many Judy Garland fans out there that probably do not remember her when she was at the peak of her movie career at M.G.M., but she never was at the top after she left M.G.M. and with A Star Is Born and others to follow, she just didn't have that magnetism on the screen that she had, let's say, with Meet Me In St. Lous, or Easter Parade.I have to agree with the other reviewer, this movie is just Judy Garland playing Judy Garland. I have to agree with the fact that some of these songs should have been deleted, or even not filmed, and I have to agree that if they would have had Judy do a rousing version of Swanee, instead of the overlong and boring Born In A Trunk, which could have brilliantly been used in one of her T.V. Variety Show, it would have a much better effect as to why Vickie Lester was born for Stardom in Hollywood! They should have completely deleted Somewhere There's A Someone For Me, and when she tries to bite into that sandwich that was bigger than her mouth, have the door bell ring, and have Mason answer the door, etc. etc. etc.. This would have had a more powerful effect on the scene.It's A New World was a perfect spot, and showed us the old Judy Garland as we all remembered her - a great singer! They should have deleted the Long Face number, and instead, have her talk to the head of the studio, Charles Bickford, as played, maybe with a little less hysterics, and then have them call for her on the set, and then film a musical number with her sing "Melancoly Baby" singing by a piano like in the Born in a Trunk number. As she's singing, she could show the pain she's going through with shots back and forth to Bickford showing the pain he feels for her. Then at the end of the number, she turns to the piano in tears; Bickford quickly goes to her side, and they both,in Bickford's arms, cry and share the pain with each other. Now, if they had done that; there would have been no dry eye in the theater, and even I would not have been able to contain myself, and there would have been no amount of boxes of Kleenex to go with what I would be feeling for Vickie Lester. That would have made more sense! Now, everyone will probably hate me for this, but James Mason was all wrong for the Norman Maine role. Originally, Judy Garland wanted Cary Grant, and he would have been great. Just think of Grant going from the debonair Cary Grant to the depths of degradation to suicide. He would have been perfect and I'm willing to bet that he would have been awarded the Oscar for his performance!As for the length of the film. There were scenes in it that looks like they were drawn out because they felt that the longer the movie, the better the movie. Many of these sense could have been scaled down or deleted to make a more powerful punch to the story, for instance, the ride in the car after Norman picks up Vikie, Esther at that point in the movie, it was just a scene of babbling and could have been cut to get to the excellent scene when she asks him how he knows that she's a great singer and he simply says, "I heard you sing!" This whole scene is brilliant! They could have also deleted all that business on Norman going to sea on a movie and loosing touch with Esther. I wish, at the time, I had been able to get my hands on that script!The one actor in the film that has been overlooked is Tommy Noonan playing Judy Garlands pianist/friend. His performance near the end of the film with Judy Garland as she's in her self-pity state and not wanting to go to the benefit is a great scene for Tommy Noonan while doing a better acting job in that film than Judy Berharts acting.And one more thing before everyone decides to put my head on a chopping block: George Cukor was all wrong for the director. Who they "really" should have hired was Michael Curtiz. He was still alive and working for Warners. He would have seen all the problems and I believe,with Cary Grant playing opposite Judy Garland, would have got such powerful performances out of them that both would have received the Oscar!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Count me among those who love this film, but am I the only one who feels for Libby, played by Jack Carson? Yes, he's snide and spiteful, but for God's sake, who wouldn't be in his shoes? When he says, "Norman Maine's charm escapes me." I tend to agree with him. What makes this violent drunk so special anyway, except that he's played by James Mason? And, although she's played by Judy Garland at her radiant best, isn't Esther a classic co-dependent wife? Have any of you adoring fans ever actually dealt with a close one who's alcoholic? When the studio mogul says, after Norman Maine dies, "you didn't know him at all," I feel like arguing the point. Libby should say, "Maybe YOU didn't know him, Oliver. Did he ever insult you for making him do his job? Did he ever punch you out? Did you ever have to continually face his dirty side, as I did, which he--and you too, Oliver--refused to confront?" Maybe I'm a poop. But I had to say it.And, yes, it's a brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not the fantastic motion picture it was built up to be. I classify it above average to good. There is a disappointing lack of action and the photo scenes are phony. Still, I like the 1950's hamburger joints with the neon signs, plus the old 1950's cars. Judy Garland salvages this movie with her excellent songs and her grace, but the movie isn't all it was built up to be. Give it a 6 for above average, but if we were allowed to have .5's, I'd give it a 6.5---above average to good.I hate to be a critic of anything Judy Garland does ---I like her so much---but in all fairness, this movie just isn't the fantastic movie it was built up to be. It just isn't, it's as simple as that. I can't be expected to be anything but fair---it gets a 6.5 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of problems, but a moderate success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Star is Born begins at a big Hollywood event. Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland) is singing at the event with her band. Norman Maine (James Mason) is a film star who is supposed to appear before Blodgett's band, but like usual, he's drunk. They try to keep Maine from heading out on stage, but he ends up waltzing out while Blodgett is performing, anyway. She tries to make him appear as part of the act. Later he thanks her, and at the same time, becomes infatuated with her. When he looks for her and finds her later, singing in a dive, he becomes equally entranced with her artistic abilities. He convinces her that she can become a star. There are some complications, but eventually Blodgett is on her way. At the same time, Maine is on the downslope of his career, and seeing Blodgett so loved just makes it worse. How will these relationship complications resolve?A Star is Born has been quite a popular story, and not just with film fans. It was first made, by the same director, George Cukor, in 1932 as What Price Hollywood?, with Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman. The first remake appeared in 1937 as A Star is Born, with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. Later, it was remade again in 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. Maybe the Hilary Duff and Orlando Bloom version is right around the corner.Why is the story so popular? From the audience's perspective, it seems to give them an inside look at their dreams--a plain-Jane gets lucky when she's seen by someone with power in the industry, and ends up being given the keys to the kingdom. From a film-making perspective, there is probably more than a nugget of truth to the story. A large part of success in the arts &amp; entertainment industries rests on contacts--who you know and how you know them. It also provides an opportunity to give a bit of a self-reflexive look behind the curtain. In some respects, including this as well as other plot similarities, there are resemblances to the much superior Singin' In The Rain (1952).As a self-reflexive portrait, and in the music and the story overall, A Star is Born is a success. Viewers particularly enamored with Garland or Mason will love it even more. However, there are a number of problems, most sourced in the facts of making the film.A Star is Born was planned as a comeback for Garland, who had been absent from the screen for four years, partially due to breakdowns and substance abuse. Her husband at the time, Sidney Luft, was one of the film's producers; he planned a big showcase for Garland's talents. They hired Cukor, who had helmed many hugely successful films throughout the 1930s and 1940s, to direct. Cukor tended to work slowly and regularly came up with additional ideas for shots and small scenes. Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin were hired to write the songs; they turned at least seven. Moss Hart was to adapt the previous films to a musical format, and he did so by additions--he added songs and depth of characterization. All these factors contributed to a film that grew out of control in terms of shooting time and budget, and at the same time, kept growing in length. And it feels like it when you watch the restored version. A Star is Born could benefit from about an hour's worth of judicious cuts.This was one of the earlier films shot in Cinemascope. There is an odd lack of close-ups, probably caused by trying to come to terms with the new process. Cukor has said, "We couldn't move the camera up or down because of distortion, and we couldn't move back and away from the camera. Everything had to be played out on a level plane." Cukor didn't want to film A Star is Born in widescreen, but Jack Warner was adamant about it.Another odd but related aspect to the cinematography is the plethora of rear projection shots. These are very obvious and give the film an unintended kind of surrealism. Many have a "veiled" appearance, as if you're seeing the background through a screen door. Occasionally the projection is from the front and ends up on top of an actor (look at Mason coming out of the door of their house--the ocean is projected on him), and occasionally rough edits to create loops are visible (again, the ocean as reflected in the home's windows is a good example).Also not helping was the fact that the original, complete film is not intact. After Warner Brother's chopped off about a half-hour, that original footage seems to have been lost over the years. The present DVD version is the "partial restoration" done in 1983. At times, the film stops and a slide show with rougher sound tries to fill in the blanks. It's a bit difficult to follow in these sections. There still seems to be chunks of exposition missing. It probably would have been better to re-edit it with extant film only.Making it a bit more difficult for me to like A Star is Born is the fact that Garland doesn't do much for me. I don't find her particularly attractive and her performances--both acting and singing--come across as more affected than they should to me, primarily because it's very difficult for me to watch them without thinking of her daughter, Liza Minelli, aping her, and I'm not the biggest Liza fan. I do love Garland in The Wizard of Oz (1939), which is one of my favorite films, but here, she seems prescient of Liza's disturbingly schmaltzy campiness. On this respect, aspects of A Star is Born, including Mason's disposition, unpleasantly reminded me of Cabaret (1972).So, a 7 may seem slightly high from me, but that's a "C", and the film does deserve that for its positive aspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>listen to the soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the many fascinating things about IMDb is that there are so many contributors with so many different views. For example, I happen to think that BLACK NARCISSUS is a masterpiece, whereas (not too) many contributors here think the opposite. Now it's clear that (far too) many contributors think that A STAR IS BORN is something other than woeful drivel, whereas I think I'm being charitable describing it even in those terms.For me the only tolerable section is Garland's rendition of THE MAN WHO GOT AWAY. Pretty much everything else makes me yawn, including the often-feted BORN IN A TRUNK which, in spite of Garland's performing abilities, is clichéd and uninspired. The fault lies fairly and squarely at director Cukor's door. Garland was not primarily a dramatic actress: when she didn't hit a scene straight off, presumably Cukor couldn't coax it from her, and so we're left with lingering takes of over-acting, under-acting, and a few things in between. Poor James Mason is dreadfully miscast. Only Jack Carson and Charles Bickford emerge unscathed. As a singer Garland is not entirely to my taste but she was good at what she did, I acknowledge that, so I suggest that listening to the soundtrack is probably the best way to enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sepia spots a good touch. Judy great at singing. She was only age 32, and would only live 15 more years. Sad personal life. Wedding in movie nice; good to see clothes of that era, especially the hat Judy wore in the wedding. She carried it off well. James Mason's trademark voice always good to hear. He could really speak.I always love seeing Jack Carson. Mason and Judy driving off quickly after the wedding, with all the suitcases and leaving Jack Carson in the lurch was sort of funny. I still love Jack, and always will, though. I remember his dancing with Ann Sothern in "April Showers". I remember Jack's wonderful movies with Dennis Morgan.I always like to look back at these vintage movies and marvel at the furnishings, drapes and other interiors. These people were the ages of my parents, and it always educates me even more about the time period of their younger adulthood. At that time, I was in early elementary school, and certainly not yet knowledgeable about the world at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Deserved the Oscar...BUT...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to fly in the face of 99.9 percent of those who consider "A Star Is Born" a masterpiece as well as Miss Garland's greatest performance. There are many fine moments within this film, and though Cukor was already on a slide, he uses Cinemascope beautifully--a rare accomplishment for a non-epic. But no matter what purists insist, the film WAS over-long, Miss Garland WAS too old, too harsh-looking, too inherently savvy to be convincing as a struggling young band-singer. To counter this basic miscasting, Cukor encourages her to bathos rather than pathos. She's a raw nerve from the get-go, and that doesn't work for her character, at least not at first. And are we to believe a girl who belts out "The Man That Got Away" as she does, is not getting anywhere on radio?! The more I see of "ASIB" the more self-indulgent it seems. Everybody plays to the balcony--in China! Although often this over-acting has great power, no matter how obvious the effort. ("Be tragic, no--more tragic!" you can almost hear Cukor saying to his stars, especially to quick-to-go-misty-eyed Judy.) Yes, yes, Judy should have won her Oscar, not only for the best of her acting and singing, scattered through "ASIB" but for the body of work, which was already legendary. I mean, Grace Kelly? What a joke. But Judy was not popular within the industry and her little ways had helped put the film over-budget.For my money, if you want to see the proper use of Judy's latter-day talents and persona, watch "I Could Go on Singing." Melodramatic and obvious--a soap opera--but playing an ersatz version of herself, she is riveting and appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's Judy- sure as you're born.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as so many people come onto these boards bragging about how much they hate musicals (or Judy, or entertainment biopics, or anything even remotely happy), I hate having to come onto these boards and explain, once more, why the haters should really just shut it. Harsh? No harsher than publicly broadcasting a dissenting opinion that won't change anyone else's movie-going habits, so what's the point? Anyway...Those who LIKE this one have already given it enough superlatives to last into the next century, so I'll just mention some significant tidbits: The restored film (and letter-boxed DVD) gives more detail not only to the intricate relationship between Judy Garland (Esther) and James Mason (Norman), but also to the ugly side of the lead character's hustle into the acting business. After Norman 'discovers' Esther and makes plans to screen-test her at his studio, he's unceremoniously rushed into a location film shoot while hung-over, and he and Esther lose contact with each other for an undisclosed period of time. Then we see Esther truly work for her supper: after quitting the band she'd been singing with, she must economize by moving to a cheap boarding house, ghost sing on television commercials, and moonlight as a drive-in waitress. (Ironic, considering an earlier scene where she tells James Mason that she hated waitressing, and was glad she didn't have to do that anymore.) This is, *obviously,* not a new story. The dissenters who love to hate are particularly fond of whiningly resurrecting this rather pallid fact over and over again-- IT'S NOT A NEW STORY!! Well, if it wasn't a musical, it would STILL not be a new story. What's the difference? It tells the story extremely well, thank you. It gives you not one, but TWO perfectly likable leading characters. James Mason's elegant and charming alcoholic is actually a bigger acting challenge to pull off (and the role was apparently met with a lot of apprehension, as several leading men turned down the chance to play it). But act he does, whether he's on the prowl at the Coconut Grove looking for a fresh conquest, or nobly telling the woman he's already fallen in love with that she should forget him because he'll destroy her, or collapsing in humiliated, pitiful tears when he overhears a very painful conversation uttered by the one he loves the most. And Judy? Well, it's not as if she didn't have prior knowledge of the star-making demons of self-absorption, insecurity, or substance abuse. In fact, while she drank occasionally, she probably abused pills more than anything else, while longing to be as patient and as unaffected as her alter ego Esther Blodgett. But her chemistry with Mason fairly crackles, and their scenes of romantic bliss are unmatched: a love song tenderly rendered on their wedding night, an impromptu and campy performance in a living room with no audience or attendants, a proposal done on a sound stage- with sound technicians as unintentional witnesses. Ms. Garland did ASIB in her thirties, and had already been both a wife and mother for the third time, and fired from a film studio for the first time. This was regarded, whether she admitted it or not, as her comeback. But it worked. She is charming, nervous, awkward, sometimes unattractive, sometimes over-the-top (as in a scene near the end where she has to be bullied out of a particularly long period of emotional solitude), but always a champion. And in perhaps her finest moment in this or any other film, when we hear her flawless performance of torch-song extraordinary "The Man That Got Away," it is in a nightclub, after-hours, just for herself and the jazz band which plays with her- but we are as lucky to have stumbled into the club that night as James Mason himself. What a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed masterpiece with tour de force Garland performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the DVD, which has been beautifully restored. It's a fine film, though uneven, perfectly showcasing Judy's genius.Tony Bennett called Garland "the greatest singer of the 20th century". No one can wring such a rainbow of emotions out of a song, or make a lyric mean so much. Who else can sing with such power and then with such delicacy?But the film is far from perfect. There's a sloppiness to some of it -- terrible process shots and non-matching edits -- that are probably the result of its troubled production. But the biggest problem is the PACING.Moss Hart's script is simply too long, too wordy, and spends too much time belaboring the obvious. Cukor's predilection for slow pacing compounds the problem.My hat's off to Haver for his heroic work restoring the film to its original length, but the restoration suggests THE STUDIO WAS RIGHT to cut it. The biggest cut section, detailing Mason's attempts to find Garland after their first meeting, is almost pure filler. Dull, unnecessary, uninspired scenes that are better left out. And nothing's gained by restoring the "Lose That Long Face" number, which stops the show right when the plot needs to move.I wish the cut version were available on DVD as well. If memory serves, it played better than the complete and rather bloated restoration.James Mason's doomed alcoholic is a superb performance, believable and even a little frightening in its honesty. He has plenty of chemistry with Garland, who easily proves herself the greatest triple threat (acting, singing, dancing) ever to appear in movies. Garland, though once or twice over-the-top, is unique and incomparable. Who else has given us a tour de force like the "Born In A Trunk" number? Who else would be capable of it?If you doubt Garland's genius, see the three alternate takes of the "Man That Got Away" number included on the DVD. The takes have plenty wrong with them, in the staging and lighting, but in each one Judy is absolutely, thrillingly perfect. Her talent is awesome. There'll never be another...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by James Mason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken as a whole, this film is definitely not the classic that it is reputed to be. On the plus side, James Mason gives what may be the finest performance of his career, and that makes this film watchable. He effortlessly succeeds as a movie star playing a movie star, which is considerably more difficult than one might expect. If you don't believe me, watch Jack Palance play a movie star in The Big Knife. The story of A Star Is Born is excellent, although clumsily executed. The Technicolor cinematography is good, and Jean Louis does his usual excellent job of costume design. Judy Garland gives a fine performance and shows herself to be a strong singer, which leads us to the minus side. Judy does her best with the songs but the music score is flat, to put it mildly. There is no Rogers and Hammerstein or Andrew Lloyd Webber quality material here. The Roger Edens and Conrad Sallinger score for Meet Me in St. Louis completely blows the score for A Star Is Born away. If you enjoy hearing Judy sing, watch Meet Me in St. Louis or The Harvey Girls as those films showcases what she can do with good material. The other major defect of this film is poor artistic design. Being a big Hitchcock fan myself, I appreciate good sets and this film does not have them. The weak music score and poor sets for a musical are most likely the result of this film having been made at Warner Bros. instead of MGM. Warner simply did not have the right mix of talent necessary to do musicals; another excellent example of a Warner musical flop is Night and Day, where even Cole Porter songs can't save it. Warner could not pull off making a musical any more than MGM could ever pull off making a film noir. A Star is Born is still watchable. James Mason saw to that, but Judy Garland's performance is wasted by having forced her to sing poor music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality and fiction lines blur in this great Garland/Mason film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comments above give you the basic plot summary. (I enjoyed reading comments above---you will too.) I too can't help seeing Judy Garland as the "real' Norman Maine! If you know her rather tragic life, and her death, she did not totally give up as did Maine, but kept coming back regularly to sing &amp; act---mostly with great power. However, overuse of prescription substances no doubt shortened her life...Maybe the movie hits me because Garland is ravaged already...great lighting and costuming can't hide the fact that this woman trying for stardom is not a young ingénue' but a woman who looks maybe 15 years older than her actual age of early 30's.Yet when Norman Maine (the great actor James Mason) tricks the studio head played by another great--Charles Bickford --into listening to Judy sing, .....all that matters to you is her "knock 'em dead" voice. Give her a contract!!! Maine is right to get Esther a chance!Garland really beats out the prettier but insubstantial 1930's Janet Gaynor's rendering of the same Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester role. Janet can mug at parties,(where she give shallow imitations of famous actresses) but Judy's singing shows her as one of the greatest 20th Century singers...My favorite scene is when Mason (who had just met Judy earlier) discovers her singing her heart out in a late nite after work jam session. WOW!And Mason, who should have won some kind of Oscar at some point in his long career...for this role or for perhaps his role in Julius Caesar, shows enough personal torment and disgust with his previous shallow young girlfriend (s) (and is himself old enough) for us to believe in his love for Judy's character. The studio wisely did not over soften James Mason's face. He, tho quite handsome, looks his then-mid 40's age. Yes, the Oscars blew it on this film. But you should acquire it!!!</fullReview>

And not just the music, the musical scenes were well directed and played. Judy Garland did a good job.The version I saw, was the restored version, which was almost 3 hours long and the missing scenes were placed by pictures and dialog. I think it worked quite well, except when the "picture scenes" started to last for like 10 minutes.

		<fullReview>First, I agree with Tony Bennett (and so many others) that Judy Garland was THE entertainer and singer of the 20th Century. "No one could touch her," he said. But he was talking about her stage concerts. Having seen her live, I think Bennett is probably right. Electrifying (at least on her good nights).Second, I own this film but seldom watch it. Why? It's simple, really. I find it tedious, talky and full of clichés. Judy's song performances (mostly) are wonderful. Yes, "The Man That Got Away" is cinematic history. "Melancholy Baby" is the best arrangement of that song I've ever heard, but it's truncated to fit in with all the other snippets of the infamous "Born in a Trunk" sequence, as is the rousing "Swanee." "It's a New Day" is just mediocre treacle, musically and lyrically, and was never heard again. "Somewhere, There's a Someone" is interminable showing-off that, one supposes, is supposed to showcase Garland's comedic versatility but instead reeks of "look-at-me-aren't-I-brilliant?" egotism. Plus it displays Garland at her least attractive. The song and her "improvisations" with banana leaves, throw pillows and the bearskin rug are silly, rather than impressive. It feels uncomfortably forced and contributes nothing, either musically or emotionally, to the story. It's, for me, an utter waste of her talent and the film's time.Garland could be a terrific actor. Yet in scene after overlong scene, she's given hackneyed lines.Others have mentioned, for instance, the scene in the car when James Mason drives her home to her apartment, where she recounts her struggles to get where she is. Sure, Judy acts up a storm.Or when she tells Tommy Noonan she's leaving the band because she has a screen test. "Then why do I feel this way?" she bleats breathlessly about her newfound feelings for alcoholic Norman Maine, in yet another clichéd scene.Or her almost unwatchable overacting with Oliver Niles (Charles Bickford) in her dressing room when she confesses her helplessness to deal with her husband's alcoholism. Director George Cukor was reportedly so impressed with her playing in this scene that he had her do it several times, and each time she supposedly brought something new and different to it. When he complimented her, she pointedly replied, "Oh, you should come by my house any afternoon. I do that every day. But I only do it ONCE at home." (See Gerald Clarke's remarkable biography of her, "Get Happy.") All the actors are excellent, really, including Judy when she wasn't allowed to be overindulgent. But the script keeps lapsing into bathetic pathos, particularly after Norman Maine is let go by the studio.James Mason is remarkable. He's so convincing as a self-loathing, mean-spirited egotistical drunk in his initial scenes that it's impossible to see what ANYBODY sees in him, much less the supposedly innocent and trusting Esther Blodgett.That plot point makes her look like an idiot, as a character. Even in those days, NOBODY would abandon a perfectly decent and relatively secure career as an up-and-coming band singer for a "screen test" promised by what everybody else recognizes as an abusive alcoholic has-been actor. "What was she THINKING?" you keep asking, as everything works out exactly as you knew it would.By the time poor Norman wades into the Pacific to drown himself while Esther / Vicki sings (a capella) the excruciating "It's a New Day" out the kitchen window in Malibu, you almost wish you could join him, having given three hours of your life to a string of cheap sentimentality and painfully obvious (and tiresome) emotional manipulation.But wait! There's more! Tommy Noonan gets his last (terrifically acted but soap-opera dialogued) scene where he berates Judy to convince her to fulfill her obligation to appear onstage at some awards ceremony that night.She ultimately does, of course. And gets to deliver the film's famous supposedly heart-tugging final line, "This is Mrs. Norman Maine." Good thing this was a musical. (The only non-musical Garland ever made was "The Clock.") Because, without the songs, "A Star is Born" is just an overproduced, overacted (by Judy) B-movie soap opera that would have long ago faded into oblivion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I popped in the video again. And I watched it all the way through again. And once again I heard myself asking: What were they thinking? I adore Judy Garland. I have always been a fan of James Mason. The original film is a timeless, example of the classic Hollywood story, penned (mostly) by Dorothy Parker. The bottom line here is you cannot sell us Judy as Esther. By the mid-fifties, sadly, Judy's youth was gone -- corrupted by drugs. Esther's transformation is one from a child to a woman -- we do not see or feel this character development. We can't. It is impossible. Going one step more, Judy is playing Judy -- Esther is lost in a sea of quirky mannerisms, a caffeinated and over the top performance further mared by a 'doomed' sense of 'meller-drama' (sic) like a soap opera on speed. If you can't sell me Judy Garland as Esther then I cannot buy James Mason as the tortured soul. Am I the ONLY ONE who sees no chemistry between the two leads?? Well, there you have it. I understand few will agree with me, Sooooo why not seek out the original film and then compare. As a footnote, Babs' attempt at "A Star is Born" is not worth the time. Of the three, it is the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star Vehicle is Born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes when a film goes through the restoration process the result is like replacing a missing piece of a puzzle. The result is a more complete vision of what the work was intended to be.Other times it is like putting a removed appendix back into a patient; it may not harm the patient, but it really doesn't do much good either. It is especially bothersome if the restored portion is incomplete or strangely deformed. Nothing good can come of that, other than maybe a scholarly understanding of the film-making process. A STAR IS BORN, the 1954 Judy Garland version, famously underwent such a reconstruction back in 1983 and it was praised for restoring a masterpiece. It is debatable whether A STAR IS BORN was ever really a masterpiece, but it is clear that the restoration made the film bigger, though not necessarily better. At two and half hours the meager story would seem sadly stretched and restoring another supposedly lost half hour makes the film lose its focus even further. And a portion of the restored version featuring black-and-white production stills, replacing lost or incomplete film footage, make the film stop dead in its tracks.A STAR IS BORN is the oft-told tale of two stars whose paths cross briefly while speeding in opposing trajectories. Garland's Esther Blodgett (a.k.a. Vicki Lester) is on the rise as a young singer, while her mentor and lover, movie star Norman Maine (James Mason), is in a downward spiral. He pauses briefly in mid-air to give her a career boost and a crack at being a movie star. It is pure soap opera, though any student of Tinseltown knows it is rooted in more than one Hollywood legend. This is the third of four versions of the tale, with the key plot twist being that it is a musical, designed to showcase Garland's distinctive talents as a bona fide song and dance legend -- which is both the film's saving grace and its ultimate undoing.Using flimsy boy-meets-girl stories as an excuse for all-singing, all-dancing musicals is part of Hollywood tradition; the stories never being as important as the musical moments they frame. When the framing story is merely a light-hearted romp, in the Astarie-Rogers mode, it doesn't seem to matter that much. Indeed, the plot is sometimes just a bother. But when the melodrama begins to get heavy and the film strives for pathos, the reality of the drama and the artificiality of the music can compete more than contrast. Either the musical numbers seem extraneous or the drama seems trite -- and with A STAR IS BORN, it is more than a little of both.Like the lamentable Streisand version that would follow, this was clearly intended as a vanity production, produced by Garland and her husband Sid Luft to rejuvenate Judy's sagging career and her damaged reputation. Therefore, it is not surprising that as a musical it is designed to play to her formidable talent (and it's not surprising either that the Norman Maine character is just an actor and not a singer as well -- thus there is no one to upstage Judy in the musical numbers). The various numbers are generally well staged and Garland belts them out with gusto, though the songs themselves are strangely banal; only "The Man Who Got Away" really endures, possibly because it does reflect the film's theme of love and loss. Otherwise, the other songs seem intrusive and beside the point. The "Born in a Trunk" number, for instance, may tell us a lot about Judy Garland, but not much at all about Esther Blodgett. Overall, the musical and melodrama never quite meld together -- often it is like switching back and forth between two unrelated films.The film is mostly revered for the Garland showstoppers, but it comes at the expense of the love story. Which is a shame because the main story is handled fairly well. Garland, always hyper and a bit theatrical, gives a performance that nicely contrasts Mason's quiet intensity and skilled underplaying. As much as Garland is overly praised for this film, Mason is equally underrated, lending a haunted quality to his character with his sad, grave eyes and solemn voice. On the other hand, Garland seems needy, almost desperate to be loved in her role, which may have been what put off Academy Award voters who denied her the much anticipated Oscar that year (she lost to Grace Kelly's bitter and melancholy performance in THE COUNTRY GIRL). It was Mason's star that was born as it bumped him up to leading man status; he proved he could more than hold his own against Garland, even as the film brushes him into the wings during the long stretches when Judy holds the spotlight hostage.And ironically, though the film was meant to revitalize Garland's film career, it slowed, but didn't stop, her downward slide. Not only is Garland a bit old to once again be playing the spunky wide-eyed ingenue, in reality she was more like the self-destructive Norman Maine character, a troubled and troublesome star struggling with too many demons, real and imagined. A STAR IS BORN was meant to be her Esther Blodgett, the second chance at redemption. Instead, though many triumphs and tragedies would follow, including a Oscar-nominated performance in the drama JUDGMENT AT NUREMBURG, Garland took the film's relative failure as a personal affront and more or less shunned Hollywood thereafter. The film would eventually enhance her post-mortem status as a legend, but as an attempt to recapture her place as a film star, it was more a last hurrah than a rebirth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star Is Born and goes on ... and on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right at the conclusion of this protracted production, Charles Bickford's studio executive turns to the cynical Jack Carson character, and says "You never really understood him, did you?" And I didn't warm to him very much either. Norman Maine, for the most part, struck me as being one of those people you go in fear and dread of being cornered by at a party. A powerful performance by Mason nevertheless, and one he was justifiably proud of. No doubt to my great loss, I've never really figured the magnetic appeal of Judy Garland, the real-life Norman Maine, and her hammy performance did little to convert me. It doesn't help that her most memorable numbers are towards the start. I saw the 'restored' version but didn't feel that these inserts did any real favours to a movie which could have benefited from some judicious pruning. Though worth seeing, it's one I would categorise as an acclaimed film that didn't live up to expectations.</fullReview>

Being the star of "Wizard of Oz". Having a singing and acting career marred by drug problems. And being the mother of Liza Minnelli. This film sort of takes place in that second of three things. While not about the addictions she herself had, it definitely gives her a chance to shine.James Mason has an incredible voice. Eddie Izzard knows that, and so does anyone who sees this movie. It may be a showcase for Garland, but he steals plenty of scenes with that voice alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "restored" 1983 version is, well, I'll leave as a question mark.But not for myself - it doesn't work, adding little and destroying the pacing of the movie. By the time Mason headed for the Pacific I had my scissors out and did the same thing to 'Star' that Jefferson did to the Gospels. My version came in at well under two hours as I deleted all of the redundant scenes - like the three distinct reaction scenes to Mason's suicide. I cut from Mason striding into the ocean to Garland sitting, near hysterics while trying to come to terms with it.I'd always thought that even the 154 min. version was overlong so I made one to my taste, emphasizing the Mason/Garland relationship and, especially, Garland's knock-out performance.That's where the question mark comes in - my concept of the movie was based on many viewings of the 1954 version which I already considered over-long so, when I finally saw the 'restored' version on TCM a couple of days ago, most of the additional material seemed little more than pointless filler.At the same time I remember being excited about that 'restoration' when I first heard about it way back when. Never expected it to take 30 years to finally see it and have no idea how I would had reacted back in 1983.Bottom line, it's up to less prejudiced viewers to judge which, if either, is superior to the other. Or if they're co-equal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Cukor's remake of William A. Wellman's masterpiece comes across as a reflection of Judy Garland's career. She plays the rising star whose husband (James Mason) sees his career fall apart. The purpose of both movies is to indict the entertainment industry's policy of chewing people up and spitting them out. This version of "A Star Is Born" got turned into a musical to showcase Garland's singing skills, but it maintains the original's spirit.I wouldn't go so far as to call this version a masterpiece. The singing gives it a flashy feeling that interferes with the main story, and some of the scenes would not get considered politically correct in the 21st century. Even so, the movie remains a fine achievement, compounded by the damaged life that Garland led. The later version starring Barbra Streisand* and Kris Kristofferson was OK but seemed like more of a spectacle than the previous versions. I recommend this one.*When "60 Minutes" interviewed Streisand, it showed footage of her as a guest on Garland's show in the early '60s, and the two of them sang a duet.</fullReview>

After Seeing this No One did, and it Reaffirmed that Her Talent had not Dissipated, but was on Demand Anytime She Wished it.It is a "Pull out all the stops." Movie with Technicolor, CinemaScope, Top Talent, and a Length that would have Judy's Fans Saying give us more, but Others saying that a Good Trimming is in Order.What is Available Today is Mostly its Full Length and the Movie is Full to the Brim with Garland Singing at Every Turn and some of Her New Found Belting Style is Either Ecstasy or Cacophonic, depending on Taste. There are some Charming Musical Numbers, but the Often Praised "Born in a Trunk" is Clunk and at 15 Minutes it does Test the Tolerance of Anyone not Hypnotized by Judy's Personal Charm.You can Feel the Strain Many Times in this Overlong Attempt to Give Them Everything (those wishing for a Garland comeback and her masses of admirers) and the Movie cannot be Faulted for its Effort. But the Film does not Fully Succeed. James Mason is Fine and Judy's Dramatic Acting is Soulful, but Overall it Seems Disjoined, Uneven, with what may be a Sub-Conscience Apologetic Embrace that Might just be Hugging the Fragile and Charming, Multi-Talented and Ever Popular Judy Garland as a Performer more than this Inconsistent Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>incomplete restoration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an attempt to restore this classic musical romance to its full almost 3 hour length. Unfortunately the 'restored' bits are often still photos taken from the production photo library, with the restored dialogue track playing behind them. Better than nothing, it at least gives the viewer a glimpse of what the total package once contained; a more complete restoration would certainly have been preferable. That said, this is Judy Garland's last great screen musical performance - before pills and stage fright made her too unreliable to center a film around - and it is a wonderful showcase for one of the Hollywood Musical genre's greatest talents. As an actress she had few peers and as a singer none, and this film and especially its staged production numbers create a permanent record of this. Recommended for any fan of the musical genre and essential for any fan of Judy's. Oh and James Mason was in it too...</fullReview>

The second of three filmed versions of the story is the best, thanks to Garland, who has the definitive role of her career as a small-time singer who is discovered by movie star Mason. The latter gives a finely tuned performance in the difficult role of the husband who loves his wife but is also somewhat jealous of her success. Bickford and Carson also provide good performances. The only complaint is that it is a bit too long and uneven. Musical highlights include "The Man That Got Away," "Someone at Last," and the extended "Born in a Trunk" sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talent Verses Ego</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, A Star Is Born is about the way the concept of 'star' (as in this case illustrated via the Hollywood variety) builds up the ego to the point of destroying the inner talent. This is portrayed sublimely by James Mason as Norman Maine. In this sense it is an interpretation, extrapolated from the 19th Century German philosopher Nietzche's theory of the rise of the superman. If Nietzche's theory of the rise of the superman is interpreted as ego, then it is illustrated as having a destructive force as in film stars (Judy Garland), politicians, (Napoleon Bonaparte), musicians and pop artists (Michael Jackson) and sports men and women (George Best). In other words the ego is a fragile phenomenon that overcomes the person and makes it its victim. Moreover, the ego of the celebrity is often built up by media hype and is difficult to cope with as in the case example of Judy Garland. This makes her role in A Star Is Born more relevant as her pain seems real as she see's it in a mirror reflection by way of the character Norman Maine.The opening scene of A Star Is Born is on the one hand an insight into the pretentiousness of Hollywood, with obsequious flattery. Then, on a deeper level it is Hollywood ridiculing the audience for the way it accepts and buttresses that pretentiousness, and the shallow phenomenon of 'celebrity'.A Star Is Born is superbly directed and is a credit to legendary film director George Cuckor. The casting is also appropriate, with specific irony in that of Judy Garland whose real-life pain in a way was exploited by husband Sidney Luft in this film as the film's producer. Such exploitation by Luft (encouraging her tour when she was ill), could have contributed to Garland's demise.Though at times Garland's acting seems a tad forced, her pain still comes through. However, the pain of Garland's character Esther is expressed better via her singing, which is sublime to say the least. Garland's singing and the film are buttressed greatly by the fantastic score by Ray Heinorf and the orchestra.The film, A Star Is Born, is relatively lengthy, but truly worth the time invested to view it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a lot of history and baggage, to be sure. Judy Garland had been dropped from "The Barkleys of Broadway" (which resulted in the happy reunion of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire in their only Technicolor movie) and "Annie Get Your Gun" and she and her fans were hopeful that "A Star Is Born" would be her big comeback vehicle. I recently viewed the movie on Blu-ray, not having seen it before, and I have to say that I was not overwhelmed by any of it. In fact, I found a good bit of it annoying. It was too long and should have been cut, though that should have been done by George Cukor, not the studio. I know that the Judy-Garland-can-do-no-wrong crowd won't like this, but she was, in my opinion, a bit too old and a bit too plump for the part and in all of her musical numbers, she is just trying so hard to knock it out of the park, the result is performances that are too over-the-top and frantic. Everything about this film seems bloated, dated, and just boring. The insertion of stills to fill in for missing footage is distracting, too. It would have been better to have done as they did with the recent "South Pacific" release and offered two versions--the complete, "restored" roadshow version, with the stills and extra footage, and the shortened version. In sum: this is a curiosity item and not without interest, but not the masterpiece that many would claim. If you are looking for a showcase of Judy's mature singing talent, this may be your cup of tea. Otherwise, forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judy Garland remained, through her life, plagued with insecurity about her appearance - she was on the plumpish side, not classically beautiful by a long straw, not statuesque or willowy or any of the other things which leading ladies of that era were meant to be.So what - who cares. Her Vicki Lester, in 'A Star Is Born', remains one of the most unforgettable creations seen on the silver screen, who remains with you for ever and ever. Judy Garland's interpretation of the character was a tour de force if ever there was one, imbuing and imbibing the persona with shades and contours which even the creator of the character would possibly never have visualized, making a legend out of an otherwise ordinary heroine with all human frailties.Which is not, of course, to say that James Mason, as the mercurial Norman Maine, fell short - it's just that the character of Vicki Lester was so powerful that it HAD to dominate the film. It is a story often told, no doubt, but as told through the persona of Judy Garland essaying Vicki Lester, it is something else altogether - and yet, with supreme grace, Vicki does not let Norman fade away ... she remains, to the unforgettable end, MRS Norman Maine.Who cares, then, for the physical attributes of Judy Garland?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a lot about A Star Is Born, saying it was Judy Garland's best performance and all that. As I like Judy Garland a lot and love her films, I naturally thought this is worth checking out. A Star is Born is not a perfect film, but it is definitely one I recommend. The film is rather overlong and some of the restored scenes kind of alienated me. Sure they are great for historical value, but for a first-time viewer like me they didn't help carry the movie along. That said, it is beautifully filmed, the cinematography is simply stunning, and George Cukor's direction is superb. The songs and music are nothing less than terrific and the choreography is spirited. Judy Garland does I agree give her best performance ever, Groucho Marx famously said of her losing the Oscar to Grace Kelly "it's the biggest robbery since Brink's" and I happen to agree with him there, Kelly was good but for me Garland was better by a country mile. And there is also James Mason, who is equally brilliant, and their chemistry together is wonderful. Overall, a very good film, not perfect but worth seeing for Garland alone. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Cukor's Direction, James Mason's Genius, and Judy Garland Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One aspect of the very long dramatic musical remake of "A Star is Born" has been copied numerous times. That is the film's only obvious shortcoming: it has only five important characters and no real explanation for the categorical character flaws that mar all of them. In addition, the film, by my lights, has two outstanding strengths, also copied often since: these being a brilliant directing job by veteran George Cukor, and the greatness of James Mason as alcoholic star Norman Maine. Opposite Mason, Judy Garland plays a young woman fifteen years younger than her real age and does some things very well, but hardly at an award level. The story, adapted from a 1937 film starring Janet Gaynor and Frederic March was the work of Dorothy Parker, Alan Campbell, and Robert Carson from a story idea by William Wellman. Moss Hart is the credited author of this thoughtful and often innovative much larger and Technicolor remake. The story line can be told in three sentences. A young singer happy just to be working with a band is spotted by a hard-drinking and enigmatic movie star. He hears her sing, helps engineer her success at a screen test, after which she becomes a great star and they having fallen in love, he decides to try to reform. They marry but he cannot beat the alcohol, despite trying hard, and the film draws to an inevitable conclusion. There is a bright score with "The Man That Got Away" as its one stellar tune. There are other huge numbers shooting Hollywood studio details from high above and every other angle, and innovative stop-motion stills behind whose facade the story proceeds in dialog. Ray Heindorf deserved credit for much of the musical success, as did Richard Barstow and others for the choreography, George James Hopkins for the set decorations, Jean Louis, Mary Ann Nyberg and Irene Sharaff for the hundreds of costumes, Sam Leavitt for exquisite cinematography, and Malcolm A. Bert and Irene Sharaff for the art direction and the long "Born in a Trunk" number respectively. The production was designed by Gene Allen, with credit for the film's production going to Sid Luft assisted by Vern Alves. The others given genuine roles in the long narrative are Charles Bickford as the head of the studio employing both Mason and Garland, Jack Carson as his long-suffering and irascible head of publicity and Tommy Noonan as Garland's best friend. The very numerous cast includes many fine actors--Amanda Blake, Lucy Marlow, Frank Puglia, Frank Ferguson, Willis Bouchey, Richard Webb, Kathryn Card, Chick Chandler, Percy Helton, Tristram Coffin, jean Engstrom, Arthur Space, Strother Martin, Mae Marsh, Frank Willcox and others. The film won several Academy Awards, including for its two stars; but it remains a curious exercise in virtuoso film-making that always holds the viewer's interest and never quite answers the basic question that also torment's Norman Maine's wife--why is he self-destructive. Had that question been answered by the scenarist, "A Star is Born" might have been a great film instead of a gorgeous, well-made and influential monument to the talents of Cukor and Mason, which is what I claim it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lavish But Sometimes Uneven Treatment of the Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of a lavish treatment of the familiar story of "A Star is Born", with several Judy Garland musical numbers in addition to the plot itself, seems worth trying, and to a large degree it succeeds. The story has some worthwhile themes, but is not especially intricate, so it could benefit from some variety material being included. Yet the production here, while large-scale, is surprisingly uneven, and too often the movie lags. It certainly has enough to be worth seeing, but not really enough to fill the entire lengthy running time.One interesting thing about the story is how different the three familiar versions are, both in conception and in execution. The 1937 version is the most straightforward, but in some ways it is the best. Janet Gaynor does not have Garland's wide range of talents, but she is better in the actual role, thoroughly sympathetic and believable. The story itself is the highlight in the earlier version, and it is told well. Both the 1937 film and this 1954 movie are far superior to the dreary, ill-conceived 1976 version, which does not even deserve to share the same title as the two classics.This 1954 version has the star power of Garland and Mason, plus the musical numbers and the colorful settings. Garland is really as good as ever in her singing, but in the dramatic portions her presence is too often lacking, whether due to her personal struggles or for some other reason. Mason is a good choice for the role of Norman Maine, but for the role to work most effectively, it needs a leading lady who can make Esther work a little more closely with Norman and show more obvious empathy for him.There are a rather unexpected number of lesser weaknesses, with the pace sometimes clunky, and some scenes just not coming off (both of which may be partially the result of tinkering with the running time and the content). Still and all, it's a movie worth seeing, at least for anyone who enjoys the classic musicals. When it works, it has numerous good moments that make most of the rest of it worth sitting through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much off-screen reality compromises this conflicted Hollywood cautionary tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite early in George Cukor's A Star Is Born ? the ambitious and troubled Judy Garland comeback vehicle ? Garland, jamming with her band in an after-hours club called Bleu Blue, delivers an intense and flawless rendition of The Man That Got Away, filmed in a single long take. Artistically and dramatically, it's the movie's apogee ? and as yet little has happened. Afterwards, A Star Is Born drifts desultorily to its bittersweet conclusion, detouring now and again into overlong novelty numbers that are like a `Best of Judy' compilation. Garland had already outgrown these whimsical, cutesy routines, which do only rough justice to the emotionally daring, mature artist she was becoming.But the part she plays (Esther Blodgett, who turns into `Vicki Lester') asks her to impersonate an ingenue ? after close to two decades in movies. A plucky kid trying to break into show business, she's performing at a Shriners' benefit which drunken screen idol James Mason disrupts. He can't remember much, but remembers and pursues her, convinced that she's destined for stardom. They marry, but while her career takes off, he sinks into alcoholism, self-pity and self-destruction. It's a story of Hollywood at its most uncertainly introspective, too, yet so schmaltzy and melodramatic that it had been filmed at least twice before in the ?30s (Cukor directed one of them, What Price Hollywood?) and would be again, in the ?70s. Reviewing that last version, with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, Pauline Kael pointed out the `trap' built into the story, one that every version stumbles into: That we're asked to buy a popular and powerful actress as a simpering helpmate, ready to throw over everything she's achieved to play nurse to her has-been hubby. Here, that's even harder to swallow, since Garland and Mason ? often excellent in their individual roles ? together generate no chemistry whatsoever. They're just following the written-in-cement conventions of this cautionary tale.There are, however, nice observations all the way through: Of the yearly round of galas at which Industry royalty is expected to show up and dispense graciousness; of the pampered and casual leisure which the stars absently come to think of as their due; of petty feifdoms within the studios and long-simmering resentments between them. (Jack Carson, as a glad-handing, back-stabbing publicist, shows yet again why he was in such demand in post-war Hollywood. But Charles Bickford, another underrated character actor, fails to convince as the most idealized studio boss possible ? and the scene where, out of pity, he offers a script to the institutionalized Mason reprises almost verbatim one in Cukor's Dinner At Eight.) There's one genuinely sinister sequence, when Mason prowls a half-deserted Coconut Grove in the early-morning hours looking for a pickup, with the oily assistance of the pimping Maitre D'. It has an unpleasant ring of truth to it which little else in the alternately self-loathing and self-congratulatory movie can lay claim to. Even so, it might still have worked on its own artificial terms if weren't so plain that the whole enterprise had been engineered (her then-husband Sid Luft produced) to rehabilitate Garland's reputation. (And viewers knew the dirty little secret, the switch: It was Garland whose private demons were threatening her career, while Mason's star was in ascendancy.) Released at over three hours, A Star Is Born has entered folklore as a masterpiece `butchered' by Warner Brothers after theater operators complained that they were losing money. Yes, a lot of excellence was lavished on the movie by its stars and director. But maybe those bean-counters out on the front lines, in this instance anyway, knew how many beans made five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begins well but then falls into some of the usual clichés.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie started off so well and original. I was ready to praise this movie for having an original story in which the two main characters for a change did not fall in love with each other. For a long time the movie seemed to be one about an old, once popular, big Hollywood-star, finding a new protégé and talent, which he trains and gets ready for the show business, without falling into the temptations- and make the mistakes he made. He passes on the torch so to speak and uses his old connection to launch her to stardom. However then for some reason the two suddenly decide on getting married and the movie becomes far less original and refreshing from that point on.I'm actually quite fond of Hollywood movies being set in actual Hollywood. I like them because they often show us how far from perfect this world is and how it's much less glamorous as it seems from the outside. Till some extend this movie does still handles these themes well enough. It still all gives you the feeling that they could had gone a bit further with it all and make the movie more dramatic and powerful with those elements rather than all of the usual lovers-clichés.It's also quite a long watch obviously. About halve an hour got cut at the time of its original release by the studios but now days the full and reconstructed version can be watch again. However not all of the footage was still around so some of the gaps are being filled up with photographs that got shot during production and the sound-track of the movie. A nice way to show the movie as it original was intended by director George Cukor but still, nearly 3 hours is a long sit for a movie of this type.Still, the movie as a mixture of a musical and full-blood drama can be seen as a successful one. It combines the two different genres quite well and uses some of the best elements of both worlds. It's the reason why the movie still works out as a good one and one that has received plenty of praise throughout the years.I also liked James Mason in this movie but I'm not really sure if this is due to his accent or his acting skills. I wasn't too fond of Judy Garland, who never looked or acted like a big star in this movie, even though her character was really supposed to. In some of the dramatic sequences she was even overacting but despite this all, people still consider this to be her best role. Well, guess that just doesn't make me a big Judy Garland fan, though I've still liked him in some other big movie roles.The movie should also really deserve credit for how it looks. This movie just got made for the widescreen. It has some perfectly set up shots and also some nice bright color use, which is suitable for its genre. It was actually the first musical movie that George Cukor directed and he would go on directing some more later on during his career, including the classic "My Fair Lady", starring Audrey Hepburn.I really loved the movie its first halve but was disappointed with its more cliché ridden and predictable drama filled second halve.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an OK film. I prefer the 1937 version. Its a lot tighter, more heart wrenching. By 1954 Judy Garland starts to get on your nerves doing a Canbelto vocal performance. She's alright I suppose but she's no Frances Langford. The rest of the cast is hardworking, professional, but there is something about this film that just seems a little out of sync. Maybe its because of all the cuts, retakes, backstage bickering and tantrums. James Mason gives a terrific performance, being, what, the fourth actor that was considered for the part? He is especially effective in the beginning in the drunk scene. Very powerful. Amanda Blake, Charles Bickford, Jack Carson and Tommy Noonan round out the cast. The musical numbers are well conceived, the choreography pretty well thought out. But somehow when you put it all together, stir and serve. It seems a little flat. Perhaps a clash of too many star egos? Perhaps I've seen Janet Gaynor and Fredric March too often as they ignite the screen with their star power.

		<fullReview>Something I'm very proud of is that I've always been able to avoid any spoilers about a film that I aim to see, and it's this that I feel has me here positively glowing after just watching A Star Is Born. Because nothing prepared me for the turn of events that the film took.Judy Garland surely is at the summit of her talent here in this picture as she puts much credence and verve to the age old adage of the price to pay at the top. She manages to give a layered performance that smacks of tragic genius and beautiful splendour all in one go, with her range actually (and joyously so) surprising me. Not to say that the film is merely the Judy Garland show because it clearly isn't, from the tremendous score to the delightful costumes, the film screams class from start to finish. I have never seen Grace Kelly's turn in The Country Girl but if it is even half as good as Garland is here then I will be amazed.And then there is James Mason, an actor who just seems to get better with each film I watch him in. Here is a real heartfelt performance, one that manages to drag you into a sympathetic state of mind when perhaps you should be hissing and booing at the screen. Mason as Norman Maine literally had me cursing that dam fly in my eye, none more so than during a heartbreakingly sad scene at the Oscar ceremony. How can a film be so jaunty {courtesy of some peerless tunes), yet be so dark and incredibly sad at the same time?.Hard to believe that some cretin at Warners cut this film after its premiere! I would hope that the one who made that decision was rounded up and shot around the back of the studio. Thankfully we can now see the film restored with production stills and the original soundtrack, but that can still be a distraction, particularly at times when you least want to be taken out of the mood of the movie, but that said, we would rather have it in than not? Surely? It's a stunning film that has some minor flaws, but for the Garland legend it's an essential viewing, for the music it's second to none, and for story telling straight to the point, and from the heart, it's cinematic gold. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star is Born. Kaput!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Saw the Judy Garland film, A Star is Born, at the Chicago Theater when it first opened. Now at that time the Chicago Theater also had a vaudeville act or big band or even a popular singer at the time headlining the bill but when A Star is Born opened it was a stand alone picture and I guess that really threw audiences there. And yes, I saw the original screen time version which ran over 3 hours. Although I liked some of the story even I could see that the film was just too long and let's face it folks, Garland was not a great an actress, singer par excellence but her over acting got on one's nerves. The very next week the theater, and Warner Bros. shortened the film and a headliner was brought on stage and the theater had a solid booking. Also, Miss Garland was giving Warner Bros. a fair-thee well in the ego department and a film that should have wrapped in a month dragged on what must have seemed interminable to the studio. Warner Bros. cut off funding and Garland and Sid Luft had to finish the movie using their own money. Even that didn't stop Garland from misbehaving and it was known that Mason claimed that he could care less about her antics as he was making enough money from the film to actually retire, which of course he didn't. When the movie was finally finished and ready for release it was learned that Garland was nominated for an Academy Award but Warner Bros. could care less and let it be known that the studio would not be backing Miss Garland on this, also, the three picture deal that Luft had got vanished when Garland showed that she was more royalty than a committed player. Even when Warners gave the green light to cut the film the studio didn't care because it could show the loss on it's books but Garland and Luft might suffer. The film came in in the black so the Luft's didn't suffer too much but losing the three picture deal sealed Judy's fate in Hollywood, no studio would hire her, she was too deemed too unpredictable. Still, it's nice to see and hear her belt out The Man That Got Away and the other songs from this flawed masterpiece. It's worth a look every now and then, but just the first two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to dear TCM I finally was able to see this much ballyhooed movie in its entirety - or as much of it that remains after the famous lost cuts - see details elsewhere on this page. I loved Judy Garland in Wizard, the Andrew Hardy series and Meet Me in St Louis. As far as I can tell, she managed to ruin her voice before this "come-back" movie was made. All of those forced notes grate on my ears - sorry. How sad that so many people turned themselves inside-out to give her this opportunity. Even sadder that so few people seem to recognize the poor quality of her voice in this movie. The film is beautifully photographed and James Mason is fine but, please - do not try to tell me Judy Garland even came close to earning a nomination for this movie.</fullReview>

'The Man That Got Away' is always considered one of the best musical numbers to come out of old Hollywood: but wait until you've seen it in widescreen. It's not even the same number, and you get why people who've seen this film in theatres revere the number. Some of the compositions (especially during the opening set piece) aren't just Cukor's best work, they rival anyone's from that era. Let me reitierate: see it in widescreen or trust those of us who have. This musical/ melodrama/tragedy set the bar so high that 50 years later people remember this film but not the musical that got a best picture nomination that year, OR, the performance that won Best Actress that year.</fullReview>

One thing I don't like is the still scenes. I find these very boring and don't understand the point of them? but other than that it's classic! I love Judy Garland and every film I have seen her in, The Wizard of OZ, Meet Me in St Louis, Easter Parade and Now a star is born is fantastic. I must say though that Till The clouds roll by was a dissapointing one but hey! you can't have everything. I have been a fan of Judy's for, what seems like, a lifetime and I am definitely going to go out and find some more of her films. This film is a terrific comeback from a terrific actress, singer and dancer and is well worth watching... even if the stills are crap! YAY JUDY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judy Garland delivers one of the most convincing performances I have ever seen in a film that in many ways mirrors her own life story. She is completely solid in her singing and acting. Mesmerizing in "The Man That Got Away," revealing if, yes, self-congragulatory in the big "Born in a Trunk" sequence, and positivly radiant when performing the "Somewhere There's a Someone" production number at home for her husband, she is also heartbreaking in the scenes where she is faced with her husband's descent, mirroring her own real-life one. (The husband was played excellently by James Mason, I should add.) She is so utterly in love with him that it's difficult to beleive she was just acting it. I'll say, along with most everyone else that's seen this film, that she probably gives her best performance here. (Yes, it might even top Dorothy!)I saw the restored version in Widescreen. The added scenes where still photographs had to be substituted for missing footage added mystery to the whole thing. Interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goodish drama, but massively padded. Central story is interesting, though has a large air of inevitability and predictability about it. Biggest negative, however, is the massive amount of padding in the movie: many scenes seem overly drawn out or plain unnecessary. The biggest culprits are the musical numbers (though I may be biased: I am not a fan of musicals at all). Not only do they make the movie excessive in duration, but ruin the momentum of the plot.The movie could easily have been a tight 90-110 minute drama, instead of the 3-hour odyssey it is, simply by editing some scenes and leaving out the musical numbers (OK, not all - some are useful as means to demonstrate Vicki Lester's talent).Decent performances. James Mason's was the standout, especially as he only appears for the dramatic scenes - no musical fluff from him. Plus he clearly has the greatest gravitas and pure acting ability of all the performers. Judy Garland is OK, but mostly there for her singing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A STAR is snubbed . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . by a craven Hollywood community totally cowed by the Witch Hunters in the voting for the "best picture" Oscar of 1954, as American turncoat super-snitch director Elia Kazan's anti-Labor screed, ON THE WATERFRONT, took a cowardly plurality of votes away from A STAR IS BORN. The latter George Cukor picture is a landmark in Irony, as the real-life primary victim of Tinsel Town's "studio system" at its worst--Judy Garland--is forced into essentially caricaturing her past and future Passion of Frances Ethel Gumm, right down to being convinced by the make-up department that she has a Frankenstein face. Remarkably, Cukor presents James Mason's elderly alcoholic character, "Norman Maine," as STAR's tragic focus. As Gertrude Stein always said, "a drunk is a drunk is a drunk," and at "Norman's" age, the only pathos involved in his passing at sea is that he did not croak SOONER. Ms. Garland herself, expiring at age 47, Philip Seymour Hoffman (46), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (46), John Candy (43), Elvis (42), Paul Walker (40), Chris Penn (40), Anna Nicole Smith (39), Corey Haim (38), Sal Mineo (37), Bobby Darin (37), Robert Williams (37), Marilyn Monroe (36), Jayne Mansfield (34), John Belushi (33), Carole Lombard (33), Chris Farley (33), Brittany Murphy (32), Bruce Lee (32), Rudolph Valentino (31), Heath Ledger (28), Brandon Lee (28), Edie Sedgwick (28), Jean Harlow (26), Brad Renfro (25), James Dean (24), River Phoenix (23), Aaliyah (22), Freddie Prinze (22), Heather O'Rourke (12), and countless other actors died young enough to become tragic figures in Real Life; not so "Norman Maine," even in fiction. And, of course, Judy herself filmed STAR exactly halfway between playing OZ's 12-year-old "Dorothy Gale" and passing away herself, which constitutes the biggest "tragedy" of all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Christian, i enjoyed this It tells the story of Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland), a singer and Norman Maine (James Mason), a famous actor with a serious alcohol problem. He's smitten by her voice and her talent and takes her under his wing. With his help she gets a studio contract and makes quickly the transition from simple girl to an Oscar-winning star. Their happiness seems perfect as they also fall in love and get married. But Norman cannot control his alcoholism forever, soon he starts to drink heavily again, especially after he is fired by the studio. While Esthers (or Vicki Lesters, as she's renamed by the studio) star rises, his sinks into oblivion, which slowly destroys their marriage as well.The movie never over-dramatize or plays down Normans alcoholism, it's a very realistic and depressing picture we get about this problem. More surprising is the realism and insight we get about how the studios worked when actors were merely contract players, obliged to do what the studio dictated them. Though it never openly criticizes this system, the film definitely shows how little freedom stars had (Change of the name, complete makeover, typecasting). It is also clearly inspired by some real events of that time (just think of Elizabeth Taylors grieve over her husbands death, and the disgusting pictures that were taken on his funeral), which is chilling.Intense is what you can call Judy Garland and James Mason performances. Both are brilliant and are perfectly matched here. Garland, with all her memories of her time at MGM, gives her best performance ever and one of the best performances of the 50's (this should have secured her the Oscar - alas, as so often it was awarded to Grace Kelly for a lesser performance). James Mason, often overlooked, is her equal, seldom are actors so perfectly matched (and with considerable chemistry too).The sad thing about this film is the unnecessary and brutal cutting of several scenes after the film was already released and quite successful. Warner Brothers literally butchered the movie, without the restored scenes (as far as those are still available) some developments make no sense. So be sure to get the restored version, not only to get a feeling of what it might have looked like with all the scenes intact, but also to enjoy the rich colors, the beautiful score and cinematography. A real treat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remarkable film. Remarkably long, for starters, and I can see why Warner Brothers execs wanted it trimmed down from 182 minutes to 154 minutes (the restored version seen today is at 176 minutes).It's also remarkable because it shows a bit about what Hollywood was like, since many of the scenes used real movie studios locations.But, of course, it's most remarkable because of the performance by Judy Garland. But it's remarkably pathetic that this role -- of a woman standing by her husband, who is a drunk -- so paralleled her own life (in reverse) of drug addiction and alcohol. I'm old enough to remember Judy Garland's television specials in the 1950s and 1960s, and my grandparents (whom I lived with) commenting each time about how Garland looked and that she "wouldn't be alive much longer". And their predictions that she'd commit suicide successfully before long. Nevertheless, she was a grand actress, and her musical numbers here (especially "The Man Who Got Away") are truly impressive.The film is also remarkable because of co-star James Mason. Not usually of my favorites, although aside from Ronald Colman, the actor with the most distinctively charming voice. But he is excellent in this film.Jack Carson and Charles Bickford, in supporting roles, are excellent, as well.Well worth a watch, and this will end up on the DVD shelf of anyone who follows Judy Garland. And, this outshines the earlier and later versions of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand Entertainment on All Levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star is Born, A (1954) **** (out of 4) Grand entertainment on a very large scale, this remake of the 1937 William Wellman film has just about everything you'd want in a movie. Alcoholic actor Norman Maine (James Mason) takes pride in his new discover Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland) and manages to get the young woman a screen test, which turns into a studio contract where she quickly climbs to the top of Hollywood. The two are married but soon her star goes to the top while Norman begins to lose control of everything. Some people seem to forget it but the 1937 movie with Fredric March and Janet Gaynor was a terrific movie and this remake does it justice as well as add all sorts of depth to it. The original version is pretty much story and terrific acting while this one here really tries to give you a behind the scenes look at Hollywood and what the town can do to you. This film came during a time when Hollywood was delivering large entertainment and that's certainly true here with some beautiful 2.55:1 cinematography, masterful looking Technicolor and a nearly three-hour running time that has just about every form of drama and comedy. There's no question but the main reason to check this film out are for the performances by Garland and Mason. Mason clearly steals the film as his performance of the drunk can be funny at times but at other times downright depressing. Mason doesn't take an easy route of just doing the fall over routine but instead he really delivers a full character and gives us everything we need to know about the guy. Garland also delivers a very strong performance because she has to be able to be strong enough to stay with Mason's performance, which she does without issue. Garland handles the dramatic scenes perfectly and her singing has never been better in her career. The musical numbers range from small ones where Garland is simply singing to her husband to much larger ones that nearly leap off the screen. The Man That Got Away, Lose That Long Face, Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo and the Born in the Truck melody are certainly among the highlights in the music department. Technicolor has always served Garland quite well especially in films like THE WIZARD OF OZ and MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS and this is another marvelous one. Just take a look at those lavish and beautiful colors and especially during the opening sequence where the studio certainly wanted to jam all the colors into your face. I can't help but wonder what these images must have been like for crowds seeing this in 1954. As terrific as the film is I do think there are a few problems including the ending with Mason's character. I don't mind how they shot it but I think adding a song over it made it lose some of the impact. The history of the studio cutting the film down by nearly 25-minutes sadly means that some of the footage is now missing so we get production stills in their place, although the audio is still available. A STAR IS BORN was the perfect story to be told in a perfect time in Hollywood history because they could go all out and deliver something epic, which is what they've done. This isn't a flawless movie but the look, acting, directing and music make it a perfectly entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It didn't work for The Maltese Falcon, but with A Star Is Born we managed to get three classic films from the same story. I'm guessing that people like a love story that's entertainment based.This version that starred Judy Garland and James Mason is quite a bit more expensive than the 1937 United Artists film that starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. Warner Brothers bought the rights from David O. Selznick who produced it for United Artists as a vehicle for the comeback of Judy Garland.As we all know Judy suffered a nervous breakdown and was four years off the screen after Summer Stock. I'm sure it was with some trepidation that Jack Warner signed Judy for this musical version of A Star Is Born.Dropped from the 1937 film is the wide eyed innocent fresh off the farm Esther Blodgett that Janet Gaynor played. Judy has a minor career, she's singing in a band with friend Tommy Noonan. But at a benefit where she's performing, her quick thinking prevents drunken screen star Norman Maine from making a spectacle of himself. James Mason as Norman Maine actually remembers what happened and the young lady intrigues him. He finds her at a club singing the Academy Award nominated song The Man That Got Away and he sees star quality in her. A little pushing with studio head Charles Bickford and A Star Is Born, renamed Vicki Lester.In her singing and her acting no one was more vulnerable than Judy Garland. She had no other life other than performing from the time she was a small child. That Born In A Trunk number is quite autobiographical. She had all the hard knocks of Born In A Trunk before she was signed by MGM and she had to deal with a lot of heartache as Vicki Lester does. The role got Janet Gaynor a Best Actress nomination and Judy got one also.In fact A Star Is Born might be unique among films in that both leads both the first and second version got Oscar nominations. James Mason repeated Fredric March's nomination from the first version. And Norman Maine is a difficult role. He's essentially a weak man who has indulged himself too much and can't seem to stop the downward spiral. But he's bright and intelligent and the tragedy is that the love of his life came too late for him. Like the other version this A Star Is Born earned a flock of Oscar nominations, but not one award. Judy was the favored choice, but she lost in an upset to Grace Kelly for The Country Girl. Ironically that's another film where a woman has to contend with an alcoholic husband. James Mason unfortunately was nominated in a year where after three straight nominations, the pressure was overwhelming to give Marlon Brando his Oscar for On The Waterfront. It would have been one egregious slight.Another part of consequence is Jack Carson's as the studio press agent and general factotum for Mason, a job he hates. Mason does treat him like a doormat at times and Carson's got every right to feel resentful. But sad to say he gives Mason far more than the comeuppance required. Carson was equally good in drama and comedy, he made his blowhard persona work in both. The last film of this story with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson was also acclaimed and Barbra got a few hit songs out of it. Something tells me this will not be the last version of A Star Is Born.Can you see Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes doing it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sad movie. It's about a man who wants to be good, but he has burned so many bridges that he can't. He has thrown away opportunities and friendships and reaches a point, like we all do, when that luster is gone. Enter Judy Garland and her star and we have a direction for him, but he can't give up his own star. She is vivacious and talented. He tries so hard to be significant to her, but in trying so hard, he doesn't see what he has. She is unconditional about him, but, I would imagine, like so many Hollywood marriages, ego has its due. James Mason does a wonderful job in this film. We want to like him. We pull for him. We cringe when he does the things he does. Judy is wonderful, doing what, as a star, she did so many time. The interesting thing is that her behind the scenes activities mirrored Mason's on screen life; she was probably developing the unhappiness that would eventually make her life a struggle. There are excellent musical numbers. The final scene creates such tension and despair as two wonderful actors play on artificial hope. I was really moved by this film. I haven't seen the other film versions of this, but it would be hard to match the pathos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Judy fan, this movie epitomized and helped me appreciate the full range of Judy's incredible talent. There are many memorable moments, both musical and dramatic. However, there is so much controversy and opinion surrounding this movie, that it would be impossible to cover all bases.I have always found Judy's performances almost hypnotic. Whether singing, dancing, or acting, she has my eyes &amp; ears riveted on her. "A Star Is Born" would be the best example of this happening to me. I only want to comment on one section that was cut then recently restored. In my opinion, cutting the "Lose that Long Face" number was wrong, because it provided a much-needed lift during the heavy second half of the film (if they had to cut, I wish it had been to shorten the exceedingly long "Born in a Trunk" sequence, but that's just my preference). Moreover, it was an excellent and ironic contrast to the emotional scene Judy does with the studio boss in her dressing room in between takes. The contrast and irony of the situation are epitomized when she dries her tears, hastily reapplies makeup, and finishes the number all smiles and sparkle. I know the movie has been picked apart, chopped up and put back together as best as possible (I have only seen a VHS "restored" version - not in widescreen). All in all, I feel Garland &amp; Mason were superb in their performances, as well as the supporting cast. If you love Judy Garland, it's a must-see. It truly is, gloriously Judy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a 48 year old Black woman who recently became interested in Judy Garland because of the recent televised film on her life entitled "Me and my Shadows." I wanted to hear more of her singing so I rented the movie, "Star Is Born." I cannot put into words how brilliant Ms. Garland was in the movie! I have never heard a voice like hers before in my life. And I truly believe many have copied her style of dance (Janet Jackson for one. She was truly a gifted genius in every sense of the word. Her dancing, acting and singing is something I can watch over and over and over again and never get tired. In fact I already have. I had no idea of this performer's artistic abilities. The movie is a materpiece that I must own in my collection. Each time I watch the movie I see something else new and disturbing. There is one scene in particular which bothers me where Ms. Garland says she wish she was dead. I'm still trying to figure out this, rather or not it was put in by mistake when the movie was restored. Star is Born is on my top 10 list for favorite movies and probably will come out number 1. Now I will have to see everything Judy Garland ever did, just to listen to her magnificent voice. I also enjoyed James Mason role in the movie. I had no idea this man was such a good actor.

		<fullReview>Despite his citation of other sources, Martin Scorsese was clearly inspired by George Cukor's 1954 musical when he made NEW YORK, NEW YORK; and there are plenty of other highbrow types who feel Cukor's mixture of studio artifice and searing melodrama makes up a masterpiece. To these eyes, the Warners reconstruction of A STAR IS BORN, now boosted to 170 minutes, is elephantine and unconvincing. Like NEW YORK, NEW YORK, A STAR IS BORN is a phial of show-biz narcissism masquerading as ferocious self-investigation. There is one number--the midpoint showstopper "Born in a Trunk"--that's so stylized in its design it would today register as avant. And Judy Garland, as rags-to-riches Esther Blodgett, has a confessional crackup scene, dolled up in ludicrous face paint for an offscreen country-bumpkin number, that is so incisive and so cruel on Cukor's part that it seems to have inspired all the films Andy Warhol made with Edie Sedgwick.But the rest of the movie doesn't wash. As Norman Maine, the rapidly fading matinee idol who brings Esther fame and fortune, James Mason is marvellous in the tragic last two reels; before that, he looks uncomfortable in his three-piece suits, trying to smile gamely at Judy Garland's acting-out. And Garland's performance never really hits its stride: her ony vivid moments are dependent on Cukor's creepy-campy fascination with the sight of Dorothy from THE WIZARD OF OZ having a nervous breakdown. (She sustains her characteristic Dorothyesque quaver even in her most unstrung moments.)The film seems evocative of its moment, and I don't mean that in a good way. Even its "blistering" highlights feel powdered by three-point lighting and the ministrations of Edith Head. (It's similar to the feeling you might get watching fifties Elia Kazan now--all this emoting was later done by actors who didn't have to hit their marks and follow their sightlines so rotely.) For a fifties movie-colony psychodrama that really rips the drapes off the wall, Vincente Minnelli's Hollywood-angst duet--THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN--dusts Cukor's celebrated work in a heartbeat.</fullReview>

Even though she was already hooked to sleeping pills, pills to wake up, and pills to control her weight, she acted brilliantly. James Mason also turned in HIS best performance, acting like that "washed up" movie star that is so hard to play while you are in your prime.It's about Esther Blargett (Judy), who gets "discovered" by the washed up actor, Norman Maine (James) who has a really bad problem controlling his alcoholism. She gets into a major studio and is a big hit. However, when the two fall in love, he gets a little better, even stopping his alcoholism for a while. However, after a few weeks, he gets back into it and really embarrasses her in a few places, including in the Academy Awards. A judge puts Norman under Vicki's (Esther's studio name) custody in turn for the stunning finale.When Judy Garland sang "I Was Born In A Trunk", that was almost her real life story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent lead performances from Garland and Mason...Mason is especially good as the tragic Norman Maine...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Star Is Born opens much like Singin In The Rain, with a big Hollywood event anticipating the arrival of two stars. But instead of genial mega-star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and dumb-blonde star Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), we are waiting for the fading Norman Maine (James Mason) and the dumb-brunette starlet Lola Lavery (Lucy Marlow). Lola turns up, but we are left waiting for Norman...and waiting....Then Mason turns up drunk backstage (we soon learn this is a regular occurrence). He ends up stumbling out into the middle of young singer Esther Blodgett's (Judy Garland) performance. She quickly improvises, saving the quickly fading star from further embarrassment by pretending he is part of the group's act.With that fateful first meeting the stage is set for the romance, rise of Esther Blodgett (soon to be Vicki Lester) and the tragic demise of Norman Maine. This film's strength centres around the two excellent leading performances. Mason, like Fredric March did in the 1937 original, makes Norman such a human, charismatic, tragically flawed and touching figure. In Mason's hands he is just not a fading big screen actor and drunk, he is a human of many dimensions, and so real- yes, he is an arrogant drunk, but people like press agent Libby (Jack Carson) don't see the other sides to his personality, his generosity, charisma, gentleness and great love for Esther. It is the fully rounded characterisation that, like March's extraordinary performance in the earlier version, make the film what it is, even more so than the Garland contribution.And Judy is wonderful too...Excellent acting along with excellent performance pieces. I can see why Garland was so devastated to lose the Oscar that year to Grace Kelly- you get the feeling she invests everything, physically and emotionally, in this performance. Perhaps she gives herself to the role too much- some of her crying scenes towards the end are exhausting to watch. And Judy fans may hate me for saying this, but....it seems like an Oscar grab to me. It's an excellent performance of course, but Garland seems to be throwing everything at the Academy saying "This is me, Judy...come on!" Now that I've compared (and it's inevitable)March's performance to Mason's, I guess I have to compare Garland's to Gaynor's in the earlier version. On the surface of it, Garland looks like the clear winner. Yes, she was a better actress than Gaynor and much more of a "star". Yet Esther Blodgett in the 1954 re-make is conceived quite differently to Gaynor's naive, winsome farm girl in the earlier film- Judy is quite worldly, she's lived before she met Norman, she's been on the road with the boys and she's a singer. It's written differently, and interpreted quite differently by the two actresses.The Cinemascope format and the photography is quite lovely, and the musical numbers, though long (see my other post for thoughts on the cutting of the film)are wonderful for lovers of musicals like myself and they certainly show off Judy's talents to the best advantage (to the point, unfortunately, where Mason is left to merely react to Garland's production numbers. The always reliable Charles Bickford does a solid job as the unusually benign movie producer.I really do love Mason's performance....some of his scenes are so painful to watch towards the end, especially the night court scene where Mason, full of self-loathing, has dragged himself so low that he is up on a common drunk charge. The look on his face as Garland stands up to intervene says it all. And the last scene, of course, where Norman suicidally walks out into the ocean after he has come to the conclusion that he can't drag Esther. the one good thing in his life, down any further with him...he doesn't want to destroy her as he has destroyed himself. Amazing stuff. If Brando hadn't been around that same year, he would have bagged that Oscar, no contest. He is just as good in the softer, "sober" scenes with Garland- the scene where he tells her to go "for the big dream" is beautiful. He makes Garland believe in herself, and he makes the audience believe it too. Judy and James have great chemistry together too.As for alternative casting choices for Norman Maine...I am so glad that Grant and Bogart turned it down. I love them both, but I can't see Grant doing what Mason did for this role. Bogie apparently loved the 1937 version, he had a print of it in his mansion and used to play it every year for guests and cry every time....maybe he didn't want the role because he didn't think anything could measure to his favourite film, or perhaps he saw too much of himself in the Maine character, that the role wouldn't have been a "safe" acting bet for him to follow. I don't know, but Mason sure is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent A Star Is truly (re)born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems truly amazing that Judy Garland could have give such a perfectly emotional performance as the wife of a falling movie star by the name of Norman Maine(James Mason). I can't describe how brilliant this film really was, at first overlong but at the end, it became a very moving piece of drama and it didn't even seem to matter that the musical set-pieces were far and few (but they were brilliant as well.) I purchased the 2 disc DVD set mainly because of the praise this film received, i loved the film but don't think it is worth a two disc set. There are no modern features and therefore it is just purely outtakes and premiere reels of the film in 1954. Really what mattered though is the superb performances from both James and Judy. They were nothing short of exceptional, as for the film otherwise the songs were brilliant however the story could drag ever so slightly, even if the scenes became very poignant and showed the mental disintegration of the fading actor Norman Maine (James, you were brilliant in this role.) The film is a gem and i would advise everyone to see it. It was a 4 year comeback for films for Judy and she didn't make any more for another 7 years, so sit back and watch a great drama piece from Cukor with, I think two performances worthy of Best Actress and Actor and well what more could you say, it's even got the classic song "The Man Who Got Away." Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I saw this on TCM after hearing about how great of a movie it was so i decided to watch it. It started out OK not that bad but kinda slowly, but when it got to the part where they just show still pictures from like a camera of the characters and places they're supposed to be but still hearing them talking and sounds and everything i thought i was going to throw something at the TV, it was so annoying! and it seemed like it went on FOREVER, and then finally it stopped so i thought i'll let it go, but then they did again 30 minutes later, and i again thought i was going to throw something at the TV, but by then i was like 90 minutes into it and wanted to see it to the end but it just got worse, I mean the overacting by garland and mason it was laughable, and don't get me wrong I love Judy Garland especially in Wizard of Oz and Easter Parade, but it was truly horrible. I guess its supposed to be have some deep meaning or something about the movie business, but its also supposed to be somewhat entertaining and it was seriously lacking in that department but I guess whatever floats your boat... i didn't like it AT ALL! but maybe you would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect movie, now matter how much they edited out of it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that legends are made of. It is still talked about, studied, dissected and gossiped about. It features one of the all-time great performances, a role so perfectly played that there is no doubt in my mind that no matter how troubled leading lady Judy Garland may have been, her ego never dominated, only the desire to turn out something excellent.Up until this film, Judy Garland's film career had simply been about "Dorothy", with a bit of "St. Louis" thrown in and a song about Mr. Gable. She had been overshadowed by Mickey Rooney for a while, but when you talk about legends, it is Garland who stands above the rest, her singing, dancing, clowning, dramatics so much the tops. Only a few actors in film could make you cry while you laughed (Chaplin being one of the few others), and you always sensed heartbreak in her acting even when the parts were simply the same as what she had done before.As Esther Blodgett, Garland is an unknown singer. "Got to Have Me Go With You!" is her break-out number, at least for the presence of a drunken superstar named Norman Maine (James Mason) who intrudes on it like a naughty chorus boy. Garland saves the day by getting him into the choreography, and his gratitude when sober turns into the desire to make her a star after hearing her sing "The Man That Got Away". Like Fanny Brice and "My Man", no matter who sings this song, you will always think of her. Even with "Over the Rainbow", that was a beginning, her innocence still prevalent, and here as a mature performer, she can dominate a song without eating it up. Harold Arlen, who wrote the music for both these songs, can truly be called one of the greatest masters of songwriting in the business, still honored today in an Off Broadway show, "The Wizard of Song"."Say Vicky Lester!", she is told upon hearing her new name, and even if there was once a bit actress with this name in real life (around the time of the 1937 Janet Gaynor/Fredric March version), it will be Garland's Vicky who will go down into immortality. Vicki and Norman marry, he attempts sobriety, and she becomes a superstar. While "Born in a Trunk" is considered the hallmark of this film, I truly find her "Somewhere There's a Someone" to be the richest moment where she perfectly chews up every moment this 7 minute dance number takes on. "Loose That Long Face" and "Here's What I'm Here For" also point out her ability to win your heart and rip it out at the same time.Excellent dramatic performances by Mason (certainly not overshadowed in this by his strong leading lady), Jack Carson (press agent) and Charles Bickford (studio head) add dimension to the story, not making this all about the star. Tommy Noonan is touching as her roommate, having just supported another great diva, Marilyn Monroe, as her put-upon fiancée in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes". Lucy Marlowe makes the most out of her bit role as a rising starlet, but it is obvious that once Vicky Lester enters the scene, there's no doubt who will end up with the man and the Oscar.Having directed such greats as Hepburn, Garbo, Crawford, Bergman and Taylor, George Cukor adds another coupe to his credits with "A Star is Born", and all of the combined talents prove that this was indeed a team effort, not just a showcase for Garland after her triumph at the Palace following her exodus from MGM. With husband Sid Luft at the helm, there is no doubt that there was high hopes of it revitalizing her film career, but the film points out that Garland's best work was on the stage. Like the name of her finale film which proved that Garland could go on singing, it wouldn't take the cows to come home, only audiences to fill up the seats where she won their hearts, even if only able to give part of herself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star is Reborn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1950, Judy Garland's contract with MGM was suspended when the turmoil in her personal life finally became too much for the studio to bear. For four years, she was away from movie screens until her then-husband Sidney Luft helped to her orchestrate a much-hyped comeback at Warner Brothers."A Star is Born" is a remake of David O. Selznick's film of the same name from 1937. That version garnered 7 Oscar nominations (resulting in one win), so the remake had a lot to live up to. In the end, it did more than live up to original, it surpassed it by becoming the definitive version of the story to date (out of three versions and counting).The story is a relatively simple one. A talented female singer is discovered by an alcoholic movie star whose best years are behind him. The two become romantically involved but her meteoric rise to fame starkly contrasts with his ever worsening fortunes. (This premise should sound vaguely familiar to anyone who's seen 2011 Best Picture winner "The Artist", which borrows liberally from both "A Star is Born" &amp; "Singin' in the Rain".)As you might expect, the movie is first and foremost a showcase for Judy Garland. She did not disappoint, landing her first Oscar nomination for her iconic performance as the titular 'star'. However, to the surprise of many (including myself), she didn't end up winning. Also nominated in a losing cause was James Mason, whose excellent performance in the male lead was up against some stiff competition from Brando &amp; Bogart. Supporting actors Jack Carson &amp; Charles Bickford also delivered top-notch performances, though they received no recognition from Oscar voters.Musically, the movie stands out, mostly due to Garland's powerful voice. "The Man That Got Away" is today a recognized classic (for good reason) and the big production number, "Born in a Trunk", is outstanding too. The songs by Harold Arlen &amp; George Gershwin are generally well done, though one or two (most notably, "Someone at Last") could have been dropped with minimal impact to the story.Visually, George Cukor's direction is well handled throughout as he takes full advantage of the CinemaScope frame. Meanwhile, Sam Leavitt's cinematography is drenched in beautifully saturated Technicolor.Unfortunately, for all of the movie's high points, there is a drawback. Prior to wide release, Warner Brothers somewhat haphazardly cut the film without the director's involvement. As a result, some of the original footage has been lost. The current version available on home video is a reconstruction that is almost complete but has some gaps filled in with still photos (with the complete soundtrack, though). This is a real shame but, thankfully, it isn't enough to wreck the film.In the end, "A Star is Born" qualifies as one of the best movie musicals of all time. The memorable musical numbers are augmented by a pair of stellar lead performances and high production values all around. Hopefully someday we'll be able to see the missing footage, which will only serve to enhance an already impressive cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>88/100. Although this version of the classic story is outstanding, I still like the earlier 1937 version best. Judy Garland is truly amazing. When she sings "The Man That Got Away", it sends chills up your spine. There are so many classic scenes and great songs. The cinematography is unique and quite good, the production is so lavish, the art direction and costumes are amazing. Good work by James Mason. A great film, but at close to three hours, it can be tedious at times. Other great musical numbers in the movie: It's a New World, Somewhere There's a Someone, I Was Born in a Trunk, Lose That Long Face and Gotta Have Me Go With You. Able support from Jack Carson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Star is Born of 1954 is the finest remake of a film ever. Hopefully, someday they will discover in a vault somewhere the rest of the missing footage. I understand that Judy Garland was devastated by the cutting at the time. The 1937 version is sweeter and more sentimental but this remake takes the cake!The outtakes on the Special Edition CD are nothing short of phenomenal. The missing scenes are handled tastefully but leave the viewer wanting a bit more.The shots of Los Angeles in 1954 are just plain fun. Having moved to LA in 1960 as a child, I found the exteriors a trip down memory lane, especially the shots of oil wells along La Cienega Blvd in the early days. I believe wells still pump there. This is a total treat for native Californians.</fullReview>

The song "The Man That Got Away" has to be one of the highlights of this film possibly followed by "Born in a Trunk". James Mason acts well and gives Judy a lot to work off of. But it was Judy that really made this movie what it is. She should have gotten that Oscar for this performance. But nevertheless the academy shut her out.

I think most people at home who had seen both movies were. As I look back, though, I think that perhaps Judy's performance is remembered more because of that loss. I hadn't even seen the 181 minute version, only the 154 minute cut. I had decided to save money and wait till it came to the neighborhoods. I have never forgiven myself. I never saw the "restored" version until long after her death.Oscar is a funny guy. He never even nominated Jack Carson, but was awarded to Edmund O'Brien the same year for a similar but less poignant performance. George Cukor (who secretly coached Vivien Leigh in GWTW) was passed over and had to wait until My Fair Lady.I've never understood how this movie missed 100 Greatest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a spate of Judy's absences caused by her demons and the pressures of making movies, "A Star is Born" remains her best on screen performance. At age 32 her voice is absolutely in top form-the best recording of her entire career. Although she dominates the picture from start to finish, screen writer Moss Hart and director George Cukor were smart enough to give her opposite star, James Mason, an incredible and pivotal role of support. When the picture progresses to the point where she is in support, the effect is devastating. "The Man That Got Away" is a classic, but was yet another casualty at Oscar time. Garland losing Best Actress to Grace Kelly (pretty though she was) is still one of the greatest travesties in Oscar history. A gorgeous but still shattering film experience, I rate this one of the best films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland shines in this....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the best version of "A Star Is Born" The earlier one with Janet Gaynor is of course also good (we don't need to mention the Barbra Streisand version). But Judy without a doubt sings, acts and dances her heart out, giving everything to the performance.The sets are Old Hollywood and vintage nostalgia. The Cocoanut Grove as it was in the 1950's must have been a sight to see. Anyone who has visited today's Hollywood, and has any sense of history will long for the days gone by. The Trocadero, the days of Lana Turner and 1950's glamor, all are gone. This film provides a piece of Los Angeles as it looked when Garland was making her second comeback. James Mason is sympathetic and effective as Norman Maine, the ill-fated alcoholic star.Charles Bickford is the gruff studio head, Oliver Niles, who promotes Judy's (Vicki Lester's) career. Without Mason's encouragement (telling her she must try- because she can be so much more; she is better than she knows) she would maybe not have had the courage to attempt stardom. Jack Carson as the cynical publicist, out to destroy Maine, is also reminiscent of the days when Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons generated the studio publicity, through Hearst Publications. (Today, by comparison, we have trash TV, and gossip from the Enquirer) I would prefer the 1950's any day!.The music is pure Judy. "The Man That Got Away" is perfect; Judy's voice needed no distortions or microphone build-up; her voice and gestures are inimitable.The tragic ending parallels Judy's real life. As she is realizing Norman Maine's alcoholism is destroying his career, in her own life she endured personal tragedy and loss. Ms. Garland was taken away too soon, a superior entertainer who will always be remembered for her uniqueness and talent. She should have received the Oscar for this film. 10/10.</fullReview>

She can sing, dance and act whereas Grace Kelly (who won that year) simply scrubbed off her glamor makeup to show that she's a serious actress. Hollywood likes that. James Mason and Judy play so well together but it's Judy's movie all the way. The "Born In A Trunk" scene is wonderful in content and performance.

		<fullReview>This is really one of my favorite movies ever! Judy Garland was robbed at the Oscars in my opinion. This was one of her very best preformances! Her voice, was at imo her best! It was so thrilling and strong! It has some really good songs, The Man That Got Away, Born in A Trunk, Loose That Long Face, all of them are just great! The movie is about Esther Blodget (Judy Garland) a singer who is trying to make it in film. And one night her and the band she is with are singing at a charity event when in stumble a drunk Norman Maine, and actor (played wonerfully by James Mason). She has to cover, and makes Norman look like part of the act, saving him from public humiliation. Anyways, that night (or the next) he goes out looking for Esther. He tells her that he can get her a contract at a studio if she leaves the band she sings for. Well one thing leads to another, and Esther becomes Viki Lester a movie star, who eventually marries Norman Maine. Im not going to go any further, but I reccomend it to anyone who likes a good movie. Very dramatic and moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland's Come-back was an expensive undertaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When MGM fired Judy Garland from "Annie Get Your Gun", it was after years of torment on both sides. Her repeated "illnesses" and tempramental outbursts are legend and won't be listed here, other than to say her dismissal from "Annie" was caused by such and was the straw that broke the camel's (MGM in this case) back. Although Judy was the primary reason for the film to close and reshoot later with Betty Hutton in the title role, the production had a lot of other factors that caused delay, including Frank Morgan's passing away. He was to portray Buffalo Bill and Louis Calhearn was cast in the role. Anyway, when Judy exited MGM it was with a cloud over her head so she was looking for some vehicle to help her "re-emerge". When her husband at the time, Sid Luft, came up with the script for "A Star is Born" they took it to Warner Bros. and history was made. But not without plenty of problems. The first major one was that Warner wanted to present the film in CinemaScope- the most popular widescreen process at the time. It was also patented and owned by 20th Century-Fox who leased the equipment to other studios. Well, Jack Warner refused to pay and ordered his minions to develop their own version. They did, but it proved too time consuming and costly that it was abandoned and Warner finally acquiesed.The already- shot footage was scrapped and had to be re -shot adding to the escalating budget. One of the best-loved and best-produced films/musicals of that or any other era, "A Star is Born" shows what large-screen formatting can present as seen through the skilled eyes and in the expert hands of a veteran and gifted director like George Cukor. It was his first color film, and his first in widescreen. His staging of the "Man that Got Away" number in a smoke-filled intimate after-hours club contrasts dramatically with the opening extravaganza of "Gotta Have Me Go with You" song/dance routine filmed on a wide stage at L.A.'s Exposition Hall(At the time one of the widest stages on the west coast - if not the whole U.S. - with a huge proscenium) Two completely different settings, yet both fill the screen with atmosphere. For first-time viewers- you might be surprised at the "middle" section which incorporates black and white stills while a voice-over accompanies it. When Ronald Haver was restoring the film, he found nearly all the lost footage, however there was still some moments that could not be recovered despite an exhaustive search. The result was that they had to use stills of the "Action" enhanced by the sound track to "bridge" the gaps. For a further, indepth and fascinating account of the restoration and search, check out Ronald Haver's book.This is one of my all-time favorite films. I was priveleged to see it presented at the Academy Theater after its restoration.The only survivinmg member of the cast - James Mason got a standing ovation as did Ron Haver. If you don't get -at least - a lump in the throat during that last scene, then you should be watching the Barbra Streisand version - not this one. And don't even bother with the 1939 version.Otherwise enjoy! This is truly "One of the Essentials" as TCM espouces. And please! see it in "CinemaScope"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland re-defines the term "tour-de-force" in Cukor classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't necessarily consider myself a fan of either the director or the stars but I'll always have a special affection for George Cukor's version of "A Star Is Born" starring Judy Garland and James Mason. Sentimental,lushly romanticised in its view of Hollywood and, by modern accepted standards of film length undoubtedly overlong, but in its overall impact and its main constituent plus points it must be regarded as one of the true greats of the Hollywood studio system. This story of a movie heart-throb on the slide who discovers, encourages, and marries a new sensation only to find that she has displaced him in the movie-going public's affections is a formula guaranteed to sell plenty of Kleenex. The original film starring Fredric March and Janet Gaynor has many admirers, especially among older critics, and while my only viewing was regularly interrupted and incomplete, it looked far too dated for me, particularly in Fredric March's performance.Cukor's version has much to admire: its well-structured and paced so well so that one doesn't begin to tire at the 100 minute 'wall';it has wonderful sets and musical and dance performances, but, above all, it has perfect casting with many career-best performances.James Mason is an actor who I've always considered limited.Sure he had that wonderful voice but too often he always seemed ready to fall back on it for support. His face lacks the powers of animation which mark out the truly great screen actors and while he has always been able to convey vulnerability and, later, villainy, it frequently seemed as if he swapped a set limited number of masks whenever the emotion of the scene dictated. There was no subtlety in his facial movements.Here, however, he gave arguably one of his greatest performances and without knowing their relationship on the set, there seems a definite chemistry between himself and Judy Garland. And the overall impact of the performance is of the proud man unable to come to terms with his obsolescence.But Garland towers over everything else in the movie. Here she re-defines the term "tour-de-force". Not only in her singing and dancing but in her outstanding acting performance she finally rids herself of that nagging grown-up little girl image.Maybe Cukor was proving here why he was termed "woman's director"(And I can only imagine that the reason Grace Kelly got the Oscar nod over Garland for that year was because of the former's bravery in tackling a non-decorous role. But that decision must surely rank with its neglect of Cary Grant as one of the Academy's greatest crimes ).And to prove that a rising tide raises all boats, Jack Carson gave what must have been the performance of his career. As the smooth-talking oily press-agent ever ready to kick a man when he's down he stomps on all those who condemned him as dependable nice-guy support roles.Woman's picture?.Well it gets me reaching for the Kleenex every time. And I bet even Clarke Gable liked this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere there was someone who was waiting for her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of A STAR IS BORN was actually told four times. Three times under the title in 1937, 1954, and 1976, and once earlier in the early 1930s as WHAT PRICE Hollywood? But the earlier film had the discovery of an up and coming star actress by an alcoholic director on his way down (the director was actor/director Lowell Sherman, best recalled as the villain in D.W.Griffiths' WAY DOWN EAST; Sherman had become a director of comedies and occasional actor - unfortunately he died in 1934). The first two under the title of A STAR IS BORN made the falling figure an actor (Fredric March, James Mason) who discover a great actress (Janet Gaynor, Judy Garland). In the last version it was a fading musical idol who discovers a rising musical talent (Kris Kristopherson, Barbara Streisand). Somehow the story is a timeless one, and I expect somewhere in the next two decades another version will pop up. Our society has the savage tendency of ripping down what it has built up very readily, especially it's public figures of adoration. Otherwise why would scandal sheets exist. In the 1937 and 1954 versions Norman Main is a man who had great talent (in the earlier film he actually says in the "Academy Award" sequence he won an Oscar, but he does not say that in this 1954 version). However, he has a serious drinking problem, and he is slowly becoming box office poison (declining figures in his pictures) and unreliable attending his film shooting schedules. But he is dazzled by the talent and vitality of Esther Blodgett (later Vicki Lester) and pulls out all stops to make her career. But as she rises, he falls, and the gap between them makes him decide he is a hindrance to her. So he kills himself.In both films he is protected as long as possible by his understanding friend and producer Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou in the 1937 film, Charles Bickford here), but the studio people can't stand him (in the 1937 film Vince Barnett as a studio photographer whom Maine roughs up, mutters how little anyone cares about Maine's feelings anymore). The one in both films who really dislikes Norman Maine is studio publicity head Matt Libby (Lionel Stander in 1937, Jack Carson here). Libby has had to clean-up after Norman so often that he sees the actor as a drunken irresponsible hedonist. It may be added that in the 1937 version Libby does have better feelings - he feels that Norman is going to ruin Vicki, and Libby likes the young actress. Oddly Jack Carson does not show that.The story of how A STAR IS BORN in the 1954 version was butchered is well known - about forty minutes was removed, and the reconstruction in 1983 put back about 35 minutes. But one suspects more is still missing than has been admitted. In the reconstruction they show shooting of a sea epic that Maine was making, in which he is in a frogman's outfit (in the distance). Yet I distinctly recall there was a photograph of Mason as Maine in costume for a sea picture, swinging from a rope. No such shot is in the reconstruction. I have a suspicion that A STAR IS BORN is one of those films (GREED may be another) where the cutting actually was not so bad as it appeared the first time. The main musical numbers were mostly saved, in particular the "One that Got Away" and a medley put in for the film within a film at Vicki's first preview (the one beginning with "Born in a trunk"). Certain subtle changes were supposedly lost in the cuts, but most viewers who saw the final released version had little difficulty following the story. To me the bulk of the missing material follows a misunderstanding between Norman and Vicki regarding her leaving her band job and awaiting his call setting up a film test. It is a curious bump in the decision of Vicki to stop being a band singer, but it doesn't follow that we had to discover how it was caused and how it eventually was resolved.I suppose that I have come to the point that I see a two hour film as long enough, and after that the film has to be really spectacular to hold my attention. I prefer the two hour version - but to be fair the new material, including the last musical number shot at the studio) is worthwhile for viewing. The movie and it's principle performances remain first rate - perhaps the supporting performances of Carson and Tommy Noonan as Danny were enhanced best, the former showing the brain of Libby more than Stander did, and the latter showing more personal concern about Vicki than the earlier male friend (Andy Devine) was able to. Noonan's best scene is his reminder of what Norman did for Vicki to get her to attend the charity event at the end. But an earlier sequence about her decision to quit the band, and a lost scene dealing with a last pitch to her at the bus are good scenes too. I watch Noonan and Carson and think of how well they did in support of Mason and Garland, and then am struck by the fact that by 1970 Noonan, Carson, Garland, and Charles Bickford had all died. Mason would die in the middle 1980s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie with an Identity Crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things to love about A Star is Born. Judy Garland's fabulous singing talent is on full display. The script is witty, clever, truthful, and in some ways very daring in its exposure of the Hollywood experience (particularly the studio experience). However, as much as I am bowled over by Garland's singing, it gets in the way of the story in several places. As the viewer is just beginning to suspend belief and think of Judy as Esther Blodgett or Vicki Lester, she lets us know that she's Judy Garland again through some show stopper of a number. I understand that Judy and her husband produced this movie as a comeback vehicle for her, but had they showed a little more restraint, it would have been a better movie, I think. The other part of the movie deals with two adults who fall in love. Both people are flawed, particularly Norman Maine (James Mason), but the depth and complexity of these two characters (particularly Mason's character) and their screen chemistry is something to behold. Off the screen, Mason and Garland became very close and Mason delivered the eulogy at Garland's funeral. In summary, I wish there had been more balance between Judy the star singer and Vicki/Norman, a couple desperately in love and doomed to fail, because it's the latter than brings the poignancy to the film. Mason did an outstanding job of keeping the "couple" story line compelling to the tragic end. He provided the romantic bitterness that's needed to keep this film on its tragic trajectory - although many of his scenes toward the end of the movie are so raw and emotional, they are hard to watch. I had to keep reminding myself, "it's just a movie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that got almost cut away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judy Garland stars in this tour DE force. In this she meets a movie star when she is performing on stage and he joins her on stage ( well he is drunk). She saves him from embarrassment and thus they end up falling in love! In 1954 after this movie was released the powers that be at Warner Brothers ended up cutting 30 minutes out of this! This footage was almost forever lost but was almost restored to its original running time in 1983. When you watch the movie and there is sections of just still pictures this is the best the producers could do to restore the missing scenes! This devise worked for me! Running almost 3 hours it is long but with home video you can always split that over 2 nights! The classic song "The Man that got Away" is from this film! The highlight of the restored footage is the complete "Born in a Trunk" scene! Also watch Judy Garlands make up when she is shown making movies. Now just a little FYI watch "the birdcage" after your done watching "A Star is Born". You will then see that Albert ( Nathane LAne) does Judy Garland in his (drag)show ( because of his makeup and costumes he wares in one scene)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once more last night I attempted to sit through A Star Is Born with Judy Garland. I stopped by IMDB tonight just to browse some of the opinions on the film and was shocked to find they were all so incredibly positive. (Please sit down if you are a Garland fanatic.) This is a seriously flawed film, it's uneven, shameless and often over the top (hmmm I could be describing the leading lady). So it's not surprising that the biggest flaw in the film is really Garland herself...way too haggard looking for the role of fresh faced Esther Blodgett...I think she's supposed to be pretty, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. She sure can sing! You have to give her that...unless you love La Garland, folks she's just makes you uncomfortable watching her. It's like watching Clift after the fall...as a curio, maybe...as camp, for sure...as film...drek. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens to us when we see a star? A lot of the filler-time in motion pictures is buzzing activity and flashing lights, and this is what we see in the first five minutes of a star is born ? a dizzying, dazzling array of extras and decoration filling every inch of the screen. And then, out of the crowd, appears Judy Garland. Suddenly all is still, the backgrounds seem to fade, and our undivided attention is fixed upon the star.Of course, cinema is all about gloss, and much of this is just an effect. Director George Cukor, unusually for an old theatre man, understood exactly cinema worked both as an industry and a means of expression. Cukor always used long, unbroken takes, but those in A Star Is Born are lengthy even by his standards. All the better for us to become absorbed and entranced by Miss Garland, who is rarely off the screen after her first appearance. The most gorgeous expression of this is in the musical numbers. Take, for example, The Man That Got Away. The whole thing is staged with an apparently simple ? although actually highly elaborate ? pattern of moving the camera back as the song swells, and closing it in as the song diminishes. Always Cukor's camera is there to capture the essence ? not just the detail ? of her performance.But the picture would be somewhat hollow if this treatment were given to a performance that was anything less than captivating. Fortunately, Miss Garland is appropriately stellar. Not only was she one of the greatest all-round entertainers of her era, she was probably one of the most self-aware people in Tinseltown. The Born in a Trunk number bears a fair few similarities to her own rise to stardom, and Judy surely knew it. Throughout A Star Is Born she must pick up and put down a dozen personas, and she relishes each one, but she also has a kind of consistency throughout them all ? a mad passion and a poignant sense of art imitating life. The end result is perhaps the most irresistibly engrossing piece of acting ever committed to celluloid.And this is really what makes this version of the story so much more stirring than the 1937 original. The latter was admittedly more incisive in its depiction of capricious Hollywood, but it lacked that bittersweet undertone. Judy Garland was one of the geniuses of the silver screen, able to enchant audiences in a hundred different ways. The studio knew this ? that is why they effectively stole her youth and pumped her full of drugs to keep her at work. A Star Is Born is almost like her revenge piece, in which she pours all the glory and suffering of her early career into one breathtaking masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by George Cukor A Star Is Born stars James Mason and Judy Garland and is the emotionally draining story of one of the worlds greatest actors and the young woman he helps turn into a star. The film deals with his decline into alcoholism as she becomes more famous than he is.Matinée idol Norman Maine(James Mason)is a leading star who's drink problem is causing a few problems but his talent ensures he is still employed.He meets young singer Esther Blodgett(Judy Garland) a fabulous singer who saves him from embarrassment at a big benefit show where he turns up drunk.The two fall in love and marry.All seems well as Norman lays off the booze and she starts to become a famous actress(repackaged as the glamorous Vicki Lester).However once her fame outshines his directors stay away from him and he descends into alcoholism,leading to a tragic and heartbreaking ending.A warts and all look at Hollywood and the effect on actors when for what ever reason they are no longer wanted.It's still a source of anger to many of Judy's fans that she lost out on an Oscar win to Grace Kelly in The Country Girl, Kelly's performance was very good but Judy's was nothing less than spectacular.Featuring fine performances and toe tapping songs,A Star Is Born really shines bright. If you like this version check out the 1937 version starring Frederic March and Janet Gaynor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film but it has its faults...Judy outstanding...Mason at his best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it would have been appropriate for Judy Garland and James Mason to have won Oscars for their work in 'A Star Is Born'. Mason has the difficult task of acting as a sounding board for Garland's overwhelming thespic and singing talents--a double threat--but does it with charm, humor and truly exceptional acting skill. Their chemistry is apparent early on when he interrupts her song routine at a gala event--and continues to deepen throughout the film until the heartbreaking conclusion. The Academy would have been fully justified in awarding Oscars to both Garland and Mason.But the film itself has its faults, not the least of which is the overall length and the inclusion of a "false" Academy Award banquet scene which is allowed to run too long once Mason breaks into the program. We are asked to believe that no one would have cut to a commercial instead of witnessing his long, drunken soliloquy, ending with the infamous slap. Furthermore, by the time events like the Academy Awards were telecast, they were no longer held in the kind of intimate banquet setting shown in the film. Nor were only four names nominated for Best Actress Oscars. How technicalities like these escaped George Cukor (with his penchant for accurate details) is incomprehensible. Once again, Hollywood--in making a film about Hollywood--overlooks a number of gaffes.Those criticisms aside, the film is a magnificent tribute to Garland's powerhouse talent. Not only is her acting on a high level, her voice is showcased in some unforgettable numbers--The Man That Got Away, Somewhere There's A Someone, Here's What I'm Here For, and, of course, Born In A Trunk.A must see for Garland and Mason fans and infinitely superior to the Barbra Streisand remake. Better too, in my opinion, than the earlier version with Gaynor and March which now seems antiquated.</fullReview>

She's simply great--she looks good and sounds fantastic--her rendition of "The Man That Got Away" had me in tears! She even takes the minor songs--one that she does in various accents, for instance--and makes them good. Many people think "The Wizard of Oz" is her best movie--I think this is much better.

Judy is at her best here - strange to think it was her penultimate film given the story - Esther rises in her career as her mentor and lover slides down the ladder - and some set pieces, Born in a Trunk, The Man That Got Away, are simply incredible. The restored version adds bits that were lost and has much better colour and sound than earlier prints. This has to be the best dramatic musical ever made; not only does it build on and develop the Dorothy Parker/Alan Campbell script for the 1937 film, but it also weaves its own special magic as we watch Esther Blodgett becomes Vicki Lester and all that her stardom entails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a superbly crafted and executed remake of the 1937 version and it's so far superior.Judy Garland gave her everything as the tormented Esther Blodgett/ Vicki Lester in one of the greatest screen performances ever. When she lost the Oscar to Grace Kelly's "The Country Girl," Groucho Marx called it one of the biggest travesties in history. Lucille Ball had stated that she was "confident" that Garland would win the coveted award after viewing this magnificent film.The story of a woman whose career was ascending while that of her husband was rapidly declining was magnificently told. Garland sang her heart out. Who can forget her outstanding rendition of Ira Gershwin's "The Man that Got Away?" By the way, the song was nominated for the Oscar as well but lost to the lovely 3 Coins in the Fountain, but 'Man' was far superior.Jack Carson was as good here as he was in 1945's "Mildred Pierce." He was just waiting for the day that he could extract revenge on Norman Maine, the man he regarded as a pain in the butt.As Oliver Niles, the always excellent Charles Bickford represented the old guard in Hollywood seeing that change was inevitable.How about Tommy Noonan? He suddenly rose to the occasion by a perfect performance in the scene where he told Lester that life must go on following Maine's suicide.The pain that was etched by the tormented James Mason as he saw his life crumble is a testament to his grand acting. That walk he took down the ocean to a path of suicide, this was totally memorable.Where was the motion academy that year? Did the voters hate Judy Garland so much for giving everyone fits on the stage that they would deny her the Oscar? I'd love to have seen the vote tally for best actress that year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Version of a Classic Hollywood Story....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1954 version of A STAR IS BORN is the second of three versions of the classic Hollywood story, originally conceived by William Wellman about an up and coming star who falls in love with am alcoholic Hollywood legend whose best years are behind him. Judy Garland delivered the performance of her career that should have won her an Oscar as Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester the rising star who falls for her mentor, Norman Maine (James Mason), a Hollywood icon who can't get work anymore because of his drunken escapades. This film, produced by Judy's husband at the time, Sid Luft, was severely edited after initial release; however, a lot of that footage has been restored over the years with some still photos inserted and the film now looks like the story Garland and Luft wanted to bring to the screen. Judy's weight appears to fluctuate throughout the film; however, her voice is at its peak. Her performance of "The Man that Got Away" is chilling and the 15-minute "Born in a Trunk" sequence is regarded as a mini-classic in itself. James Mason, also nominated for an Oscar,is tragic and heartbreaking as Norman Maine and there is solid support from Charles Bickford and Jack Carson (wonderful as an acid-tongued agent). Hollywood in the 1950's never looked s glamorous and appealing and Judy's last great musical is a cherished classic that is still worth watching after almost 50 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the 1974 version of the "Holliwood story" but I've enjoyed it only because Barbra was in. It sort of bored me at a point. Than I finally decided I would watch the, maybe most, famous one with Garland. Well, what a difference! I don't want to spoil anything so I'm just going to praise this jewel. This movie is a masterpiece in every way, from the direction to the acting and the costumes and the scenes...everything is grand. Garland gave all of herself in every scene and led me to tears in most of them. When I knew there was James Mason as the male lead I thought "what a strange couple!" But God the feeling they have, I could have never imagined. They're just perfect together. You can see it in one scene in particular where she says "I don't think my mouth is big enough!". That moment is real, and what gives you that sense of loss all during the movie. Something is going to happen and the disease slowly and inexorably advances. It's not the ordinary musical...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Masterpiece that can never be forgotten !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Masterpiece ! Judy Garland's Greatest screen performance that should have earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress. James Mason was superb also, he being nominated in the Best Actor category of the Oscars too. George Cukor had the amazing ability to bring out the 'best' in many Hollywood Female screen Legends. Judy Garland was one of these. Never has she displayed such feeling and pathos on the screen. Her singing voice had reached its ultimate peak in this period too. Who could forget her spine tingling version of Harold Arlen's "The Man That Got Away" - as well as the 15 minute 'Born In A Trunk' musical segment. Groucho Marx was certainly right when he said that her loss of the Oscar in 1954 was "The Greatest Robbery in History since the Brinx Robbery." It certainly was. But fortunately we have her treasured, faultless performance preserved today in 2010- including all out-takes, on Blue Ray, with all its marvelous digital qualities. Thank you Warner Brothers, we are so grateful !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly a perfect movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to imagine a little bit, what would have been, had Star Is Born not been slashed by crazed studio edits, but this movie is a revelation. Judy understood, better than anyone in film history, in my opinion, how to weave acting, singing and dancing together into a whole that transcends the parts. To put it differently, she knew how to put her soul on film. Mason supports this with astonishing grace, and Cukor seems to know that he is onto something special.You'd think that, having paid her dues the way she did, the studio system might have taken a chance on putting out Garland's magnum opus in the right form, despite it's length. They probably wouldn't do it today, sad to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is another movie to add to THE BEST MOVIES JUDY GARLAND EVER MADE collection. It's full of humor, wit, charm, drama, romance, and of course, singing. "Zis is the story of a little girl searching, searching, searching for zomewhere she knows there is a zomeone who iz za zomeone for her. Zis is her story." And so it is. This is also the story of Esther Blodgett, a very talented singer in search of her big break. She stummbles upon a mixed blessing, an alcoholic has been actor, Norman Maine (James Mason in one of his best). He tells her to give up on this small dream of hers and to go for the bigger dreams because he knows that she is more. She belives him and later meets up with him. He starts her on her journey to stardom. And on that journey, the two embark on a romantic trip and fall in love. Behind this plot, though, is broken promises and embaressing acts by the husband who is suddenly realizing that his wife is much better than he is. Jealousy begins to control the marriage and brings about much more drinking. But before it gets too serious, we see a scene where Judy Garland gives it her all and looks beautiful and stunning while doing it. Her voice is golden and her acting is fresh. I don't think anyone these days can compare with Ms. Garland. This is one of her very best. She's wonderful. And James Mason is a doll. In the newer videos, there is a special before and after the movie. It presents the very first viewing of the movie. You get to see some famous faces (Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, and Judy Garland and Sid Luft of course) and Judy looks pretty during that too. Then there's the dinner and after the picture deleted scenes are shown. It's a real bargain. If you like Judy, musicals, or just good movies, I strongly suggest you buy or rent this! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My user rating for this film is a 10, only because they don't have a rating of 15. Judy Garland is a show-business legend, and James Mason is (was?) a director's dream. Thank God the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences restored much of the lost footage. This movie is brilliant on all counts; what more can I say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Star Is Born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, My Fair Lady), I remember seeing most of this film once before, but for some reason I never finished after the Academy Awards scene, so when I got the chance I did watched the whole thing. Basically Norman Maine (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated James Mason) is an actor with a declining career, and while intoxicated he bursts onto the stage during a performance by showgirl Esther Blodgett (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Judy Garland) and her two co-stars, at the Shrine Auditorium. Thanking her for saving him from public humiliation, Norman asks Esther to dinner, and later he watches her perform a song with her band, he is so impressed with her singing talent he urges her to try her hand at acting. She decides to follow this advice, quits her band, but starts off at first working as a fast food carhop, and singing in television commercials, and this is how Norman tracks her again to show off her talent to studio head Oliver Niles (Charles Bickford). Now hired by the studio, Esther is given the new name of Vicki Lester, and she eventually gets her first starring role in a musical film that is a great success, she becomes an instant star, and she married Norman. While Vicki gains higher success, Norman isn't finding any work, and he may be turning to alcohol again, and when Vicki is nominated for an Academy Award, for which she wins, he accidentally strikes her face, forcing him to go into rehab. Not long after his release, he ends up getting in a fight with Matt Libby (Jack Carson), at a racetrack, when he accuses him of living off Vicki's earnings, Vicki bails him out, and he overhears her saying she may quit acting to help him. Feeling very depressed he tells his wife he is going swimming, but he goes to the sea to drown himself, she finds out and refuses to see anyone, but in the end Vicki is tempted to a charity event by Danny McGuire (Tommy Noonan), and she dedicates it to Norman, ending with a standing ovation. Also starring Amanda Blake as Susan Ettinger. Garland gives an award worthy performance, following on from her success in The Wizard of Oz and Meet Me in St. Louis, Mason is also great as the struggling actor she falls for, it is a tuneful film, and it shows some of the darker side of Hollwood, a most watchable musical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Ray Heindorf and Best Song for "The Man that Got Away" which was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. Judy Garland was number 82 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, she was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 28 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 7 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it was 43 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most critics and I agree this is one of the greatest if not the greatest thing Judy did. You certainly cannot look at the film through the haze of knowing Judy's tragic story. If you can't avoid it though you should at least realize it adds to the whole amazing pain of the story...I've seen every movie Judy's done... Read three biographies. I think she nailed it here. And so did all the people who originally saw it. What WAS criminal was the BS that happened after the premiere when the Warner decided to cut it down from the original running time. That caused it to lose at the box office...It is a great piece of film making. George Cukor can be proud of it. So can Judy wherever she is now...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Hollywood has to offer, with a magnificent Judy at her pinnacle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Star Is Born" is THE musical valentine to all aficionados of quality cinema. And Judy Garland, MGM's most phosphorescent star, was never more illuminating than in this effort -- her one and only non-MGM success.To fully appreciate this landmark 1954 movie, it's wise to know a bit of Garland's history prior to the making of what would be her last great Hollywood musical. MGM had fired the emotionally unstable and completely undependable actress four years earlier. Virtually unemployable, Judy turned to the concert stage and revitalized herself with stunningly successful tours both here and abroad that put her back on top. Soon her name was being batted around again in Hollywood. Warner Bros. planned to film a musical version of "A Star Is Born," the old cliched story of a Hollywood couple ? one on the rise, one on the decline. Judy, in what would be just one of many comebacks, was awarded the coveted film role and would be directed by the brilliant "woman's director" George Cukor. The rest, as we say, is history.Taking on the extremely fragile, highly temperamental Judy was truly a risk for Warners, and there were indeed problems a plenty on and off that set throughout the filming, but the finishing product can only be described as the best Hollywood has to offer. And Mrs. Norman Maine has become just as much Judy's signature role as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz," for what is captured here is the essence of her musical genius.Ironically, Judy is the one who plays the agreeable, accommodating actress on the rise while James Mason (quite superb) plays the brittle, self-destructive Hollywood has-been whose once-formidable career has been eclipsed by depression and alcoholism. Judy is the strong, valiant one, the one who sacrifices all. She provides the backbone, the strong arm, the guiding light. And she plays it for all its worth.Perhaps it is because of this strange dichotomy in character that Judy fascinates in the role. You can't say Judy is playing herself. Esther Blodgett is certainly part Judy ? the once untried talent who makes it big, the eternal giver, the timorous, soulful beauty who wears her heart on her sleeve; but a larger portion of Esther is what Judy yearned to be in real life ? positive, sober, reliable, the essential caretaker, the ultimate decision-maker, the Rock of Gibraltar. Judy had virtually none of these traits. Barbra Streisand might have taken the hint 20 years later when she herself remade "A Star Is Born" in 1976. Had SHE played against type ? playing instead the star whose career is on the skids ? one can only dream the performance she might have given.Garland's songs are absolutely spellbinding here, surrounded by a full, glorious score and superb arrangements. Her raw, unbridled passion and almost desperate energy is exhilarating to watch even after repeated viewings. The highlight of highlights, of course, has got to be "The Man That Got Away." This song can still make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. And the "Born In a Trunk" sequence is arguably the greatest cinematic showcase ever afforded a musical artist."A Star Is Born" was brutally cut and tampered with by Warner Bros. upon its initial release (supposedly Judy's emotional problems and constant absences caused the film to go way over budget; as a result the film was shortened for more daily repeats at the theater houses). This "butchering," for whatever reason, deeply affected the narrative flow and resulted in a choppy, sometimes incoherent film. `A Star Is Born' did not become the huge success it should have been upon its release. Since then, however a "restored" version has been lovingly reassembled that includes audio-enhanced stills that fill in for some of the missing scenes. This is the MUST SEE version, not the other.Along with Mason, who gives a trenchant, often terrifying performance as the mean, spoiled drunk unable to overcome his demons despite the love of a good woman, Charles Bickford, Tommy Noonan and Jack Carson all lend sensible, sturdy support as various prominents in the couple's backstage lives. One major gripe I still have is that they didn't give Garland a poignant ballad at the end of the movie á la Streisand's "My Man" in "Funny Girl." The ending begs for it. I keep waiting for that number every time I see this picture.Judy's Oscar loss is without a doubt Hollywood's most embarrassing flub of all time, but it can't tarnish the brilliance of what surely must be one of the finest musical performances ever delivered. In that alone I feel vindicated.Have I gushed enough?</fullReview>
