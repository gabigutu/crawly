		<fullReview>"The Hills Have Eyes" is personally one of my favorite horror films of the '70s era, I'd say this one is just below Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I love the whole atmosphere the film gives off, and how brutal the film is. "The Hills Have Eyes" follows a normal American family on a camping trip who accidentally crash their station wagon and trailer in the middle of the California desert. The gang consists of Bob and Ethel, and their teenage children Bobby and Brenda, and their adult daughter Lynne and her husband and infant. Their father goes out for help, while the rest of them wait at the trailer, but they are unknowingly being watched by a family of cannibalistic mountain people that are hungry for flesh. As night falls, the clan of mountain-dwelling cannibals close in on the family, attacking their little safe-haven Airstream trailer, and begin to brutally slaughter each of them as they fight to save their lives.One of the more memorable exploitation films from the 1970s, this gruesome little chiller is a nice addition to the list. Wes Craven, writer and director of this movie, does a great job at setting a mood, atmosphere, and having plenty of scary moments throughout. The desert in the film is eerie itself, it's such an empty and genuinely creepy landscape for a horror film to be set in. Along with this is the brutality factor - this is a harrowing little movie. The violence is shocking and strangely realistic, and it makes it more unsettling than it could have been. I can see why Mr. Craven has gone on to direct so many other successful horror films, such as "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street", because he's good at what he does. The acting here isn't bad, we have Dee Wallace Stone ("E.T.", "Cujo"), but most of the other actors are unknowns, who give decent performances. Some of the acting was admittedly over the top and a little laughable at times, but what could you expect from a low-budget '70s horror flick? This film comes to a close in a rather odd way, fading out into a red screen. The ending was surely abrupt and I'm sure there were other, better ways to conclude the story. But, again, the rough abruptness is another addition to the movie's raw atmosphere and visceral quality. This isn't a pleasant movie, and I think anyone who has seen it can agree on that.Bottom line - "The Hills Have Eyes" is one of the best horror/exploitation films to come from the '70s era. Not the best, but it is definitely close to it. It's brutal, raw, unsettling, and it made me uncomfortable. Any movie that has the power to do that must really have something going for it. Definitely worth a watch, it's a classic midnight-movie. One of my many personal favorites. If you like this, I'd also recommend Craven's debut picture, "Last House On The Left", which is also a visceral exploitation B-movie classic. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven is a director who did a lot to revive interest in the horror genre, but he also did a lot to ensure that we were unlikely to get our horror the way we used to. While I personally have nothing against his mega-successful "Scream" franchise and have enjoyed both films immensely, I feel sad knowing that Craven will never be able to recapture the awesome low-budget effectiveness of his earlier works. He has developed his directorial skills a LOT since then, but any horror fan will tell you that slicker does not necessarily mean scarier. Now that Craven has successfully broken free from the genre that has provided him with a living for over a quarter century (and has moved on to directing inspirational films with Meryl Steep!), we will never see another film like his "The Hills Have Eyes", which is raw, intense horror at its best. The film doesn't quite have the same impact as Craven's earlier "Last House on the Left", but it is a more skilful piece of work, and is still one of the most frightening genre flicks ever made.Like all great horror films, the plot requires very little description. The upper-class, white-bread Carter family are on a road trip to California and decide to take a detour through the desert to check out a silver mine that the parents received as a silver wedding anniversary gift. They ignore the warnings of a crazy old man they encounter at a gas station who warns them to stay on the main road, and end up wishing they'd listened to him after their trailer becomes trapped in the middle of nowhere with a broken axle on the car. It soon becomes apparent that they've stumbled into an area that is populated by a family whom the Carters would never have to worry about encountering back home in Cleveland. The members of this family are named after planets in the solar system (Jupiter, Mars, Pluto etc.) and are able to survive life in the desert by praying on unsuspecting travellers like the Carters. After a night of unbearable hell, the Carter family has lost some of their members and most of their supplies and decide to take revenge once daylight hits. They end up acting more violent and psychotic than the villains.Not even David Lean has used the desert to better effect. Craven's direction here is top-notch, and does a terrific job at conveying the isolation of his location and the helplessness of the whole situation. He takes his sweet time building up the mutant family's attack on the Carters, so that the tension almost becomes unbearable. By the last act, the film is less concerned about the heroes finding their way out of the desert, but about whether or not they are going to end up stooping to the level of their enemies. Of course, these themes of vengeance and family were covered by Craven before in "Last House on the Left", but this time around, he ensures that they will reach a wider audience by presenting them within the confines of a more straightforward genre film. The main factor that prevents this film from being superior to "Last House" are the villains, who are somewhat cartoonish and not quite as memorable as Krug &amp; Company. However, they still do provide plenty of menace, and like the "Last House" gang, exude a certain likability when they're not acting vicious, especially Michael Berryman, who steals every scene he's in as the dim-witted Pluto. All in all, "The Hills Have Eyes" is an unforgettable experience and one of the best films of its kind. Even though videotape copies of "Hills" have been in the darkest depths of moratorium hell for years, every horror fan should go out of their way to check it out. Especially since we just don't get them like this any more...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being close to thirty years old, Wes Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes" maintains a distinct raw intensity - far surpassing the level of terror seen in horror films today. The plot in a nutshell; a family on vacation ventures from the main road, ends up stranded in the desert, and falls prey to a malevolent clan of inbred cannibals. Though the story idea may be far from original - it is the atmosphere, directorial style, and acting that raise the overall credibility of the film. The low budget and claustrophobic desert setting creates a sense of dread permeating throughout the entire film; while the grainy look of the print adds a sense of realism to the unfolding events. With a brisk running time of only 89 minutes the film doesn't waste a moment in setting the mood - then when all hell breaks loose it is unrelenting until the final scene. The actors portraying the Carter family bring sufficient emotional range to their characterizations, making it clearly evident that this a normal family being tested beyond the boundaries of civilized nature. It is also worth noting the performances by the actors who play Pluto and Mars (two of the baddies) - these characters are portrayed as both sadistic and devoid of any sympathy. Although the DVD print is grainy (as mentioned above), it is THE definitive version of the film and is thousands of times an improvement over the quality of the video release; quite amazing for a low budget film of this nature. Grim, violent, and symbolic; it is an amazing piece of 70's exploitation horror. "The Hills Have Eyes" is a classic in every sense of the word, and receives an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's finest movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Carter family are travelling through the desert on their way to California. Head of the family Bob (Russ Grieve), a retired police officer, decides to visit an inherited silver-mine on the way, and ignoring the advice of Fred (John Steadman), a local filling station owner, drives off the main road towards the hills. An accident leaves the family stranded and easy pickings for a family of cannibals lead by Jupiter (James Whitworth). Following a savage attack by this family, which leaves a number of the Carter's dead, the survivors realise that to continue surviving they too will have to become savages.Wes Craven followed his controversial debut ?The Last House on the Left' (1972) with this far greater arranged and compelling tale of family warfare. ?The Hills Have Eyes' is a movie with a raw brutality that has been unsurpassed in any of Craven's films to date, and is possibly the finest horror movie to be directed by Wes Craven. Despite not being as graphic as one would expect the movie never ceases to unnerve or alarm. The atmosphere, which bears a slight resemblance to ?The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974), maintains an unsettling air from beginning to end as the viewer is sucked into the nightmare that the Carter family is forced to endure. The desolation and hopelessness is portrayed beautifully by Craven, who utilises intelligent camerawork and a haunting soundtrack to fully create the feelings of terror. For everything that the screenplay lacks, Craven's direction more than makes up for and one wonders why Craven is no longer able to make such raw, gripping and emotional movies such as this. During the movie it becomes easy to identify with some of the characters and then feel fulfilled when they exact their retribution.The acting, while not up to the standard of Craven's more recent offerings such as ?Scream' (1996), is of a fairly high standard for a low budget 70's horror flick and certainly helps in aiding ?The Hills Have Eyes' to accomplish a brutal, psychological edge. James Whitworth offers a fantastic performance as the despicable Jupiter and should probably be thought of higher as a horror film villain. His performance demands respect for its power and authority and is accompanied well by Michael Berryman and Lance Gordon. Producer Peter Locke even had a small role as Mercury, the watchdog for this contemptible family of savages. Interestingly the cannibal family come across as deranged hippies, which explains their planetary names. Virginia Vincent was the only performer that I really could not tolerate, but that could be because of the poor scripting for her religious-nut character Ethel. A very special mention has to go to Stryker the Alsatian, who `played' the part of Beast.I highly recommend this for horror fans. Those people who think that the ?Nightmare on Elm Street' series is the be all and end all of horror should certainly check this out. ?The Hills Have Eyes' is, in my opinon, Wes Craven's most thought out and gripping horror film to date which features some good performances, excellent camerawork, enthralling sequences and some first-rate special effects. ?The Hills Have Eyes' is an excellent example of classic Wes Craven and is one of his most creative movies. My rating for ?The Hills Have Eyes' ? 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Craven, and one of the best horror films of the 70's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's greatest B horror film was this harrowing low-budgeter that has gained quite a fan base over the years.Charming, all-American family becomes stranded in the dessert wilderness and are preyed upon by a clan of savage hill-dwellers.Violent, shocking, gory, and genuinely frightening, it's not hard to see why The Hills Have Eyes gained it's reputation as one of the most ruthless horror films of its decade. Craven's direction is well done, nicely exposing the raw and scenic filming locations. His story is also quite powerful. Craven gives us a taught, merciless tale of fear and survival that dares to break the audience's comfortable expectations! It has plenty of unexpected twists and a steely suspenseful climax. As with Craven's early film, Last House on the Left (1972), The Hills Have Eyes is a film about clean-cut,likable people who must become brutal animals to avenge themselves. It's solidly intense and very poetic.The cast of unknowns turns in great performances. Lanier, Houston, Speer, Grieve, Wallace, and Vincent all make for a well identifiable American family. While Whitworth, Gordon, and Berryman make for perfectly scary monsters!A startling and memorable thriller all around, The Hills Have Eyes remains one of Craven's greatest achievements and one truly relentless horror picture! Genre fans should not miss it.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five years after Last House on the Left, Wes Craven releases another movie about people doing horrible things to other people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last House on the Left was one of those movies that was unpleasant to watch because it was so well made. Wes Craven and producer Sean Cunningham pulled out all the stops and wrote in all of the most disturbing and cringe-inducing scenes they could think of into Last House on the Left, and I think that a lot of that depravity seeped over into Craven's next film, The Hills Have Eyes. My first assumption was that Craven had a hard time finding work or funding because of the controversy that resulted from Last House, but in one of the featurettes on the re-release of The Hills Have Eyes he explains that the studios wanted another similarly horrible film but he didn't want to do it again. As he explains, he resisted until he was almost broke, then made The Hills Have Eyes.The similarities to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are fairly extensive, as far as plot. A station wagon full of city folk are driving through the desert and ultimately find themselves struggling for their very lives from some sinister and disturbed people living completely cut off from civilization. And if that is not enough similarities, they are also cannibals. On the one hand I want to say that the acting was sub-par at best, but on the other hand, there were some truly impressive scenes, even from the same actors that turned in some of the most disappointing performances in other scenes.Of particular interest is the fact that the movie's story is derived from things that Craven learned about Greek mythology, namely, the way that the forces of good and evil sometimes combined, blended, and ultimately became blurred on each side. The evil curved toward good as the good reacted to the evil by becoming it. This is what The Hills Have Eyes does. It's a study of how easily people can turn from good to the very evil that they despise. Notice the end of the film when the character looks down at the blood all over himself and realizes that he has become one of the murderous cannibals that he has been trying to escape for the entire movie.That such a raw and horrific horror movie is able to explore such a universal aspect of humanity should in itself lift it from the level of campy horror trash that so many people gleefully and immediately condemn it to, without making even the slightest bit of effort to learn what the movie was trying to accomplish. On the one hand, it attempts to delve into a base aspect of the human condition, and on the other hand it tries to scare people out of their wits. And amazingly enough, it succeeds at both.The Hills Have Eyes was overshadowed the year of its release by Smokey and the Bandit, which was released a week later, but it also shared theater screens with such tripe as Day of the Ants and The Exorcist II. It wasn't the most popular movie in theaters, but it was distantly the best horror film, and deliberately threw caution to the wind as far as breaking taboos and creating a potentially offensive cinematic experience. Indeed, after Last House on the Left, Craven was hardly concerned with maintaining his politically correct reputation. The movie plays into a favorite Hitchcock theme, that of extraordinary things happening to ordinary people. You have the typical all-American family hunted by a clan of monstrous cannibals and in the middle of the desert. Not only do they have to deal with a broken down car and no mechanic in sight, but the dryness and heat of the desert and now these people trying to kill them. What may be most disturbing about the movie is that it is based on the Sawyer Bean family, who committed similar atrocities along lonely highways outside of London, and whose story inspired Craven to write this film.It's true that the movie is unpleasant and makes you squirm at many points, but that's because it is a true horror film, it's not the sugarcoated nonsense that Hollywood cranks out these days. This is the kind of raw horror film that Rob Zombie was trying to take us back to with House of 1000 Corpses, and it's exactly the kind of movie that Craven's longest standing and truest fans wish he would go back to. And after watching The Hills Have Eyes and comparing it to just about any contemporary horror film, it's easy to see why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Impressive Thirty Years Later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While traveling in a trailer through the desert to California, the retired detective Big Bob Carter (Russ Grieve) stops in an isolated gas station with his family for fueling and rest. Bob is traveling with his wife Ethel (Virginia Vincent), his son Bobby (Robert Houston), his daughters Brenda (Susan Lanier) and Lynn (Dee Wallace) and his son-in-law and Lynn's husband Doug (Martin Speer) and their daughter baby Katy (Brenda Marinoff). When they leave the gas station, the owner advises Bob to stay in the main road. However, the stubborn driver takes a shortcut through a nuclear testing site and wrecks his station wagon. With the family stranded in the middle of nowhere, Bob and Doug walk on the road trying to find some help. Bob is captured by an insane and sadistic member of a deranged evil family that lives nearby the spot. Doug returns to the trailer, and along the night the Carter family is attacked by a group of psychotic cannibal criminals. Absolutely trapped by the murderers, they have to fight to survive.The 1977 "The Hills Have Eyes" is still an impressive movie thirty years after the release date. I have never had the chance to see this low-budget movie, which has not been released on DVD in Brazil, and the VHS is rare. The violent, crude and claustrophobic story has not been dated; on the contrary, I believe it is more credible in the present days, when we can see violence everyday on the news, than in 1977. This movie is certainly one of the best in the filmography of Wes Craven. The cast is pure emotion and fear on the side of the Carter family, and evilness and sadism on the side of Jupiter's family. Ruby, performed by Janus Blythe, is probably the most interesting and ambiguous character, living with a dysfunctional family but still acting like a human being. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Quadrilha de Sádicos" ("Sadistic Gang")Note: On 30 December 2014, I saw this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eyes Have It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven first directed a film back in 1972 called Last House on the Left. If you haven't seen it...do so...for it is quite an experience. It blends dementia, depravity, cruelty, and blood and guts with values and basic moral and philosophical questions(at a very base level). He next directed The Hills Have Eyes, which many feel might be his best work. It is a horror classic to be sure for a number of reasons. It has the struggle of an innocent typical American family with a gang of cannibalistic subhumans that live in the desert. This struggle is intense, and blurs the boundary between normal and abberant behaviour(just as Craven did in LHOTL). The basic story is one of survival, not just survival of life but a way of life. The cast does a fine job...some of the psychos are quite convincing, as are the "normal" characters rather good in their roles. The story builds rather slowly but crescendos after the first death and we are given one climactic event after another. The real stars of the film, however, are the dogs...which are integral to the plot, and the desert itself, which establishes a mood and atmosphere of bleekness, desolation, and futility. Craven did a fine job with his second feature, and I would have no problem saying it was one of his better films. I would even concede that technically it is vastly superior to Last House on the Left, however, for me at least, not as horrific or chilling. Just as with Last House, much of the subject matter of the film is decidedly outrageous, with an infant possibly being served up for Thanksgiving Dinner its high point(or low point if you prefer). Unlike Last House, Hills is not nearly as graphic in its action, leaving a bit more to the imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven's second film is well-crafted and frightening to say the least. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT was more realistic (almost too much), but this perfect drive-in movie leaves you wanting more. It must have been an unbearable shoot. Check out the 2-disc DVD.A definite 7 out of 10 with Michael Berryman giving the best performance. Perfect locale in these California mountains that is scarier than the Bates Motel. Great cast with all unknowns. Dee Wallace was quite touching as the young mother and the old Grandpa Fred in the beginning was authentic to the max! Even if you're not a big horror fan, you should check this out late at night. Wes Craven has a good eye and feel for blood relations!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an anticlimax!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and I have yet to come across a worse offender than Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. Having held back from watching this for years, I was really pleased when I got it for Christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it - knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying. I needn't have bothered.After a promising - if familiar - start, that firmly sets the film in the 'Desolution USA' world of survival horror, things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wasteland.Looking like it was shot on a budget of $5, with the cannibal clan's costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and Red Indian attire, the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic WASPs who take a detour on a road trip to California, to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone (!). When they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesh-eaters and have to fight to survive.While hoping for another Deliverance, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn or Devil's Rejects, I actually realised I'd stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video store's bargain bin.With gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound close-ups, I can kind of see how an 18 Certificate (in the UK) is justified, but with those close-ups trimmed this wouldn't have looked out of place as a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV.The whole silver mine/nuclear test site subplot is just a McGuffin to justify pitching the 'civilised' family against the primitives, but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passers-by.And then there's the ending ... or lack thereof. The Hills Have Eyes seems to be missing either a third act or, at the very least, a satisfying denouement. Instead, I was just left wondering: "Yeah, and ... ?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary? No... Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason that I gave this movie 5/10 is because I watched it with friends and we had THE BEST time ripping this movie apart and cracking up during the most 'suspenseful, scary' moments. It may hold sentimental value for previous generations and be good compared to contemporary horror films, but for today's youth it's a comedy, if anything. I heard that a bulk of the real violence was edited out so that it could pass the censors, which makes the torture scenes ill-becoming. All of my friends agreed that this movie has absolutely no denouement! It just ends and it's hard to pick out the climax. The two characters (and baby) are thrilled that they killed the cannibalistic inbreds and literally jump for joy. Lest they forget that they're still stuck in the middle of the desert with no food and not a modicum of hope. The movie was definitely full of holes that distract any audience from the plot. Perhaps the remake is better; I haven't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craven's first good movie is an integral part of the horror/grind-house/exploitation flicks of the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in a budget close to 300 to 400 thousand dollars (give or take a dollar), and shot in just several days in the desert with limited crew and actors, The Hills Have Eyes isn't really a stylistic masterpiece under such limitations like its twice removed cousin Texas Chain Saw Massacre (then again Wes Craven didn't have the visionary chops of Tobe Hooper). However watching it, even in the wee hours of 3 AM in the morning on TV, it was still quite the little entertaining good versus evil flick. The remake of it, which will be known to more perhaps than Craven's original (or more seen), has the bucks to claim its lot of gore and expanded production design. But with this film, we get just the bare bones, so to speak, of a mutant cannibal film, where a family of six (with two dogs aptly named Beauty and Beast, ho-ho), get railed off the road in the middle of a desert, and a creeping sense of doom as the night rolls around.Craven puts together a cast of relative unknowns, but at the same time casts to type extremely well, with all of the family members (particularly the elder naive mother and bitter father) just right, and the mutant family (featuring the welcoming presence of Michael Berryman) with their names akin to planets, quite terrifying as well. There isn't much to their work, but there shouldn't be. This is the kind of film where you want the situation to just do what it can, and Craven doesn't get in the way save for a few tongue-in-cheek moments and some spots of gore. The moments of violence actually become somewhat more graphic than expected just by how fast they go or what isn't shown (apparently there's a X-rated cut that's out of existence). What's interesting too is how there's a little- not much but some- background on these mutant characters, the ties that bind this group of hungry maniacs together, with one perhaps not as twisted and remorseless as the others.As I said, if you're looking for Craven's masterpiece you might not find it, as there are moments where the story and dialog kind of crack in their place. But I was in a nice grip of excitement as the story unraveled into its last half hour or so, with a few twists that, to me, rival over those in the new Aja remake. It's a gritty, strangely amusing shoe-string production that knows what it is and is just happy to be shown somewhere. At the least, it shows Craven growing a bit from his horrid days of Last House on the Left, pointing to his fresher ground of Nightmare on Elm Street. This is the kind of movie that every horror or 1970's drive-in fan should see once, and has rightfully had a place as a cult film for decades now. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's films like this that make us remind ourselves to "sleep tight" at night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that Hills Have Eyes fans, I feel, find difficult to admit, no matter how great of a film they think Wes Craven's low-key, no-budget horror masterwork is, is that it's undoubtedly a film riding the coattails on the popularity of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Upon the release of Tobe Hooper's essential horror film that has become a genre gold-standard, nearly every film company - even ones that were created simply for this purpose - were jumping at the opportunity to hire directors, scour the neverending sea of casting calls and auditions, and looking for affordable effects artists in order to make a film that would be a frightening little flick people could catch on a Friday night.One of those directors was Wes Craven, who would later go on to create Freddy Kruger in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, one of the most well-received and highly regarded horror franchises ever made. Before that, however, Craven was a fairly inconsistent, unpredictable man in the director's chair, churning out as many winners as he did films like his pornographic venture Angela: The Fireworks Woman and eventually The Hills Have Eyes II. However, the original Hills Have Eyes is something to marvel at, much of its quality stemming from its universal plausibility and rawness. This is a film that personifies horror and uncertainty with a biting and unforgivable sense of dread that you can feel from the start.The plot isn't even worth digging into; a well-off suburban family embarks on a road-trip in their four-door, equipped with a full-size trailer, only to break down deep in the Nevadan desert and be the targets of animalistic savages that lurk in the mountainous parts of the desert. One of the savages is known as "Pluto," played by horror legend Michal Berryman, most notable for his facial deformities and distinctive look, who acts almost feral in his attempt to be the fearless do-boy of the group. The savages stalk and harass the family, making use of their insufficient firearms and easily spooked nature, even going as far as to attacking one of the young girls and leaving her a panicked wreck for much of the film.Watching it in present day, appropriately during the month of October, The Hills Have Eyes still has the ability to shock to the core, specifically in the way it executes its more suspenseful sequences. These are where the film's lower budget and small scale work in its favor. Consider the screams, the bloodshed, and the moments of sheer terror interjected in the long-term sequences of suspense in this film; all of these little quirks are elevated by naturalism. The screams heard by the characters rip through the film's audio-track, almost distorting every sound and hitting the center of your eardrum in a violent manner as if it's stabbing it in an unrelenting fashion. The bloodshed of the film isn't a bloodbath, but a sporadic showcase of the film's ability to make its gorier scenes as realistic and unsettling as the screams we so frequently hear.Finally, there's Craven's pacing and execution, which turn out to be successful almost all the way through. Craven is a fan of quiet, natural buildup; the kind that relies on the murmur of the water, the wind in the trees, and the chirping of crickets in order to create an environment that's equal parts believable and unnerving. Here, Craven builds slowly but surely, assuring that the execution is seamless and that nothing moves too fast, not even the scenes we've been waiting for since the start of the film. It's all even-handed and balanced and pleasantly so.The Hills Have Eyes lacks any kind of form or polish and that's precisely what makes it the movie that it is. Horror films don't need aesthetics that run studios millions of dollars, nor do they need proved greats as headliners or complex props and setpieces. The most memorable films are the ones conducted on that realistic, natural scale that leave us sleeping with one eye open and checking under our beds and blankets before we turn out the light. These are the films that personify the unknown and the elements of fear in a way that makes us remind ourselves to "sleep tight" at night.Starring: Martin Speer, Michael Berryman, Virginia Vincent, Dee Wallace, Susan Lanier, Robert Houston, Lance Gordon, and Russ Grieve. Directed by: Wes Craven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Image of crisis. Clear, precise, strong. Last part of a character ladder. And charm of an old movie. This are seeds. The result is a pledge. For small ingredients of normality. Behind masks and globalization, without ordinary fears and cages. A movie impressive for its simplicity. As white flag of hope. Innocent hero of different situations, free and pray for industrial system, piece of huge machine who marks modernization, symbol of a world too gray to be more that a silhouette, anonymous worker and toy of others facts, it is same comedy with same Charlot. But, in same time, it is a manifesto against a fake society. And subject of meditation about monsters who must make life better. A film who says profound things in ironic way. In children way. A letter for our day. Testify or map. For survive in strange times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As they say, nothing beats the Original. They're right about that all right. Although I enjoyed the remake for hill have eyes, which was directed by Alexander Aja, the original is just as great as the remake. The original gives a more raw and dirty feel for the film.The Story is about a family going on a vacation and got an accident in th middle of nowhere and is hunted by some savagers. It no deferents from the remake.As I said before, the original gives us a more raw and dirty feel. But don't look down on this because unlike the remake, which has more gore than the original, the original is a low budget horror movie that can gives audiences the thrills and scares. And considering when this was made (1977), this is a really good horror movie of it's time. Spawning another two sequel, a remake and an upcoming remake sequel, the hills have eyes 3.This horror classic directed by the great Wes Craven is one horror classic that all horror fans should not avoid. This is Wes Craven at his best.Overall 4/5 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Wes Craven film I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many I think this is Wes Craven's finest film. He started off with the gritty Last House On The Left which is just too dark for repeated viewing, but with The Hills Have Eyes things seem a lot more balanced. You never get bored whilst watching as it draws you in and won't let go. It makes you feel a lot of mixed emotions such as sadness, tension, anger and happiness. In the scene where the baby is taken and the mother is killed, I felt sad because it shows just how frail life really is. But later on when the baby is rescued I felt relief and happiness. I won't bother writing an essay on this, all I can say is that this is a film that all horror fans must see and will be enjoyed by non horror fans too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE HILLS HAVE EYES is clearly one the best horror films ever made, as it follows a large family traveling out West who end up waylaid by a desert-dwelling cannibal family. The film is fast-paced, scary as hell, well-acted and reasonably gory for the period in which it was made. This flesh-eating family of mutants are all sharp as a snake, with the exception of their mother: they communicate with each other via walkie-talkie, and ambush their victims in guerrilla fashion. To add an even greater sense of realism, director Wes Craven adds a daughter to the brood who can't stand what they're doing and makes several attempts to escape. The film looks like it was shot yesterday on the Anchor Bay DVD I just received, and this is one drive-in film that even the most ardent backseat lovers must have felt compelled to watch, much like THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 10 years later. Watch for a very young Dee Wallace as one of the besieged family members. There's also a rape scene that, while severely abbreviated, must have been a major shocker for its time. Normally, movie cannibals simply eat their victims. It's also interesting to watch who lives and who dies. This does not follow the hard and fast rules of many similar films, and at least one of the deaths comes along so suddenly and in such a cruel manner, it is hard to believe that it even happened. There's also an imperiled infant, which had to be a first in its time. Craven was at the top of his game with this one. A must-see, and much copied, most recently by WRONG TURN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nuclear Families</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Carter family are on their way to California, but take a detour through a nuclear blasted desert in search of a family silver mine. When a freak accident causes them to crash their car, the Carter's - Bob &amp; Ethel, their children Lynne, Brenda and Bobby, Lynne's husband Doug and their baby Katy - are stranded in the middle of nowhere...but they are not alone. Little do they know that the rocky wasteland is inhabited by another, very different family. Papa Jupiter is the head of a cannibal family who live in the desert hills, and he and his vicious sons - the sadistic Mars, the deformed Pluto and the simpleton Mercury - are already plotting the deaths of the Carters in order to replenish their food supply. Bob and Doug wander off into the desert, searching for help, leaving the women and children behind. As night falls, Bobby Carter grows increasingly alarmed. The family dogs are restless and spooked, and the bitch Beauty turns up dead, horribly gutted. Heavy breathing can be heard on the CB they are using to call for help. When father Bob is discovered, crucified and burned alive, it is already too late. Mars and Pluto have descended upon the trailer, raping Brenda, killing Lynne and Ethel and stealing baby Katy away. However, when the sun finally comes up, the Carter's have ceased to be victims. Brenda, Bobby and Doug turn as savage as their tormentors, setting traps and giving chase into the hills to retrieve baby Katy and have bloody revenge upon Jupiter and his sons. Loosely based upon the case of Scottish cannibal Sawney Bean and his outlaw family, The Hills Have Eyes is similar to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but not quite as good. That's not to say it's bad - it's a great, tense, atmospheric and brutal movie, though not as brutal as it could have been considering Craven's previous film The Last House on the Left. The attack on the trailer and the rape/ murder of the women is a difficult scene to watch, but it's also enormously satisfying to see Brenda recover and ruthlessly take charge, plotting a clever trap for Jupiter. Likewise, cannibal family daughter Ruby also emerges as a heroine of strength and resourcefulness. For a film made in 1977, The Hills Have Eyes really is a woman's lib horror movie. It may move too slowly for some, and admittedly some of Brenda's screaming got on my nerves, but all in all this is a great movie for its time. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this one of director Wes Craven's best or worse? It has genuine cult following credentials and helps make Michael Berryman one of the most recognized faces in the horror genre. A retired detective from Cleveland, Big Bob Carter(Russ Grieve)and his extended family are on vacation and on their way to California, they decide to go off road looking for an inherited silver mine. Of course, their car and trailer breaks down in desert wilderness and are soon the target of a cannibalistic family hell-bent on murder. Berryman plays Pluto, one of the more aggressively violent savages. Other cast standouts: Virginia Vincent, Janus Blythe and a very young Dee Wallace-Stone. Producer Peter Locke is seen in a couple of scenes as one of the raging hill dwellers. Late, late night viewing recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Drive-In Horror at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes has been one of my favorites ever since I first watched it four years ago. I've always been a fan of that brand of 1970s slasher where a group of normal people has to fight for their lives against a cannibalistic family. I'm not sure why, maybe because they always tend to be very gritty and violent, plus they give you more than one killer and the killer family tends to get more characterization than your standard slasher villain. It could also have something to do with the fact that both sides are literally fighting for their lives. Think about it, while the Carter family is fighting for survival, Jupiter's clan is killing to eat. Certain members of the family get a little sadistic pleasure out of the murders, but at the root of it all they are killing to feed.The actors all play their parts well. No one in the Carter clan stands out as being excellent, but no one drops the ball either. Michael Berryman shows how he became a cult icon out of this role, but again no one else from Jupiter's tribe stands out as being Oscar worthy, yet they all play their parts well enough to be scary as hell.Another thing that has helped set The Hills Have Eyes apart from most of its genre brethren is the inclusion of four of the more intense moments in horror films. The first scene occurs when the family finds Big Bob burnt to a crisp after Jupiter kills him. It's not so much the brutality of the death, but how the Ethel reacts to seeing her husband of 25 years barbecued. The most intense scene of the film is when Brenda is attacked by Mars and has the gun fired off in her mouth, only to find out that it was out of bullets. Just think about that, someone forces a gun into your mouth, fires it and the only thing that has kept you alive is that the assailant decided to shoot your sister twice instead of just once. Another scene that really hit me the first time around was when Bobby and Brenda struggle to come to grips with using their mother as the bait for their booby trap. It didn't get me as much this time, but I had no clue what kind of trap they were setting the first time around so I was getting pretty nervous when Jupiter walked up to her. The final scene that really stands out to me is the death of Mars. I suppose it isn't even close to being the most brutal murder ever captured on film, but it's the transformation that occurs within Doug for that brief moment in time. Doug is set up as a kind and peaceful man, but it shows what some are willing to do when put up against the most extraordinary circumstances. Oh yes, it all comes back to the primal nature of the film.Overall, The Hills Have Eyes is a fantastic film if you are into 70s drive-in horrors. I have never understood why The Hills Have Eyes is grouped into the exploitation sub genre. It does have some brutality and gore, like exploitation films, but it's no more brutal or graphic than most slashers of its time. Sure, two of the family members sexually assault Brenda, but her attack isn't even remotely graphic and the film contains no nudity what so ever. I was always under the assumption that exploitation films were more about the nudity than the violence. Or when they are about violence, they amp it up to the degree of simulated snuff, films like those in the Guinea Pig and Faces of Death series.MY GRADE: A ... 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horrible movie.I rented this a week before going to see the theatrical remake of 'The Hills Have Eyes' in theaters, I have come to the conclusion that with the exception of one movie (A Nightmare on Elm Street), Wes Craven cannot make a movie to save his life. Let's start with the story (OOH OOH SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT). For those of you haven't already seen the movie, don't read past this point... Okay. The story starts off with a family in some desert going somewhere they stop at a diner in the middle of nowhere and meet up with a hillbilly. The hillbilly talks with them for the longest time and then finally tells them to go somewhere. Here's my first gripe with this movie, it's way too long and way too talky. Every other scene is Johnny or Billy or Susie talking about how the roast is doing in the oven... UGH! Onward and downward with this mess of a 'film...' Long story short, family meets up with a bunch of inbred hicks living in the mountains who want to eat them and so they have a big chase scene and the wimpy guy stabs the ugly guy to death... THE END! Seriously, that's how the movie ends, there's no ending. I don't know whether it was a joke, or if Craven ran out ideas or what, but it's like... "Stab Stab, Stab, Stab Stab Stab!" THE END!I'll be totally honest with you, there are three reasons I hate this movie...1. "Beauty!" (Kid in Short Shorts.) 2. Poor Film Quality 3. No Ending.That's it. That's the review, like the movie, it has no ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Wes Craven had retired after the double punch of 'The Last House On The Left' and 'The Hills Have Eyes' he would be a horror legend. Unfortunately he didn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's 'The Last House On The Left' is a horror milestone. It's a very crude and uneven movie, but still for me a very powerful one. It contains some scenes that are still extremely intense and disturbing, and that have rarely if ever been surpassed in subsequent horror movies. I don't known if Craven is embarrassed by it or what, but he seems to have distanced himself from it in his subsequent career. He went on to make several movies that were much more commercially successful, but were a lot tamer and much more viewer friendly. 'The Hills Have Eyes' is almost a transitional movie, the beginning of the slow journey from "old" Craven to "new" Craven. Compared to 'Last House...' it's a walk in the park, but alongside say the 'Scream' trilogy it looks the Manson family's home movies! Craven was still working with a very low budget compared to the mainstream, but for him it was a big step forward from 'Last House...' the results are not as shocking and confronting but it's a lot more consistent and technically more efficient, so I can understand why some horror buffs regard this as his best movie. Personally I find it difficult to choose between the two. The story concerns a family on a road trip looking for a silver mine they have acquired. There's Dad (Russ Grieve) a retired cop, Mom (Virginia Vincent), and three kids - Brenda (Susan Lanier), Bobby (Robert Houston) and Lynne (Dee Wallace). Also along for the ride is Lynne's husband Doug (Martin Speer) and their baby. Despite warnings from a local old coot (John Steadman) they stray from the main road and soon find themselves stranded in the desert. Little do they know that Jupiter (James Whitworth) and his cannibalistic clan, which includes sons Mars (Lance Gordon) and Pluto (Michael Berryman) have sniffed them out and are miiiighty hungry! Craven manages to create a lot of tension in this movie, the "normal" family are realistic and convincing, especially when things begin to fall apart, and Jupiter, Mars and Pluto are three fantastic baddies. Michael Berryman really capitalizes on his naturally odd looks (the results of multiple birth defects), and steals every scene he's in. Of all the cast Dee Wallace went on to the highest profile career ('The Howling', 'Critters', 'E.T.' etc.), but this movie made Berryman into a horror icon. James Whitworth is also terrific, and Lance Gordon gets THE line of the movie ("Baby's fat. You're fat... fat and juicy."), but Berryman outshines them both in the same way that Krug (David Hess) dominates his gang in 'Last House...' I like this movie a lot. I don't think it's as impressive as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' or 'Dawn Of The Dead', but it still deserves a place among the best of 1970s American horror, and should be watched by anyone with an interest in the genre. If Craven had retired after the double punch of 'The Last House On The Left' and 'The Hills Have Eyes' he would be a horror legend. Unfortunately he didn't, and went on to be involved in some very lame movies (especially the sequel to this which should be AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS!) This decision has obviously proved to be very financially rewarding for him, but it is one that will forever divide horror movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The nuclear family versus their savage desert cousins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A retired policeman &amp; his extended family are driving through the desert to investigate an old silver mine that was bequeathed to them as a wedding gift when they unwisely decide to take a detour on an unmarked road ? into an area designated as an Air Force gunnery range &amp; therefore not meant for the public. Buzzed off the road by a fighter jet, the family's car suffers a broken axle. Stranded in the desert with no means of rescue, the family find themselves prey for a clan of crazed cannibals living in the area.Wes Craven is one of the horror genre's leading lights, a director who is known primarily for the recent Scream series &amp; inventing one of the genre's most popular monsters ? pizza-faced, razor gloved child molesting ghost Freddy Kruger. But most of today's young fans probably don't know that Craven started his career making brutal revenge thrillers like his debut Last House on the Left.The Hills Have Eyes is Craven's second film &amp; a sort of remount of Last House on the Left but with considerably more skill &amp; finesse. I was never much of a fan of Last House ? the concept was good on paper but the execution of the idea left a sour taste in my mouth. With The Hills Have Eyes, Craven made what was probably his first true classic.The film is a continuation of the basic idea that Wes Craven first made in his previous film ? the brutal savaging of the 'flower power' generation &amp; the hippies by their brutal cousins, in this case a family of crazed cannibals living in an Air Force gunnery range &amp; picking off anyone unlucky enough to cross their path. The whole film has the protagonists ? a retired policeman &amp; his liberal children ? brutally attacked &amp; decimated by the cannibals, whose origins can be put down to their patriarch (there is a creepy scene where the old man makes an emotional confession about his devil of a son &amp; how he was banished to the desert to start a family of cannibals). From then on, it's a battle to the death where the two families take on each other for survival, leaving little mercy.Craven's best works had a kind of rubber reality where the realm could change with very little regard for logic. True enough, The Hills Have Eyes has some of this in it ? the desert can be seen as a strange place that normal people cannot exist in &amp; that savagery is the name of the game. The actors do a good job &amp; there are some disturbing scenes (as the owner of a pet bird, I found the scene where a cannibal snaps a canary's head off for a quick snack quite brutal).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutal film; one that shall not be taken lightly, and certainly not one that has enough raw craft to be a "good" horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of ****Wes Craven's entry into fight-for-survival horror, "The Hills Have Eyes", is a somewhat respectable film that is alas all dressed up with nowhere to go. I do not get why I didn't enjoy it all that much. The film was fairly entertaining, and it even had the right amount of humans vs. mutants action. This is all-together a somewhat well crafted horror film, but at last it's a bit too focused on the sadistic nature of its antagonists. This prevents it from being a riveting horror film; a frightening chiller. It has not aged well; and I don't assume that it was ever considered a masterpiece of horror. Wes Craven is a man who I believe will always be a master of horror, if not only for "A Nightmare on Elm Street". The only problem is that "The Hills Have Eyes" makes me wonder just how far Wes Craven will go with his style. Here's a film that could have worked a little better if it hadn't been so drenched in blood and seemingly faux intensity. In the end, it just doesn't feel like the thrilling film that it wants to be. It's decent for a little extremely forgettable entertainment, but then again it's not consistently worth the viewing. Sure, it has its lengthy moments of amusement, but anything else is just boring. The characters are cliché, the story is cliché, and just about everything else is cliché. On the bright side, the production design is brilliant and the film looks mighty fine. The trouble is that besides being visually interesting, "The Hills Have Eyes" just didn't do for me what it did to others. It's a cult horror film, no doubt; and it's also a cult horror film that I just didn't like. However, I can respect those who do. It could strike people as cheesy fun. For others, it may have aged well. But to me, it has not aged at all; or at least not particularly well. Overall I'd give it a skip, but since it's somewhat well-made and since I understand Craven's intentions as a director, I will not discourage you from seeing it. I'd be delighted to hear what other people think of Craven's 70's horror bloodbath. There will be those who enjoy it and those who will forget it. I'm one of those people who is just ready to forget it; although at least I can forget it for being the kind of film that you just have to kind of take as you will. It's not bad; but it's by no means good (if you were to ask me). It will none the less appeal to 50% of the audience that it attempts to reach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good horror film which holds up surprisingly well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get the bad points out of the way: The movie is less interesting following the attack on the trailer, the mutant family look a bit silly rather than scary, as can only be expected there is no cinematography of note, and there are some cringe-worthy lines.That said, Wes Craven's sophomore effort "The Hills Have Eyes", quite surprisingly, holds up quite well in 2008, not that the horror genre has made amazing advances since 1977 in any case. The story, hardly original although in 1977 was certainly far less commonly used than it has been since, involves a mutant cannibalistic family doing mutant cannibalistic family things. The story is mildly plausible, more than more supernatural horror stories, and is reportedly based loosely on the Sawney Bean story (real-life clan who killed and cannibalized over 40 people in 16th Century Scotland. The film, as a result, feels more realistic and hence more engaging. The low budget atmosphere and filming lends itself well to the story, at times giving it an almost documentary-like edge, and suiting the brutality of the mutants' actions (Aja's remake, professionally-filmed and edited with MTV-era sensibilities, feels far more removed from reality).The film gets no real points for originality, despite being relatively unique at the time, as it follows a simplistic horror movie pattern. Wes Craven, a director I believe possesses quite a lot of talent (not always put to use, of course), handles the setup and the main set-pieces of the film extremely well though, building suspense and an atmosphere of menace very well before delivering the first big scene of the movie: the attack on the trailer, which outside of a couple of silly moments is a really convincing and engaging horror set-piece.The film ends on a natural note and is effective as a whole. "The Hills Have Eyes" works purely as a disposable 90-minute thriller in spite of its flaws, and Susan Lanier is nice to look at, so you'll never be completely bored.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Hills Have Eyes we fallow a family who are on a road trip to California. Along the way their cars pulls off the road and breaks down in the middle of the desert. Soon after that they are being haunted and slowly killed off by the Planet family. A group of mutated individuals who live uncivilized in the hills of the desert. While the family is being tormented by these cannibals they come up with ways to fight back and defend themselves in hope of surviving and saving the ones they love most. When I look back at it the plot and overall idea was pretty original for its time. We've seen other films similar to it but it doesn't have the same approach or message in the end. The Hills Have Eyes is a different kind of horror film. Using suspense to shock an audience and it does a great job of that. When the film was first rated it received an X rating. It wasn't as much of the blood and gore but the suspense that caused it to receive an X. It's the suspense and music which make it seem realistic, horrifying and tragic in some parts. It's not as strong or as edgy as Last House on the Left, but it's damn near close.The film has a fair amount of blood but very little gore. This is mostly due to the films low budget. In this movie we are introduced to a great cast of actors. It's surprising to hear what these actors had to go through, filming out in the desert running around in the rocks and having to withstand all the cold nights. I thought the acting was great, it made the look and feel of the movie realistic and it really caught my attention seeing all these different characters trying to handle all of these violent situations. As the film progresses you'll notice a change in some of the characteristics of the people in the film. Half of the characters in this movie are normal and the other half are well, different. I thought they did a pretty good job casting actors who were odd looking but very warm spirited groups of people. This helped out especially with the films low budget. Normally you would take an actor and sit them down on a makeup chair to give them a less than normal look, but they just couldn't do that with this movie. So instead we are treated with natural and great on screen performances by Lance Gordon, Michael Berryman, Janus Blythe, Cordy Clark, Brenda Marinoff and a cameo by producer Peter Locke.If the film had a bigger budget you can just imagine how much more they could have done with the look of the characters. What impressed me the most about this was its overall message about civilization. You ever notice not just in films but also in real life that people will go out of their way to do whatever they can to protect a loved one? I think that aspect is greatly shown in this film. Not only does the family in this picture fight back but you start to see a turn, or switch between the character roles. Eventually the hunters become the hunted and with the ending it showed you that the most civilized can be the most savage. Although I did like the message in the ending I thought the film could have went on a little longer. The movie just seemed to end very fast and when it did end I was puzzled saying to myself "is that it?". I thought the ending could have been longer or at least included some more scenes to show what happens later with the characters who survived.Overall I thought the Hills Have Eyes was a good movie. It's a horror classic which relies on it's suspense to terrify an audience. For me the films setbacks were with the budget. It would have been nice to see more blood and gore, and even a better look with some of the characters. I also thought that there could have been much more to the ending. Those were my only real big problems with the film. Other than that I loved the story and cast of characters. The acting is good and the suspense is well done, especially with the films music. This is a horror film that I will always remember and enjoy watching. It's an old film but it's not all that outdated. I was most impressed with the story and message about civilization. For me the good definitely out weighs the bad and I had a good time watching the Hills Have Eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craven's best, hands down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm usually not a big fan of Craven's films, but this one was great! I really liked the simple plot, they did a lot with it and made it a lot more original than it sounds. The cannibals were great characters, hilarious at times and down right scary at others. Until near the end I didn't particularly care for the "normal" family, but even they became decent characters eventually. Oh, and how could I not mention Beast? That dog was incredible, he was like the Littlest Hobo on steroids. If treated differently this could have been a cheesy and forgettable movie, but it was creepy and memorable thanks largely to Craven's direction. Too bad he couldn't stay this good forever...8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On their way to California, the Carter Family stop off at a gas station to ask for directions to a silver mine, but the old guy tries to warn them away from taking a detour off the main road. Big Bob decides to take the back road anyway, only to have an car accident when a rabbit gets in the way. Unknowingly they are stranded in a barren environment and they're not alone. As they're being watched by a group of inbred cannibals led by Papa Jupiter. Who are waiting for their opportunity to pounce on their clueless victims.This is probably my favourite Wes Craven film, after initially being unsatisfied by it on my first viewing. Honestly, I was probably expecting way too much from it, but suddenly now it's kinda grown on me. After seeing the just-as-good remake last week, I just felt the need to give it another spin. After making the pretty harsh exploitation flick "Last House on the Left", Craven came up with another beauty of a low-grade shocker that when the "you know what" hits the fan, there's no time to ask questions in this brutally, raw gauntlet of survival. We're effectively manipulated into this harrowing situation because the characters seem real enough, even though the idea might be far-fetched. After the camper van attack Craven's direction never lets up by providing one adrenaline packed climax after another until it reaches boiling point with a freeze frame ending. I see a lot people complain about the ending, but it didn't bother me at all. Does everything have to be wrapped up? Actually, I thought it was rather clean-cut. The barren location was ideally daunting with an unsparing quality of those encroaching hills. There's just claustrophobic build up from the nauseatingly, moody camera-work. The grainy look gives out an authentic feel that takes hold and maroons you along with the family. When it came to the violence, it's not overly explicit or realistic, but it gets down and dirty with a unyielding energy pumping through the veins. What also made it more uncomfortable was the foreboding electronic score and unnerving sound effects of the hissing wind and the cannibals daunting their hapless victims. While, it might take some time before the calculated mayhem unfolds into hysteria. You can't help but get caught up eerie shades of the swirling helplessness the family encounters, as you know what's coming. The pacing to begin with is slow, but it gives us time with the family prior to the rapidly unexpected change. The screenplay plays it simple and it works out incredibly well with some great shock moments and by keeping the audience in a state of mind, where they're not quite sure how things are going to work out. It feels like there's one hopeless situation after another making it hard to figure just who, if any get will get out alive. There's even some sort of structure in the plot touching on the social commentary of civilized vs. uncivilised. Were it questions the idea just how civilized are we when it gels the two sides together, by making the victims resort back to their primal instincts to overcome their plight. Which, for these wild people it's a way of life. The suspenseful climaxes messes around with the idea rather successfully.The performances are modest, if a little one-note, but it's the family of vile, but highly organised cannibals who take the honours as the most interesting and believable developments. Led by Michael Berryman as Pluto and James Whitworth as the ferocious Papa Jupiter. Those two performances just stick in mind and they steal most of the shots. The suburban family provides a variety templates without resorting to any sort of redundantly shallow progress and there's some nicely added sardonic wit amongst them. Russ Grieve comes to the forefront as the father Big Bob and Dee Wallace gives her character Lynn some fight. Susan Lanier is excellent in her portrayal as the traumatized Brenda. But it's the family canines that make a name for themselves here. Especially Beast the German Shepard, who at times takes it upon himself to take up the challenge and deliver the goods."The Hills Have Eyes" is one of Craven's most ambitious and emotionally charged projects, well that's before he hit gold with some mainstream horror franchises. It's a tense and rather edgy production that exploits our fears of our brutal nature impeccably well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family driving to a new life in California find themselves stranded in the desert when their vehicle breaks down.However their troubles are just beginning when they find themselves being stalked by a family of cannibalistic outcasts. Without going into major details the father gets crucified and blown up,two of the women get shot,one gets raped,one of the dogs gets gutted and the baby gets taken for a cannibalistic feast.It is when the baby gets taken the remaining family members fight back. This is an early Wes Craven film that lacks the brutality of "The last house on the left" but still has its disturbing moments;when the father gets tortured and the dismemberment of the dog which isn't seen happening but leaves a lasting feeling of revulsion. This is what i call a cat and mouse movie where the tables are turned and the hunted become the hunters and get their revenge on their oppressors The only problem with the film was the abrupt ending which left the audience with a lot of unanswered questions.However this is still a class craven movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craven's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- A fairly typical family is traveling through the desert when their car runs off the road and breaks an axle. They find themselves stranded in an isolated, hot, and dry area near some rock-strewn, menacing looking hills. As it would happen, the hills are home to an equally menacing looking band of cannibals. The family must endure a night from hell as they fight to stay alive. Will they all make it? - This is easily my favorite horror movies that Wes Craven has made. It's much more enjoyable as an entertainment vehicle than his previous work, The Last House on the Left (I will never understand how anyone say that they find The Last House on the Left quality entertainment), but it's not as safe as the family-friendly, quote-ready horror he would later make. I often use the same adjectives to describe The Hills Have Eyes that I use when describing The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) - raw, savage, brutal, and unrelenting. The people in the hills don't think or act like you and I. They're quite capable of anything and prove that throughout the night with their attacks on the family. Rape, murder, and kidnap are all they know and the only way they know to survive. You get the feeling throughout the movie that anyone could die.- I'll admit that some of the acting is less than good. Virginia Vincent plays the stranded mother and delivers some lines in the most unintentionally hysterical manner. On the other end of the spectrum is Susan Lanier. Her portrayal of the frightened Brenda Carter is very realistic and adds a degree of authenticity to the film. I've often compared her performance to that of Marilyn Burns in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Portraying a frightened character with all of the screaming involved cannot be an easy thing to do.- The Hills Have Eyes explores some of the same themes that Craven covered in The Last House on the Left. That is, who are the civilized and who are the savages? How much and how long does it take for a normal person to be reduced the same level as their attackers? It's an interesting idea that would require a better understanding of psychology than I have.- The Region 1 DVD from Anchor Bay is a must have for any fan of this movie. Having seen The Hills Have Eyes repeatedly at midnight movies in the early 80s, I didn't think the movie could look this good. It's not perfect, but it is so superior to any other transfer I've seen. The DVD is loaded with features, including a very informative commentary from Craven and the producer, Peter Locke, and a "making of" documentary that runs almost one hour. It's one of the best SEs that I own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It gave me nightmares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But I don't live on Elm Street so I'm okay. Still, I didn't find this to be particularly scary or anything. I haven't seen Wes Craven's Last House On The Left but it seems to be in the same sort of documentary/amateur horror genre. It does look very novice and it's far from Craven's best work but it is slightly interesting.Plus, I have no clue what all the fuss is about regarding the shock and gore. There is hardly one spot of blood in this movie and I just finished watching the uncut version. Horror and gore is implied but never really shown or excessively displayed.I kind of felt that the character of Pluto was quite sympathetic even tho he was one of the bad guys. I felt sorry for him when the dog bit him. But none of the other characters provoked anything out of me. They were just either dull or stupid and not even in a typical horror movie way. Wes Craven kind of shoots himself in the foot by limited the possibilities early on, resulting in a movie with an annoyingly abrupt ending and no subtext or subliminal quality whatsoever. It works perfectly as a Drive-In movie but as a horror it's weaker than a twentieth-time-around tea-bag.The DVD sports a truly dodgy looking 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1 that fails to impress at all and a bunch of features, including Audio commentary from director Wes Craven and producer Peter Locke, An all-new featurette featuring Wes Craven, Peter Locke, Janus Blythe, Susan Lanier, Dee Wallace, Michael Berryman and cinematographer Eric Saarinen, 'The American Nightmare' documentary (directed by Adam Simon and is actually really good), Stills gallery, TV spots, Trailers.I guess if you're a fan then it is a must buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the remake instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen parts of 'The Hills have Eyes' on TV, I was very excited to find this movie in the bargain sales department. I remembered the movie to be very grim and raw, but with bright colours and bizarre landscapes. Something you'd maybe rather not watch because of its harsh realistic scenes of raw and indiscriminate violence and hellish freak characters.As soon as I started the movie, I discovered that this was the original version and not the remake that I had in my mind. Quite a disappointment I must say. It is a rather mild and clumsy freak show, and the good guys and girls are not really believable in their behaviour. I should've been warned when I saw that Wes Craven directed this one.The splatter scenes are done in a very effortless way; especially the dog scenes where you'll never see the face of the man and the dog biting him at the same time. So yeah, one is constantly aware of the fact that you're watching something that has been 'manipulated', consequently not totally sucked into something 'real'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes is one of the earlier movies directed by the creator of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, Wes Craven. How this film was ever given the title as a "horror classic" is beyond me. It's really not that good of a film. Psycho, the Exorcist, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street; those are horror classics. This film just isn't scary. When the "monsters" in a film are borderline retards, it is a little hard to get scared.Don't get me wrong, this film has some good scenes. When the "cannibal family" goes to take over the camper I was into it. However, the stuff before and after that was very mediocre. The latter part of the film was almost like a cat and mouse chase between the "good" family and the "bad" family. Bottom Line: It's not a classic. It's not scary. Don't waste your time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For once, the remake is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unusually, this is one film that I ended up watching long after I've already seen the remake; I always try to see the original films first but this Wes Craven chiller slipped me by. Sadly, I was left feeling disappointed and let down once it was over, mainly because the remake is, surprisingly, superior in every way: the actors are better, the gore better, the direction better, and the music better. The remake also sticks VERY closely to the plot of this film, so all of the surprises and twists were well choreographed in advance and there was little to intrigue me here.For a '70s horror film, it's not a bad effort: there are some good chills and the film makes a horror star out of Michael Berryman, the bald bad guy who traded on his appearance here for the rest of his career. The problem is that the low budget hurts the proceedings somewhat, with the rest of the cannibal family resembling hippies rather than mutants. Despite the savagery of their actions, they end up laughable instead of frightening. Another problem is Craven's direction ? it feels insipid rather than inspired and in light of Alexandre Aja's excellent job on the remake, I can't help but feel it's lacking. Some of the cast don't help, with Susan Lanier standing out as one of the most irritating screamers in horror history (the dog's great, though). Back in the day, THE HILLS HAVE EYES was a shocking and depraved horror flick; today it's a dated intrigue that doesn't stand up alongside fellow '70s movies like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It's okay but I'd recommend the remake over this any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You folks. Stay on the main road now you hear!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having announced himself to the horror hordes with The Last House on the Left, Craven's next horror pick would be this, The Hills Have Eyes, another slab of grit and grime. A nuclear family head across the desert in their giant trailer only to break down and find there's beasties in the hills hungry for their blood.It has become very much a popular cult pic with Craven fans, which is understandable given the brisk pacing, moments of intensity and suspense, while the allegories and messages are smartly inserted. But the low budget does affect the product, it looks cheap and renders much of the violence and sexual aspects (implied or otherwise) as being not very frightening or stomach churning. While some of the acting is very poor, further adding a cartoonish feel to what should have been a nerve shredding experience.Above average for sure, but not the masterpiece some would have you believe. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Baby's fat. YOU fat. Fat and juicy."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer / director Wes Craven's gripping, visceral thriller has an undeniable immediacy. The viewers feel swept into the action themselves, and it always has an incredible raw power; it's the kind of thing from which one can't look away even if they want to. It pits one family against another in a remote, forbidding rural environment that is utterly convincing. The protagonists are city slickers, on their way to California but stopping in the area - of no use to anybody but the Air Force and our antagonists - to check out a silver mine. Their car and trailer break down and they're rather ill prepared for what follows, as a brutal pack of savages emerge from the nearby hills and put their victims through a series of nightmarish incidents. "The Hills Have Eyes" is one movie that truly lives up to the words "grim" and "gritty". It's the low budget, and the authentic atmosphere, that make it such a compelling movie. Craven and company aren't afraid to go to some pretty dark places, and make no guarantees of anybody's safety - including a baby's. Also, the recurring movie theme of characters needing to get in touch with their primitive instincts in order to survive a horrible ordeal is vividly portrayed here. As the story plays out, we can see each side is ready to raise some serious Hell once the sanctity of their respective families is threatened. Things steadily go from bad to worse and the pacing simply picks up more and more throughout. Don Peake supplies a fairly spare music score that enhances the action but never overwhelms it. The art direction is by Robert Burns of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" fame and the effectively stark cinematography by Eric Saarinen. The acting is sound by this group of actors; distinctively featured Michael Berryman, beloved by fans of genre fare and B movies, makes for one Hell of a poster boy, and also instantly recognizable is Dee Wallace of such future favourites as "The Howling", "E.T.", and "Cujo". Hulking James Whitworth is particularly delicious as the maniacal Papa Jupiter; the cast also includes people like Russ Grieve as intimidating Big Bob Carter, Virginia Vincent ("I Want to Live!") as matriarch Ethel, John Steadman ("The Longest Yard" '74) as Fred the gas station proprietor, Robert Houston ("The Great American Girl Robbery") as Bobby, and producer Peter Locke, acting under a pseudonym, as Mercury. There are some brief bits of juicy gore, and some very amusing bits as well, and the big finish is a real corker. Watch this movie and you may very well realize the need to know what your "defensive capabilities" are at any given time. Fine entertainment all the way from its eerie opening credits to its unsettling fade-out. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I mentioned in my review of Aldo Lado's 1975 film "Night Train Murders," an Italian homage of Wes Craven's notorious "Last House on the Left," when I originally saw the Craven film, it struck me as an undeniably intense yet indefensibly repugnant affair, and I swore never to see it again. I have kept true to that promise, too, although I have a feeling that today, three decades and some hundreds of sick films later, I might be better prepared for the unsettling nastiness that that film dishes out. Craven's follow-up horror film of five years later, 1977's "The Hills Have Eyes," has never bothered me as much, somehow, although it is no less intense an affair. In the latter film, we meet a prototypical American family, the Carters: a retired mom and dad celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary; their three grown kids, son-in-law and infant grandson; and the two family dogs, Beauty and Beast. When the Carters' car and trailer break down in the wilds of the desert Southwest, however, they encounter a family that is NOT quite as prototypical: Jupiter, a mutant who had been born in 1929 and left to die 10 years later; his three sons (Mars, Mercury and Pluto); daughter Ruby (the "Marilyn Munster" of the clan); and kidnapped prostitute/wife. Oh...did I neglect to mention that decades of desert living has turned Jupiter's clan into scavenging cannibals, as well? And that those Carters sure do look mighty appetizing?Anyway, Craven's second horror film is inexpertly made (not that that signifies anything; so was George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead," one of the scariest pictures ever made!) but, like its predecessor, remarkably intense. The first half of the film builds tension nicely, and after the clan's initial attack and massacre--a truly nerve-wracking sequence--roughly halfway through, things just don't let up. This is visceral, brutal filmmaking, with no way for any viewer to predict who--if anyone--will survive. Jupiter's sons are a truly horrifying bunch, with perhaps Mars (Lance Gordon) being the worst of all. His line "Baby fat...you're fat...fat and juicy!" is absolutely bloodcurdling. That said, the cannibal family in Tobe Hooper's "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" (1974) strikes this viewer as being even more depraved and nightmarish. Interestingly, the Jupiter character did not become a mutant as a result of having been born near a nuclear testing range, as might have been expected; his birth predated those tests by over a decade. In a cast of relative "no-names," only Dee Wallace (here at the beginning of her psychotronic career) and Michael Berryman (as poster boy Pluto) might register as familiar, although the acting by the entire cast is better than adequate. This picture is a tad grainy looking, but don't blame the Anchor Bay DVD; this is most likely how it looked when it was pristine. It also features one of the best dog attack sequences you've ever witnessed, as well as one of the most startling fade-outs before the words "The End" pop up. Trust me, by that time, you'll feel as if you've been through a wringer....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senseless violence and plot with some tense parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's beyond me how this movie has been rated anything greater than a 7 and it's considered a cult classic. I just don't really see the point of this movie. Was it to scare me? Well... it wasn't really scary with all the "scares" being predictable and being the typical "gotcha!" scares. Also the majority of the 2nd part of the film is just needlessly bleak where you basically watch a family fruitlessly struggle against the cannibals and only until the last 1/2 hour does the film actually pick up.Well what I've said so far seems like I absolutely abhorred this move but there were some scenes that I found tense and actually sort of pulled me in and made me keep watching. Also some of the characters are pretty decent actors. There is also some interesting cinematography and some decent effects (Pluto's foot after being attacked by the dog). The last 1/2 hour had some pretty creative moments and was generally tense like the booby traps they set up for Jupiter. So I can say it was generally entertaining and somewhat worthy of spending a Saturday night.Now what I find wrong with this movie is that you don't really care about any of the characters since there is no development of them. There are a few parts where the movie seems abrupt and just suddenly cuts over something and you're left uncertain of whether it was intentionally done to build suspense or if the editor just got lazy (ie when Bobby falls down after discovering Beauty's corpse) and not to mention the joke of an ending where Craven was probably put into this sort of situation: "Craven." "Yeah?" "We're out of film." "Eh, can't afford any more let's just leave it without any closure and hopefully people will still like it because that makes it more 'cult'". The plot doesn't seem terribly different from a slightly altered version of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" which was released a few years before this movie. On the visual side, I was expecting the mutants to look well... MUTATED. Mars simply looks like a cross between a werewolf and Mr. Hyde from the 1930s with the only character truly resembling any sort of mutant was Berryman but he was already born like that.Maybe I'm being overtly harsh on this movie because I didn't watch it on release and it lost its impact on future generations. Don't get me wrong, I watch all kinds of old movies/shows and still enjoy them but this one just doesn't really have any "feel" to it especially when for most of the film you're watching a family being picked off and just watching things that are supposed to disgust you but they don't because you don't have much care about what's going to happen next. I found the film worked better in the implied/non-explicit parts (the story behind Jupiter) rather than the explicit parts (the dad being burnt alive). I'll just leave it off as this movie had a good concept but there isn't enough uniqueness, characterization, or general feel to make it outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes plots has your usual plot as something disastrous happens. To me it's more than a disaster, It's bloody tragic. A family's car breaks down in the middle of the desert and a Family of Cannibals who live in the Hills stalk and then kill them.Another one of Wes Craven's greats. After a Nightmare on Elm Street, this would have to be my 2nd favorite Wes Craven Film. This film has total suspense which leaves you in it, it's brutal and it even leaves you disturbed.I think Michael who played Pluto did an excellent job at the character, he was freaky and he always scared me every time he came back on screen.The 1977 Classic Hills Have Eyes is a great classic and trust me, watching this film twice or more (like I have) will always leave you disturbed. This film really has hills just looking at you.i don't think anything bad could be said about this fantastic Wes Craven film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run to...err...from the Hills.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Wes Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes," a family finds themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere and at the mercy of a blood-thirsty clan of mutant cannibals. Ultra-violence, booby-traps and other shenanigans ensue.In spite of its clumsy opening, the film gets going rather quickly, leaving not a single moment to spare. When things get bad for our unfortunate family, they get really bad, taking a grisly and gruesome turn for the worse. The overall tone is that all bets are off, and it's never clear just who will survive and who will meet an unfortunate and unpleasant demise. The acting (especially from the villains) is spotty at best (with a completely wasted Dee Wallace in tow) but the film doesn't succumb to that fact. As Wes Craven's second film (following up "The Last House on the Left"), it shows signs of the true genius that would give birth to "A Nightmare on Elm Street" with some interesting plot devices (a dog becoming a main character in the final act? Rock on!) striking visuals, an eerie setting (it's all about location, location, location) and an unrelenting mean streak.While time hasn't been too kind to the film ? being that it looks horribly dated now that a 2006 remake, directed by Alexandre Aja, turned out much better -- it's still a well-paced, gritty and grim affair that keeps you on your toes throughout its brief 86 minute running time. In a way, it's a film that was ahead of the curve and deserves to be seen by any and all genre fans as the iconic piece of horror movie history that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family's car, with trailer attached, breaks down while driving through a desert which turns out to be a nuclear testing site. It turns out a family of cannibals lives in the surrounding hills of this desert. What works right away is that the family feels like a real family and the atmosphere is believable. What happens is the head of the family starts walking to a gas station a few miles back which they stopped at before the car broke down. The cannibals surround the trailer and eventually kill members of the family. I won't say who dies. Anyway, there are some effective scenes here for sure with the way the movie is filmed and edited. The movie goes into the next morning where we see the cannibals in day light which may be a mistake. They go from scary to a bit silly and even thought the costumes were not very authentic looking and wondered if I was suddenly watching an episode of "Gilligans Island". The family dog could even show "Lasie" a thing or two on how to help a family. Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff here but did not find it to be as effective as many other viewers. Still a good film, just not as effective as Craven's earlier work, "The Last House on the Left". Worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining drive-in horror thriller that still delivers scares today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its best not to compare "The Hills Have Eyes" to Wes Craven's proceeding film "The Last House on the Left". That masterpiece was so disturbing it practically destroyed Craven's career, so he understandably had to tone it down a lot for his second chance "The Hills Have Eyes". If he hadn't made an easier second film, we wouldn't have seen the "Scream" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" series. Still, thats not to say this is a weak horror film. Its still remarkably frightening and brutal, with plenty of politically incorrect violence that makes me all the more shocked it was remade recently. Its free of the nihilism that signified "Last House on the Left", but its still a shocking horror film that undoubtedly left drive-in patrons satisfied.On a technical level, the film is merely decent. The acting is very uneven. Russ Greive and Virginia Vincent as the leaders of the nuclear family are both horrible to the point of being distracting. Fortunately, the rest of the cast (espescially the villains) do an adequate enough job. The characters aren't fleshed out like they were in "Last House on the Left", but this is more than understandable for reasons previously stated. Craven's direction keeps the film moving at a lightning quick pace. As a director, hes quite controversial in horror circles (some, including myself, find him largely overrated), but there's no denying he can stage an effective horror sequence. The biggest flaw with the film is the abrupt ending - you don't think its the climax and than the film just fades to the end credits. Still, "The Hills Have Eyes" is an entertaining horror film which still manages to frighten nowadays. Plus, who knew Eliot's mom from "ET" used to be so hot! (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the classic original that i know and love, this story is very fast paced, the story is tight, quick and to the point, with no wasted space on film, i love the gore, the guessing about who is going to die next, and in which way. I loved the two dogs in the movie,, didn't like Beauty getting killed but hey,, i loved the traps that the family did set for the Hill People at the end. i think Michael Berryman was wonderful in the movie,, all that makeup, you really couldn't tell that it was him. Wes Craven did a great job directing this movie,, this one really set the tone for all of the family slasher type movies that we are currently seeing now,, this along with the original Texas Chainsaw are two of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot more subtle than 'Last House On The Left'! Thanks Wes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people consider the remake to be the better of the two, but I argue that claim. One: Wes Craven is a genius. Two: Michael Berryman's performance is better than any of the killers in the remake, the guy intended to take Berrymans place in the remake (the dude with the pick axe in the beginning) looks an awful lot like Jason Voorhees without the hockey mask from Friday the 13th part 3 (check it out Friday fans). I have a personal crush for late seventies early eighties horror movies and this movie won my heart. Sure it's old school and everybody wants CGI effects and all that crap nowadays but take the time to watch this and enjoy the heritage of the horror film business from yonder. 10/10 this movie is in its original form and to deny this movie of a perfect grade is too much of an understatement. Check it out if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes is a 1977 horror film, directed by Wes Craven and starring Michael Berryman. Wes Craven has stated that the film was inspired by the Scottish legend of the "Sawney" Bean family.This film is also featured in ' The Evil Dead ' when Ash is in the basement there is a torn poster of it. In return to Sam Raimi Wes put The Evil Dead on the TV during A Nightmare On Elm Street.The thing that catches your eye most is the bold man on the front cover, but I've forgotten his name in the film, he is very good if you haven't seen it yet.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose that this film is rated higher than what I've given it, and at the time in which it was made, I'm sure it deserved much more than a 70%."The Hills Have Eyes" in it's original version is indeed far more enjoyable than it's re-make, which is... expected, I suppose. The idea of using a desperate and dying family in such a barren area as a desert was QUITE pleasing to me, and what I find even better is that the victims passing through the desert had an actual REASON to be there, unlike what you'd find in most horror films like this- the "bystanders" have no business being there/no relevant reason at all, and that's what's very unique about this one.It is indeed a classic. Wes Craven's come a long way. Kudos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second outing for the great Wes Craven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's second outing comes in the form of "The Hills Have Eyes" which has similar elements of "Last House On The Left". This is the movie that Wes Craven's directing career bounced back after all the flack "The Last House On The Left" caused and it's easy to see why because this film is effective in a story about a family attacked by a family of Cannibals and then they fight back. Although this movie doesn't have the same traumatic effect as his previous it still is in my eyes much better.The good things about this movie is that it still hits that raw nerve like not knowing which family member is gonna die or live, and although none of the deaths aren't paticually gory they're still pretty disturbing and you can see Wes Craven had more money invested in this movie, although it's very simple it still packs a punch.The acting is also very good in this movie as well Susan Lanier (Brenda) was great her screams sent shivers down my spine, Robert Houston plays the brother Bobby very well,Martin Speer (Doug) brought enough emotion to the part considering what happens to him. Dee Wallace-Stone (Lynne) does fine with what she has to do she radiates as always in her tragic role. Michael Berryman (Pluto) is just plain ugly here and it works, Janus Blythe (Ruby) was outstanding. In fact all members of both families played they're parts well.All in all a definite must see, but word of advice stay well clear of the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, my mistake was that I watched the 2006 version of the movie before 1977 version. Of course, this one is just a pure classic and, as I said before, a must see for every horror movies fan, but it looks so childish and mild after the new version of "Hills have eyes". Talking about the plot, I was surprised that both versions of the movie had almost identical plot, but....it was only in the beginning. Later it was quite different. Well, we have almost a stone age family living in a cave here instead of mutated from radiation monsters living in a New Mexico atomic explosions test polygon - village. And some of the villains itself is rather funny than scary in this version. There's less blood, scary moments, violence, all the characters is dressed hippie style etc. Well, generally speaking, you might be quite disappointed to watch 1977 version after you have seen 2006, as the new version is much better in almost every aspect. However, I strongly recommend it for all others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I re-watched this Wes Craven film recently, and I was surprised how I remembered it differently years ago. It's scary now, but it was so much more terrifying back then for some reason.It still has good scare moments and it's still extremely suspenseful. Not many horror films these sad days rely on suspense, as well as gore. This one has both. The scene where the dude smashes the window out of nowhere and grabs out the old gas station guy (I forget his name) is still shocking. ANd when Michael Berryman is in the trailer and tries to rape Ethel, I was cringing. It's really funny and scary at the same time. The actors are all good, especially Dee Wallace.The ending is really good, on a very high note. No formula wrap-ups here, thank you very much.What surprised me also was the short running length, I remembered it as longer than 89 minutes. It just flies by once it gets rolling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though his massive popularity came after the release of "Nightmare at Elom Street" the truth is that Wes Craven was already kind of popular among the b-series fans thanks to movies such as this one.The plot is pretty similar to the one in "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", with a mad family of murders lost somewhere in deep America. It is a pretty entertaining movie that keeps you alert for the first half hour, but after that everything seems to flag and gets a little reiterative.Anyway, it's a b-series classic and now that there in Hollywood they've made a remake of it's a nice opportunity to watch the original one.*My rate: 6/10</fullReview>

They Burn the father, shot the mother and one of the sisters, rapes the other one and kidnapped the baby. The survivors in the family decides to fight back. All the cannibals dies (except one of the cannibals survives. I specially like when Brenda and Bobby kills Jupiter. Brenda axes him in the back and Bobby shot him. This movie contains some good action, good horror suspense and of course the scary desert in the 70s.If you like Wes craven. This is the move you should see.</fullReview>

Little he knows, that a feral mutated cannibal family lives near there, and they are hungry for some flesh.If you ask me, that is a bit silly, yet still a very good premises for a horror film. There is no special effects apart of the mutant family's make-up, but even they do look rather realistic more than totally deformed group of monsters. the over-all appearance is definitely low-budget, but that doesn't effect the outcome, which is tight, well flowing piece of horror.Acting, even though isn't worth any prices, is appropriate for this type of film.

It starts out with a family going through the desert to get to their vacation spot, but when the car breaks down, a group of inbred, cannibal freaks attacks them looking for trouble. What I thought was really great about this movie was that it could feel so gross and gruesome, but not be gory. The acting in this movie is nothing above nor below average I think it is right in the middle. So i'm just gonna finish out by saying this movie is awesome!

		<fullReview>Having seen the UK trailer for the remakes of Was Craven's The Hills have Eyes I decided that it was about time that I watched the original 1977 version. Having only seeing a few other Was Craven film;, Nightmare on elm St part one and the Scream trilogy which to be honesty I wasn't to impressed by.The film centres around the Carter family who have been stranded in the middle of a nuclear test site, once dark falls the family are attacked by "mutants" who steal the Carter family baby.Having read the plot outline on the back of the DVD case I wasn't too sure wither this film would live up to it's "cult" statues. For ?3.50 I didn't get any special feature such as be hide the scenes footage but it turned out to be a very deal non the less.Unlike like some modern day horror were the audience has little or no "feeling" about the characters and what happens to them, The Hills have Eyes manages to make the audience have sympatric for the Carter family. The first 40 minutes of the film is quite slow but still manages to create a tense atmosphere that is sustained though out the course of the film.I was expecting a more graphic film but was pleased with the way in which Was Craven handled many of the scenes. The first time the "mutants" attack the Carter family is quite distressing to watch even though it wasn't particularly graphic, the sound of Lynne Wood being attacked was enough to shock the audience.The narrative was easy to follow but I did wonder weather the "mutants" were born that way or were they effected by the nuclear test site or even both but that doesn't take any thing away from this film.The end of the Hills have Eyes is brilliant, it doesn't give the audience a complete ending and lets them decide what happens to the remaining members of the Carter family.A highly recommended film that it well worth watch/owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget with a clever script. The brutality of humans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A deranged family of cannibals terrorize a typical American family for different reasons: surviving, and the pleasure of torturing. On their way to their vacations, our victims have a road accident and end up getting lost in the middle of nothing. Big Bob got scared too easily of a jet and a baby rabbit. The man had a big heart but didn't imagine that his family would end up in big danger. Now they are at the mercy of another family...not your typical American family I must say. Is it that the cannibals are just like wild animals and do not want to cause damage? Or is it that they just kill as a need?. Watch "The Hills Have Eyes" to witness how humans can become animals and how they can do anything to survive. I really like the plot of this movie. It's brutal and makes you wonder if it could happen to you and your family. Craven improved a lot and created a suspenseful, violent, raw movie. Those elements are covered perfectly by decent acting, an effective score, and a perfect, diabolical direction. The acting is not the best but it's comprehensive as it's a low budget movie. The characters are displayed in a manner that you can say there isn't acting at all. That way you can relate to them and later feel sorry for their fates. The villains are not likable. The actors just did a regular portrayal of serial killers but lacked of a heart to do it. In some parts the movie looked like a spoof but thanks to Craven's direction it stayed as a Horror movie. The events in the movie are breath taking and do not make space for interpretation. Violence just happens and it can't be stopped. The torture that most of the family members suffer is very cruel. Watch this movie to witness why it's so famous and everyone talks about it. You won't regret. It's a violent low budget movie but with a clever script. Not a masterpiece by any means! Not even Craven's best but still a very good Horror movie. This movie has generated a lot of controversy through the years. Why? Because it's Craven's 2nd. movie and also considered one of the most violent movies of all time. Does it lives up to the expectations? In my opinion it does it just half justice to it's fame. It's not as violent as many other exploitation movies. And I don't mean that violence is necessary in movies. The truth is that Craven created a great plot and crafted scary, violent situations. Craven shows the brutality of humans not caring if they come from the city or from the hills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot SynopsisWes Craven began his film career in 1971 co-directing Together, a soft core documentary with Sean S. Cunningham. Cunningham would later go on to produce and direct the original Friday The 13th in 1980. Craven made his feature film debut with the gruesome Last House On The Left, beginning a lasting affair with the horror genre. Craven then gained some morbid inspiration for his next film, The Hills Have Eyes.The Hills Have Eyes is loosely based on the Scottish legend of the Sawney Beane family. They were a clan of cave dwelling cannibals, consisting of a wife, six daughters and eight sons. Later came eighteen grandsons and fourteen granddaughters, all products of incest. In the early fourteen hundreds they robbed, murdered and devoured anyone that passed through their area in the East Lothian County. Their crimes continued for twenty five years until they were hunted down, captured and taken to Edinburgh. It was here that the family were all horrifically tortured and later executed.Craven's loose adaptation of the legend takes place in modern day America. The Carter family are a typical American family making their way through the desert, enroute to California. They are Bob and Ethel Carter (Russ Grieve and Virginia Vincent) together with their adult children, Bobby (Robert Houston), Brenda (Susan Lanier), Lynne (Dee Wallace-Stone), her husband Doug (Martin Speer) and their baby daughter.The family stops for fuel at a run down service station, run by a nervous old man, Fred (John Steadman). Fred is exceptionally anxious about something and is in the process of abandoning his business when they pull in. He tells the Carter family to stay on the main road and not to visit the old abandoned silver mine, as they had planned to do.Of course, the Carters don't take Fred's advice and end up running off the road. With the added weight of their caravan, the rear axle on the car snaps and leaves the family isolated and vulnerable in the barren landscape.As the family embark on an action plan to get help, they are totally unaware that the nearby hills have eyes. The stranded travellers are being watched by a family of savage outcasts who have an agenda of extreme violence and cannibalism.This tribe of rouges is led by the imposing father, Jupiter (James Whitworth). Mars (Lance Gordon) and Pluto (Michael Berryman) are the twisted and evil sons, hell-bent on causing mayhem and death. The adult daughter of the clan is the only shining light amongst them. Ruby (Janus Blythe) sees the evil and despair of living with the family and plans to escape. The film's producer, Peter Locke (credited as Arthur King), plays the small role of Mercury, another of the clan's evil offspring.The horror of the situation is soon apparent to the Carters as the primal fury of the clan is unleashed upon them. But this average family from suburbia can only take so much and plan their fight back. However, their fight for survival will require them to transform their homely personas into that of their attackers and use the same primitive cunning and savage violence to defeat them.We live in an era where seemingly no popular film from the past can escape the dreaded Hollywood re-make. A new film version of the The Hills Have Eyes is due for cinema release in March 2006. This new version is directed by Alexandre Aja, with Wes Craven and Peter Locke thankfully taking on roles as Producers.Wes Craven wrote and directed a sequel to The Hills Have Eyes in 1985, however The Hills Have Eyes - Part 2 failed to gain an enthusiastic audience and is far superior to the recent remake. 7/10</fullReview>

But anyway getting back to the review The Hills Have Eyes was amazingly done great acting, great gore, and one smart damn dog. Overall this movie is perfect surprisingly though I thought there was going to be a rape scene or at least some nudity but man surprisingly it was done well because we all know how us men love tits and ass. But Craven sets his history here. Helping Aja on the remake which changed some characters. Why did they not use Mars that was dumb I found. But the original is amazing and I loved it.

		<fullReview>Although this isn't my favourite horror film, it is still a damn good one. Made in 1977 on a budget of around $250,000, this is one of the most influential horror films made.The Carter family are driving cross-country. On the way they have an accident which leaves them stranded in the desert. Bob 'Big Bob' Carter goes to the gas station, while Doug goes to an army base. Bobby, Brenda, Ethel and Lynne stay back at the trailer. Unbeknownst to them, they are being watched by a family of inbred cannibals planning an attack. What follows is two families pit against each other in a struggle to survive.This was Wes Craven's second horror film following the controversial Last House on the Left. Even though this isn't as shocking and violent as it is let out to be (due to the censors forcing Craven to edit the more shocking bits out), it still has its moments which I found brutal. To all those worried, yes, there is rape, but it is not shown, just implied.The acting in this wasn't particularly great but the location was truly a good choice. It was beautiful, but creepy. The music, directing and FX are all good. This movie is also quite good at building tension and there's plenty of it in the now famous "trailer" scene.3?/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The modern master of mainstream horror gives us a taste of his early technique...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... One of the initial things that lets us know we're in the hands of an assured director is Craven's masterful use of silence in establishing the eerie build-up. The soundtrack throughout is mainly comprised of low ominous rumblings (apart from some ill-advised forays into '70's funk, somewhere within the midsection - if anybody has a reasonable explanation for that, let me know!!) and the sparse use of sound is a welcome alternative to most modern scores, which seem destined to telegraph every shock.Such minimalism also extends to the landscape photography on show; which has a bare, sterile feel that echoes later cinematic imaginings of a dystopian future-world. Ironic really, since the objective is to move away from sophisticated gadgetry and get back to basics. This is out-in the wilds stuff, but the bleak vision of a "Clockwork Orange"-style world still holds, because society has crumbled and morals are way out of whack.In a fitting twist, it's the 'beast' that's allowed to exact revenge too; hinting that in the final conflict, the real battle will be animalistic, with all those people who are too civilised left to die out. Technology fails them when they need it most; so they have to rely more and more on reverting back to primitive nature, where the most useful weapons are axe, fire and stone...It's rough and ready, no doubt; but if you like your films to appeal to the caveman rather than the culture-vulture, give it a try... !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Hills Have Eyes' is a far superior film to Wes Craven's previous drive-in exploitation flick, 'Last House on the Left'. This time round, he makes an effort to create a coherent storyline, more rounded characters, and a sense of real tension and suspense. He's aided by a far more competent cast, most of whom are capable of delivering actual performances.The movie starts out great, with a mysterious and ambiguous meeting between Ruby and the owner of the old Gas Station. When the all-American show up, asking for directions, the tension is masterfully built. Once the trailer goes off the road, however, things come to a grinding halt ? characters behave in unrealistic ways, run off recklessly into the night, and take implausible risks. The hill-dwelling crazies seem to take an incredibly long time to make an appearance, and waiting for them, rather than drawing out the suspense, actually kills it, and the film descends into tedium.The last third of the movie, after the attack on the trailer, restores some balance to things, with some genuine excitement generated. But for me, at least, it was too little, too late.For a horror movie, and a Craven horror movie at that, there are surprisingly few scares and the gore is of the ketchup variety. A highlight is the work of Robert Burns, who created such memorable sets for 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre', here working similar magic on an equally tight budget, creating a believably sun-dried rottenness to the locations.An okay movie, containing a suitable sense of dread and menace in the sun-bleached mountains, but far from great. 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is still seven years away, and it shows.</fullReview>

Stranded, they are soon the target of a family of cannibals, murderers, and rapists. With three of them dead and the baby kidnapped, the three remaining survivors decide to take revenge.my thoughts: Seeing this film was a real treat. I went to the Palace Theatre in Syracuse where they were showing both the 1977 and 2006 versions of THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and Michael Berryman was there signing autographs. I met Michael Berryman, who plays Pluto in this film. He is a great guy, I also got a free t-shirt and poster in the process. Then, I finally watched the films. I'll review the 2006 version next.Although a bit slow-paced, this film pulled me in from the beginning. I knew with it coming from Wes Craven and starring such great actors as Michael Berryman and Dee Wallace-Stone, I was in for a treat. There are some flaws. Robert Houston (who plays the cute teenage Bobby) has some dumb reactions to things. With some of his family dead, he could have showed some more sympathy. The deaths are also brutal and shocking, and there is an off screen rape. Even though it was off screen, it was still pretty disturbing.Susan Lanier is a great lead as the cute, blonde but slightly annoying Brenda, and the rest of the cast holds their own as well. Michael Berryman, in particular, was creepy as was the rest of his character's family.It was great seeing this with Berryman there, he did some commentary but not too much. He just once in a while threw in some information and jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early "loonies in the boonies" antics....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched this on video last night and then spent much of today shoveling snow after the biggest blizzard in these parts in a decade, I'm thinking the desert sounds pretty appealing right about now, so it takes an effort to recall that in cinema it's inevitably a spooky realm (not just in America, as "Wolf Creek" recently reminded us). "Why would people want to live out there by themselves? They must be up to no good!" "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" established the more or less permanent pattern for this (never mind that it was based on Ed Gein, a Wisconsin farm boy who never saw the desert in his life, nor even ever left Wisconsin). When Wes Craven took a crack at it, he'd already made "Last House on the Left," his Hippie updating of Bergman's "Virgin Spring," already demonstrating one of his chief traits: a pretty wide and wholly humorless mean streak. In "Hills" he adds another one: tension dissolving into slapstick violence. Although he's always been associated with horror, one senses his heart isn't really in it; in "New Nightmare" he even played himself slagging the genre. His recent "Red Eye" was straight-up action shot through with his beloved meanness; did decent box office, so I'm happy for him."Hills" shows the now-well-familiar "extended family" on vacation in their "recveh," blithely ignoring the advice from the obligatory gas-station eccentric to stay on the main highway. Craven shows how uninterested he is in developing suspense by introducing one of the feral clan, "Ruby," immediately; still he knows to whet our appetite by keeping the desert rats mostly out of sight for a while. Once they appear, they come off as so rabidly predatory (with a widely varying command of English) one doubts they would not have killed/eaten one another long ago. ("Two Thousand Maniacs" had subtler acting?.seriously.) Craven gives them almost equal time with the "normal" family, making the latter as unlikable as possible; the father's a retired cop from Craven's own Cleveland who uses "the N-word" and berates his family constantly; the mother's a dotty walking set of clichés; the blond boy's a sullen punk; the blonde girl's a self-absorbed brat. At one point they all share a chuckle over the memory of one of their big Alsatian dogs killing a neighbor's smaller dog; shortly afterward they huddle for a laconic prayer. Just as Sinead O'Connor popularized the term "recovering Catholic," Craven could do the same for "recovering Baptist" (although the late Sam Kinison was funnier with it). Craven's only goal seems to be to create a "behavioral sink" for all these unpleasant people and let them have at it. The violence is fairly impressive given the limited budget and need to get the "right" rating but in the coldness of Craven's universe, nothing really resonates much; I can't think of a movie with this much mayhem that left so little impression on me. It ends with a freeze frame of the one almost-rational character plunging a knife into a bad guy's chest for about the fortieth time, as though inviting us to mourn the damnation of humanity or something, but gee whiz, the guy didn't have a gun, these people were hard to kill plus they'd kidnapped his baby for crying out loud; Wes probably felt very daring inserting that element but it felt cheesy since I knew the baby wouldn't die. Wes would not have had the stones for that; nobody would've back then. Maybe Mr. Aja will in his remake, but I doubt it---not in the version seen Stateside anyway. But if he sees fit to kill off the excruciatingly annoying Emilie de Ravin (from "Lost"), that alone would make it worth the price of admission?..Michael Berryman has the only name/face most people would recognize---hard to forget the latter. When I saw a newspaper add for "Hills" as a teenager, I thought it was about extraterrestrials or something. (Please, somebody hire him for more comedic roles!) By the way, rent the unjustly neglected "Race with the Devil" for a much more compelling look at vacationers vs. loonies in the boonies....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven at his Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Wes Cravens early projects and easily one of his best. I first heard of the Hills Have Eyes because I saw its terrible sequel and really had no interest to watch the first one. Well, a few years ago I saw the Hills Have Eyes on IFC and rather enjoyed it. It wasn't officially until I bought it on DVD that this film became one of my all time favorite horror flicks. This movie really relies on atmosphere and mood which is a great thing for a low budget horror film to rely on. The violence in this movie is almost all implied, which really works for this film. The subject matter alone will disturb you. Especially when this family of cannibals plan on cooking this poor little baby. There is just something really sick about the whole story line, but that is what makes this such a great horror movie. Also, the movie stars Dee Wallace Stone (Cujo, ET) and Michael Berryman who got cult fame after this movie was made. You can see him recently in The Devils Rejects. I also here that a remake of this movie is in production. Thsi makes me really sceptacle because I hate remakes of classic horror movies. But, I guess it's worth giving a shot as long as it's not PG-13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, yet Bobby's actions ruin just don't make sense in the context of the story, but as a horror film, it has entertaining moments!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(MASSIVE SPOILERS) ***You've been warned*** Wes Craven's second major horror feature film is a cult favourite, and subsequent must-see for any horror buff for its status alone. And, while, there were some decent moments, overall this film felt a little far-fetched and dated. In some ways, the overpraised 'The Last House on the Left' is better than 'The Hills Have Eyes', but in others, the latter is better. For me, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is when Craven became really good in his genre in my opinion! 'The Hills Have Eyes' is set in the American desert, in a barren landscape near a nuclear testing facility (which you never see!). A typical American extended family take a detour from a trip to California to see a silver mine, and subsequently crash their vehicle, and become stranded in the middle of nowhere. Ex-Detective, Big Bob Carter (Russ Grieve), his wife Ethal (Virginia Vincent), and their adult-children and spouses; Bobby (Robert Houston), Brenda (Susan Lanier), Lynne (Dee Wallace-Stone) and Doug (Martin Speer), are all unknowingly being watched by a bunch of nomadic backward fringe-dwelling psycho family who look modern cave people- yet, know how to use walkie-talkies, and of course they are somewhere in the rocky ominous "hills". However, they are intimidating enough, and a daunting feeling of dread is present for this typical American family and their two dogs! (Side note: Robert Houston, who plays Bobby recently won an Oscar for his short documentary, 'Mighty Times: The Children's March') As the story progresses for the 'The Hills Have Eyes', the stranded family split up, and Doug and Big Bob decide to find help separately, while the others stay behind with the station wagon and caravan. Meanwhile, the gritty-looking and mostly unseen nomads watch them from the hills! Only the dogs seem to clue on that something is up, and eventually things begin to unravel as one of the dogs makes a run for the hills. Ultimately, this eventually leads to a confrontation where the family must work to survive, up until its dramatic and violent conclusion- similar to the vengeance inflicted to the villains of 'The Last House on the Left'! Overall, this film feels a little dated, and nowhere near has the impact of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974) as a gritty realistic horror film. The bad guys in 'The Hills Have Eyes' are over-the-top clichés, and their motivation in getting the baby doesn't seem to stem from anything other than hunger (I kept waiting for Fat Bastard to come out of nowhere!). Similarly, we don't really learn anything about the vacationing family either- except that Big Bob was a Detective, and Ethal is religious! And, while, Big Bob and Doug's narratives are okay, I didn't really buy Bobby's behaviour- especially since he was the one who first clued on something was up once one of the dogs was killed. I mean, not trying to create panic is one thing, but when you are alone with three other women, you should at least give them the low-down, and prepare for the worst. His character's actions, even once Doug came back, is somewhat responsible for the villains of the piece getting the advantage to set their initial trap! When characters should be on the alert, they are, instead, having sex, or going to sleep- even when Bobby clearly suspects people are stalking them, he allows his family to do this!?!?! It was hardly realistic to have this character step back and say nothing so he wouldn't alarm anyone, particularly the women in the film (a kind of stereotypical attitude in some movies), after it's obvious one of your dogs has been gutted. He should have been preparing them, especially considering in hindsight that near the climax of the film, he is able to utilise resources to set booby-traps! Like, he couldn't have done that before the desperate times! And even after the first confrontation, Bobby is still the character doing somewhat unrealistic and stupid things. When Doug goes off on his own with a walkie-talkie, one would assume that Doug would've said to Bobby to keep the frequency open. Yet, when Doug is in the hills and tries to contact Bobby, he is unsuccessful due to Bobby trying to call for help elsewhere! To me, again, if Bobby knew the situation, and knew Doug was scouting, then why, at that point in time does he block the line? I found most of Bobby's actions unrealistic including that one! Also, the second dog, which is established as more patient and lethal, goes above and beyond the call of duty in this film. I mean this dog is really smart, almost ridiculously smart. If only it were smart enough to take out bad guys when it was in hills prior to the initial confrontation between the family and the nomadic tribe! Oh well! Besides these gripes, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is not too bad! It has enough action and crazy characters to entertain you but not really scare you! It's not Craven's best film, and probably in the same league as 'The Last House on the Left'! An okay low-budget horror film! If anything, the separate final battles between heroes and villains is ultimately satisfying- especially the final shot! This would have been a much better film if it were more realistic, and established an "attack as a form of defence" method for the family to work with!! Well, that's my opinion anyways! *** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE HILLS HAVE EYES is another very decent exploit-style film by Wes Craven, done back when he still had an obvious love for horror/exploit films...HILLS is not as strong or "shocking" as THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, but is still an all-around decent film. The basic story: A family breaks down in Nevada and is terrorized by a bunch of inbred, mutant, freak-o hill people (including the naturally strange looking Michael Berryman - as a side note, I met him at a convention once, he's actually a very cool guy...). That's about all you need to know going into this. The acting is fair and it has that gritty 70's feel that makes it a little more potent. A decent, campy-kinda film that's worth a look. 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I enjoyed The Hills Have Eyes, it's not among my favorites. It's slightly dull, seems like it pulled a few punches with the content for such a feature, and just not quite as interesting as maybe it should be. Nonetheless, it has its merits as well; a fine 70's-horror atmosphere, distressing plot, relentless baddies, and, of course, Pluto. As an entry in the inbred, cannibalistic sub-genre, the change of settings was a nice touch, moving it from the mountainous woods to the dry, rocky desert. Perhaps my favorite scene in the movie was the use of Ethel's corpse as bait?there's just something gleefully unsettling about how that idea plays out. Anyway, as I said, it's not a personal favorite but definitely a movie horror fans will want to check out, as it is one of Craven's best.</fullReview>

Also the film's producer:Peter Locke plays one of the Cannibalistic Clan in a memorable cameo.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Expanded Surround Sound (Also in DTS 6.1 ES Digital Audio). DVD has an amusing commentary by the writer/director and the producer. The second disc has an documentary of the making of the film, documentary on the film career of Wes Craven, alternative ending and more. This film went on to be successful in theaters and a cult success on video. This DVD also has a collector's booklet. This is one of Craven's best. Don't miss this one.

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven: Horror Director phase.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes (1977) is one of the classic and essential horror films of the seventies. Whilst his first horror flick LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT was a product of the late sixties (despite being made in the early seventies, HILLS HAVE EYES is a definite seventies era movie. Loosely based upon the old country tale of Sawney Bean, this updated tale is about a mutated family of inbred monsters who live off the dying and radiated deserts of the southwest.An extended family traveling the back roads of the southwest come across some old mines that belong to the family. Despite warnings from the locals, the family decides to visit the abandon area. It's going to be a night of hell for these white bred suburbanites as they encounter people that man was never meant to let walk the earth!! Survival horror at it's finest. Who'll survive this night of terror? Nasty and brutal stuff from the once great Wes Craven. When I was growing up, whenever I heard that name mentioned in a movie I knew I was in for something good. Sadly, he's turned into nothing but a hack and a sell-out film maker. But we'll always have films like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and THE HILLS HAVE EYES to fall back on.Highly recommended. One of the horror fan's essentials.</fullReview>

It isn't long before the genteel Carters are forced to revert to savage instincts in order to protect their own clan, as the thin veil which is civilization is torn away. The acting is realistic and first-rate, the scenes of violence are genuinely gripping and there is no padding or dull moments. Real-life horror is the scariest kind of horror, as this film demonstrates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading all the negative comments on IMDb and actually sitting down and watching this movie... I just felt that another view of this movie was in order. I honestly really enjoyed this movie for what it was.First things first... there are two types of horror... the type that might not ever happen... that is pretty much somebody's bad dream (such as George Romero's Dead trilogy, The Evil Dead series, or any of the slasher movies from the 80's with characters such as Freddy and Jason).Then there's the type of horror that truly exists in today's world. Having Bush as the President, even though I'm all the way over in Canada, terrifies me. Every time I open up a newspaper all I see is bad news... I guess I'm just lucky that I don't live in a bigger area where the news is more atrocious. All the child killers, rapists, etc. This movie focuses on the second type of horror... the real type. If this isn't your cup of tea then simply don't watch this movie. Go watch the new Dawn of the Dead remake... in my opinion that is also truly amazing.Forget about Freddy, forget about the Screams, think about the Wes Craven that directed People Under The Stairs.... but only more gruesome and dark. Craven's inspiration for this film was the legend of Sawney Bean. Bean was reputedly a cave-dweller in the 14th-15th century Scotland, who along with his inbred extended family, attacked, robbed, and cannibalized passersby over some 25 years. If that sounds like a part of the human personality that you want to see explored in a movie... you're interested in how dark an demented a person can truly become given their environments... then watch this.If not, stay far away.In my opinion, 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hills have eyes was one of the best films that Wes Craven was behind. This, along with Nightmare on Elm Street would be my favorites. It's about a family that is traveling across the desert, and they soon fall victim to a clan of cannibals who dwell in the desert plains. There's a few morbid scenes and the acting is well done. The cannibals are casted very well, as they are all named after planets, ie pluto, jupiter, mars etc. The bad guy characters I thought, could have been explained a little better, but that is nothing to really complain over. Viewers today may view it as an outdated picture. But those fans that appreciate the classic pictures out of the seventies would not be disappointed by The Hills Have Eyes. The setting is also something that I really liked. Again, it set in the desert and not very many horror pictures are based out of that of the desert. I don't know what it is about the desert, I mean, there is just something creepy about desert nights that are a good setting for a horror film. Maybe it's the coyote howls and the gusty winds. Craven is an innovative writer/director 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Hills Have Eyes" made an impact on viewers back in the 1970s and the white bread, all American family being stalked and terrorized by a savage, cannibalistic family in the middle of the desert away from civilization terrified viewers and reflected the dark side of the American dream in post Vietnam war America. The concept of this contrast is strong and gives a certain social commentary which makes this Wes Craven film an intelligent horror movie. The "civilized" family slowly loses all the amenities of civilization, first when their car breaks down and they lose food and electricity and slowly become not too different from the antagonists especially when members of the family are murdered and the family baby is kidnapped by the savages. The theme is also illustrated by the 2 family dogs, Beauty and Beast. Beauty is completely tame and unsuited to survival which leads to her demise whereas Beast, has a primal, hunting instinct and a blood thirst which makes him suited to exacting revenge upon the cannibals. The cannibals aren't supernatural creatures but rather primal humans who kill to survive and to obtain tools and goods for their own living. The daughter, Ruby, of the cannibal family, shows compassion towards the other family and even wants to escape from her own. In contrast, the patriarch of the "civilized" family is a bigoted, stubborn lout while his wife is docile and goes along with everything he says. The children represent the baby boomer generation that goes along with their parents traditions at the same time thumbing their nose at it as when the daughters share a cigarette and the one daughter and her husband go for a conjugal romp. And the father's stoic, unyielding manner juxtaposes that of his son-in-law, Doug, who is easy going. However, Doug changes when he has to rescue his infant daughter from the clutches of the cannibals. The family of cannibals have their patriarch, Papa Jupiter, who sees the family as intruding and forcing their lives onto them and has a seething hatred for them. This can be seen at the source of many a conflict in the news these days. Although, the film is tame by today's standards, some of the death scenes were still unsettling and it brings up the question of what we would do if we were stripped of all that ties us to civilization and left bare to fend for ourselves. Would we become the "savage" family and kill if our survival depended on it. I think a truly disturbing, effective horror film not only gives you the frights but makes the viewer reflect upon themselves and contemplate the darkness that lies within the human psyche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The hills have eyes" is Wes Craven's second movie and just like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" it's one of those movies that would inspire other horror-filmmakers (especially Sam Raimi who later would shot "Evil Dead"). The story is a bit silly but rarely has a horrormovie such a big impact, a big grown-up family travel with their camper to California. Instead of seeing girls with bikinis, they got stuck in the desert waiting to be killed by some maniacs with cannibalistic lusts (the main target is the baby as the meat is still soft). There are some unforgettable characters in here like Pluto, the brutal papa who used to be a cop (remember the line "I was a cop in the meanest city I can imagine, I met the greatest scum but it is my wife who has put me in the biggest s***") and of course the debut from Dee Wallace, who later would become famous as ET's mother.

The film is much better made than his previous film "The Last House on the Left", but it still lacks the slickness and polish of his later productions, such as the "Scream" series.Inspired by the legend of the Sawney-Bean family (a notorious family of 17th century Scottish cannibals), the plot revolves around three generations of a mid-western American family whose mobile home breaks down near a nuclear testing range in the middle of the desert. They soon come under attack by a family of savage, mutant cannibals.While the film is often quite brutal, it isn't particularly gory. The action is well-staged and the film is pretty exciting. The film is pretty suspenseful and often quite shocking.The acting in the film is pretty good.

		<fullReview>The Hills Have EyesI love these horror movies from the 70s! They always seem to be good and have an effective atmoshpere. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre had a good atmoshpere, but it failed from it's acting abilities. Sure, it had some pretty shocking scenes, but it isn't the absolute masterpiece it is set out to be. The Hills Have Eyes has the same atmosphere as Texas Chainsaw, but I liked this even more.I have never seen a horror movie set in the desert before I saw this. I liked the whole idea, I mean, the desert is kind of creepy. It's really quiet and even though you are surrounded by open space, you feel a sense of isolation. This movie is about a typical 1970s American family who become stranded in a vast area of a California desert. This movie has the style of Texas Chainsaw, and is essentialy creepy. The crazy cannibals in the hills are really disturbing. Wes Craven is a wonderful director. Another good raw horror film of his is Last House On The Left. That is one disturbing movie. I actually enjoy Wes Craven's old school horror movies over his recent Scream teen type movies. An overall good horror movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOTA family of 7 members going to California through the desert. Their car gets broken and they're being stalked by a cannibalistic family which have not emerged into modern times. After a few family members are humiliated and killed , those who left, decide to hunt down the family.COMMENTS I was really impressed by this movie. The film locations are good , and there's a creepy atmosphere all around. Acting is good too. I was kinda scared when I saw Michael Berryman with his hands with no fingernails ! He's looks really creepy in the movie . Other actors play ok. They don't do something spectacular but they aren't that bad either. Overall acting is good. I think a big plus for this Wes Craven movie is a good plot and great filming locations. The desert , the wind , and all that combined with the music creates a great creepy and chilling atmosphere. When the family's trailer is in dark and the cannibals slowly starting to scare the members , you can easily feel the suspense. There is very little gore , because it's a movie of different type. Unlike flicks that are overloaded with gore , this movie has a good plot , very solid acting and great suspense factor. I haven't seen many Craven's movies . Among those I've seen are : New Nightmare and probably this one?cant think of any others? But for 1977 , this movie in my opinion looks really respectful. Well I guess I would have asked for more gore. The only gory scene is where Pluto (Michael Berryman) gets bitten by a dog and later gets his neck `torn' by another dog. I guess he stays alive because in part 2 (1985) Pluto appears again. Maybe Hills Have Eyes fails a little bit as a horror movie but its really interesting , chilling, has some gore , good acting , good filming locations?what else you need ? :) OVERALL Fans of Braindead , Premutos , and other gory movies don't even bother?.. This movie deserves its status for : Good acting , good plot , great filming locations and Wes Craven. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great flick. In my "eyes" this is Wes Craven's best film, not so much in terms of the amount of horror it conjures up, but because of its humour and craziness. Deliverance opened up a whole can of worms and Wes Craven feeds on them like a radiated cannibal gnawing on a baby.It does start off kind of dubiously, with sub par acting and low production value making it feel like a typical badly made horror flick, but then little aspects begin to pierce through the low grade facade. The dialogue between the family is hilarious, especially Big Bob Carter, a former detective with a quick temper. The rest of the group are made up of the oblivious mother who is the catalyst for Big Bobs fits of frustration, their teenage son and daughter, the young couple with baby in tow, and Beauty and Beast the very intuitive pet German Shepherds.The group is on its way to California but first Big Bob wants to look for silver mines in the desert. Soon they are stranded with no one around except a clan of starving cannablistic freaks. Well needless to say that people die horrible deaths and as the group dwindles down it becomes a savage fight for survival. Things really pick up once the first victim is claimed and the film never looks back, the over the top loonyness of the clan (made up of family members named after planets i.e Mars, Pluto, Jupiter)is just infectious even when they are preparing a baby for dinner, the subject matter should be too much to bare but it is done in such a zany way that it is laugh out loud funny, especially the speech pattern of these freaks as they converse to each other using walkie talkies, just great stuff. The same type of crazed phonetics that made "Wrong Turn" watchable. Now this is good and bad, because ultimately this film fails as a horror flick, its too outrageous. But damn is it funny and exciting. I especially love the use of the dogs, they kind of have their own story line and it works, Beast is the true hero of the flick and its done in a way that makes you cheer the dog on, all I cared about was whether he was going to live or not. They just don't make films like this anymore, "Wrong Turn" came close but just doesn't live up to this masterpiece's sheer brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>would be better if...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains very minor spoilers.The Hills Have Eyes would have been better if it had taken place in a wooded area and if Wes Craven had concentrated more on suspense. There are a few good, but brief, moments of suspense but the terrain in The Hills Have Eyes is far too open to allow for unseen movement so unfortunately much of the suspense is lost since the cannibals can be seen approaching our stranded heroes. Suspense could have been created if Wes Craven had allowed us to see just what these cannibals do to their victims, then a sense of foreboding and fear would have been created for the stranded people in the movieThat said The Hills Have Eyes is more of a survival picture then a horror picture and in that regard it's pretty good. While a viewer hoping for a really scary movie may be disappointed the movie is still interesting as you root for the normal people to triumph over the cannibals.As a horror movie The Hills Have Eyes is way over-rated. "Harrowing and Nasty" the DVD cover reads. Well, there's not really that much gore in this picture. People with weak stomachs could probably sit through this movie fairly easily, having to shield their eyes only once or twice.Overall The Hills Have Eyes fails as a horror picture but is still interesting and enjoyable to watch. I would have liked this movie to be much creepier and it could have done with a better ending, as it is the movie just kind of ends. As a horror movie I could only give this a 3 out of 10 but it is interesting if not fantastic so The Hills Have Eyes rates a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film waiting to be reassessed on DVD. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE HILLS HAVE EYES is a movie of historical significance to myself, if nobody else, as it is the FIRST EVER VIDEO that I saw, around the age of 13. Back then, it seemed to be a big disappointment to me, in that it wasn't as gory or as suspenseful as I first thought. The less-than-average reaction I gave it back then was also down to a substandard video copy that had some bad interference during the climax of the film, so I lost the full impact.The film has just been reissued on DVD in the UK in an excellent new transfer, complete with an alternative ending and two documentaries on the 2 disc set. I already watched the MAKING OF one last night and will watch THE AMERICAN NIGHTMARE at a later time. There is also a demo on the restoration of the print as well.Seeing it like this is a revelation.The colour is superb (the eerie setting of the desert comes across more in this version). In addition, the soundtrack is excellent and clear (compared to the video version which sounded slightly muffled) and it looks a much more reasonable experience.The story, based on a real-life 16th century account of a cannibal family (more can be learned in the MAKING OF documentary), chronicles a family, the Carters, who break down in the California desert and are attacked by a group of cannibals, but before things are bad enough, the survivors of the family stage a last-gasp revenge to try and save themselves.....Far more enjoyable this time around and well worth anybody's money, THE HILLS HAVE EYES deserves another look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fat and JUICY!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ The Hills Have Eyes is the film that solidified Wes Craven as a horror director. His sophomore effort proves he can make a scary movie when he wants to. The story follows a clan of cannibals living, if you can call it that, out in a desert wasteland. A family vacationing in the area takes a wrong turn and wind up stranded in this desolate, isolated place. That's when all hell breaks loose and a battle for survival begins. I was enjoying it completely as a gritty, slightly campy, horror flick. That changed about half-way through. Once Dee Wallace Stone's character died, it became totally unpredictable and felt "real." Based on who she is, I had convinced myself that she was the star and she wouldn't die. Boy, was I wrong. At that moment, I was drawn into the movie on a whole new level. I had no idea who was going to survive, nay, if anyone was going to survive. It really was unpredictable and I applaud Wes Craven for making it so. I also applaud Michael Berryman as being one of the most unforgettable characters that Craven has created. Berryman's Pluto has the ability to both scare and fascinate me. Now, a large part of the horror community thinks Craven "sold out" or that he killed horror in the nineties. I find myself guilty of doing this as well sometimes. Then I go back and watch his early films and forget all about that. There is a raw energy in Craven's classics that I have to believe the man still has. If you tire of hearing about the Scream trilogy (be it good or bad), then pop in the Hills Have Eyes, sit back, and enjoy the ride. Commercial horror and pretty faces this is not.Note for genre buffs: There is a ripped poster of Jaws visible in the camper and Sam Raimi would later put a ripped poster of The Hills Have Eyes in his The Evil Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes is an acclaimed film of bizarre horror and cannabalisim from director Wes Craven featuring an all-star cast. Dee Wallace-Stone (E.T.), James Whitworth (357 Magnum), Michael Berryman (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Academy Award nominee Robert Houston and Virginia Vincent (TV's Eight is Enough) make up the characters of both a family stranded out in the Western desert and of cannibal hungrey hill people who eventually begin to terrorize the family. Although at times it seems slow and cheap, the film is actually quite frightening and interesting and it's shock power makes one of the most bizarre films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes used to be so much braver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD... Wes Craven is a man caged in a prison cell he built for himself. He has never wanted to be renowned for being a horror film genius. Unfortunately The Last House on the Left sealed his doom. After this startling debut he tried to avoid such atrocities for five years before reluctantly re-entering the horror field with what would be considered another modern horror classic: The Hill Have Eyes.Comparisons with Craven's legendary Last House are inevitable. Let's talk about plot and you might see my point. A middle class family venture into the vast desert to search for a lost ?silver mine', but to their disadvantage, a wild family of cannibals find them, kidnap the baby and rape of the daughters. Lowlife, obtuse baddies and higher class, sophisticated goodies do battle, good vs. evil, rich vs.poor?etc. The film is haunting, but not as ?in-your-face' as The Last House. Don't expect too much bloodshed or plot twists, Hills Have Eyes has it's own moments to remember without resorting to typical horror gimmicks. Using a dead grandmother as bait for the cannibals, the sight of an eviscerated pooch, Pappa Jupiter (leader of the cannibal clan) chowing down on the dead father's arm while ranting to the severed head on a stick ? `I'll eat the brains of your kid's kids!'The Hills Have Eyes also marks the beginning of an ongoing joke between Wes Craven and Evil Dead/Spider-Man maverick, Sam Raimi. In one scene, after the cannibals wreck the camper?trailer, bite off the head of a parakeet and drink it's blood and kidnapped the baby for food (`Babby's fat, you fat, fat juicy!' or `We just caught us a young Thanks Giving Turkey!') you'll notice a Jaws poster torn in half in the camper. Sam Raimi saw this as Wes's way of saying that Jaws was ?pop horror' so included a torn poster of The Hills Have Eyes in his film, The Evil Dead, to say HIS film was the true horror. Wes responded by having Nancy, a character in A Nightmare on Elm Street, falling asleep whilst watching The Evil Dead. Then there's a Freddy glove hanging in the work-shed in Evil Dead 2. Where will these fellas go next?The Hills Have Eyes remains one of Craven's better films. Barryman retuned as ?Pluto' in 1985 for Craven's less successful The Hills Have Eyes 2. This sequel was considered atrocious, but seemed like a higher budgeted remake replacing the believable family with obnoxious teens to cash in on the prolific slasher genre of the period. Craven did a more acceptable job with his commercial Scream trilogy. There was talk of a Hills Have Eyes 3 during the mid nineties, but it never happened. What did emerge was known as ?Wes Craven presents Mind Ripper,' known in certain territories as The Hills Have Eyes, part III. It's loss of graininess and higher budget goes to prove that sometime less is more.`The Hills Have Eyes is the most gut-wrenching film I have seen in my entire life.' Sam Raimi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After just recently seeing "The Last House on the Left," I didn't know quite what to expect from "The Hills Have Eyes." Once again, Craven shows a rawness to the violence in "The Hills Have Eyes," as he did with "Last House." The results are very good. There's some real great shocking moments in this movie. From watching these early films from Wes Craven, I've gained a new respect for him. He really took some chances early in his career and they payed off in my opinion. My rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes is a good horror flick by Wes Craven. Often considered classic I find absolutely nothing to consider this film a classic. A Follow - up to a bit more disturbing film Last House On The Left which was made 5 years before. This film featuring perhaps a better known cast is about a family who are going to California. Their car breaks down and they have a trailer. They are in the middle of nowhere and there are these hills surrounding it. They are not aware of it but there is a cannibal family who lives in the hills and are going to get them. The family has to survive and fight for their lives and to kill the attakcers etc.This film is overall an good film. A lot better than The Last House On The Left however Wes earlier films as well as the Scream films are not original. It has the Texas Chainsaw Massacre wibe to it. Especially the cannibal family ( We never see them eat people by the way). The violence is more action packed than graphic and disturbing and it contains hardly any gore. It is a bit bloody though. I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are all savages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films about survival in the face of both human and natural adversity tend to interest us on a primal level. That's why I find this film so fascinating. A family traveling through the desert in the south-western part of the country are sidetracked by a flat tire near an abandoned Air Force outpost. They are besieged by a tribe of cannibals who survive by killing and eating any trespassers. From that point on the movie takes off into a terrifying realm where the "civilized" people must become savages to protect themselves and their loved ones.  This film is terrifying in the aspect that the cannibal family treats the civilized family, from the suburbs of Chicago, as playthings. They don't think twice about torturing before the kill. The set up keeps the film interesting but when the family begins to realize that some of them might not make it out alive the story really begins rolling. Watching the family slowly slip into atavistic behavior to fight off the cannibals is watching the de-evolution of man.  The performances are well done, especially considering that none of these actors were marquee names. In fact, the only two to gain any sort of fame were Michael Berryman as the bare headed Pluto and Dee Wallace (before the Stone) as the oldest daughter; both of their performances are noteworthy. However, the entire cast is believable in an unbelievable situation. Wes Craven's direction was still raw enough that one gets the feeling of nihilism throughout.  While it can be found in your video store under the horror section it could more likely be in the shelf next to Deliverance or Rituals. This film, while it does contain horrorific aspects, is more about using a minimum of resources and relying on cunning with only thoughts about surviving. A film that should lead the viewer to stop and think, "What would I do in that situation?" Hopefully, none of us will ever have to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Craven's better films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(***1/2 out of *****) A family (including John Steadman, Martin Speer and horror movie vet Dee Wallace) stranded in the middle of the desert gets attacked by a blood-thirsty group of inbred cannibals (including James Whitworth and the interminably typecast Michael Berryman). The survivors have to resort to equally barbaric tactics to defend themselves. One of Craven's better horror features, this cross between "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Deliverance" is also similar to the director's earlier 1972 revenge thriller "Last House on the Left." But, whereas that one was highly exploitative and generally distasteful, with this movie, though quite violent and disturbing, itself, Craven steers clear from pure exploitation by making the bad guys so cartoonishly depraved and menacingly unrealistic that they could only exist in a ?70s horror movie (although, the desert-dwelling cannibal family depicted in this film is based on an actual clan of similar savages that preyed on people in the post-Civil War Southwest.) Craven's plot builds to some very intense and effectively gruesome scenes, and I like how the members of the desert family all have planet names (Jupiter, Mars, Pluto, Mercury). A word to the wise: Avoid the sequel.HIGHLIGHT: Desperate brother and sister Bobby and Linda (Robert Houston and Susan Lanier) are forced to use their own dead mother as bait to lure raving mad, patriarchal anthropophagus Jupiter (Whitworth) into their trap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as Wes Craven movies go, (which are easily as inconsistant as his fellow peer John Carpenter) The Hills Have Eyes is one of the better ones. Low on plot but high on tension and atmosphere. Genuine heart thumping territory. But this film starts to drag it self out toward the end and the credits seemed come up with no resolve to anything that had just happened. Sure the ending kept the tension rolling through the credits, but it also made me feel like they couldn't figure out how to get these sorry folks out of the desert and decided you didn't care if they did anyhow. It was enough to bring down my overall feeling of the film. If you want a nail biter this is it, just don't expect it to be an overall great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The raw tenacity of Wes Craven's 'The Hills Have Eyes' shows an enigmatic directing skill at such an early part of his directing career. The hot barren landscapes of American desert are captured frighteningly with the direct use of sunlight and hot sandy colors enlivening a sense of isolation and alienation. The raw camera work heightens realism and creates strong hostility during its violent scenes. The juxtaposition of an Americanized domesticated and bleak un-cultured cannibals creates moralistic tensions between actors and audience where innocence is stripped away to result in bare evil and violence. The only way a family like this can respond is with violence. Like the tagline suggests, "they didn't want to kill. But they didn't want to die." Violence and unadulterated wildness are the only means for survival in this film. It questions the sheltered lives of many suburban families. Domesticated morals are no match for the barren desert and evil elements. The two family dogs, aptly named "Beauty" and "Beast", including the baby and the cannibals serve as implicit metaphors for innocence and malevolence. A good Wes Craven film not only scares but questions sociological values within communities and manifests them into well structured films that bend common ways of thinking. The issues of violence, family structures, survival, innocence and evil are raised quite solidly in Craven's solid piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craven's best film. No excuses, no arguments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As he proved with the infamous LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972), Wes Craven used to be extremely good at making creepy, intense, in-your-face horror films that get under your skin and play on your mind. THE HILLS HAVE EYES is a prime example of the early, pre-sellout Craven at his devastating best. He throws together a respectable, middle-class extended family and a vicious gang of deformed, retarded cannibal thugs and leaves them to fight it out in an eerily beautiful, often stunningly photographed (considering the tiny budget) desert setting, with very little left to the imagination, hardly any taboos unbroken and one of the bleakest finales imaginable. The scenes with the 'nice' family struggling to adopt to their new, unwanted status as kill-or-be-killed survivors are both compelling and heartbreaking, and there's just enough black comedy to give you a quick breather before the blood and thunder kicks in again. If you liked THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974) you should definitely give this a look; it's one of the most overlooked and underrated extreme horror films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Damm .... Average!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I have wanted to see this film. It is very difficult to find on video in England, which is surprising considering the cult status of the film. When I finally obtained the film in mint condition I was quite disappointed. The plot concerns a clean cut All-American family who leave the road and trek across the desert in search of a Silver mine (as if rational people would do something this idiotic). They find themselves on a bomb testing range which happens to be inhabited by a wild family of cannibals who attack the family once it goes dark. With half of the family dead the family resort to the same savagery as their cannibal counterparts in order to stay alive. THE HILLS HAVE EYES is a very well made film, with a doubtful but imaginative premise. Just one problem - it's simply not very scary. The cannibal villains are pretty crap and are often more funny than anything else. The film eventually resorts to typical Seventies exploitation tactics as people get burned, shot, blown up and raped, plus a dog gets dismembered, but even scenes seem tame after all this time. Infact the film seems like a commercialised, toned down variation of the director - Wes Craven's debut feature, THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Overall THE HILLS HAVE remains one of the key horror movies of the late seventies, but in my view it is either vastly over-rated or has aged VERY badly. The final verdict? THE HILLS HAVE EYES is just another average horror movie, no more, no less. My Rating - 6 Out Of 10.</fullReview>

It's a shocking, brutal movie about ordinary people being assaulted by a family of mutants. It doesn't have the class of Deliverance, but instead is the movie's rawness and cruelty that make it so fresh and vivid even after more than twenty years since its original release. Director Wes Craven shows like no one ever did that he is master-skilled in sustaining the suspense and tension during the whole running time. Although not very gory for today's standards, The Hills Have Eyes carries sadistic and gruesome scenes, like rape, a man being teared apart by a dog, and lots of blood.The experience is so realistic that you feel sorry by those common people being menaced by crazed mountain men. This is not a film for persons with week stomach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Hills Have Eyes" was the first genuine horror film I'd ever seen, disqualifying "Poltergeist", "Three Men and a Baby" and other 80s genre stuff I thought to be the real thing. It was a knockout; no mischievous teenagers, no rubbery monsters; just the straight, suspenseful gut-wrenching goods. A mutant family of cannibals with Michael Berryman giving the performance of his life, what more could I want?It shares the same charms as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" with its documentary-style, grainy photography and bleak outlook on the primitive lifestyles of homicidal clans. I like it when a film shows respect for hillbillies and cannibals by not pulling punches, and it lets us see the confusion they experience interacting with outsiders who don't belong on their property, in their desert wasteland, or camping in their woods without a permit in the first place. Do you think the father in "Hills..." who ends up crucified with a mouthful of prickly pears, would become such a tragic character if this clash of cultures hadn't been presented as memorably as it had? I don't think so, and that's why it's a gutsy film, exploring a lot of territory that most 70s horror films hadn't even considered yet.I lost respect for Wes Craven after "Hills Have Eyes II" (did he really direct that?) and the "Nightmare" movies were a little too tongue-in-cheek for my taste. But I agree with the majority of people writing in that for sheer terror, and decent, honestly depicted degenerate behavior, "The Last House On the Left" and the first "Hills..." are highly recommendable. Also, John Steadman's monologue near the beginning of the movie is a jewel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of horror films, especially in the 70s, made a virtue out of having the 'straight' lead man provide some kind of reassurance by playing the patriarch and generally saving the day. Not in The Hills Have Eyes.This is no ordinary horror movie. It works on a load of different levels and stomps all over the thin line between gory, violent exploitation and art.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Followup to Last House On The Left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes(1978) was the second straight masterpiece in the early career of Wes Craven. Its a tale of two families with the civilized ones pitted against the uncivilized family. This movie exhibits why Wes Craven is one of the best horror film makers working in Hollywood today. It came out six years after his controvisal debut due to being on an unofficial blacklist. The Hills Have Eyes(1978) is a better film then the Scream Trilogy because its filled with scenes of true horror and suspense.The movie was the film debut for Dee Walace Stone. Michael Berryman gives a good performance as Pluto. Wes Craven really toned down in this film after the vicousness expressed in The Last House on the Left(1972). It is basically a survival of the fittest plot as the two families fight for the right to live. This was the first Craven movie to involve a female protagonist that takes a stance against the main villains.Although not as powerful or phycologically disturbing as The Last House on the Left, its still an effectively enjoyable feature film. As far as I'm concerned, Wes craven's best are The Last House on the Left(1972), The Hills Have Eyes(1978), and A Nightmare on Elm Street(1984). The actors give for the most part give some fine performances. This has plenty of fear inducing, heart beating terror. The Hills Have Eyes(1978) proved that Wes Craven was a capable director and not some one film wonder.Wes Craven is good at introducing the main villains as a purely evil person...I.E., Krug(Last House on the Left), Jupitar(The Hills Have Eyes), and Freddy Kruger(A Nightmare on Elm Street). One thing this feature does well at is giving ample amount of situations full of tension. There are a few scenes that stand out during the movie. The movie was based on a legend of middle age mythology. The Hills Have Eyes(1978) is a hard to find movie that should be released on home video in wide screen format because its a film that deserves such treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven delivers another movie that rips out your soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After devastating audiences with his depraved but excellent "Last House on the Left", director Wes Craven once again goes for the kill with this demented tale of an all-American family facing off against a family of cannibals while deserted in the desert. Don't expect the movie to start getting sick until midway through. While the film is all around a creepy experience, the atmosphere goes from secluded and scary to deadly and terrifying! The majority of the performances are wonderful, especially from one of my favorites, Dee Wallace (Stone), who I have loved ever since "E.T."! Of course, Craven pulls out all the stops, breaks all the movie rules, and does not let his audience rest for one second after the family starts getting killed off! The invasion of the trailer by brothers Mars and Pluto is nerve-wracking and from then on, it's a non-stop rollercoaster ride of chills, spills (blood), and unexpected twists. You thought that Krug and his gang of thugs were demented in "Last House"? Wait till you meet this gang of degenerates! Led by father Jupiter and his overweight ex-prostitute wife, daugher Ruby and sons Mars, Mercury, and Pluto are the kind of people you would expect from inbreeding! I have heard mixed reviews from fans and critics alike, but I think this is possibly Craven's finest work, better than "Last House", "Nightmare on Elm Street", and "Scream put together! From these four films, I have made the judgment that Wes Craven is one of the Top 5 horror filmmakers of all time!!! Seek out this film and watch it in the dark. I dare you not to be shaking by the end credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes, we hardly knew ye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before becoming the franchise monster of Freddie Kruger and SCREAM, Wes Craven made his masterpiece in this still-chilling 1978 cheapie about a Middle American family (hardass patriarch, schmucky boy-children, doting females) who meet their warped mirror image in a clan of mutant flesh-eaters who live like scavengers in the Southwestern desert.The moral of Craven's little fable is crashingly obvious--the distance between the Waltons and the Mansons is exactly one comfort zone. But Craven hammers it home with a combination of mordant humor and almost nauseating suspense that still exerts a hammerlock grip today. This is without question the greatest of the "subversive" family-romance horror movies of the seventies, and its one big verbal set piece--Big Daddy (a retired cop, natch) lambasting his hapless family--seems to have been FedExed to the set by a then-teenaged Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously Craven had a bit more money to play with here; but what he`s basically done is transfer the basic plot of Last House On The Left &amp; to the desert. I think that on the whole, it`s probably better executed than his earlier film. Again it concerns the way average citizens have to forget their values to exact revenge for previous wrongdoings ? to reduce themselves to the level of their attackers. There is certain plausibility to it all; nothing is too over the top here. This is a courageous, at times brutal account of two very different groups of people coming into contact. Strong stuff indeed, but recommended to horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Effective For What Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first caught this on home video away back in 1983 and not thinking a great deal of it . In the context of the period horror films were a staple diet of my peers . We didn't have a cinema on the Isle Of Bute in the 1980s and even if we did were too young to be allowed in to a cinema to watch a horror film . What home video did in those those days was allow us to be a cult of the forbidden where young adolescents could watch things were weren't supposed to . The novelty wore off for me very quickly since I tend to be impressed with narrative when watching a film and horror movies are very contrived with characters forgoing logic . I do remember THE HILLS HAVE EYES cropping up in conversation in 1983 with my peers remembering the budgie scene but I stated it I found the movie rather sick with the baby about to be eaten totally objectionable . I guess back then I didn't understand the genre in general and Wes Craven in particular Having over the years understood more about film making I still really wouldn't describe myself as a horror fan but for a casual viewer of horror movies Craven does deserve great credit . He's not Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky or even George A Romero , he's not a horror director interested in any political subtext but does like to play a very dark joke on the audience . In many ways watching this movie you realise it's rather similar in tone to Craven's earlier film LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT which is closer to morbid, twisted black comedy rather than a precusor to what is described as " torture porn " nowadays . A desert cannibal bites the head off a budgie and drinks its blood ? it's not to be taken entirely seriously . A little tiny innocent baby is going to end up on the menu of the desert cannibals ? If you genuinely think this is going to happen then the joke is on you That said it is a very mean spirited film as several of the all clean all American extended family find themselves fighting for their lives some of whom lose their lives in a cruel fashion . It's also a film that does often startle the audience and I found myself unexpectedly jumping out of my seat at several scenes . Okay it's not difficult to do , just stick a character in frame in the dark , keep the camera locked on them and have a silent soundtrack for a few seconds then BOOM have a sudden unexpected noise and have a bad guy jump in to frame and the audience are guaranteed a panic attack . It's both manipulative and very easy for a film maker to do this but Wes Craven knows what he's doing and he's very effective at it which means a classic horror film on a low budget</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For normal '70's horror standards, this movie is simply great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of horror movies got made during the '70's but looking back at them now, only a very small section of them actually still live up by todays standards and only the greatest are known and respected as classics, while all others have regained a more campy cult status. In that regard "The Hills Have Eyes" is really one of the better horror movies from the '70's. It actually is such a standard and simplistic movie, that actually doesn't have much story but almost instead entirely relies on purely its simple concept of a family being stranded in the middle of the dessert, who get attacked by a couple of deformed freaks, due to nuclear testings being held around in the area. It sounds cheap and campy but the movie actually successful achieves at it to become a great, effective as well as original one within its genre.What the movie does well is that it spends time on its build up and atmosphere. Because of this the entire movie basically has an eerie type of atmosphere, even when nothing horror-like is happening on screen. There is a constant sense of danger and unpleasantness. Because of this the simple story of the movie also works out so well. It shows that you don't need much to create a good horror movie with.The movie is a shocker and slasher but it's yet not an exploitation movie. It doesn't exploit its violence or gore, like Wes Craven perhaps still did with his first movie "The Last House on the Left". Instead it's a more honest and realistic looking and feeling movie, even despite of its concept.Perhaps the only mistake the movie makes it that it also tells the story too much from the viewpoint of the monstrous villains. Perhaps the movie could had been even better with its horror and tension if it hadn't been so 'close' to the movie its killers.It also actually surprised how much the 2006 is actually alike this movie. Some scenes and dialog are just completely reused and it progresses in basically the same manner. This is a surprise since remakes always tend to be better, bigger and more spectacular to its original. No wonder I liked the remake so much as well, it's pretty much the same as this movie.An under-appreciated '70's horror classic.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoilers- *Really great, but for rarely mentioned reasons.."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes is great IMO for many reasons. Most of them are rarely mentioned on these boards. Usually people say, "Oh Berryman was great" or "Craven's best, along with Last House". Well both are true, but there are other reasons. Quite frankly Berryman is IMO outshined by Whitworth (Jupiter) and Gordon (Mars) who actually have richer roles. They are more memorable and haunting to me, if maybe not as memorable looking. The character of Juptier is easily the most enjoyable thing about the film to me. The backstory presented is haunting in my opinion, how he ruined his father's life, killed his whole family, etc. as a devil child grown into a devil man. Great stuff that provokes reflection. Hills '77 is IMO much better than the 2006 remake. If for no other reason than atmosphere. The grainy film lends itself to a documentary quality, that is missing from the Hollywood-type remake. I mean in the '70's films, you were "there", not watching a Hollywood set in the desert. Sadly, that golden era of films and realism is over, and newer big budget remakes fall way short due to their gloss. IMO Hills is better than Last House as well. I enjoyed Last House, but was still a bit disappointed. It meandered a bit too much, was a bit too goofy, whereas as Hills struck all the right chords. I love the fade to red ending, I love the story, setting, etc. of Hills. It is great for reasons supporters of the sequel can never understand, and it is fairly pointless to try, as it is an intangible quality that lends to Hills '77's magic that you either get or you don't. This movie left me thinking about it for regularly weeks. And it is rare that any film is able to do that as strongly. I definitely recommend it to viewers with imagination, integrity, and who want to be challenged. It places the viewer in some uncompromising situations, and asks some tough questions. Along with NOES, I think it is Craven's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Hills Have Eyes" is a 1977 American horror film directed, written, and edited by Wes Craven, produced by Peter Locke, and it stars Michael Berryman, Susan Lanier, Dee Wallace, Robert Houston, Martin Speer, and Russ Grieve.It is about a family from Ohio going on a summer road trip to California. The father ("Big" Bob Carter) is a recently retired police officer who decides to take his loved ones on a detour despite getting dire warnings to stay on the main road from an elderly gas station owner.The man of the house goes off the path to search for some silver coins that are supposedly in some of the mines out in the Nevada desert, but after swerving to avoid running over a rabbit, he skids the car off the road and crashes, which leads to the vehicle breaking down, and the Carters becomes stranded. They are soon targeted for murder and cannibalism by people who live in the nearby hills.I first screened this movie in 2003. The reason why I decided to watch it was because after reading about it online, I thought the back story sounded very cool and when I heard the inspiration behind Wes Craven writing it I was really looking forward to watching it, and I was disappointed when I saw it. It took viewing it several times over the past ten years to finally appreciate it more.The reason why this photo play did not appeal to me was because some of the members of the cast at times show no emotion at all with their acting, and a few times when they try to, they overact. Sometimes the acting is so bad it's comical. The pacing of the film is just a little slow at times too.The soundtrack by Don Peake is *wonderful* however, and very frightening. I feel the music is the best part of the picture. The atmosphere is great as well and the desert is a wonderful spot for a horror story. The layout, along with the soundtrack, create a great feeling of horror.Michael Berryman delivers the best performance, and his character "Pluto" is highly entertaining and really scary. The image of him on the cover for "The Hills Have Eyes" is intimidating.The film gives some personal attention to the mutant family, and while some may like that, I personally feel it takes some of the mystery away from the characters, which in-turn takes some of the horror away. I enjoy some horror films that give attention to the killer(s) and humanizes them, but in this story, I feel showing the film strictly from the point of the Carter family would have made the film more scary. The mutants at times also acted so cliché that they came across as Saturday morning cartoon villains so it was hard to be scared of them and take them very seriously at times.The story of a family being stuck in a desert and being hunted by mutants is a wonderful and cool idea so I was really glad when the film was remade in 2006 with better actors and actresses, as well as better screenplay writing.My dislike for the original has nothing to do with the fact that it is a 1970's motion picture either. I love old cinema, and I can see why in it's day, this flick was good, scary, and shocking, but I think it's tame compared to today's standards. Perhaps it is my 21st century way of thinking that leads to my opinion on this film.I can't see why anyone would like the original over the new and improved re-imaging of it. I honestly think anyone who does is someone who just cannot get over the past. I think most younger audience members would probably fall asleep while watching this film.The blu-ray for this film is good. It has an alternate ending, some cool original trailers for this movie (one that is really entertaining because there is a disclaimer before showing it) as well as featurette on the making of the film that I really enjoyed watching. There is also a text and video bio for Wes Craven, the film's director, writer, and editor.In closing, "The Hills Have Eyes" (the original) all and all is just okay if you're desperate to see a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge horror fan but never saw "The Hills Have Eyes". My video store never carried it but I happened to come across it in my local Circuit City and decided to spend the $10 bucks on the DVD since I heard it was a classic horror flick by Wes Craven. I don't understand some of the other reviews that I read on this movie. There really is no gore, brutality, rape or anything really scary about this film. I actually found the cannibals funny at times. I was rooting for Beast (the dog)throughout the entire film. He was quite smart at times. Too bad Beauty wasn't. I enjoyed seeing a young Dee Wallace in this film and I enjoyed the overall setting and story of the movie. However, this was not in the least bit scary. The worst part about the movie... the end. I felt like I was in the middle of the movie and it just ended. Too many unanswered questions. I felt the need to see more. It was like Wes Craven didn't know how to end the movie so he just picked a scene and said "The End". That was the most disappointed thing. Overall, a classic movie but nothing to rave over. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for the 2006 version of "The Hills Have Eyes," I figured it was time to finally watch the original after years of being haunted by Michael Berryman's (Pluto's) "unusual" mug glaring at me from the box in the video store.To begin with, the look of the movie is a pure time capsule from the late 70s. Huge station wagon pulling a huge trailer? Check. Cut-off jeans, ringer t-shirts, and cheesy mustaches? Check. CB Radios commonplace? Check. While I found this charm to be in the movie's favor at first, it became distracting to the point where I could no longer take anybody seriously. As for the desert, although it is supposedly New Mexico, I kept thinking it looked like the Star Trek episode "Arena" where Kirk has to make a cannon to shoot the lizard Gorn.To say that I was disappointed would mean that I had high expectations for this movie to begin with. The plot is the old "City Slickers (Good Guys) Stray from Civilization and get Abused by the Locals (Bad Guys) For No Apparent Reason" story seen first in such movies as "Deliverance" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and countless movies afterward.A director is somewhat limited in what he can do with a story like that, but I've found the best movies of that kind are the ones where the Good Guys are especially courageous or resourceful, and/or the Bad Guys seem particularly cruel or formidable. Wes Craven tried to make the Bad Guys seem cruel by including a split second of a dog carcass, the insinuated rape of a girl, and talk about eating the baby. Maybe in 1977 that was rough stuff, but the villain of the 21st century needs to look at least as bad as his alleged deeds.Sure, Pluto (Berryman) is one of the more unusual looking creeps in movies, due largely to the fact that he doesn't require make-up for his unsettling appearance. But the rest of Jupiter's family? We're supposed to be scared by crooked teeth, curly hair, and people wearing headbands with claws and bones stuck in them? If you added British accents they could be characters from most "Dr. Who" episodes from that same era. The whole time the Carter family is acting terrified, my thoughts were, "C'mon. These guys aren't THAT scary!" Throw in the Least Realistic Animal Attack Ever Filmed since Walter Matthau flailed around in a pond with a rubber tentacle in "Ed Wood," and an ending so abrupt that it reminded me of the lazy student who quits his essay mid-paragraph exactly as he reaches the minimum length requirement (or maybe Craven was already over the meager budget at that point) and you can see why I felt like it was largely a waste of my 90 minutes.However, this movie did have one redeeming quality: I am now eager to see the 2006 version. The story of The Hills Have Eyes, while hardly original or unique, can be greatly improved by special effects that are, well, "special," the absence of unintentional comedy (like any scene with a CB) distracting from the horror mood, and an ending where the camera at least zooms or pans or does SOMETHING other than fading to red (red?!) after the last foe is defeated.I'm sure the newer version is improved on all three counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How far would you go to stay alive?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see why Wes Craven's "Hills Have Eyes" got labeled one of the Video Nasties. Perhaps not so much for the gore (as there isn't a lot), but the premise of the film - a normal, likable family suddenly brutally attacked by some inbred's in a desert, and what they do to stay alive. The film is great compared to a lot of the terrible films that are shoved down our throats (only for us to vomit them up) these days. "Hills Have Eyes" might want to make you vomit too, but for a different reason.The cast are outstanding. Susan Lanier deserves a lot of credit for her role as Brenda Carter, just for her screaming! The way her character changes after she was brutalized is well portrayed by Lanier. Her interaction with Robert Houston, who plays brother Bobby is terrific. Houston also does a great job in terms of character progression. Martin Speer plays their brother-in-law Doug, and while he was good, I found it odd that his character survived. I suppose due to the fact that he had his baby. Russ Grieve does a good job of playing family patriarch Big Bob Carter and has some good, humorous moments. Virginia Vincent is splendid as matriarch Ethel Carter. However, it is Dee Wallace-Stone who gives the best, and possibly most underrated performance, as Lynne. Dee brings sophistication to the film and carries herself with so much grace. Her character is also the one I sympathise with the most and I was shocked when she was killed (too soon I might add).As far as the antagonists go, each of the actors and actresses to a great job of playing their creepy character. However those of note would be Janus Blythe who plays the outcast with a conscience, Ruby, and it makes a lot of sense that she returns in the sequel. James Whitworth is terrifying as the patriarch of the "Eyes" in the Hills, Jupiter.Overall, a certifiable master piece, not only for the horror genre, but for all films. Craven does a fantastic job, in "Hills Have Eyes", which could possibly be his greatest film ever. The cast are outstanding, the score is well suited, and it will make you think - if you were in the Carter family's position - how far would you go to stay alive???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Joe Cool Review: The Hills Have Eyes(1977)Starring: Susan Lanier as Brenda Carter, Robert Houston as Bobby Carter, Martin Speer as Doug Wood, Dee Wallace-Stone as Lynne Wood, Michael Berryman as Pluto, and Janus Blythe as RubyPlot: A family somehow ends up in an Air Testing range in California that is closed to the public. They are attacked by inbred cannibals. Hijinks ensue.Openers: I heard good things about this movie, so naturally I wanted to like it. I really truly did. I thought with the plot it might end up like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Did it? No! In fact this movie is what TCM would have been if an incompetent director were running the show. But wait, I thought Wes Craven directed this movie? That he did, and he proved why Nightmare on Elm Street was the movie that made his career, because it sure wasn't this pile of garbage. The Good: Michael Berryman. He at least tries to do something with his character. I've seen him in other roles and he is somewhat of a cult icon within the genre. He is decent here. The Bad: It's a shame that his character of Pluto wasn't. It was a fairly decent actor stuck with a stupid role. In fact the entire group of baddies are just non-threatening and a group of idiots. Dee Wallace Stone, who I've seen in other movies as well, looks bored here and doesn't really do much. The rest of the cast is just as bad. Although special consideration would have to go to Martin Speer who I believe just over-acted, especially at the end, which was abrupt and anti-climatic in it's own right. The family doesn't get a chance to really have any sort of character development, so when they die I couldn't care less. The script would have to be the worst thing holding this movie down. The plot has potential. It could be a decent slasher flick but instead it's an 89 minute disaster. The Ugly: A dog is gutted, and a bird gets it's head bitten off. Not by Ozzy, although that would have provided some goodness, as I probably would have been laughing. This movie elicits no emotions out of me except for anger as it was just terrible. Also, the dog happens to be smarter then it's human cast mates. That's sad.Final Verdict: The Hills Have Eyes is a terrible movie. Go pick up the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead, or see the remake of this one. Either way you're guaranteed a better movie.0 out of 5(1 of 10 on IMDb because it won't let me choose zero.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one's a goody. You get stranded in the desert with your family which is bad enough, but next thing you know, crazy people from the Hillside Cave Trailer Park are trying to kill and eat you! Jeez-Louise...sounds like home. Is it just me or is Michael Berryman's noggin absolutely fascinating to look at? I want an action figure of Pluto, stat! Anyway, the action is pretty intense and by today's standards the film doesn't have the self-referential in-jokes or 'jump-scares' (thank you God!) that some seem to think should be part of every horror movies these days, and hey...real horror is getting mauled by some psycho freak and having to meet this guy's parents afterwards would be even worse...you better just see this movie.

		<shortDescription>A Wes Craven 77 Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All horror film fans who love the films that Wes Craven has produced will love this 1977 Classic; it has plenty of blood, gore, rape scenes and plenty of crazy background Horror Music to chill your very bones. Susan Lanier,(Brenda Carter)," The Hills Have Eyes PartII",'85, gives a great acting performance and is deeply violated by the horrible Beasts which seem to come out of nowhere. Robert Houston,(Bobby Carter),"A Place At The Table",'01 is a loving husband who does his very best to protect his wife and family and has a very hard struggle throughout the entire film. Dogs and even a baby meet up with horrible perils, despite the fact that a married couple still try to make love in the back of a station wagon while a family member gets himself all burned up. If you want to feel like you have witnessed an actual murder, this is the film for YOU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Exploitation Flick from Craven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Lucky ones died first' the exploitation tag line for Wes Craven's 'The Hills Have Eyes' a story about a nice middle American family on their way to California break down in the desert and are set upon by a clan of cannibals who snatch the tasty looking baby. The premise far more disturbing than the film actually is, but this compared to Craven's brutal 'The Hills Have eyes' both movies are in the 'horror of the family' sub-genre in which the nice middle class family have to adapt and become savage killers in order to survive. This character change is extremely interesting and frightening at the same time. For this alone the movie is worth checking out, a must for horror fans &amp; gore hounds those who easily offended should give 'The Hills Have Eyes' a miss (Note torn Jaws poster apparently a dig at the movie suggesting 'T.H.H.E' is real terror!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, poor terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts pretty well. You feel there is room for a terror movie set in those hills in the middle of the desert. But as it goes you come disappointed with what is supposed to scare you.Why set a ridiculous accident to spark the movie? The trailer family aimed to go and see the old silver mine, so why not just get them there? (location trouble maybe)The villains are ridiculous too. Except for the dumb bald big boy which could have been better used if only shot more threatening. Why not use the dog as his animal arm to harass the poor naive guys lost in the desert?On the whole the movie fails because it goes on the verge of auto-spoof; an out-of-the-box tool for directors who are not sure they can be more scary as the story rolls out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive comments from this site I went ahead and bought a copy of the film off ebay. The acting in the film is average and a bit hammy, especially by the family of cannibals, one sequence comes to mind when Jupiter is ranting and raving to the burnt corpse, speaking right into the camera. Its one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor. Its also evidence of some of the worst editing I've seen, theres a terrible jump cut right in the middle of his "speech". There are a few creepy moments though, and at times the music works well...but overall the film isnt that great and I dont know why people think Wes Craven is that great of a director. Thus far he hasn't showed me anything that I believe to be brilliant, the only thing that improved with Cravens films, production to prodution was his budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry but this will have to be one of my negative comments. This movie had a great idea but it is so outdated I cant bear even to think about it. These people who are giving it such high ratings need to get up to speed with things, watch the 2006 remake and then you have a proper movie. If I could give this movie a lower rating, I would, I mean come on - why do you think Wes Craven did a remake????? I've seen many 70's horror movies that were a lot better than this. The acting is low class, the budget very low and bad directing but what would you expect from an old seventies movie, how you can even say this is a classic or a brilliant movie is beyond me. To all the people who rated this movie high, do yourself a favor and watch the remake and then you will know what I am talking about. Sorry Wes Craven but you made up for it with a brilliant remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hills Have Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one horror franchise that I was never really interested in exploring. Some of the things I heard about it was that is was disgusting, gritty and gruesome. While all those things can be good in a scary movie, from what I read, The Hills Have Eyes took it to the extreme. But I decided it was time to check it out and I'm glad I did. For what was supposed to be a extremely violent flick turned out to be a very watchable and satisfying horror film from Wes Craven. The plot is pretty straight forward. A family named the Carters get stranded in their RV in the desert while surrounded by a group of cannibals waiting to strike. The mom and dad are Fred and Ethel. Their two daughters are Lynne and Brenda. They have a son named Bobby, plus Lynne's husband Doug is along for the ride with their baby. Most of the movie revolves around the cannibals killing off the family members and surrounding them in the RV. One major point of the film is when two of them attack the RV and steal the baby. It is then up to the Carters to save the baby and kill or be killed.The Hills have Eyes isn't as gritty or as gruesome as I heard it would be. Much like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I thought it was more shocking then gory. The acting is very real from the family members, especially from Brenda (Susan Lanier). The back-story as to why the family exists is kind of weak. This old guy had a deformed son who he casted off in the desert when he was ten. The deformed son (who goes by the name Jupiter) has made a family of his own with a hooker he picked up, and they simply live off in the desert eating dogs and presumably other humans. They have two sons named Pluto and Mars, and a daughter named Ruby.I say the back-story is weak because much is left to be explained. Why are they out in the desert living like that? Why are Pluto and Mars deformed, but not Ruby? Why would a random hooker want to be with a guy like Jupiter? Plus, I call the family cannibals. That could be argued considering we never see them eat other humans, but it is assumed. So, many things left unexplained which is a downside. And the ending is not a very good one to people who are looking to have a film conclude by explaining what happened to the survivors. The gore that is in this is well done, but there isn't much of it. The deaths are shocking because of how sudden they occur, not by the brutality. Overall a good movie with some tense moments. Very shocking for its time (1977). I wish more could've been explained and a better ending would have helped, but good acting and good atmospheric fright helped.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal opinions on The Hills Have Eyes (1977)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. I haven't been able to pick a favorite horror film, since there are so many good ones, but this is my all time favorite ever since I first watched it. I loved it's first remake to, that's one of the few remakes I liked. It stuck with the original story, just added to it. The actor that played Pluto is one of my favorite actors, he's perfect for the horror acting job. Most people think that all that was makeup, but that's what he really looks like. I also like how they are just normal humans, nothing special or different about them. They can die like any normal human,unlike in the remake, how they are mutants that can get shot 6 times and still not die. This is some of the best 70's horror. Which in my opinion, is the best horror can offer. A must see for all horror fans. I also saw something about how people thought that the body of beauty was fake. Your an idiot if you thought that was fake. You could tell it was real. Beutie's body in the remake was fake, but not in the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Horror Movie that has a cult following</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite getting a lower score than it deserves, "The Hills Have Eyes" is a movie that is truly horrifying in every sense of the word. It is classic Wes Craven, who, despite some stinkers, is really a master of horror.The plot really is simple: A family are heading out on a vacation to California, but their car "breaks down" in the desert. Little do they know that they have strolled into the property of a family of cannibals. I think we all know what happens next.I'll start out by stating the only problem of the movie, and really, this goes for just about any horror movie: the stupidity of some of the characters. It really bugs me when a character goes off to look for something that hasn't come back in an hour. But, I guess that's what happens in horror films, and when you break down in the desert, what else can you do? So really it's not a big complaint.Other than that, I have nothing negative to say. The acting was great, and the scares were great. I was only scared once or twice, but hey, I still enjoyed them. The scariest part for me though is when two characters are shot with a baby in the room. A baby!!!!! This child is not even 2 years old, and it already has witnessed a murder! Wes Craven, you delivered it! All in all, a really good horror movie that got the remake treatment. In most cases, remakes are quite bad, but from what I heard, Alexandre Aja's remake is quite decent. This film truly shows that Craven, despite making some bad movies, is a master of horror. 8/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something scary in them there hills...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes has to be Wes Craven's take on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It certainly isn't as good as Tobe Hooper's masterpiece but it's nevertheless a pretty impressive horror film in its own right. Like TCM this one is about a group of city people who unfortunately come into contact with cannibalistic denizens from the remote backwoods of the American South West.The main strength of the film for me is in the family of primitives. They are an interesting creation, and definitely a little scary. Michael Berryman is as always pretty unforgettable as the bald-headed mentally deficient Pluto, while James Whitworth and Lance Gordon are pretty terrifying as the pair of savages known as, respectively, Jupiter and Mars. Craven also makes great use of the desolate mountain setting. It's very ominous and you can easily believe in the threat that lives in the hills. The film also takes it's time before introducing its family of horrors, this adds to the overall atmosphere of dread that slowly builds up over the course of the night from hell. It does have to be said that the film does lose a bit of its momentum once the initial night of terror ends. Once our heroes start to fight back against the villains the following day the intensity eases off somewhat. The film also, I suppose, asks questions such as is the ultimate savagery of the city family any more acceptable to that of the family of cannibals? Well, actually yes it is. They had it coming to them quite frankly.The Hills Have Eyes is a very worthwhile 70's horror film. It's a good example of American low-budget exploitation film-making and certainly shows that Wes Craven has some definite talent and ideas in this genre of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't call it one of the best horror movies I've seen but it was really enjoyable, I enjoyed almost every minute of it. It's probably because of the creepy atmosphere, which not many horror movies actually have, though I liked the remake, I wouldn't say that it succeeded at this point so well as this movie did. The story was great and kinda original for that time movies. If you have already seen a remake, I still suggest you to watch this one, though both movies are very similar and the remake has a much better effects, this movie is still creepier and more mysterious. Wes Craven did a great job as a director, though I liked A Nightmare on Elm Street better, this movie is also one of the best his works.</fullReview>

Anyhow the plot is original, the effects are fairly polished for it's time-frame, the acting is fairly good. It's a classic movie and I don't want to give too much away. Don't judge Craven by Shocker, People Under The Stairs or Deadly Friend because I heard they weren't too good. With Craven occasionally he will have a film gem, even though some of his stuff is admittedly ugly. I have Serpent and The Rainbow sitting here as well as The Last House on The Left and are up next for me to watch. Heard good things and it's what I am expecting. Anyway I made a short guide to show what people should watch. I don't believe the Hill's remakes are by Craven. Here's a run-down.The Hills Have Eyes (Original) - See it, it's a classic! 9/10 The Hills Have Eyes (Remake) - See it, it's done well. 8.5/10 The Hills Have Eyes 2 (Original) - A pile of crap, in all aspects. 4/10 The Hills Have Eyes 2 (Remake) - Ditto. 5/10 (For better+More effects)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically not as good as the remake, but very interesting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having first seen the great (though not perfect) remake made by Alexandre Aja, I really was interested in seeing the original. Of course, being a fan of horror movies, and of Wes Craven's movies in particular, I was aware of THHE, but I've always heard, that this is just a really mediocre movie, and that it was surprising, that the remake, while taking he same premise, has managed to become a really good film. Now, after finally having seen the original, I have to say - everything I've heard about it and its mediocrity is true. And yet...First of all, let me say that the original and the remake are indeed very similar. The characters of the Carter family are the same, the basic premise is the same, indeed the whole first half of both versions is pretty much identical. The big differences appear in the second half of both movies, and that's where the original THHE begins to be interesting. Now, don't get me wrong - Aja's remake is far superior, and not only because of the much better technical execution and the bigger budget. But the original had some really great ideas, that were dropped for the remake, and while I appreciate Aja's more complex story development and its darkly satirical, almost political context, I really think that Craven's also very dark and satirical, but also more anthropological approach to his movie made it at its core more disturbing, but also more believable.Craven's Carter family isn't as likable as the one in Aja's remake, so when their lives finally are in danger, the audience doesn't connect to them on the emotional level as much as with Aja's characters. But, on the other side, they are the more realistic family. An other important difference between the two versions of THHE are the villains. While in the remake the Carters are fighting against a bunch of mutated individuals, who just happened to live in the same city, the villains in the original are clearly shown as a degenerated FAMILY. And that is a really very interesting approach, which is completely lost in the newer film. In Craven's movie, there are two families, one the mirror image of the other, and both have the same goal - to fight for their survival. They have even more in common, but it's subtle - after viewing this movie and thinking about the two families I've noticed that they weren't that different from the start. That's why the Carter's are not as likable as in Aja's remake - Craven didn't want to just show some good people fighting against some bad people, but to further the commonness of the both sides. He shows us, that the capability and the willingness to become extremely violent is in every person and even more - it's a part of human nature in itself. Unlike many vigilante movies,and also Aja's remake, the original THHE is extremely pessimistic about this subject. That's why the last picture of the movie is a freeze frame of Doug furiously stabbing Mars - there is no redeeming for Doug for this killing, except his will to survive and protect his beloved ones - he has become not more than a desperate animal. The question that follows, is: Was he, or a human being in general for that matter, ever more than a desperate animal? Is the "good", civilized, suburban Carter family really that different from the degenerated desert freaks they have the misfortune to encounter? The only real difference between them appears to be the protective shell of civilization, which is quickly stripped off the Carters, once they are lost and alone in the desert.Now one could argue that Aja's movie achieves the same effect and provokes the same thoughts - but there IS a fundamental difference. Aja doesn't show Doug who becomes a monster, as does Craven, but Doug who becomes a HERO through becoming a monster. And after all the brutal killings that Doug is responsible of, he returns to the remains of his family as a hero and is looking forward to live on his civilized life. Essentially, Aja's movie shows an extraordinary development of an ordinary guy in an extreme situation. Craven shows us, that there is nothing too extraordinary about it - violence is a part of our nature. That's why his movie is more disturbing, and also more interesting than the remake, when it comes to the subject matter. But I can't deny the sheer visceral impact Aja's remake and its great technical execution made on me. After all is said and done, the newer film is the better one. It benefits from the beautiful work of the cameraman and overall from the higher budget. But I can't discard Craven's original because I can't help but think that this movie made (maybe even unintentionally) an interesting and provocative statement about the human beings, and it's a great pity that Wes Craven hadn't more money and also experience as a director to make his movie the definitive The Hills Have Eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hills Have Eyes was pretty good for it's time I'd day. It was shocking, violent and well weird. I didn't like this movie as much as the 2006 remake. I guess having mutants was just cooler in the remake. In this version we just have ugly looking people that are cannibals that live in the desert. There is still a rape scene, it's no where near as graphic as the 2006 version's though. Hills Have Eyes is a bit slow at times, but has some good action scenes near the end. One thing I really hated about this movie though, was the ending. It was just terrible and felt really rushed. The rest of the movie is fairly good though, but like I said earlier I prefer the remake over the original. I just think it had more action and was just done better. The Hills Have Eyes 1977 is still a classic though, and worth seeing if you enjoyed the remake. Michael Berryman does a great job at playing Pluto too, I found him to be pretty creepy in this movie.I give Hills Have Eyes a 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a family drives their way to California in the middle of nowhere, their car breaks down and decides to camp for the night to fix it. Unfortunately there is a family of mutant hillbillies waiting out there for their blood.One of the most influential and original horror movies of the 70's! Wes Craven who wrote and direct this movie which has became an instant cult favorite truly stands the test of time with disturbing atmosphere and it's gore. The film manages to be better then his previous "Last House on the Left" but manages to be better then that particular picture, Dee Wallace Stone and Michael Barryman ("The Devil's Rejects") who plays the odd-headed mutant named Pluto shines here in a memorable performance.The film nearly got an X rating due to it's intense violence but got an R-rating and became a drive-in hit, the recent remake was great but this is still the movie that is the pinnacle of killer hillbilly movies to come.Also recommended: "The Hills Have Eyes (2006)", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series &amp; 2003 remake plus The Beginning", "Re-Animator", "Mother's Day", "Tourist Trap", "High Tension", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Sleepaway Camp", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "The Last House on The Left", "Maniac (1980)", "Cannibal Ferox", "Friday The 13th", "Freddy Vs.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie over 25 years ago and time has not erased the memories of this sick, twisted effort from director Wes Craven. The basic plot of "The Hills Have Eyes" is that a family is traveling through a California desert when their vehicle breaks down, stranding them in the middle of nowhere (and remember, this is long before cell phones). They soon are being stalked and methodically murdered by a family of psycho inbred cannibals. This movie is incredibly violent and gory. It was truly terrifying, and I had trouble sleeping after I watched it, which I guess is the goal of true horror movies. I can honestly say that I will never watch this movie again, it was truly sick and is not for people who are weak stomached. If you are into truly violent, twisted movies, then you can't get them any better than this. Personally, I don't care for this type of horror, but if you are, then I can recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S10 Reviews: The Hills Have Eyes (1977)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Carter family is speeding through the Nevada desert on their way to California. As a gift for their 25th Anniversary Ethel and Big Bob got the deed to old abandoned silver mine, so they make a refueling pit stop so they and their son, daughters, granddaughter and a son-in-law could stretch their legs. But little do they know that hills surrounding them are full of maniac. A backwater cannibal clan has set their eyes on the Carters. When they are stranded in the middle of nowhere the situation becomes dire as they are forced to become like animals to protect their family.Wes Craven's fourth attempt at directing (Last House on the Left and uncredited stab at a porno flick with "Hills" producer Peter Locke, who knew) "Hills" is a simple down and dirty exploitation low-budget flick that at times can really get down to the nitty gritty. The movie has excellent photography and an occasionally unsettling musical score. The acting (including Dee Wallace's first foray into horror) is very good with most of the principals turning believable performances (especially the cannibals, they usually steal the show). "Hills" is one of Craven's best and a solid exploitation entry film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family (mother, father, 3 kids and son-in-law) are stranded somewhere in the desert. Then strange things start happening, as they are terrorized by some crazy desert people, including the guy from the Goonies!The movie is made 5 years after Cravens first classic The Last House On The Left, and is a little less grim. There's some funny stuff put in (in particular the way the bad guys are killed), although making it a bit lighter does take some of the eeryness away.There are enough silly moments (like the guy running his personal best in 100 metres after being stabbed in the knee) and lousy lines to call this a stinker, but I enjoyed it to a certain level. Not as powerfull as Last House though...5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Wes Craven and most of his work, but like some other directors (talented and un-talented) he didn't start off making the great American movie. "Last House on the Left" was horrible, and then came "The Hills Have Eyes," which wasn't as horrible, but only turned out to be OK. It's no "Scream" or "Nightmare on Elm Street." I found the film to be watchable, but there aren't too many thrills and chills until the last 20 minutes, which is the only point where it really takes off. Not to mention some of the acting is bad and there are a few cheesy lines of dialogue ("We're gonna be up s**t creek without a paddle"). At least the cannibals are pretty creepy. The music sounds like it came straight out a crappy old 50's sci-fi flick. I don't consider this to be Wes' best work, but many seem to disagree and some consider this to be a classic. Hey, there's no accounting for taste.My score: 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Texas Chainsaw Massacre-lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**definite spoilers**After breaking into horror films with the notorious "Last House on the Left," director Wes Craven made another attempt to corner the market with "The Hills Have Eyes." The film was an attempt to cash in on the success of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" by imitating the formula; a family is trapped in the desert wilderness on a cross-country trip, only to be stalked by another family--of cannibals. Who will survive and who will be someone's next lunch? The film has an eerie, desolate atmosphere, its low budget giving it a feel of gritty authenticity. It refuses to gloss over the violence, making everything feel nasty and queasy. However, it doesn't really work, despite its best efforts. Tobe Hooper's landmark film still holds up today, retaining its scares and creepiness. Craven's film has its moments, but doesn't have the same impact today. It often feels more like a pale copy than a genuine original.The cannibal family is often annoying, unlike the disturbing weirdoes in TCM. There are times when they arouse our irritation instead of fear or terror, which is not a good thing in a horror film. Leatherface could easily dispatch them in short time, period. However, the bald guy is kinda creepy (not to mention ugly) and is more worthy of being a horror movie killer. There are a couple of gory scenes that are genuinely cringe-inducing. One scene has an implied rape that makes one's skin crawl. I did like the way the family dog is incorporated into the film, actively fighting against the cannibals; he is truly angered at the death of the other dog and seeks revenge. Interesting plot device, though that has to be one smart dog. The performances are generally adequate.This film has gained a small cult following, but to me it isn't really worth checking out unless you're a horror fan. Its unoriginality and uneven pacing, among other things, have ensured that it has not aged very well, for the most part. Hooper never felt obligated to include an explosion in his film, but Craven apparently did, since he was willing to stretch out an already limited budget on a bit of pyrotechnics. There are isolated moments in this this minor thriller that hint at what could have been a more effective film. The stark location cinematography is an definite asset. All what they really needed was a little imagination and a bit of creative daring and we could really have had a winner here.** (out of ****)Released by Vanguard</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a notable improvement over Was Craven's first movie, "Last House On the Left" (Of course, after that movie anything would be an improvement). The film has a rather creepy premise and atmosphere and is somewhat more techically well-done than Craven's first feature. Not to mention more appropriate music this time around. The two major flaws I found with this movie are the obvious moral (asking the question of which family is more "civilized") and the sudden ending. It looked as if Craven had simply run out of ideas and decided to end the film. Still, a pretty good movie and definitely an improvement over "House."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, this movie by any means is not good, or unbearably bad either. It is just one of those kind of movies you are almost positive you will never watch again. Poorly made, no background information, and what is one of the most thrown together endings ever made... None of this helps matters at all.But, 'The Hills Have Eyes' has subject matter which is hardly ever delt with, and somehow does manage to scrounge up some suspence. Mainly the most annoying thing about this movie is the fact that it does not explain itself... and yes, it does need to. Movies like this have to in order for it to stay alive and this one almost crashed and burned terribly. Staying afloat only because of minor reasons that you would hate to put down.However one of Wes Craven's better efforts in his earlier days as a cheap film director... (Just look at the horrible movie 'Last House On the Left' and you will see what I'm talking about.) Reguardless of whatever was said about this movie It was a nice try, but I do not recommend this to everyone, only those who enjoy cheap horror movies and that don't mind getting majorly disapointed at the end when there could have been more to be easily expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently some movies get the "cult" status despite their evident lack of overall quality. Often the name of the director plays a huge role too, and I suppose that's the case for Wes Craven's Hills Have Eyes.The movie is just another low-budget 70s pseudo-horror flick, with all the pros and the cons of the genre.The pros are rather few, and sure don't make up for the amateurish and below-average acting, for the dull plot and for the uninspired and uninspiring action.The desert provides a good scenery for the story, but the "inbred monsters chasing retarded family" formula wears thin very quickly.Yet another "classic" which aged horribly but who'll get endless praise because of its cult following. It may have been shocking and groundbreaking 32 years ago, but now it just feels boring</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the remake of the Hills Have Eyes I saw a great movie. I looked and saw the second one came out in 07 so I rented the first and second originals. The first 30 minutes of this movie me and my brother were laughing at it. (Because of horrible acting) The "Mutants" have no resemblance to mutants. They look more like Native Americans. I know this was made in 77 but still they had special effects back then. My brother who hated the remake hated this one even more. I'm not even going to watch the 2nd original as I'm sure it will be the same. If you get this movie I suggest using the disc as a Frisbee because it will be more enjoyment the the actual movie. If you rent it leave the store and stick it in the slot. It is a waste of $6.00 or whatever it is where you live to rent movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic...good but not spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now let it be known that I did see the remake of this film first and LOVED IT!! (see my review) absolutely blown away by it so I finally sat down to watch the original and I was quite taken by how close the remake was to it's original. Many of the scenes and moments were kept in tact which is very impressive BUT the remake did some things (perhaps due to budget) that this original didn't quite accomplish that made it sub par compared to it's later version. The Hills Have Eyes regardless of which one you see was created by horror master Wes Craven. The bleak and empty setting of the desert creates an atmosphere for this families survival like nothing else could. Although not incredibly gory, and a very darkly shot film it creates a sense of terror and fear as this family is stalked by a completely insane man and his twisted family all groomed by him to kill anyone they want to get what they want.Robert Houston plays young Bobby Carter, the son who gets the job of protecting his family, in particular his mother and two sisters while his brother-in-law and father go looking for help after they crash their car and trailer in the desert. Houston does a decent enough job although again after seeing the remake I can't help but compare and he just doesn't have the intensity or emotion that Dan Byrd had in his role. Still he does a decent enough job. Susan Lanier, Martin Speer, Russ Grieve, Virginia Vincent and veteran B-Horror Movie actress Dee Wallace all round out the cast as the Carter family. I lump them all together without discussing their individual roles because they are all adequate but not outstanding. The story is really what holds the film together and the setting. What this family goes through is more important than the family itself and keeps the story riveting. James Whitworth, Lance Gordon, Michael Berryman, Janus Blythe, Cordy Clark, and the film's producer makes a small appearance as Mercury, Peter Locke. All these actors play the psychos. The killers trained and raised by their mentally deranged father who was outcast by his own father years earlier for being a freak. Although I think their characters are a little over utilized and now mysterious enough they still play their vicious roles well enough. Everyone does their part if not only adequately.I do not for one minute try to talk down this film's classic status. I just discovered that there is a sequel made in 1985 with many of the same cast members and whether it's bad or good I am absolutely DYING to see it. I loved The Hills Have Eyes and it showed a talent in new film maker Wes Craven who went on to completely revolutionize the horror film with Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream and more. The Hills Have Eyes is definitely on par with what The Texas Chainsaw Massacre had done several years earlier but with not nearly as much gore. The Hills Have Eyes works at scaring you by setting up a presence, send a chill up your spine it's far more psychological. So what did the new one do that this old one didn't?? Well the new one established characters so well...made each one of them so real and important and they had such progression. Also I felt the story was better written. In this original it was simply a deranged man who was never quite right and ended up raising a family in the desert but in the new one you have the Government nuclear testing that caused their extreme mutation also adding in some brutal special effects that were disgusting and chilling. Now I do not in any way blame the film makers of the original because they shot this entire film on a budget of 230 thousand dollars and the remake budgeted 11 MILLION!! Small difference there. This is a must see for horror fans because it's a classic and will definitely leave you jumping, it's dark and scary and it's a must see. But I also insist you see the remake which will blow your mind if you even enjoy this one a little!!! Can't wait to see the sequel!! Stay tuned!! 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, the American family barely got through this one, and not without casualties. I've seen our moms and dads, buds and sis's, menaced by lots of critters, but this is first time they almost ended on a dinner table. Not that the cannibal primitives that menace them use anything like a table. Looks like they prefer big rocks instead. Okay, with names like the planets we don't expect the queen's court. But this grotesque clan makes you wonder about evolution itself. So, can our all-American family survive this trip to the desert and the cannibals that live there.Great horror flick. Director Craven not only builds suspense, but also shocks the bejesus out of us. And what about Berryman as the deformed Pluto. His no-makeup close-ups are really jarring, making the whole deal seem real. No doubt about it, he really deserved a big payday. In fact the whole cast deserved combat pay. What with crawling all over that lunar landscape, the bandage concession must have been huge. Kudoes too to the normal folks, who get to do a lot of screaming and running, uphill and down. And I like the way the helpless girl turns it around at the last minute. Should please feminists in the audience. Too bad the old gas station coot is often overlooked. He's enough to make you want to run out of gas. Plus, Virginia Vincent is the most realistic looking corpse I've seen in decades of movie viewing. I hope it was just makeup.No doubt about it, the 90-minutes really delivers the goods for horror fans. The result amounts to a triumph of directing and staging, though the acting does wobble at times. Meanwhile, I'm canceling my trip to the desert, in fact, make that any desert, any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Milestone in 70s Exploitation Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven is, to me, probably the greatest director of horror ever. The volume of work that he's been able to produce, combined with the fact that he's been able to do quality work decade after decade puts him above just about anyone, in my book. He was at the absolute height of his powers here as he was releasing classic after classic and this movie is no exception.The film shares a lot of thematic similarity to his previous movie LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. In both movies you have the idea of a group of savage villains with no redeeming qualities at all laying siege to wholesome family types. The conflict between that ultimate good and ultimate evil sets up the reveal that no one is all good and even the most pure can be pushed to savagery in the wrong conditions. These elements are put to much further extreme in LAST HOUSE and toned down (some) in this movie, yet are still there for sure. Some would expound that this comes from the recent events in Vietnam and the atrocities that our soldiers were forced to witness (and participate in), though only Craven could tell you for sure if this is intentional. .In Craven's own words he had been highly influenced by Texas CHAINSAW a few years prior. So the end result is the themes of LAST HOUSE mixed with the messed up cannibal clans of TCM and you get this instant classic. It's depraved and sadistic and violent and no one escapes from the movie unscathed and unchanged. It's also a masterwork in atmosphere. Long before the cannibals ever show their faces, Craven has established an unsettling feeling using the harsh desert as his canvas. Even if you knew nothing of the movie going into it and knew nothing of what was going to happen, you immediately get the sense that this night is not going to go well for the family.There are certainly a lot of taboos here, with Craven willing to kill dogs, kidnap babies, rape young women, burn old men and touch on incest along the way, as well. Yet, despite its' reputation, there is also some amount of reservation, as well. He could have pushed things much further and many of its' legion of imitators have done that and more. It's certainly exploitative without ever feeling trashy.It has, maybe, not aged as well as some of its' contemporaries like TCM and HALLOWEEN and doesn't always share the same legendary status that it once did with those movies, but make no mistake. This is one of the best horror movies the 70s had to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A happy family on their way to California stop at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere to get gas and directions to an old silver mine that they want to see as part of their trip. The man there warns them to not go to the mine and just stick to the main road. They, of course, don't and soon have an accident which snaps one of their cars axles. Far removed from civilization and unsure of what to do they soon realize that they should have listened to the warning given to them.As with many low-budget horror movies in the seventies this one at times cheesy and has very apparent limitations, but manages to pull itself together pretty well despite those limitations. There are some disturbing scenes of gore and that classic relentless feeling that has come to define the fear instilled in most of todays horror films. Wes Craven does a good job at setting up the film, but after that, the movie falls into some problems that bring it down from the other movies of its time.The first of these is the atmosphere and mystery element. That movie begins with it, but then as the relentlessness kicks in, just flat out abandons it. There is also to much of a focus on the savages in the hills and this takes the protagonists characters from the focus of the film as there are two groups of people now. This detracts from what could have been a good survival horror movie and brings it into the territory of "the city people" vs "the country people." If the savages weren't shown as much that would make the film slightly less visceral, but would leave you wondering just who the hell they are and where they came from. Their pretty prominent screen time doesn't make them at all frightening by end, you just end up being disgusted with them, their existence and just hope they get killed in some brutal fashion.I can't say that that last hope doesn't go unfulfilled, but it is also played out worse then it could have been by the end. There is no atmospheric close or anything to the film. Closure isn't always good, especially in a horror movie where the film's main force is often the open and creepy ending, but here we don't get that. On the flip side, the ending is quite unexpected that is not wholly a bad thing.OK flick worth checking out for genre fans. 5/10Rated R: grisly violence and a rape</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes is a horror film, made by Wes Craven the same director that brought us A Nightmare On Elm Street, and Scream. I was excited to watch The Hills Have Eyes, after hearing so many good things about the original film, I finally decided it was time to check the film out. The film's plot is that a family's car breaks down in an area that is closed off from the public, this area is inhabited by wild savages who are ready to kill, and so this starts the film.Without giving to much away, the film opens up to a slow but great start, the film actually develops the characters before killing them, which is a nice thing to see compared to other horror films, which just kill of characters for the sake of it. Of course the family's car gets broken down, in an area that just happens to be closed to the public and inhabited by these savages, who let's just say aren't the nicest of people, you'll ever meet. The killing's do start fairly early on, with the first one being the death of one of the dog's in the film, I'm not going to say which dog, but the death itself is actually a bit sad, even if you don't see the dog actually being killed. You do see the aftermath of it though, and it is quite brutal, I think this scene worked well because you don't the dog being killed, instead Wes Craven leaves it up the view to imagine it, this worked so perfectly. After the dog's death, more deaths begin to happen of course, and this is where the film just starts becoming a blood bath sorta speak. The motives are the savages aren't really anything else, other then them wanting to kill the family, so their motives are rather simple.Now the acting in this film, while not horrible, is still bad even for a 1977 film. I have to point out that half the time, the woman in this film were screaming, and not in a good way either. This is what bothered me most about the acting, the fact that everyone was screaming all the time, even if it was only a small thing, I get it that this is a horror film. But is there really a need to have people screaming all the time? I honestly think that this is the biggest problem with the film, is the acting is bad. Now while some of the acting is decent, most of it just bad, the only actors that were actually good in this, were the savages themselves, that's saying something.The movie is a pretty decent film, but I'd say only watch it if your a Wes Craven fan, because chances are if you didn't like his other films, then your certainly not going to like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has probably been 3 or 4 years since my first viewing of "The Hills Have Eyes," via an old Magnum Video cassette. I had, of course, heard very good things about the film, but was ultimately disappointed with the overall result: the acting was poor, the cannibals campy, and the climactic battle unwisely set during daylight hours (thus eroding the overall suspense factor). Flash forward 2 or 3 years, to my excited expectations for the Alexandre Aja ("High Tension")-directed remake of "Hills," which turned out to be a great horror film in addition to a remake that actually eclipsed (pardon the pun) its source. For some reason, my delight at the remake persuaded me to give the original another look, and needless to say, I was much more impressed than during my previous viewing. Perhaps my appreciation for American horror in the 1970s has deepened (ditto my respect for Wes Craven's contributions to that era), or my respect for horror in the new millennium has merely declined (not that it was very favorable to begin with). Whatever the reason, "Hills '77" is still relevant and worth a look, even in the wake of its more technically-proficient progeny.At this point, the story is familiar to the point of cliché, but Craven's setup is something of bizarre (if borrowed) genius: two generations of the Carver family, driving cross-country to check out a silver mine they've inherited, trailer and 2 dogs ("Beauty" and "Beast") en tow, take the infamous "wrong turn" off the main highway and are met with a broken axle in the middle of the desert. But it turns out the totaled car is the least of their worries, for an inbred clan of scavenging savages is living in the imposing, mountainous hills...and they'll eat whatever meat they can find. We follow cannibal and normal alike over the course of 2 days that become an intense battle for survival. But--to quote a character from another flesh-eating allegory--"Who are the REAL cannibals?" While purportedly inspired by the real-life case of the Sawney Bean Family, Craven's screenplay and directorial style (even some of the scoring and sound effects) echoes Tobe Hooper's similarly-themed "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but blended with the "you-are-there" snuff-film documentary style he brought to 1972's brilliant "Last House on the Left." His compositions are often chillingly effective, from faces hidden behind bushes in the dark, brief flashes of characters running in the background, intimidating extreme close-ups, and the minimal use of artificial light during the soul-deadening nighttime sequences. Only in moments of poor, over-the-top acting does the film lose its bearings--otherwise, it's as viscerally urgent as Hooper's film (maybe even more so).That being said, some of the weaknesses I encountered during my years-ago viewing still remain, albeit more forgivably. The cannibal family, when given more than a few seconds of screen time, lapse into high camp; and more so, these characters, intended to be menacing, become much less so the more we see them (at their worst, they look like rejected extras from "Deliverance"). While their dialog is often tinged with a macabre (and sometimes ill-advised) humor, the cannibal clan often feels like a bunch of retrograde survivalists with bad teeth. While "Hills '06" made the family so inbred and (very thoroughly) irradiated only a select few could even utter coherent syllables, Craven's angle is that of a mere "wild child" dumped in the desert, who therefore propagated a feral family...problem is, their dialog (even utilizing slang terms) rings false. This is a minor complaint, granted, but it slackens some of Craven's otherwise spot-on realism.Additionally, the Carvers are presented as the idyllic nuclear family, a regular slice of Americana. While some of the actors appear too old for their roles, everyone has a keen eye for emotional reactions (whether this is deliberate or a result of inexperience is a moot point), probably best exhibited in the aftermath of a gruesome siege on the trailer. Craven's juxtaposition of the Carvers against the cannibals (named after planets) is far from subtle, especially when the "normal" humans reveal their own savagery, but it does show that he has intentions greater than mere exploitation or horror; the inclusion of a sympathetic cannibal named Ruby (Janus Blythe, who also appeared in the beyond-inferior "Hills" sequel) provides a link to civilization that further confounds the black-and-white sense of morality usually found in a film of this nature.The ironic chain that led me to give "Hills '77" another shot (didn't like it the first time; liked the remake; liked it on second glance) resulted in a satisfying re-appraisal of what I once considered an easily-dismissible (and generally overrated) footnote in Wes Craven's filmography. It certainly heralds from his most prolific era, and Anchor Bay's nice--but not TOO nice--remastering job preserves the grainy documentary style that transports us back to 1977 with devilish glee.</fullReview>

The acting was pretty bad, and the directing wasn't much better. Flashing from one scene to the next often felt uncoordinated. There were times when the flow of things weren't entirely coherent as poor choices led to plot inconsistencies, laughable dialogue, and a lack of direction that had its effect on every aspect of the film.

		<fullReview>In my eyes, Wes Craven has only really made two definite horror classics. Them being "A Nightmare On Elm Street" and the "Scream" franchise. Everything else he's done hasn't been awful! But it's not the best, however I'm sure when "The Hills Have Eyes" came out, it was a big shock and unforgettable. however in the dawn of the new millennium, "The Hills Have Eyes" has little that is shocking about it and is forgettable amidst bigger shockers and more disturbing films such as "Martyrs", "A Serbian Film" or even "The Human Centipede".Aja's remake in my opinion is one hell of a lot better than this original. Although Wes' idea is good and original Aja manages to drive the narrative further, creating a visual feast as well as well-written characters and atmosphere. What annoys me in this one is the fact that the villainous family aren't deformed! In fact, there is nothing in this film about being on a nuclear testing ground which is what gave the remake such an edge! Here, they're just savage cave men! Wes also rushes into everything too quickly. Aja took his time, building up atmospheric tension and letting us delve deeper into the characters. Unfortunately Wes delves too quickly into it without adding anything more than what the remake already gave us. The family is a bit annoying in this with the anti-hero Doug being nowhere near as likable as Doug in the remake. The caravan invasion scene isn't as shocking and is directed messily. For the majority of the film it does seem like people running through the desert away from cannibals in loin-cloths.However, everything bad aside, it is actually an entertaining ride. The action is pacey and most of the characters are well characterised and people who we can care about. I can also understand how people can get scared as well with the cannibals being quite unhinged and desperate.So although it could've afforded to be gorier and have some cleaner directing and with better characters. It's still entertaining and well worth checking out if you're a fan of the remake, horror or even Wes Craven himself. The remake perfected this good attempt. Watch that one first!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously preferred the remake over this one. I saw the remake first, and thought it was pretty decent. After seeing this, it didn't turn out like I thought it would. Both are similar to each other, but the other just went more smooth and was more intense. This one rushes through a little bit, and the suspense isn't as strong, nor is the horror when it begins.An American family become stranded in the middle of nowhere, and become the victims of a tribe of cannibalistic humans.A lot of people say that between a movie and its remake, whichever one I saw first is usually the better one. That might be why I like the remake better, because it was too different from the remake. Kind of like how if people saw this first, they would like it best. But anyway, for this film, it didn't really do it for me.In the remake, the mutants are actual mutants. In this one, their not really mutants, their just cannibalistic humans. They don't look the least bit mutated. Plus they talk and have conversations, which takes away from the terror. The zombies in Night of the Living Dead didn't talk, which made them really scary. Sure they talk in the remake, but not as much. It was just trying to follow this one. But it made necessary changes without changing too much.I didn't get the ending. Why was it so rushed? Sure his baby was saved and he killed off all the cannibals, but did it really have to end on spot? It wouldn't kill Wes Craven to add a little bit more of an ending, like the remake. It at least shows them regrouping together. Thats all the ending needed.Anyway, simply inferior to the remake, this film is not Wes Craven's best. It just didn't work out for me like the remake did. But i'm sure if I saw this one first, I would have liked it better. But all together, it just didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing... Wow... The remake is actually better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to watch this after having watched the 2006 remake on channel 4 and it is probably the first time I've ever said it, I think the remake is actually better, but that is not to say this is a bad film. If you're interested in 70's horror you probably don't want to miss this one. If like me you're not, and just like watching a good film regardless of the genre, then don't bother. The film has good moments but as a whole it is badly put together and the acting is hit and miss. It takes 40 minutes or so setting up the story, then has a fast past action scene in which the "Eyes" of the title attack the Carter family (not the band), and then the last 30mins are rushed and the film is suddenly cut dead in it's tracks. You could say it leaves you wanting more but for me it just felt like an anticlimax. Craven could have done with making this film another 20mins longer at least to even out the ending. I guess maybe he got bored? I don't know... If it wasn't for the dogs in this film it would be a total waste of time. The two German Shepherds, named Beauty and... Beast, are far finer actors than any of the humans, but, alas Craven even manages to ruin that. At first I had sympathy for the Carter Family and their plight, but after hearing them laugh at how one of there dogs killed a poodle I felt like, if that is any kind of insight into their mindset, they pretty much deserve everything they get. The film did have some ingenious ideas like the exploding camper van but the only reason I knew how that worked was because of the remake. The audience is not engaged enough. Over all it is outdated, patchy, and doesn't stand the test of time.If you haven't seen this film then skip this and watch the 2006 remake which Wes Craven had a hand in and is far better. If you have seen the film, and liked it, again, watch the 2006 remake, and if you can't see how the remake is better then you are an idiot...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE HILLS HAVE EYES (Wes Craven, 1977) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite owning Anchor Bay's 2-Disc Set for close to two years, it's only now that I managed to catch up with this horror 'classic' ? which had been the missing link for me from among all those seminal releases that the genre spawned throughout the 1970s; consequently, I also hadn't watched the 2006 remake ? even if I mildly liked its director Alexander Aja's SWITCHBLADE ROMANCE (2003).Anyway, while I concede that the original is perhaps genre exponent Craven's best work, I can't deny being slightly let down by the film: the desert setting is notable and the action of its latter stages effectively handled?but, despite a plethora of mutant cannibals for villains (in itself, a neat concept), what we see is never really scary or even very disturbing! This is all the more baffling when considering that Craven's preceding film had been the notorious THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972); that said, some of the death scenes here are remarkably vicious (such as that of the old man at the derelict service-station) ? while others are just plain bizarre (the one devised for the head of the city-folk, a retired cop crippled by a heart condition, and Mars' own at the very end).The premise of having a group of stranded travelers at the mercy of a family of maniacs is obviously reminiscent of Tobe Hooper's THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974), another influential (with numerous sequels, prequels and remakes to its name) genre outing from this same creative era which, ironically, also didn't quite impress me as much as I had anticipated ? though, cumulatively, it's an altogether more intense experience than Craven's film. While the cannibal family (many of whom are named after planets!) ? and especially Michael Berryman's lanky and odd-looking Pluto ? have acquired iconic status, their characterization is rather sketchy; John Steadman as the old man and Janus Blythe's Ruby, then, appear as the human members of the clan ? who are resented and eventually attacked by their own kin for being 'soft-hearted'.Still, the victims don't fare much better (the impossibly na?ve mother being a liability above all) ? and their final dehumanization, not to mention resourcefulness in the face of crisis, isn't exactly believable if inevitable so as to generate the requisite crowd-pleasing heroics. One of the latter folk is played by Dee Wallace, soon to tackle the lead role in Joe Dante's THE HOWLING (1981) ? curiously enough, yet another popular horror title which doesn't do much for me! Incidentally, Craven states that his intention with the film was to blur the line between Civilization and the wilderness: symbolizing this is the fact that the travelers' Alsatian dogs ? which play a major role in the proceedings ? are called Beauty and Beast and, while the former quickly (and gruesomely) expires at the villains' hands, the latter repeatedly triumphs over them! By the way, I followed the film with its much inferior (and partly recycled) sequel ? made by Craven himself and featuring three cast members (four, if you include Beast) from the original; see my comments about it elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tagline: the lucky ones died...before watching this.I've never watched a Bulgarian movie from 1920's, so I can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but it surely is the worst movie I've ever watched. I can't almost remember it.All I can recall is a family of stupid people who don't do anything right. Their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand, so they decide that there's nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. Then there's an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the police.And, speaking of the police...if those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years, lots of people must have disappeared...how come the sheriff didn't suspect anything?But I gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so. The rest is bore. An hallucinated unbelievable bore.I will be merciful and won't speak about the dialogues. And the acting. And the effects.I will only mention the final scene, where the freak girl eliminates a snake (the snakes! they come out in the end, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with a sniper-precise throw of a stone, demonstrating the full disregard of Mr. Craven for reality and for things that happen on planet Earth in general.I believe there have been riots when the film was first released in 1977.Even being eaten by a cannibal wouldn't be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to tell you the truth, I saw the remake before I saw the original Hills have Eyes, because I couldn't find the original to rent. Probably because when the remake came out, probably everyone wanted to see it too, but still I'm judging this movie like I saw it first. Wes Craven is today's master of horror, he knows how to take the most common problems and makes them into ultimate tales of horror. The movie's main motto in my opinion is survival.This family is on vacation in the desert, but they get into an accident and slide off the road. They are in the middle of nowhere and can't get a connection on their radio, so naturally, the father goes back to a gas station on foot to get help. But there is one problem, inbred cannibals have their eyes on his family and plain on having them for dinner! This movie is terrifying and I would recommend it, it was a harrowing and nasty little piece of film that is now a legend! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Hills Have Eyes" is one of Craven's few undisputed masterpieces.**SPOILERS**A couple, Ethel (Virginia Vincent) and Rob Carter, (Russ Grieve) their daughter Lynne (Dee Wallace-Stone) and her husband Doug Wood (Martin Speer) as well as their children travel through the desert on the way to California. After being accidentally lead into a military testing zone, they become stranded in the middle of nowhere. Trying to make the best of the situation, Bob decides to leave to get help, leaving son Bobby (Robert Houston) in charge, which infuriates sister Brenda (Susan Lanier). As night falls, they become convinced they are being stalked by a family of freaks living in the desert preying on families who become lost, and are forced to fight back to save themselves.The Good News: The one thing I really like about this movie is the gradual formation of suspense as we get to discover who's attacking the family. Being trapped on an open road in the middle of nowhere is a pretty terrifying ordeal for anybody, and here, Craven forces upon us the ultimate traveling nightmare. The darkness that surrounds the family is terrifying, as anyone or anything can hide in there and creep out to injure or kill them. This film provides that fear in spades, as tons of times we see or hear all these sights and sounds that would terrify any sane person. The one scene that really got me was watching one of the characters run down the highway in the dark as these crazy laughs were heard echoing alongside him. That was a pretty terrifying ordeal, and it only gets better from there. The event that kick starts the film into overdrive is one of the most horrendous acts ever committed to screen, and the audacity to pull it off and make it be as stunning and striking as it is a huge testament to the genius of Craven. To do something like that is pretty ballsy, and it also works in his favor to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. By subjecting this scene to us, we play into his hands because now, we don't know what else he will throw at us and we become anxious and nervous as the waiting game begins. If he pulls that on us, what else will he do, and that is a trick from a master filmmaker. The best part of the film is the events that follow after the aforementioned great shock, as it kicks the movie up a little and gets very exciting. After that, the film is all action until the last second of the film, and that appeals to me. It isn't so much a horror film as it is a horror-thriller with action overtones, and to successfully switch over is a great trick, since it works wonderfully. Also great is the family that serves as the protagonists. They have a creepy air around them that makes us all become scarred of them. Their look is the main part, as they look positively crazy. Adorned with all kinds of feathers and deformed features, the family is crazy personified and is a look and behavior that only "The Devil's Rejects" have been able to top, so this is one large feet. Their behavior is also a large part of their creepiness, as they behave like true deranged people would. The family is one of the best parts of the movie.The Bad News: About the only thing I can find fault with this movie is the non-traditional storyline. Most slashers work by having a group of people trapped in an isolated area getting picked off one-by-one. This one isn't like that: a group of people is trapped in an isolated area and are picked off in one scene and features the victims turning against the killers.The Final Verdict: This one is pretty underrated and features a lot of genuine suspense that catches viewers off-guard. It has a terrifying storyline that works for many people and delivers shock after shock. Highly recommended for fans of this type of slasher, while others maybe disappointed with the non-traditional slasher story.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, an after effect of a dead animal, attempted rape and scenes with children in danger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craven's cannibal clan classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977, whilst nine-year-olds like myself were being thrilled by George Lucas's Star Wars, adults cinema-goers seeking an adrenalin rush and a brush with the dark-side were flocking to see Wes Craven's low budget horror The Hills Have Eyes.Craven's second movie, after the exploitative Last House on the Left, is a classic slice of 70s screen terror and is definitely one of the most influential of the period, although it does lack the shock factor of the director's debut, and the relentlessly grim atmosphere of the similarly themed Texas Chainsaw Massacre.When a family travelling to California decide to take an unscheduled trip to a remote silver mine and crash their car, they end up fighting for their lives against a savage cannibalistic clan. After a gruelling night of horror during which several of the stranded travellers are killed, the surviving family members (including a loyal Alsation dog) fight back.The talented cast of relatively unknown actors give credible performances and Craven's direction, which seems more polished than on his debut, makes the most of the remote location, carefully building the tension. However, the movie does lose some of its brooding menace once the members of the cannibal family are revealed in all of their glory; some tawdry costumes and comical makeup (curly wigs, blacked out teeth) give the clan a less than terrifying demeanour. And while I'm having a bit of a gripe, I also thought that the film ended a tad abruptly!Whilst not exactly the solid-gold classic that some claim it to be, The Hills Have Eyes is nevertheless an entertaining movie that should be seen by all fans of 70s horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of Craven's best, but good of it's type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest Horror directors really love to get us at our most vulnerable points. This can be done in so many ways, which is part of what makes these films so much fun. Sometimes they really push the envelope and spark controversy, like Wes Craven did with his debut film 'The Last House on the Left.' Critics weren't exactly kind to it, but audiences across the globe must have loved it because it was a success at the Box Office. It would be five years before he would get another job, but when he did he would introduce us to a different kind of horror. After all these years, and compared to a lot of Craven's later work, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is far from being a classic, but isn't one to write off either.Pros: Acting is fine all across the board. Simple, effective score. Gorgeous cinematography. Has a nice gritty look and feel to it. Some harrowing sequences. Pace picks up for the action-packed second half. The desert clan is a freaky bunch that you wouldn't want to run into. A feeling of unease hangs over the whole film.Cons: Not much plot to speak of. First half really drags at times. Some of the dialogue really could have used some polishing up. Abrupt ending. Not exactly groundbreaking.Final thoughts: Like the similar 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' this movie was loosely based on a true case. It's also frighteningly realistic like that film, and I wouldn't call it a rip off, but it isn't one of the all time greatest of the genre. There is much to praise here, but there are enough faults to keep this from being way above average. Still if you're a fan of the director and the genre it's worth seeing at least once.My rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit first that I saw the remake before this original, so I was a little dubious as to which one I would prefer, but I kept in mind that this one featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, from director Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream). Basically the Carter family are travelling by car with caravan through the deserts of California travelling on vacation, and they stop at an isolated gas station. The family are retired detective father Big Bob Carter (Russ Grieve), his wife Ethel (Virginia Vincent), son Bobby (Robert Houston), daughters Brenda (Susan Lanier) and Lynne (E.T.'s Dee Wallace Stone), with son-in-law Doug Wood (Martin Speer) and their baby daughter Katy. The old gas station owner Fred (John Steadman) warns them to stay on the main road if they want to get to where they're going, but they ignore this, take what they think is a short cut and wreck the caravan. They don't realise that they have gone into an area going through a nuclear testing site, and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere with a walkie talkie radio not responding to calls. Bob and Doug go to find help from somewhere, with Bob getting kidnapped by the crazed mutated people, a family, living in the rocky hills, they have obviously been mutated by nuclear means. Doug returns to the caravan after seeing one of the two dogs dead and slaughtered in the hills, and soon enough the rest of the family suffer an attack by the mutated people. These hideous psychotic people also happen to be cannibals, so when they savagely kill the Carter family members one by one they plan to eat them. They are very pleased to be getting a baby to eat, so the remaining people still alive obviously fight for survival and go to rescue the child. In the end, the remaining family members do manage to kill a few of the mutated people, with the help of one of them turning nice, and the film ends with pretty much the main one having his sight turn red with blood. Also starring James Whitworth as Jupiter, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's high fore headed Michael Berryman as Pluto, Janus Blythe as Ruby, Lance Gordon as Mars, Peter Locke, or Arthur King as Mercury and Cordy Clark as Mama. The mutated people aren't as impressive as the remake's, but they are creepy, the gore amount is slightly less, and the scare factor is about the same, I can't really say which of the two I prefer, this one is a worthwhile horror. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to Wes Craven's acclaimed horror classic, but for me I think it was too late. It's one of those unfortunate cases where, having been so hit over the head by so many subsequent remakes, sequels, rehashes and ripoffs, that what might once have been so fresh came off as a little routine. But it's certainly much better than the needless remake (BOMB), which I stupidly went to see before I saw Craven's film. The original's got some intense moments, is better directed, and the cast is better than in the re-do. I almost gave it a solid three stars except that the abrupt ending really stank. It's not that I mind negative endings (hell, I think NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD's is excellent) but this one here really spoiled the momentum. On the DVD there was an alternate climax which reversed a couple of scenes and added a new "upbeat" conclusion, and I think it worked better for this particular film. Oh, and I have to say I felt so sorry for the little baby that's constantly crying and was probably scared as hell in this film, the poor thing. I wouldn't be surprised if she's scarred for life. Michael Berryman is creepy looking, but here again I've seen him so many times since the film that the effect wasn't as strong. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This often-hailed "cult" film from 1977 was clearly no Texas Chainsaw Massacre.To me, The Hills Have Eyes lacked plenty, especially the essential ingredient of heart-pounding brutality that's a necessary requirement of any good horror film of this one's grim nature. In my opinion, this film was far from deserving the special status of being ranked right up there as a genuine horror-movie cult classic.Besides all of the hammy acting that seemed to prevail, the clan of repulsive, inbred maniacs in the story were such a bunch of bungling idiots that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at their dim-witted behavior. Their goofy shenanigans, at times, bordered right on the very edge of pure slapstick comedy.The Hills Have Eyes was the sort of film that just couldn't build and sustain even the slightest bit of genuine suspense and terror because the viewer could plainly see everything coming a mile down the road, well in advance.In its time The Hills Have Eyes may have been considered a real "shocker", but that ain't the case today. I cannot believe that this bit of so-so horror-movie mediocrity actually spawned a sequel, and, even worse yet, a frickin' remake.Here is my version of The Hills Have Eyes' finale in a nutshell - Stab!

		<shortDescription>The Hills Have Eyes, But Maybe Not Much Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the way to California, a family has the misfortune to have their car break down in an area closed to the public, and inhabited by violent savages ready to attack.This film is marketed as a "sequel of sorts to Last House on the Left"... and was made before Wes Craven really blew up with "Nightmare on Elm Street" and still had to rely on a very low budget. Of the three, this is the weakest. We, the audience are promised violence, gore and rape. Not that we need lots of violence, gore and rape -- but why promise us what you cannot deliver? There was no rape or nudity of any kind, and the violence was minimal. The only gore at all involved a dog biting a man's foot (which was gross, but nothing shocking).The story itself is pretty standard for horror movies. A family is stranded in a remote location (a desert) and mentally unhinged killers decide to close in on them. This is also an early theme of Craven's -- taking a nuclear family, putting them into some sort of twisted situation, and watching them try to fight back to preserve the family. In interviews, Craven has called "Hills" his take on "The Grapes of Wrath", and some have called it an anti-western.I was also misled about the film having "inbred cannibals"... although there were some cannibals (which we never see being cannibalistic), the story given to us in the film said nothing of them being inbred. As near as I could tell, they were more or less recruited into the group, not born. But I guess you do not have to actually tell the truth about your movie if you want people to see it.Horror fans will love seeing Michael Berryman and Dee Wallace in early roles. Wallace, who has gone on to be huge, previously had a smaller role in "The Stepford Wives", but that was about it. Berryman (who is the nicest guy you ever want to meet) has successfully turned this into a career choice.Craven has reflected thoughtfully on the film, saying the Roman names of the cannibal family "represented bodies of great force, tremendous power." He also suggests a new kind of morality with the cannibals because "there was nothing devious about them. They made no pretense."I should also single out art director Robert A. Burns, who had previously worked on "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and would later do "Tourist Trap", "Re-Animator" and "The Howling". He died in 2004 at age 60, and I think he never really became well-known, even among horror fans. Constructing props for Hooper, Craven, Gordon and Dante... this guy should be saluted.Overall, the film is okay. It is definitely still one of the better films from Wes Craven, and one of the best horror films you will find for 1977, in the pre-horror-crazed 1980s. If you run across this one, a rent is not a bad idea. Do not go out of your way, but do not pass the film by, either.Fans of the film need to get the DVD or Blu-ray, if for no other reason than the audio commentary with Craven and producer Peter Locke. There are plenty of stories of working the low budget horror scene of the 1970s...</fullReview>

They eventually end up wrecking their car and soon a group of cannibals from the hills are attacking them.Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES is to me one of the greatest horror films of the decade and also one of the rawest. Craven had previously made THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and when you compare the two films it's easy to see a certain vision on the screen. Craven's ability to make both film seem real and make both of them so raw and powerful really speaks to his talent and especially when you consider the budgets that he was working on. LAST HOUSE is a real mixed film as far as I'm concerned but everything came out perfectly with HILLS and that's why it remains so powerful no matter how many times you see it.There are a few sequences here that are so full of terror that you can't help but get curled up or be on the edge of your seat. The first time is when the attack finally happens on the family. When you really sit back and think about this sequence it's really amazing how much stuff is going on and how well the editing brings it all together. You've got stuff going on outside the trailer as well as inside the trailer. In both cases multiple things are happening and with so much going on it just keeps building the tension level.The second sequence happens during the extended ending where the family must fight for their lives. Again, multiple things are going on at once and the way Craven plays this sequence and the earlier one just makes things so suspenseful that you can't help but feel the terror.Of course, the terror only works if you care for the people you're watching. There's quite a bit of character development here as the start of the film gives you plenty of time to get to know this family, care for them and want to see them survive. Caring about the family really helps once they come under attack. It also helps that the performances are so good. Dee Wallace, Susan Lanier, John Steadman, Robert Houston are all extremely good as are the "other" family played by James Whitworth, Michael Berryman and Janus Blythe. It also doesn't hurt that we're given some realistic cinematography that puts you right there in all the action and the music score is one of the best out there for a horror movie.THE HILLS HAVE EYES is in my opinion Craven's masterpiece. Yes, there are a few flaws here and there but the power of the film is unquestionable and it's this terror that makes the film so memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good of Its Kind But What's That Really Saying?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of the subgenre of horror that is about people terrorizing, raping, torturing, mutilating each other with glee. I've seldom found any of these films to have true scares, just repellent exploitative imagery designed to disgust the viewer. And frankly I don't see the point to that. Nothing about that says "good time" to me. The reason why I give The Hills Have Eyes a better rating than most of the other films of this type I've seen is because it is somewhat original, well-directed, has some good atmosphere, and only dips its toe into the vile rather than soak itself in it as more recent films of the type have done. If you have to watch a film about this type of subject matter and you don't like gratuitous rape and violence, this is probably your best bet. It's not rated PG but it's still pretty tame by today's standards. For those like me who are not fond of these types of films, know that it is not as bad as the torture porn of the 2000s. For those who view that as a negative and want more rape, torture, and graphic imagery: seek professional help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some reviews around the internet stating this movie was unique, macabre and very atmospheric. After watching this, I sincerely disagreed. When watching 2006's version, we have ugly monsters with big cruelty in their acts; however, in 1977's version, villains don't look that bad at all. They are weird, I agree, but not enough to scare the spectator, as a horror movie should do. Main actors also aren't any convincing or professional; for example, in the scene that the girl is being raped, she doesn't look any frightened at all when the "monster" leaves the bed. Moreover, I find it unethical to use an actor with a visible disease to portray the monster; maybe it was normal for the years it's been made, but I still don't find that any reasonable. Stick to the remake version that you will probably like better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dreary, non suspenseful horror movie or...an exercise in tedium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination.for one the villains look almost normal,not what you would expect deranged lunatics to look like.for another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves.by that,i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie, with a lot of running around aimlessly.the film didn't have a clear direction.the plot of the movie is hardly original,even for its time.the Texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film, as far as horror goes.the film has little in the way of scares, and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once.i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie, though it failed in its intended purpose.i basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end .when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise.i sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubt.yes, there is some loud screaming,and yes people die,but who cares.much too slow getting to any sort of pay off,if you can call it that.my buddy enjoyed it, so at least one of us got something out of it.the hills have eyes isn't the worst film we could have watched, but i doubt i will watch it again.this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that version.anyway, this movie was painfully slow at times, while other times was chaotic and repetitive.unless you like watching paint dry, occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block, screaming their head off, stay away from this movie.a better bet would be the original Texas chainsaw massacre(1973)1.5* out of 10* which is being generous</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitation, Not Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE (original) HILLS HAVE EYES is generally known as a classic horror film. Because of the blood, guts, and killer cannibals, but especially since Wes Craven, who'd later scare us on ELM STREET and make the next generation SCREAM with delight, wrote and directed.The plot has the usual horror elements: a trailer-traveling family gets derailed in the middle of nowhere and, like the title implies, they're not alone. The setting is fitfully spooky: the surrounding valley of sharp canyon cliffs where just about anything is possible, especially after the antagonists show themselves in the bright daylight ? perhaps too bright for a movie meant to keep us on edge in a genre where darker is better.The Neanderthal hillbillies are liken to a group of mutant hippies had they wandered into the Town of Bedrock after hearing The Beatles White Album. Michael Berryman, the iconic staple of horror films who, suffering from Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia ? a rare condition leaving him with no sweat glands, hair, fingernails or teeth ? is anything but a victim to his fans: he can really act and steals the show as Pluto, the intrepid scout of the hill-dwelling psychos.Dee Wallace of THE HOWLING and E.T. gets taken out before the real stuff occurs ? leaving her boyfriend, brother, and screaming little sister, played by Suze Lanier, to carry on in this low budget thriller with surprisingly little payoff, leaving the best scenes to the last twenty minutes when the protagonists deliver their own style of creative revenge.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can a film where the antagonists wanna eat a baby have any redeeming qualities?...nope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this one but this was an obvious take-off on the Texas Chainsaw massacre.It obviously doesn't have chainsaws but what it does have is a crazy family who stalk and kidnap and kill an innocent family who happen to break down near where these "creatures" dwell in a remote area. I mean, these parasitic cannibals live near Nellis AFB in Nevada and they steal from the base all the time and live offa people who happen to drive down this lonely stretch of road. First off, don't you think that the most secure place on earth would have the ability to see and know what's going on right outside their doors? Apparently not cause they have a cannibalistic family right outta the Ozarks feasting on unsuspecting people.The makeup in this is a laugh. Not even remotely close to a quality job. This film was made to fit right into that mid 70's "Exploitation" craze. There's not loads of gore but enough to make you think, "what was on this filmmakers mind when he thought of this concept?".I think what was really off putting was the fact they kidnap a baby from these people and decide they're gonna eat it in celebration. How can anyone think that this would have any entertainment value? I heard so much about this through out the years and since it was a Wes Craven film I thought it would be a sure hit. Well...I was wrong. If you wanna see a decent take off on the hillbilly weird-outs...grab Wrong Turn...much scarier and satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven is one of those filmmakers who loves including material that pushes the limits of movies that have already been made. Two of his best efforts represent this method of thinking. The ever popular A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) was a clever horror film that changed the game of how slasher films could be made to be even scarier and probably this was probably his most inventive creation. The other film being his debut with The Last House on the Left (1972), which has developed a following of its own. I'm not sure why though, it is a film filled with a repulsive story. And then, there's this movie which also has its own following. For this particular work of Craven, it was difficult to say how good this horror film really was. It has moments that work and other parts that showed no improvement from Craven's film debut.When a simple family looking to move permanently to California become stranded in the middle of a desert, they start being hunted by a group of cannibalistic savages. This is really all that the plot is and like most contemporary horror films, these events take place all in one day. The cast to represent the main characters are mostly unknown in today's time because their careers got as far as Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes Part II (1984) and were never seen from again. The sequel to this movie also is much worse according to many. The only actors that are memorable are Janus Blythe as one of the savages (who can't hide her beauty behind all that dirt), Dee Wallace as the mother of the traveling family and Michael Berryman as also one of the savages. This is Berryman's 3rd film as an actor and although he plays an antagonist, at least he entertains when possible. The animal actors perform well too.For the family of savages, a parallel can be drawn to that of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). The family's traits are mentally unhinged, are physically disfigured, live in shoddy conditions and live off of what they can get. The difference between the two is that Hooper looked to horrify his viewers without giving away too much. He let the imagination run wild to what his antagonists could do. Craven on the other hand enjoys exploiting that to the fullest extent. An example of this is rape. It isn't as graphically shown like it was in The Last House on the Left (1972) but it still is nothing that was needed to be filmed. Why does Craven enjoy portraying these scenes in such a tasteless manner? However, the one plus that Wes Craven always includes in his direction are his characters' ability to fight back.Yes, this family gets damaged to an extent that is irreversible, but they also don't back down. When the family begins to fight back, that's when things become entertaining. Although a character may scared, watching them have the courage to retaliate is always more enjoyable that always watching them suffer. The only issue with this, is that the characters aren't that memorable to begin with. With this, the ability to like or feel anything for these characters feels too late in the running time. As for the cannibalistic family, there is some background given by an old farmer but even then, it isn't disclosed in a clear manner. Something about a monster baby that was left out in the desert to die but didn't die? That's what I got, and if I didn't miss anything, who exactly turned out to be the monster baby all grown up?The acts of violence that are depicted here are also in the Wes Craven format where everything is a response to primal instinct. An eye for an eye. Speaking of primitive, the musical score by Don Peake wasn't very effective. At points it had tracks that sounded like they wanted to build tension, but much of it was underdeveloped. The one specific element that viewers should get a stronger understanding for is the feeling of isolation. Being stranded in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by dangerous people will not have you sitting comfortably. Eric Saarinen's cinematography helps reinforce that feeling getting steep shots of mountain peeks. This is effective at making the audience feel like the hills are literally watching your movements. It's unsettling. But to expect it to be anything more than sending a strong message of fear, probably isn't the case. It has a few cast members that stand out and has some OK elements to its story, one of them being fear caused by isolation. As a whole though, it's just another film where Wes Craven makes you sit through a bunch of classless violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw, atmospheric...but overall unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film directed by Wes Craven is a lot less impressive as his debut, the notorious Last House on the Left. But Craven can't really be blamed for that because he obviously was a lot more careful when he wrote the script for The Hills have Eyes. Last House on the Left almost destroyed his career before it even begun and the shocking character of that movie made him pretty hated among critics and producers. Craven obviously kept that in mind while working on the Hills have Eyes and so, the villains are a lot less "human" and it doesn't at all contain perverse -or even erotic - sequences. Especially the character-building in The Hills have Eyes is a bit of a letdown, according to me. The villains are supposed to be a bunch of savage and cruel madmen, but they look pretty organised to me and they're overall rather 'normal'. The protagonists of the film - the entire Carter family - fail to impress. As a viewer, you never feel connected with them and you don't really care whether they'll make it or not. Michael Berryman really became the icon of the film and that is well-deserved. Due to his naturally inherited disease, he looks spooky and primitive. Casting him for the role of Pluto really was a brilliant idea. Other positive aspects of the film include the terrific use of settings and locations, the solid directing by Craven and the raw character of the film. Craven uses the hot and hopeless desert as a powerful tool of suspense and atmosphere and I guess that's the most perfect element in the entire movie. Even though I think The Hills have Eyes doesn't belong to the absolute top of horror, it's Craven's second best film without a doubt. I'm not a fan of his modern work and I truly loath Scream. The Hills have Eyes recently received a special double-disc DVD edition which is a real treat for the fans. It contains fascinating commentary tracks by Craven himself and producer Locke. Besides that, the extra disc contains a documentary about the greatest directors in the genre in which they express their love and motivations towards horror. It's called the American Nightmare and I certainly recommend giving that a look as well. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty, scary, but unfortunately too stupid at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gritty, gripping horror film that has maybe a few too many bits of stupidity to rank as one of the all-time greats. A nice try, nonetheless. A family moving across the country breaks down in the Nevada desert. Unfortunately, a family of murderous freaks lives there and they decide to get their rape on. This is quick and nasty, with some truly horrific villains (most notably the odd-looking Michael Berryman, who has the very unfortunate life experience of really looking like that). A few things harm the film, though. The hysterics of the women, in particular Dee Wallace's constant shrieking, while understandable, is like nails on a chalkboard. The worst thing, though, is the Rin Tin Tin-like superdog, called Beast, who is seriously way smarter than any actual dog in history. He dispatches more of the bad guys than any of the human heroes and is even smart enough to carry one of the villain's walky-talkies back to his masters without any prompting, allowing the heroes to listen into the killers' plans. The film also ends abruptly, which can sometimes be good, but I think this one could have used an actual ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hills Have Eyes starts with with Big Bob Carter (Russ Grieve) his wife Ethel (Virginia Vincent) &amp; their family stopping off at Fred's (John Steadman) gas station for fuel as they travel to California. The Carter's ask about an old silver mine &amp; how to get there but Fred warns them to just keep going &amp; forget about the mine. Unfortunately the Carter's fail to take Fred's advice &amp; after swerving to avoid a rabbit in the road end up stranded in the middle of nowhere miles from civilisation. Big Bob sets off back to Fred's gas station while his son-in-law Doug Wood (Martin Speer) sets off towards an apparent Army base marked on their maps while his wife Lynne (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) &amp; baby Katy (Brenda Marinoff) stay behind with Ethel her son Bobby (Robert Houston), daughter Brenda (Susan Lanier) plus their two Alsation dogs Beauty (Flora) &amp; Beast (Striker). Beauty runs off into the desert &amp; Bobby follows her only to discover her gutted corpse, Big Bob makes it back to Fred's place &amp; sees Fred murdered by Jupiter (James Whitworth) a huge man who lives &amp; scavenges in the desert &amp; is the Father of a family of murdering scum who pray on innocent travellers, Jupiter then turns on Big Bob when he suffers a heart attack. Meanwhile two of Jupiter's sons Mars (Lance Gordon) &amp; Pluto (Michael Berryman) ambush everyone in the trailer, sexually molesting Brenda, biting the head off their budgie, stealing their food &amp; shooting Lynne &amp; Ethel before running off with Katy. Doug is determined to find his daughter while Jupiter is determined to gain revenge for his other son Mercury (producer Peter Locke as Arthur King) when Beast pushes him over a cliff to his death, eventually the two families meet in a fight to for survival... Edited, written &amp; directed by Wes Craven I thought The Hills Have Eyes was a decent enough horror film although I didn't exactly love it. The script by Craven was written for the sole purpose of making a film with the least amount of people &amp; in one location, it moves along at a fairly sedate pace &amp; while it's never boring I did find my interest starting to wain way before the closing credits. I was never really convinced that the 'planet' family had lived in total isolation for their entire lives, they speak perfect English &amp; Mars can curl his hair very well I mean he must do it every morning before he goes hunting. The Carter family are well developed, you feel &amp; root for them as all these horrible things happen to them &amp; they can't do anything about it. Director Craven creates a good low budget, only $230,000 apparently, exploitative horror film atmosphere throughout, The Hills Have Eyes looks gritty, minimalist &amp; has a certain realism about it. Even in it's uncut form The Hills Have Eyes is not that graphic &amp; probably wouldn't concern that many people these days who are used to ultra violent Steven Seagal &amp; Jean-Claude Van Damme action films, it's got more of a brutal tone to it's violence rather than relying on explicit blood &amp; gore, I did like the fact that the film wasn't afraid to kill anyone off &amp; make it's characters suffer. Someone is set alight, a bitten ankle, we see a gutted dog &amp; some of it's intestines on the ground, a bird has it's head bitten off, a couple of gunshot wounds &amp; that's about as nasty as it gets. The so-called notorious gun in the mouth shot that cut from most UK versions for years &amp; Brenda's rape scenes are so short as to almost not register, blink &amp; you'll miss them. The acting is surprisingly good &amp; I felt for the Carter family &amp; really disliked the 'planet' family. Technically the film is basic but functional &amp; the Californian desert makes for a great location looking &amp; feeling harsh, unforgiving &amp; isolated. Overall I thought The Hills Have Eyes was a fine way to spend 90 odd minutes but I definitely don't consider it the classic that many seem too, good solid watchable exploitation but not brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually, we think of Wes Craven's movies as really cool. "The Hills Have Eyes" would likely be the one that splits people. An absolutely disgusting story of an all-American family getting stranded in a desert inhabited by cannibals, the movie leaves nothing to the imagination. There may be points in the movie where you have to remind yourself that it's only a movie; some of the scenes they really could have done without.Still, if we accept this as a cheap '70s exploitation flick, then it's not bad at all. But I must warn you, only watch it if you have a very strong stomach. And yes, that's Dee Wallace (aka ET's mom) as Lynne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An all American family is driving through the desert to California. They consist of a mother, a father, a daughter, a son, and a married daughter with her husband and their baby. Unfortunately their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. And there's a family of mutants living in the hills nearby. And they're hungry and night is falling...Wes Craven's follow up to "Last House on the Left" is better than that...but that's faint praise. It's not as gory or sick but still hard to sit through. It was made with low production values...and it shows. The "special" effects are lousy and the makeup is more silly than scary. Also most of the acting is horrid (even by Dee Wallace). In a way that's good...when people start getting killed and things get real desperate a good cast might have made this too depressing to watch. Also it contains no ending--it just sort of stops. There's no resolution to the main problem. On the plus side--it IS well-directed by Craven who makes good use of music, location and sounds. And there are three good performances by Janus Blythe (Rudy), Jupiter (James Whitworth) and Susan Lanier (her hysterics looked WAY too realistic). And the attacks are brutal and bloody (but not as bad by today's standards).This was a huge drive-in hit in 1977. A typical family being attacked sent shock waves out all over. It hasn't aged well at all. It's still considered a horror classic but I don't see why. It's really not that good or scary--just disgusting. I also HATE it when little babies are put in danger. I'm giving this a 5.</fullReview>
