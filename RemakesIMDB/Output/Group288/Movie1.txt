		<shortDescription>OUTSTANDING CLASSIC PLEA FOR LIBERAL SOCIETY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original play "Gestern und Morgen" had its premiere in 1930 and was an immediate success. This prompted Carl Froelich to adapt the play for film. Both leading actress of the play Hertha Thiele (her first film) and the original director of the play Leontine Sagan (also her first film) were invited to join. The direction was split into direction of the cast and mise-en-scene by Leontine Sagan and overall direction by Carl Froelich; this means that Froelich was responsible for the overall quality of the film (in German: Künstleriche Oberleitung).The play as well as the later novel emphasizes the sexual/lesbian love theme, but the film adaptation was toned down; the original sad end was replaced by a happy end. Though the film goes as far as it can in its theme of (awakening) lesbian feelings and sexual feelings of young girls in general, shifting emphasis automatically meant concentrating on the theme of the cold and inhumane authoritarian (Prussian) way of life and upbringing, a way of thinking still present in the Weimar republic and in 1931 already considered a danger to the young republic. Then audiences were more interested in this aspect than in the sexual one. Despite this it still remains a remarkable film of the Weimar period in depicting the more loosening attitude towards sexuality in general as well as the dismissal of the old authoritarian life style, though, and this is the weak point of the premise, it never succeeds- in relating the two. A political stand this film certainly takes not, but, as the original title "Yesterday and Tomorrow" says, this film makes a plea for a more liberal and humane society. Of course the film was banned after the Nazi take-over (though for some obscure reason Goebbels liked the film "as film").The old way of thinking is shown in some remarkable images. The opening of the film, after some shots of Potsdam, shows first the marching of soldiers than cuts to a walk of the girls; the girls do not walk, but march as the soldiers do. The Prussian authority is represented by the Frau Oberin whose presence in the film is that like an average hard boiled Prussian king (and not unlike Frederick the Great, the king who was depicted in nationalist films in the 20' and 30's a number of times)); her hairdo is not simply a way to wear one's hair, it fits like a crown on her head. When she presides a meeting with the other teachers, she presides as a queen, sitting slightly above the level of the teachers. Fear for authority is conveyed through the Von Kenten character whose physical attitude constantly is that of a writhed of fear, human being.Note the military trumpet in the final scene (one of the examples of the excellent use of sound) as Frau Oberin walks resigned through the corridor: there may have been a small relapse in the system within the institution, the trumpet tells us that outside things are still unchanged.The direction of Sagan/Froelich and the cinematography are outstanding, but it could never have become the classic it is if both Hertha Thiele and Dorothea Wieck had not been in the lead. Photogenic Thiele plays Manuela as a sensitive, but still proud girl; Wieck gives the Von Bernburg character all the subtleties and uncertainties it needs. But let's not forget the completely forgotten actress Ellen von Schwannecke as a wonderful Ilse. Thiele and Wieck would repeat their co-operation in an amazing film by Frank Wysbar (one of the producers of "Mädchen"): Anna und Elisabeth (1933), also a film with a lesbian theme.A very odd aspect is also noteworthy. The 4 main people involved can be divided in 2 sub groups: Hertha Thiele and Leontine Sagan went into exile in 1933 and were not to have a career after 1945 in West-Germany, while Dorothea Wieck and Carl Froelich (he became member of the NSDAP) continued their careers in Nazi Germany and after 1945. Convinced of it that involvement in this film also meant according its basic ideas (remember that it was not an established production company that made the film, but a collective), this split-up of minds can almost be seen as symbol for the schism in Germany.For a complete understanding of this film and the play I recommend to read the novel as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive, pure atmosphere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in pre-National Socialist Germany when the economy was at a true low. The girls at this Catholic boarding school are slight, pale, hungry creatures -for food and comfort. Daughters of soldiers, they are taught discipline and deprivation, not luxury. The girls, however, have more personality and strength of character than those in the majority of movies produced nowadays. Manuela is a highly emotional 14 year old 'new girl' who has no mother. She, like the rest of her classmates, yearns for the attention of the fair and beautiful Fraulein von Burnberg. Ilse is the school trouble-maker, leader, and clown. Witty and outspoken, she repeatedly entertains the other girls, binding them together in secret comradery against their oppressive elders. At an after-play function Manuela is the only student who can tolerate the taste of the punch given to them as a reward. Her friends pass their cups on to her and she soon gets herself quite drunk. In a semi-conscious state she announces her feelings for the popular Fraulein von Burnberg to the entire school along with the infuriated Headmistress. These girls are not all lesbians, they are merely children starved of human contact and love. As a result they throw their hearts at the open mind and kind heart of Frau von Burnberg. I found it surprising and beautiful how loyal the girls were to each other. There is very little rivalry or conflict among the students, a vast contrast to the modern representation of teens. Even when Manuela embarrasses herself horribly in front of the school, her classmates stick by her without hesitation. That's cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Striking and Bold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be both touching and disturbing. Innovative and bold, Madchen in Uniform exposes social taboos in its depiction of lesbianism and teacher-student relationships. Beyond the subject matter, I was impressed with the acting and camera work, which seemed to tell a story all on its own. The quality of the film was certainly poor and the subtitles leave much to question, but the overall effect of the film is poignant. It succeeds in lifting the veil which conceals adolescent female life and without exploiting the budding sexuality of young girls, a phenomenon too often seen in cinema today. It seems strange that this careful balance of exposition and preservation was better kept seventy years ago than it is today. Should this movie be re-made now, one would doubtless see nudity,stereotypical lesbian behavior and exploitation of the relationship between the student and teacher. This film reminds us that a film doesn't have to shock us to be sexually provacative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mädchen in Uniform This was a very bold film. It presents the controversies of lesbianism, teacher-student relationships, and antifascism in Germany in the 30's. The acting is of great quality. You don't need to know German to understand what's going on, even with out the subtitles. I find it interesting that feminine sexual powers are used throughout the film. The beloved teacher, Fräulein von Bernburg, uses her sexual powers to win the affection of the children, keeping them in check. During rehearsals for a play, one of the girls is told to use her feminine powers (to be more seductive) to play her part. Sex appeal is also mentioned in describing a movie star. The antifascism isn't blatant in the film, but in the opening scene, we see soldiers marching and then the schoolgirls marching, hinting at the hidden meaning. This film has a place in history and is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this film wasn't the most crowd-pleasing one I've seen lately, I think it's a rather important one. The openly lesbian themes of the movie are quite surprising, considering that the movie was made in 1931. The theme of sexual discovery in a girls' boarding school was quite revolutionary for film at the time. It was also an interesting critique of society, and was very anti-fascist. The Prussian principal represents the authoritarian, militaristic aspect of society, while the kind teacher represents a more maternal and loving part. The combination of lesbian themes with that kind character shows us that a more female-dominated society would be a positive change. The Prussian school shows that women are oppressed by patriarchal society into a militaristic machine, and the rebel teacher is a movement away from that. This film is an intriguing view of life right before Hitler. It provides a meaningful glimpse into the lesbian subculture of Berlin before the Nazis came to power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was more than a gay classic, this film was a social commentary on the time period it was set in. We all now well know the views held on homosexuality by Hitler's socialist party which was coming into power during the time this movie was made. The entire film foreshadowed many of the things that would happen to people who were not seen as desirable in the eyes of the German government. One part especially, where the students and teachers were forbidden to have contact with Manuela, spoke of the public shunning of Jews and other so-called undesirables who were forbidden contact with other people. Of the three movies that Leontine Sagan directed this was the only one made in Germany. Given the fact that Sagan was of Jewish ancestry and the main theme of this movie was of love between women, it's not hard to see why her career in Germany was short lived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mädchen in Uniform is clearly a wonderful portrayal of sexuality in film, but what exactly is the sexuality that is portrayed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mädchen in Uniform is a very impressive German film that presents an unusual sexual awakening in an equally unusual situation, which leads to some complex content to analyze. It is clearly the presentation of a sexuality that is not considered normal, but it is not necessarily a lesbian film. I think that the fact that there is not a single man in the film and, even more, the intimate relationship between Manuela and Fräulein von Bernburg, give the impression that there is a strong lesbian undertone in the film, but I don't think that it was meant to be seen that way. It seemed to me that it was more of a coming of age film than a lesbian film.I think that Mädchen in Uniform was the portrayal of a girl who needed a higher than average amount of attention and who was reaching the age where her sexuality was beginning to take form, and because she was in an all-girl school and had no male influence in her life, she attached to the most accessible person who could fulfill those needs - Fräulein von Bernburg. It seemed to me that Manuela became so amorously attached to Fräulein von Bernburg more because of a lack of options than because of an interest in the same sex. There is undeniably a lot of female/female eroticism in the film (such as that goodnight kiss), but I don't think that it is a portrayal of lesbianism. It seems to me that the film has at least as much to say about budding sexuality and freedom of exploration for teenagers as it does about homosexuality.Manuela's needs for attention (and the same need harbored by the other girls in the film) was most directly presented in the scene where Fräulein von Bernburg comes through the room to kiss the girls goodnight one by one. In the novel Swann's Way, Marcel Proust presents a character who is so obsessed with his goodnight kiss from his mother that he literally fantasizes about it all day, and then is miserable after she kisses him because he will have to wait so long before he gets that attention from her again. He is completely dependent on that kiss, and in that gigantic novel, a large part of the reason that he is so obsessed with his mother's kiss is because he is largely isolated from the outside world an has an emotionally distant father. His only source of affectionate attention is from his mother, and it is portrayed in a way that almost seems incestuous because he loves so much to feel his mothers lips on his face. This is the same thing that is going on in Mädchen in Uniform, except in a slightly different form.Now, whether or not Mädchen in Uniform is, in fact, a lesbian film, there are definitely some typical stereotypes derailed in the close of the movie. Manuela was driven to the point of suicide by the adults at the all-girl school she attended, and it was the children who had to come in to save her (which is an element of the story that strengthens the assertion that it supports freedom for teenagers, who are clearly able to make wise decisions on their own), and there is also the fact that she did not commit suicide, which is significant because it would have been the stereotypical way for a woman (especially a homosexual woman) to respond to a stressful situation that she cannot control.It seemed to me that in that way, the movie broke down a some stereotypes, but it is important to really analyze the film so that we can see what, if any, stereotypes are applied to the characters and to the story. The sexuality in the film is obviously not traditional, but one must take into account the circumstances under which that sexuality is portrayed before one can decipher a specific message from the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant and Chilling German Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's a girl to do when she is surrounded by women in a female boarding school? She falls in love with her female teacher who shares some mutual feelings. This film is not so much about lesbianism as it is about Germany was striving to become so disciplined and unfeeling towards one another. Of course, lesbianism was bound to happen. There were no other options. You have a girl who wants to be loved and love just seems unthinkable in the German culture of the Nazi uprising. Even though this film was made in 1931, the girls' uniforms reminded me of the concentration camps uniforms. The school was trying to discourage close relationships between girls and among teachers and students. I don't think of it much as a lesbian film as a chilling portrait of how Germany was bounded for destruction during World War II. Maybe the film points as a good reminder of how relationships should be encouraged and feelings are human. This school was trying to restrict the girls' humanity into an almost robotlike existence. That's how I always saw this film. I never thought of it as a lesbian film because the girls in the school had no other choice or option. They weren't allowed freedom and that's what the major theme of this movie is. Germany was beginning to restrict it's freedom on their citizens and forcing them to become less human in order to succeed but that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative Weimar-era study of Prussian all-girl school, relations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it would have been nice to see a well-restored and cleaned-up print of this, which was not the case, it still seems an exceptionally well made film for its era. The camera work was fluid and the sound was decent. It is a rich, provocative study with much to think about. While famously seen as a lesbian story, and that is part of it to be sure, it also concerns the rigid authoritarianism of its particular time and place, which soon led to so much sorrow and tragedy and sends out a strong feminist and tolerant message. The story is never boring and easily holds one's interest these many years later. It is strongly atmospheric and immerses one in the hothouse environs of the strictly disciplined, all-female world, where the girls develop close and intimate relationships and passionate crushes on their favorite teacher, Dorothea Wieck. She is fine here, and so is Hertha Thiele as Manuela, the primary focus of the story, but then the entire cast performs well, including Erika Mann, daughter of Thomas Mann and wife of W.H. Auden, as a bespectacled, tattle-tale instructor always running to the head of the school. The ending sent out a strong message and worked well, though you are left on your own to wonder how things resolved themselves as per the two lead characters. Well worthwhile to see if you can find it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good pre-Nazi sound film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mädchen in Uniform" or "Girls in Uniform" is a German film from 85 years ago that is in black-and-white and runs for slightly over 80 minutes. The main character here is a girl with lesbian tendencies and it was obviously the filmmakers' intention that we like here, so you can imagine how the Nazis, who came into power 2 years later, saw this film. It was banned and tried to eradicate from existence. Luckily there were not successful and copies of it still exist today. Another reason why they hated it was certainly the anti-authoritarian plot here with all the actresses playing students and staff at an all-girls school. And the main antagonist was the old Oberin, the head of the institute, with her strict rules and regulations. Not only one of the film's director is female (Leontine Sagan), but the entire cast here is. No males included.I thought it took a while till the film really became good, but the longer it goes, the better it becomes. I would not call it a mus-see, but it certainly has its moments and a pretty dramatic final sequence too. the last show with the head mistress leaving is also quite good. Today, none of the actresses in here are really famous, but the film still is, probably more famous than the remake starring Romy Schneider from the 1950s. I think both films are good and I recommend checking them out. Thumbs up for "Mädchen in Uniform".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Need For Equipoise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's technologically pretty clever for 1931. Near the opening, just when the new girl is being shown around the boarding school, there is a scene of the girls' chorus enthusiastically singing a patriotic song, and the camera dollies in through the mob to one particular face. As it does so, the sound of her voice becomes louder and distinguishable from the others, so we can hear that she's shouting a corruption of the lyrics -- something about needing to eat.The careful meshing of images and sound wasn't standard for the time, except of course that Hitchcock had played around with it in early films like "Blackmail". But it's apparent that some effort was put into the direction. There's a nicely staged high angle shot of a five-story square staircase filled with chattering children moving upward as if on a frisky escalator.The new girl is fourteen-year-old Manuela von Meinhardis, whose mother had died when she was young and father serves in the military. After the other students welcome her, they warn her about falling in love with one of the teachers, the compassionate but mercurial Fräulein von Bernburg. Manuela then is promptly groomed and fitted with an ugly uniform with precise and ergonomic Gründlichkeit.This is some girls' school too. The rules are strict, somewhere between a convent and Marine Corps boot camp. You can't have money, candy or books of your own. You can't put a picture of a movie star on the inside of your locker door. Everything is presided over by a stern, homely Headmistress who reminds me of Miss Pavor DeGrone, my fifth grade arithmetic teacher. Try to imagine a scowling Erik von Stroheim in drag. "Through discipline and hunger we shall be great again." Now, this is 1931, so Hitler hadn't risen to the dazzling heights he would yet achieve, but it's also Prussia, home of the Junkers, land of the Spartans.At bed time, von Bernburg comes around to the dormitory and kisses each girl delicately on the head. The girls, hungry for affection as well as chocolate, await their turns ecstatically. But when it's Manuela's turn she throws herself into the teacher's arms and they kiss on the lips, which introduces a note into the relationship that's only been hinted at before, although the note is minor. In a later scene, von Bernburg gives Manuela a new petticoat and the impression is conveyed that the teacher is especially fond of Manuela but that Manuela's affection goes rather deeper than that. Well, after all, Manuela is at an age where, as the headmistress puts it, "their emotions are aroused." Any doubt about Manuela's physical development is put to rest in a scene in which she wears tights as part of a costume for Schiller's play, "Don Carlos." She's pretty nicely filled out, even if she's illegal. Schiller wrote the play around 1785. I had to read his work in a German class and he's pretty good, even amusing at times. It's Schiller's words that are sung by the chorus in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, some of the noblest music extant.During a post-play celebration, an alcoholic punch is passed around and Manuela, happy beyond imagining because she was successful as the principal player and because she believes von Bernburg loves her, gets drunk and shouts out some opinions that find their way to the ears of Miss DeGrone, I mean the headmistress. She and von Bernburg are forbidden to speak to one another again and Manuela's classmates are ordered to shun her. This leaves Manuela pretty down in the dumps. I'll leave it at that.I suppose it was surprising in 1931 to find a film dealing with what everyone since appears to have called "lesbianism," but it's really a story about the need to leaven discipline with understanding and mercy. Anyway, it's not really surprising that the teen-aged girls should develop crushes on an authority figure or on each other, even if it leads to some sexual experimentation.This is the kind of school that sociologists call a total institution in which everything is controlled and people of the same sex are forced to spend time together. If this is as bad as it gets in a Prussian girls boarding school, any state prison in American has it beat by a mile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is a lot better than the remake.The remake took place in the early part of the 20th century.This version take place the year that it was made .Although they keep claiming that this deals with lesbianism.There's a difference between sexual attraction and affection. Manuela , played by Hertha Thiele comes from a strict house hold .A cold Aunt and a military father.Her character is starving for affection and love ,not sex yet.This is the way I see it.When she arrives to this strict boarding she met by warm friendship from the girl students.But when she meets one of the teachers ,Frueline Von Bernburg. portrayed by Dorothea Wiek,the teachers affection and concern for Manuela, affect the student so positive that Manuela falls for her.But not as a sex partner. More like falling for Wiek's character like a mother needed by a daughter. You see after being in the play ,by Schiller,was it Kabals and Liebe? She has a little too much alcohol during the party that she gets over board about her daughter love for her teacher.But every, especially the mistress,played by Emilia Unda, takes it the wrong way.This was a excellent classic German film made during the last years of the Wiemar. Madchen in Uniform, not to be confused with an all girl bondage xxx video.worth seeing 11/21/12 Happy Thanks giving! .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Maedchen in Uniform" (German, 1931): I viewed this film in an "unrestored" version, yet I was still fascinated by it on a number of levels. The photography was wonderful ? with well thought out set shots full of light and dark diagonal patterns illustrating late Expressionism/early Art Deco, and close ups of the girls and women using equally beautiful lighting, often with soft focus filters. A little knowledge of Euro/German history was helpful ? since this movie was banned in Germany (just prior to Hitler's coming into full power), and there is a lesbian angle to the story. (Yet, having lived in Europe, I was NOT prone to assigning every hand-holding, dance, or goodnight kiss to lesbianism.) The Prussian attitudes were represented by the older women still in power, and the "new" German attitudes were given to the young girls, the "hope" of the future. Germany couldn't have been in much more turmoil at the time, and was cranking up towards the war to make up for the last war, fascism, racial purification, intolerance, and an even deeper sense of conformity. This film is loaded with the era's "issues", and not necessarily supportive of where Germany was headed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Girls in Uniform is a feminist classic.This film is one of the hidden themes of early German cinema. For a movie that was made in 1931 the structure was very good. Light is used to indicate the repression of the girls. The girls were in a world full of darkness by the authorities of the boarding school. The interesting thing was that the main focus was on the relationship between Manuela and her teacher, there were other relationships too but they ware not the main focus. My feeling is that none of those girls were happy in that school but they learned to handle the situation and simply to live with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very curious piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a highly unusual film from just before the Nazi era. It's about a Prussian-style girls school and the difficulty a new arrival has at fitting in to the stupidly strict system (i.e., rules just for the sake of having rules). This difficulty is remediated, somewhat, by a kind housemother. In this relationship, there are strong hints of lesbianism, though considering this is the early 1930s, a modern viewer may find the treatment of this taboo a little vague and silly--though not nearly as silly as the excised gay scene from Spartacus. For this reason alone, it is a very curious movie. I actually would have found it perhaps more interesting if they had either allowed this relationship to evolve more or if they had helped the young infatuated girl to understand how these feelings are, perhaps, related to her loss of her mother and her own pubescence (another parallel issue in the movie). Oh well. This isn't really a complaint, just curiosity.Late in the movie there is a dandy climax (cinematic, not sexual). The young girl is pushed and pushed unmercifully by the draconian headmistress until she attempts suicide. I liked this touch, but wonder how the story might have been different if either the girl HAD actually died. Also, after she is saved, the movie ends with the headmistress visibly shaken--but ends there. I wanted to see what would happen next in the mind of the movie's writers and director.Oh well, enough of my ranting. It's a good, though not great movie with themes that make it either an adult film or at least one you should think twice before letting your teens see it alone (maybe see it with them and discuss the images instead).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is amazingly well done. Given the time period in which it was made, the way it tackles the issue of homosexuality is quite revolutionary. The film is ambiguous when it needs to be and direct when the audience really needs to make connections. Hertha Thiele plays her role convincingly. The use of symbolism, as well as other allusions to psychoanalytic thought are both hilarious and effective. Unfortunately, the subtitles are horribly written. I am surprised that a German film institution has not redone them, or re-released this classic film in better quality. I thought the Goethe institute was all about things like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting when taken within the correct historical context</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The experience of watching Madchen in Uniform left me feeling that that I had missed part of the film's message because of both the subtitles and the historical context. On the surface the movie seemed to simply be about a girl who after being forced to go to boarding school falls in love with her teacher and doesn't know how to handle herself. What is lost in the translation to English though are many of the messages that were quite revolutionary for the time and place that the movie was made. The film actually reflects the pre-Nazi German society, especially the places of both women and homosexuality. This was hard to follow in the subtitles which, showing the movie's age, were often missing or very hard to read. I found the movie rather unentertaining to watch; however, I feel that if I had known more about the time period and place that it was coming from before I viewed it then it might have had greater meaning to me. If the language and cultural barrier can be crossed, I feel the Madchen in Uniform achieves its point of addressing the social and political issues of Germany when it is observed with the correct historical context and openness in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not entirely entertaining, but look past its deceiving appearance to what it is truly about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My initial reaction to this film was that it served no purpose. It seemed, to me at least, to be about a German boarding school for girls who mostly had lesbian infatuations with their teacher and other students. Although this is what it is mainly about, its true nature is to illustrate the bonds and relationships created between friends, and also to show the importance of a maternal figure in a girl's life. When Manuela first arrives at the school, she has a gap in her life that would usually be filled by a mother figure. Because her mother died, her father did not know how to take care of her, and her aunt did not give her the love she needed, she searches for someone who can give her what she has been lacking for so long. Fraulein von Bernburg is the teacher who can do this. She is strict with the students, yet does not punish them. She treats Manuela in a way she does no other. If this love began as something similar to the type a family would share, it slowly transitions to something more than that. It creates a bond between them that is not permitted in the school, but in the end it allows both Manuela and Fraulein von Bernburg to be set free from the oppression of the school. A criticism I have, though, is the ending. Once the finale occurs, it just ends. No closure is brought to these characters. Although it was a touching story line, for the most part, this movie was not very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mädchen in Uniform is clearly a wonderful portrayal of sexuality in film, but what exactly is the sexuality that is portrayed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mädchen in Uniform is a very impressive German film that presents an unusual sexual awakening in an equally unusual situation, which leads to some complex content to analyze. It is clearly the presentation of a sexuality that is not considered normal, but it is not necessarily a lesbian film. I think that the fact that there is not a single man in the film and, even more, the intimate relationship between Manuela and Fräulein von Bernburg, give the impression that there is a strong lesbian undertone in the film, but I don't think that it was meant to be seen that way. It seemed to me that it was more of a coming of age film than a lesbian film.I think that Mädchen in Uniform was the portrayal of a girl who needed a higher than average amount of attention and who was reaching the age where her sexuality was beginning to take form, and because she was in an all-girl school and had no male influence in her life, she attached to the most accessible person who could fulfill those needs - Fräulein von Bernburg. It seemed to me that Manuela became so amorously attached to Fräulein von Bernburg more because of a lack of options than because of an interest in the same sex. There is undeniably a lot of female/female eroticism in the film (such as that goodnight kiss), but I don't think that it is a portrayal of lesbianism. It seems to me that the film has at least as much to say about budding sexuality and freedom of exploration for teenagers as it does about homosexuality.Manuela's needs for attention (and the same need harbored by the other girls in the film) was most directly presented in the scene where Fräulein von Bernburg comes through the room to kiss the girls goodnight one by one. In the novel Swann's Way, Marcel Proust presents a character who is so obsessed with his goodnight kiss from his mother that he literally fantasizes about it all day, and then is miserable after she kisses him because he will have to wait so long before he gets that attention from her again. He is completely dependent on that kiss, and in that gigantic novel, a large part of the reason that he is so obsessed with his mother's kiss is because he is largely isolated from the outside world an has an emotionally distant father. His only source of affectionate attention is from his mother, and it is portrayed in a way that almost seems incestuous because he loves so much to feel his mothers lips on his face. This is the same thing that is going on in Mädchen in Uniform, except in a slightly different form.Now, whether or not Mädchen in Uniform is, in fact, a lesbian film, there are definitely some typical stereotypes derailed in the close of the movie. Manuela was driven to the point of suicide by the adults at the all-girl school she attended, and it was the children who had to come in to save her (which is an element of the story that strengthens the assertion that it supports freedom for teenagers, who are clearly able to make wise decisions on their own, or at least need to be given at least a small amount of freedom and respect), and there is also the fact that she did not commit suicide, which is significant because it would have been the stereotypical way for a woman (especially a homosexual woman) to respond to a stressful situation that she cannot control.It seemed to me that in that way, the movie broke down some stereotypes, but it is important to really analyze the film so that we can see what, if any, stereotypes are applied to the characters and to the story. The sexuality in the film is obviously not traditional, but one must take into account the circumstances under which that sexuality is portrayed before one can decipher a specific message from the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this possible?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The German film Madchen in Uniform was an interesting film. I was a little caught off guard because first I didn't know that it was a foreign film and secondly I wasn't in the mood to see a film of that sort on that particular night. Thus since I feel that there is a certain type of movie to fit each mood and if you watch a phenomenal movie when you are not in the mood to see it the caliber of that film declines in your mind. Thus I don't think I gave this film a fair chance from the beginning. I thought it was interesting how this film reflecting an obvious presence of lesbians and homosexuality experimentation far preceded its time. I also think that not only did it far precede its time that I thought people were open to homosexuality but I would never expect a film to portray homosexuality in a positive light in the 1930s. However, one thing that I don't understand about the film is that when it came to America supposedly all of these aspects of homosexuality were censored. I don't understand if you took out all of these signs that point to lesbians what parts of this movie would remain. I think the only worthwhile aspect of this film lies in the context with which it discusses homosexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was a very interesting way of looking at how girls were treated during the 1930's in Germany. The director obviously wanted to show that the authorities and leaders wanted women to be no nonsense, and just for show. The girls in this movie wanted to rebel in a way, they did not want to just be mothers, they wanted to learn, to explore, and to have a good time. I'm not sure why they made the girls all in love with the teacher. I think of the idea of lesbianism as more of a modern idea, not that they didn't have lesbians at that time, but that it was not talked about. I'm sure that is why the original was banned and cut up to keep this idea. The only thing that really bothered me about this film was that the subtitles were inconsistent. There would be loads of dialogue, and then like a word of subtitle. Often the white writing subtitles were blocked by a white background on screen or was washed out. Even without knowing what they were saying, I still got the gist of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film lovers with a slightly more than rudimentary knowledge of the subject recognize that Leontine Sagan was active long before he directed Showtime and Men of Tomorrow. Still, few of those earlier films are known that well, besides perhaps Showtime (which I don't care for much myself, though I owe it a reassessment). In 1931 Sagan made two of his greatest works, Men of Tomorrow and Mädchen in Uniform(distributed in the US as simply "Mädchen," but I prefer to use the entire title, as it just sounds better). Men of Tomorrow, as I say, is another masterwork; do see it. But it is not the issue at hand here.Mädchen in Uniform has a classic art film story behind it: Leontine Sagan came up with the idea quickly, having gotten some money, and he just took his few actors and crew on a summer vacation with very little planning involved. What results is a simple story, but one that is very mature and emotionally complex. Two teenage lovers escape the tyranny of their parents. Stealing a boat, they travel around the southern islands of Sweden together, revelling in their adolescent lust. A few things happen along the way, but they aren't really worth mentioning. Not that these events are unimportant, only that to describe them would not be useful here; they ought to be experienced as they happen.What makes this film a masterpiece is the third act. Teenage love is often so idealized by artists, born from an air of irresistible nostalgia. Maybe Leontine Sagan was too much of a pessimist for his characters to find neverending happiness by the time the film fades out. Dorothea Wieck, a Bergman regular, of course, plays Fräulein von Bernburg. There is a love in her, and she may even really love the Principal (played by Emilia Unda) when they set out together. On the other hand, part of it is she just wants the experience of an adventure, of independence from her cluttered and sad homelife and parents, of love, and, not least of all, of sex. Fräulein von Bernburg is, first and foremost, a sexual being. Andersson is not exploited, though, as she so easily could have been (French actress Brigitte Bardot provides the best example of just how an actress' career can be harmed by these kinds of highly sexual roles). Andersson arouses the audience, but Sagan is careful (as he is with all of his women) not to make her into some cheap male fantasy. We want Fräulein von Bernburg, yet we realize that she is not to be had. She is her own person.This manifests itself in a pretty nasty way in the third act. Eventually, as the summer begins to fade, the Principal decides that the two of them cannot spend the rest of their lives drifting around on a boat. They also have realized that Fräulein von Bernburg has become pregnant. Leontine Sagan thus eschews the type of ending where the two return home, maybe in love maybe not, and that's that. Instead, he gives these two characters a reality check. The Principal jumps into it with gusto, marrying his sweetheart and getting a decent job. When his child is born, he is overjoyed. Unfortunately, Fräulein von Bernburg (who is two years younger than the Principal, at 17) cannot make the same leap. This monotonous, routine life which she was hoping to escape falls back down on her. The fact that she has a child annoys her: no longer is she free to do what she chooses. And her lust is now left unsatisfied: the Principal sees her as the beautiful mother of his child, not so much as his lover anymore. Ultimately, because The Principal is away so much with his work, Fräulein von Bernburg's lust breaks loose. In the film's most memorable scene, she picks up a new boyfriend at a bar. Bergman allows her to look straight into the camera, one of the earliest examples of a filmmaker breaking the fourth wall. Fräulein von Bernburg looks into our eyes, and we see the pain, fear, and loneliness she has acquired. The shot is held for what seems like forever, even though it comprises only a few seconds.Fräulein von Bernburg leaves the Principal and their baby. The film ends with the Principal alone, staring at himself and his child in the mirror. He is hurt, that is certain, but I do not believe that he judges her too harshly. After all, he does understand Fräulein von Bernburg and her temperament. As he remembers the beauty of the summer he and Fräulein von Bernburg shared, he cradles in his arm the only physical evidence left of that time. It's a sad ending, but, with the warmness we see in the Principal's expression, we know that the child will be much loved by its father. Life continues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bold movie for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Madchen in Uniform was a surprisingly bold movie for its time. Set in Germany, before the Nazis came into power, Madchen in Uniform addresses the issue of lesbianism in an all girls boarding, and, in a broader sense, society. Although by no means as graphic and as explicit as films produced today, Madchen in Uniform was still a candid portrayal of homosexuality for its time. Aside from the actual topic though, I personally didn't feel that there was much to the movie. The movie lacked any real plot. It mainly revolved around a young girl, who, because of being homesick, found both security and love in a teacher. It is true that the movie was a source of much controversy, but as far as I'm concerned, this is the entire movie was able to accomplish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baffling in its very existence, this film has a place in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever wonder what European soft-core porn would look like in 1931? If you do, you are weird. But, if you do wonder what it'd be like, check out Maedchen in Uniform. To be fair, it is a bit more artistic than Emanuelle, but there is little subtlety to the lesbian erotica happening in this film. It turns out better than it started. I actually felt the characters' troubles to be honest and touching by the end. I cared what happened.I also believe that this film must have been somewhat well known to European filmmakers at the time. The direction is excellent, and it reminds me a bit of such directors as Jean Vigo and Jean Renoir among others.</fullReview>
