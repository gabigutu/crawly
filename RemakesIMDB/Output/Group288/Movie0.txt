		<fullReview>Before watching "Mädchen in Uniform" I knew Romy Schneider only as "Sissi" and had absolutely no clue who Lilli Palmer was. First, I was suspicious: A German movie from the fifties? Should be another ridiculous comedy with a lot of colourful pictures and "funny" music. But what a surprise the drama was!First of all: It was very courageous. If you think at the time the movie was shot in I find it courageus to make a drama about homosexuality and furthermore about a forbidden passion between a teacher and a student.And then of course: Romy Schneider. In her young years she is best known for such ridiculous films as "Sissi" or "Wenn der weiße Flieder wieder blüht". But "Mädchen in Uniform" is the most remarkable one. There she shows: I am much more and more serious than you think and I am not just a nice little girl always looking pretty, lovely and smiling into the camera. I think, after she made this movie it was clear that she would make a great career because she is a gifted, exceptional actress.And of course Lilli Palmer: Beautiful, proud, very lady-like, elegant and full of seriousness but very young at the same time. I'm out of words if it comes to describing her talent. But I think, you all agree if I say that she is one of the greatest German actresses.A great movie, definetely one of the most important German dramas od the fifties and always worth remembering and watching it over and over again. Besides: There is some good taste of humour in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mädchen in Uniform</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of a classic from the early 1930s clearly remains one of the most unusual and bold films made in post-war Germany, brought to life by three remarkable actresses: Romy Schneider, Lilli Palmer and Therese Giehse.The story of an orphaned teenager (Schneider) whose passionate love for her teacher (Palmer) becomes scandalous and culminates into a tragedy was by no means a critical or commercial success when it came to the screen in 1958. I guess the homosexual (lesbian) content was too much to take for an audience which was used to more common and likable subjects. Today, "Mädchen in Uniform" deserves to be rediscovered and cherished as a minor masterpiece. The acting alone is of sheer brilliance; Blandine Ebinger, Sabine Sinjen, Christine Kaufmann and Adelheid Seeck support the three leading ladies superbly.Stage veteran Therese Giehse, muse to writers like Brecht and Dürrenmatt and long-time lover of Erika Mann, is electrifying in one of her few movie appearances. Lilli Palmer, who began her career in Hitchcock's "Secret Agent" and became a Broadway and Hollywood star in the 1940s, puts all her charm into her enchanting portrayal of Fräulein von Bernburg, the understanding teacher whose tender loving care is misunderstood disastrously. Romy Schneider surprised everybody including herself with her performance which for the first time required her to do a little more than being just the sweet, innocent Viennese girl. After this, her 13th film, she went abroad to become an internationally acclaimed character actress, working with directors like Visconti, Welles, Preminger, Dassin, and, later, Claude Sautet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'It's a Romy Schneider film!', my mum said happily when she read the announcement in her TV guide. It is indeed, but I didn't quite dare inform my mum of the contents, seeing as she knew Romy only by the Sissi films. I love this film. I immediately fell in love with Lilli Palmer. Perhaps not as important or shocking as the 1931 version (yes, I have seen it) but still an interesting film. I especially like the outdoors shots in this film. The scene where Fräulein Von Bernburg gives Manuela one of her own shirts is lovely. I understood Romy Schneider was attempting to lose her Sissi image at the time. She succeeded in my opinion. My mum was somewhat surprised after watching it, but in the end she decided she liked it after all. So do I. Seven points out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In love with this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to know this film through an extract of the famous kiss scene, but I felt this short part already so powerful and sensual that I immediately wanted to see all of it.A film should be valued for what it is, independently of the fact that is a remake or not. The original Madchen in Uniform was banned and censored for decades, most of the copies were even destroyed by Nazis; we are not even sure today that the remaining material is fully the original one. Making a remake of it, in color, with contemporary and appreciated actresses, was absolutely topical and courageous, and the resulting indignation showed perfectly that the main theme was not only taboo in 1910 and 1931? but still in 1958.For me, this film is much more about love than about sexuality between women. In this boarding school, where the only man is a small photography in one of the lockers, who wouldn't love the only kind and understanding person? At least a loving ?mother" for all the children (think about the good night kiss scene), but much more for a few of the girls. By nature, homosexuality is indeed a logical response to the monosexuality of this place, and for Manuela, women seem the only gender she has ever known. For Ms. Bernburg, young and obviously missing a sentimental relation, it's rather the only present gender, and Manuela is the first person to declare love to her.Romy Schneider, already a star after Sissi's landmark role, was brave to opt for such a mature theme and talent-requiring character. Beautiful, captivating, and at the same time so naturally innocent and childish.Therese Gieshe is gruesomely perfect in her oppressive Prussian headmaster role, determined to raise entire generations of tenacious housewifes for the forthcoming days and wars.Lilli Palmer, in constant tearing between her institutional teacher and childminder role, is simply outstanding. And how not to discern all the little signs of how deeply she is affected? From the closure of her eyes during the kiss to the pauses she has to take, her embarrassment in many of the scenes and at the end the sadness in her eyes combined with the slowness she takes to leave? but these feelings are not accepted in the school where she is imprisoned too.Original German language adds to the Prussian harshness feeling, scenic sequences are followed by ingenious shadows &amp; lights parts, but above all it's the eminent acting that enchants the viewer, making us completely forget that the often so important soundtrack is simply missing. Take time for the film, many sequences are worth watching and analyzing several times. Madchen in Uniform is not only a must see? it's a must have!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no summary for the movie; I think the persons above me have already summarized it. I just wanted to say that this movie really touched me and that I disagree with some of the comments about Lily Palmer and Romy Schneider not doing a good job on this movie. I was really impressed by the way they acted and I was really pulled into the movie. There is no need for beautiful sets or great effects around it if the actors do such a good job! You could really see how Lily Palmer portrayed a woman who wanted to help but also had to be firm in a way to stay at the school. And also how Romy Schneider portrayed her role as such an innocent and vulnerable child who has just lost her mother and her struggles with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality remake, as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Géza von Radványi's "Mädchen in Uniform" or "Girls in Uniform" is a German 1958 film, so this one is soon 60 years old. It is a remake and while the original was made shortly before the Nazi rise to power, when this one here was made, World War II had already been over for a decade. The main difference is probably that this one here has color. And it also runs for roughly 8 minutes longer. I liked the original and I also like this one. The slight changes, for example in the ending with the Oberin being compassionate or the Oberin's assistant were all solid addition that elevated the original material. Still, despite Romy Schneider playing the main character, this film here is probably still not as famous as the old black-and-white film. The reason, however, is not that this one here is worse, but that the old film back then was just very brave in terms of the political climate shortly before the Nazis' rise to power.But lets speak a bit more about this one here. The acting was good from everybody involved and I never had a moment during these 90 minutes when I felt bored. Romy Schneider, shortly after her Sissi trilogy, looks incredibly stunning as always and received a German Film Award performance for her portrayal here. Same goes for her co-lead Lilli Palmer and Blandine Ebinger, who plays the main antagonist in her supporting role here. There were many weak, pretty cringeworthy films from Germany in the 1950s, but this is certainly not one of them. A really good watch with an interesting story about love, coming-of-age, teenage dreams and authority. The movie certainly has a message. I recommend seeing it. Thumbs up for this convincing remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to see the original version of," Madchen in uniform",but this version is great. The beautiful Eastman color photography and the art direction and the lighting makes it look like a painting , almost like Technicolor cinema photography . The acting is great too. I'm surprise that the academy of motion picture of arts and science, at the time didn't have it nominated as the best foreign picture. The plot poor Maneuala's parents are dead and has been living with an aunt, a strict one.She's send off a world's toughest private school for girl's. The principle is mean. The rules are too rough. There is a sign in front of the hall way of the school that read's " you are not put here to be happy, ecetra. Well eventually Manuela meets her teacher , played by Lilie Palmer, Elizabeth Burnberg. She'a very sympathetic to the girls and Manuela eventually discovers her lesbian self when she is practicing a kiss scene , with M.s.Burnberg ,in a rehearsal for the Sheakspearian play "Romeo and Juliette", for a school play being put on for the principle's birthday,discovering her love for her teacher.When after the play the girls are given hurricanes to drink ,Rum Punch, that she reveals to her school mates her love for her teacher all hell breaks loose A young Christine Kaufmann, who would later be the lead in Town without a pity and later marry Tony Curtis, makes her film appearance as one of the students.What's really surprising is that this DVD version does include sub titles in English, in spite of the fact it's a German disk. The original producer, who's interviewed , reveals the possibility that Romy and Lillie might have been involved with each other out side camera , maybe? Or it could have been just staying in character in order to be authentic for the film. This is available in the U. S. A. on zero region at German video.net also on VHS as well as on pal 2 DVD at amazon.de both have subtitles in English except for VHS version, maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TRIVIAL AND UNINSPIRED REMAKE OF A CLASSIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the endless row of remakes in the 50's of successes of the 20' and 30's this one may have been the oddest. What is basically a harsh, sensitive but never sentimental play, qualities that remained in the remarkable film version of 1931, has become a trivial drama. It starts with the credits; in it it is stated that the film is based on a play by Winsloe called "Rittter Nerestani"; this original title was already obsolete at the Berlin premiere and changed into "Gestern und Morgen", thereby stressing the object of the play: a plea for a more liberal society. But in the 50's German society of Adenauer's credo "No experiments" this plea was not possible.Some odd changes have been made vis-?-vis the play and the film version of 1931. The character of Von Kenten, symbol of the fear for authority, has been replaced by a nondescript character who hates Elisabeth von Bernburg; why she hates her, is not made clear at all. Frau Oberin was changed from a symbol of Prussian authority into a bitter old lady who is only the way she is, because she had some bitter experiences in life. The scandal that arises when Manuela is drunk and speaks out, is brought about by petty jealousy of one of the girls (Alexandra). Noteworthy is also that, when Ilse is banned from partaking in Romeo and Juliet, she cheerfully helps another girl to learn the part, in stead of, as in the 1931 version, packing her suitcase to leave the institution; in other words: hardly any rebellion here. The reconciliation near the end is just silly. What this all amounts to is that the play in this adaptation is melodrama. However, unlike some critics, I do not think the lesbian theme is further toned-down, it is simply represented in another way to be acceptable to an 1950's mainstream audience.There is nothing against an stirring melodrama, but also in this department the film fails. That is: Radvanyi's direction is adequate but without inspiration. At moments he tries to give scenes extra strength with shadows and light (there is a nice shot of Schneider in the dark on her bed), but it is not sufficient. He is not helped much by the two leading actresses. Romy Schneider has her moments (her first serious part after the Sissi-series), but in general fails to convey any emotion and she surely plays quite another Manuela than Hertha Thiele in the 1931 version. Lilli Palmer, who thought she could do anything, is a terrible mis-cast as Von Bernburg: she is not the woman in her mid-20's having trouble with her emotions. All scenes between Schneider and Palmer miss spark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A monumental waste of talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like 'Immer wenn der Tag beginnt' this strange mix of drama and coming-of-age story deals with the tribulations of school teachers and stars a top box-office draw in the lead (Lilli Palmer vs. Ruth Leuwerik), but otherwise they differ widely. While 'Immer wenn der Tag beginnt' is sensitive, delicate and poignant this horrible remake of a classic masterpiece misses all the way.Miss Palmer, who just wowed critics and public alike with her wonderful 'Anstasia - Die letzte Zarentochter', is much too young and much to elegant for the requirements of the part. Her scenes with Romy Schneider, desperate to escape the saccharine and schmaltzy 'Sissi' trilogy, miss sparkle and their heavily hyped 'kiss' is as shocking as a milk-shake. The chilling social comment, that made the original version in 1932 an all time classic is now completely passé and all that's left is just a beautifully photographed ante-bellum frou-frou about a gaggle of glamour girls. They laugh, they cry and after 90 minutes of tame misunderstandings the nonplussed viewer is left with a 'So what?' feeling.</fullReview>
