		<shortDescription>There are spiders on the Moon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Cunha did not direct many movies but the few he did give us are fantastic. You know right away you are in an alternate universe when you watch this one. Hero Richard Travis pulls back a curtain to give us a look at what is supposed to be a giant rocket way out in the background; but you can tell immediately that it is a wooden model just a few inches away! Oh it just gets better from there! Scientist Michael Whalen blasts off for the Moon with a makeshift crew of 2 escaped JD's (Gary Clarke of HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER fame and Tommy Cook of no particular fame at all). Mr. Travis and girlfriend Cathy Downs (former fiancée of THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN) go aboard just before blastoff and are unable to get off in time . . . does that mean they were shanghaied? Amazingly the extra weight does not affect fuel or oxygen consumption and apart from the obligatory meteor shower they reach the Moon with no problem. Remember to keep repeating "It's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie . . ."This is not the Moon of DESTINATION MOON, oh no! This Moon is inhabited by walking rocks that look like Gumby on steroids, a giant spider that looks like a puppet (well okay it IS a puppet but it's a darn mean looking puppet!) and a civilisation of beautiful women. They have a distinct problem though, they are running out of oxygen and must take off for another planet soon or else! They want the Earth people to show them how to build a rocket to carry them to safety. Meanwhile moon girl Alpha (Nina Bara) takes one look at Travis and decides she must have him for a mate and her unrequited love is more important than the survival of her own race. Talk about self absorbed!Is it art? No. Is it fun? You bet! The puppet spider had already been seen in the 3-D film CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON but Mr. Cunha's film is much more fun. The rock men are surprisingly good and the Moon girls are fabulous. Look closely for Leslie Parrish (Daisy Mae of L'IL ABNER fame) and Lisa Simone who would go on to meet THE GIANT GILA MONSTER among the lunar beauties.Amazing some TV prints cut the scenes of the spider claiming a victim and the climactic shot that shows why you should not go out in the sun while visiting the moon. Some DVD prints of this now Public Domain title offer the film uncut. Notice I said some, not all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Perfectly" Awful Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic in the "so bad it's good" canon. Almost every aspect of this film is poorly realized, and it thereby has a kind of sub-genre "purity" about it. The special effects are far from acceptable under any other circumstances. Costumes are a camp spectacular, especially those of the Moon Women and their "Lido" with her ludicrous head gear. Monsters consist of the (very slowly) walking rocks and that giant spider with visible wires who got a lot of work in the late 50s as the inhabitant of many caves and planets.Best of all, though, is the acting. Every cast member, without exception, is inept. Even handsome Gary Clarke, who later showed he had talent, is awful here. But the "Anti-Oscar" surely must go to Cathy Downs for her brilliant portrayal of an Earth woman among Lunar rivals. As they lead her to her doom in the jaws of the giant spider, she cries out: "No! Don't!"See this movie for a truckload-o-laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect "Bad Movie" Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is almost a perfect film of its type: the 50's lower-than-low-budget science fiction yarn. More specifically, the one about traveling to another planet and finding the underground civilization of beauty pageant winners in showgirl costumes and high heels. And a silly rubber spider puppet monster. And living rock creatures that look like Gumby.This is one hilariously incompetent slab of celluloid, meant for the bottom half of the bill at the local Drive-In, custom made for the local teenagers to ignore while furiously making out in the capacious back seat of Dad's '58 Oldsmobile. Almost as funny as Plan Nine From Outer Space! If Ed Wood Jr. had made a film about a trip to the moon, it would be very close to this, except all the women on the moon would be wearing angora sweaters. No, sorry, SPACE angora sweaters.I won't get into all the plot holes, bad (over)acting and cheesy special effects. The black and white cinematography is actually pretty darn good for something with this tiny of a budget, so kudos to the DP. Can't give the same to the director, writers, or any of the actors though.Very sad that Mystery Science Theater 3000 never had the chance to cover this film, nor the other films that went toward inspiring Amazon Women on the Moon, namely Cat Women on the Moon and Queen of Outer Space. Though MST3K did tackle Project Moonbase, Moon Zero and Rocketship X-M early on. They also did Phantom Planet in one of the later seasons, which has some similarities with this turkey.Anyway, this is quite an enjoyable trip to 50's Drive-In land, a magical place in a magical time nobody will ever recapture. Thank goodness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching this....I've been Mooned!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whew! This film is something to see, that is for sure. It tells the story of five people aboard a missile going to the moon. None of the leads have any acting range at all, but look like master thespians once we are introduced to the people living on the moon in the kingdom of Olanda(?). There we find the Ledo...the leader of a bunch of buxom, half-clad women living off of oxygen waiting for news from an emmisary sent to Earth. The Ledo bears no small resemblence to Rosiland Russell in appearence, lacking any of that actress's ability. The rest of the plot is incredibly inane and we see giant rock men with strips cut out where you can see human faces, a giant spider called the "dark ones" that looks like a leftover from a Syd and Marty Kroft seventies show, and other equally inept script and special effects problems. The budget for the film starts at low and goes swiftly to almost no budget! The film is funny in all the wrong places, and willbe a hoot to sit through. The guy playing Steve Drayton is just God awful! Fun to watch though!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy memories of the best elements of a 1950's film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, what made sci-fi films of the 1950's good were easy to recognize good/bad characters, self-sacrifice of one character to save the others, and a monster or two. If you overlook the low budget monsters "spider and rock men" then I believe that you too will enjoy this film. The bad characters were both killed because of "greed and power-seeking" which is seen in many 1950's films. The good characters were almost killed but were saved because of self-sacrifice of one in the name of Love. So if you are after a lot of violence and special effects then this film is not for you. However, if a different type of story, with dialog and the background of good vs evil with good winning out is your "cup of tea" then this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake of "Cat Women of the Moon"? Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard E. Cunha's low budget remake of `Cat Women of the Moon' contains some hysterical flaws. When the spacemen land on the Moon, the full-sized rocket prop they stand beneath is obviously just a flat cardboard mockup of the lower ten feet. The lunar `rockmen' who attack the astronauts look like stone Gumbies -- and the noses of the people in the suits stick out plainly from the flat stone `face'. The noises aren't even colored like the stone! The plot and acting are equally uproarious. After learning that the government is going to take over his private Moon rocket project, a scientist discovers two young fugitives hiding inside his spacecraft. He pulls out a gun and threatens to shot them if they don't agree to serve as crewmen on his lunar voyage. During the trip, the scientist reveals that he is actually an alien from the Moon -- and he built the rocket to get back home!The lunar civilization is comprised entirely of former beauty contest winners, all dressed up in high heels and showgirl costumes. Gary Clark (`How to Make a Monster') plays one of the young escapees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes "Cat Women of the Moon" look like DeMille.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that anyone would want to re-make "Cat Women...", but I guess plagiarism knows no bounds. Unfortunately, the humor of the original (which continues to crack me up) was only funny the first time, and this attempt at re-animation reeks. The original at least had some good actors/actresses (Victor Jory, Marie Windsor, Bill Phipps...), but this one is a thespian black hole. Everything from CWOTM is here: telepathic communication with a crew member, subterranean all-woman civilization, giant cave spider... Oh, there is one HUGE "difference": the greedy "crewman" who goes after diamonds (instead of the gold of COTW) which are as common as quartz on this version of the moon. The crew of this rocket (which has an exhaust manifold about the size of a large pizza) is a mad scientist, two escaped cons, and a pair of unwitting stowaways (one- of course- a woman) who, when the rocket blasts off, grab air masks "..because soon we'll be out of the earth's atmosphere". The masks are old fighter pilot jobbies, and are unconnected to anything at all, let alone an oxygen tank. Already in a deep hole, this flick goes downhill rapidly from there: The rocket just happened to have a ladies space suit (and of course she's wearing pearls and high heels); the "moon" has plants growing on it; rock creatures which attack at the speed of "The Crawling Terror", yet (of course) our intrepid band cannot elude or outdistance them; and on and on and on...What a stinker!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Dubbed Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dubbed female scream, commonly used in the 1950s, gets especially good notices in this intriguing science-fiction film. It's so good, 2 actresses, Cathy Downs and Nina Bara, get to use the exact same scream. The film is competently told, sincerely acted, particularly by K.T. Stevens as the Moon's Queen, and the always reliable Ms. Downs. The rock creatures are eerie; in fact "Galaxy Quest" (1999) honors this film with their giant rock monster. The spider is a bit puppet like, but the Moon women are compelling.Above-average chills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-budget, campy fun for 1950's horror &amp; sci-fi fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Missile To The Moon seems to be a remake of Cat-Women Of The Moon, but no one from Cat-Women's production team played any part with making this movie. Not even the writer of Cat-Women Of The Moon is credited with the writing. The story is very similar with four men (Richard Travis, Tommy Cook, Michael Whalen, and Gary Clarke of How To Make A Monster), and a woman (Cathy Downs of The Amazing Colossal Man, and Phantom From 10,000 Leagues) blasting off for the moon. Possible SPOILERS: This time two of the crew members are escaped convicts who are being forced to go along by the rocketship's creator. Also along is his assistant who became trapped with his girlfriend when the rocketship blasted off. Along the way the rocketship's creator dies, but while dying he shows the others a medallion. Upon landing on the moon the crew encounters rock creatures, and take refuge in a cave. Soon they are in the domain of the moon women, and learn there are no longer any moon men. The Lido (K.T. Stevens), ruler of the moon women, believes the assistant is the rocketship's creator, because he is the one possessing the medallion. The Lido personally knew the man who has died, but is now blind. Soon it is revealed the man is the assistant. There was a pre-arranged marriage between the rocketship's creator, and moon girl Alpha (Nina Bara.) Alpha wants to continue with the ceremony even after learning the man is the assistant. The moon maidens have telepathic powers, and there is a telepathic battle between The Lido and the evil Alpha. Alpha loses the battle but stabs the Lido in the back, and becomes the new Lido. She then sentences the girlfriend of the assistant to die by being the victim of a large spider, but the girlfriend is rescued when the men quickly escape. A helpful moon girl sets off a device that removes all the oxygen in the domain of the moon women, and all the moon women die. One more episode with the rock creatures leads the rougher of the two convicts into the sunlight, and he gets fried to the bone! Missile To The Moon contains average acting, and the special effects are average for the era in which the movie was made; with the exception of the rock creatures and large spider. The rock creatures look like spongy, foam rubber costumes, and the spider is a rather silly looking puppet. The music is effective, and is a nice touch. Obviously there is more plot in this movie than in Cat-Women Of The Moon, and a lot of it is plain silly. Why, oh why, were the two convicts hiding in a rocketship of all places? Well, this is what you get from Astor Pictures: Low-budget, campy fun for 1950's horror and science fiction fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original "Amazon Women On the Moon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This B-movie double feature classic is definitely the original inspiration for the title parody in the film "Amazon Women on the Moon". That film, however, featured the gorgous Sybil Danning, while in this 50's classic, we have to settle for teenage beauty contestants.Not to say that the girls aren't cute. But, with all the elements involved here, it wouldn't have hurt the proceedings to show some skin. Alas, this is the 50's and certain production codes prohibited nudity in this sort of film, so we are stuck with clothed beauties.The plot? Oh, yes, for some reason I got distracted. The infantile storyline concerns a scientist who is hijacked by escaped convicts. The ragtag crew blastoff in a rocketship towards the moon, where they meet up with rock creatures, giant spiders(who guard diamonds) and femme fatales. The number one cheesy high-point is the landing on the moon, and the dialogue is a close second.This film, along with QUEEN FROM OUTER SPACE, makes for preliminary viewing for anyone interested in 50's sci-fi, ultra-low-budget style. Maybe someday it will show up on DVD, and I'll get a copy. Just so I can look at those Moon Beauties, and think of what a classic the film would've been had it been made in the swingin' seventies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going Home To The Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Missile To The Moon has to be one of the wilder science fiction films the Fifties came out with. It has cheesy special effects, lousy plot, scantily clad females, and a dying civilization. All the ingredients to make a cult classic.Michael Whalen and Richard Travis have constructed themselves a moon rocket that they have in Whalen's backyard. Government funds have shut down the project. But Whalen is going back to the moon, yes I said back because he came here years ago from there on a secret mission. The lack of a crew is remedied by Whalen drafting a pair of escaped convicts Gary Clarke and Tommy Cook who've busted out of jail and took refuge in Whalen's space ship. Amazing how fast one can get astronaut training in a pinch. Travis and his girlfriend Cathy Downs also come on board and the five get to the moon.Whereupon they find a shrinking civilization living in caves led by Queen K.T. Stevens. I can't go into the rest but in the short time this film runs we meet rock monsters, giant spiders, and a doomed moon with only women running things. That's what Whalen was sent to earth for, to get a spaceship so they can all escape.In a word this film is bizarre. In fact all the players look like they're in terrible need of ExLax. I would to if I had to summon up enough abilities to make this story any kind of credible. It gets two stars from me, the second star for the sheer audacity of bringing this one to the big screen. It must have been drive-in hoot in 1958.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm still waiting for the evening gown portion of the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of serious science fiction need not bother. In fact, to call Missile to the Moon a "science fiction" movie is something of a misstatement. "Fiction" ? sure. "Science" ? not on your life. Any resemblance Missile to the Moon may have with actual science is purely coincidental and, most likely, unintentional. But that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Taken for what it is (a 1958 low-budget drive-in b-movie), it's not half bad. Sure, the rock creatures look fake and the giant spider is obviously a puppet and the inhabitants of the moon are straight off an Atlantic City beauty show runway, but all these things only add to the fun of the movie. It's kooky stuff like this that always seems to appeal to me. Don't take it too seriously and you just might enjoy it. There are a couple of other positives. One, the film is nicely paced so that at only 78 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. And two, the movie looks far better than it should given its meager budget. I'd say that the cinematographer, Meredith M. Nicholson, got it right. In the end, Missile to the Moon may not be the greatest movie ever made, but as a piece of entertainment, it's certainly better than its 2.4 IMDb rating. For what it's worth, I'll give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightfully dippy piece of vintage 50's sci-fi camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quintet of folks -- stalwart Steve Dayton (stolid Richard Travis), his plucky gal pal June Saxton (pretty Cathy Downs), kindly old scientist Dirk Green (affable Michael Whalen), brash escaped convict Gary Fennell (sparky Tommy Cook) and his whiny buddy Lon (jittery Gary Clarke) -- fly off in a rocket ship to the moon. The discover a race of attractive lunar ladies led by the blind the Lido (essayed with lip-smacking relish by K.T. Stevens) who are running low on oxygen and want to leave their planet as soon as possible. Clumsily directed with total seriousness by Richard Cunha, with plain cinematography by Meredith Nicholson, flat acting, a trite, talky script, an overwrought full-bore orchestral score by Nicholas Carras, sluggish pacing, laughable dialogue, tacky (far from) special effects, and uproariously obvious cardboard sound stages, this infamous nifty 50's low-budget sci-fi camp classic provides plenty of goofy entertainment and a sizable number of unintentional chuckles. The rock monsters in particular are a total hoot; they resemble pumped-up pernicious versions of Gumby. The giant fake rubbery puppet spider likewise makes for a positively gut-busting shoddy sight to behold. Moreover, the lunar ladies are all undeniably lovely, with Nina Bara clearly copping the top honors as the selfish and insolent Alpha. Good, silly kitsch fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drive in classic is campy scifi fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De-facto remake of Cat women of the Moon about a shipful of men who find a hidden civilization full of women on the moon. They also find some monsters.Classic 1950's scifi film has been raided for its footage numerous times over the years. Even if you haven't seen the whole film, there is a very good chance that you'll have seen at least some part of this film (I'd guess either the rock men or the giant spider). The complete film is rather silly but fun in a B-movie spoofy sort of away, except that the film isn't a spoof, this is the real deal. (Why see films like the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra when this is the real deal?) I like the film and its exactly the sort of fun nonsense that I like in my 1950's science fiction films. Is it the best film ever made? Absolutely not. But it is a fun throw back to a simpler time before we knew better, or if we did know better we could at least pretend we didn't for the sake of fun. Anyone wanting a bit of campy scifi fun is directed to this film.(To be honest I have no idea why any one would want to remake the even sillier Catwomen of the Moon, but I guess the producers figured that no one was ever going to day anything.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow...you know it's bad when they are ripping off a film that was horrible the first time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film involves five humans who go on a flight to the moon. Once there, they find a planet of nothing but women--angry, PMS-enraged women! And, to make matters worse, there are giant rock creatures, spiders and two of the crew members are crooks.Wow...you know this is going to be a terrible film when they are ripping off CAT-WOMEN OF THE MOON--especially since CAT-WOMEN is one of the worst films of the early 1950s! Now I don't know if MISSILE TO THE MOON was announced as a remake, but it certainly was and the number of similarities are too many to be a coincidence. Both involve a rocket trip to the moon. Both have a crew member who actually is being controlled by the Moon folks. Both moons are inhabited by super-unattractive "beauty queens" in spandex. Both have really stupid giant plastic spiders in the caves. Both have crews whose space suits are stolen. And, these are only a few of the similarities. So, they remade a bad movie and in a way that is no better than the wretched original! Wow, that has "must-see" written all over it!!One of the other horrible touches are a skeleton that clearly is from a science classroom (with the top of the skull sawed off)--even though it's supposed to belong to one of the dead crew members who you see die before your eyes. Another brilliant touch was using three completely different rockets as well as normal Earth gravity on the moon and inside the space ship throughout the trip. Nice attention to details, folks!Overall, this is a terrible film that only lovers of schlock cinema will enjoy. Others will probably find it pretty tedious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange happenings on the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Missile to the Moon a couple of times now and found it quite enjoyable and also unintentionally funny in parts.A couple of crooks who have escaped from prison are being pursued by coppers when they decide to hide in a rocket they have come across. They are then caught by its inventor who forces them to go to the moon with him. What they are unaware of is that the inventor's friend and his lover have also come aboard. They arrive on the Moon and come across several strange things including diamonds, a cheap looking giant spider, some rather strange looking rock men and, best of all, a group of beautiful young ladies who are living on the moon. After one of the group is hypnotised by the leader of the group so she can marry him, he manages to escape and they head back to the ship but not before one of the prisoners is roasted to death by the intense heat of the sun.Missile to the Moon is more or less a remake to Cat Women of the Moon, which was made in 1953.The cast includes Richard Travis (Mesa of Lost Women), Cathy Downs (The Amazing Colossal Man, The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues) and Gary Clarke (How to Make A Monster).This is a must for all B-movie fanatics. Great fun.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget, Low Tech Space Opera Livened By Luscious Moon Babes In Low, Low- Cut Outfits -- Hot Dawg!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did I forget to mention low intelligence Script? No matter. This enjoyable drive-in special was designed for the underdeveloped brain and over-active hormones of a particularly crude specimen of ape, the 1950's teenage male (that's me and my pals in the two-tone green '53 Plymoth sedan third row up from the popcorn stand). This bunch of knuckle-draggers wouldn't know or care that there were no clouds on the Moon or that pegboard and Army surplus bunk beds were not exactly the latest technology of space craft equipment even for the 1950's. What they would care about was whether this flick was going to show them some sexy, skimpy-dressed Moon Babes. In this department Missle to the Moon would have not disappointed! Who cares about the cheesy sets and ludicrous special effects! The producers of this awful but fun si-fi epic rounded up a covey of seriously gorgeous hotties to play the wonderfully lascivious Lunar lasses. They even combed beauty contests all over the states and the world to lure the winners to Hollywood or wherever this trifle was made, no doubt at low salaries but extravagant claims of chances for fame and fortune. One of the fun games you can play while watching is trying to figure out which of the Moon chicks is Miss Yugoslavia -- was it the tall blonde with the angular face or the short, dark, exotica who danced the hootchy-kootchy?The sexiest and most exotic of all is in fact Nina Bara, as the beautiful bad Moon girl Alpha. Though only 5th billed, Nina was the real star of the show. Her chewing the cardboard scenery, deliciously wicked villainy is the only thing, other than curiosity, that makes this space soaper worth watching to the end. Her acting skill, I hasten to add, was far above that of the higher billed members of the no-name cast. It's worth the price of the DVD to see her gleefully wicked expressions and movements as she pulls a dagger from the confines of her bulging bosom. Though 38 years old at the time, Nina was still very pretty (in a sinister way), and wow! what a figure! In that all-important department (to this picture) she stacked up quite well (pun intended) against the young beauty contest bimbos. I don't understand why this badly underused actress didn't do better. In her prime a few years before this, she would have been a terrific femme fa-tale in those noir thrillers -- well, the low, low budget ones anyway.Missle To The Moon is not nearly as bad a movie as others have carried on. Not one of those you watch just to laugh at such as Mesa of Lost Women (see my review). True, they did use the same giant, rubber spider from that looser, but they used it better in Missle. Though leading man Richard Travis and leading lady Kathy Downs were as bland as skim milk most of the time, Ms. Downs at least came alive during the cat fight with Alpha -- Hot Dawg! Though veteran stage actress K. T. Stevens seemed to sleep-walk though her part as the Moon Babe ruler Lido, the general quality of the acting wasn't so bad. Compare to past space operas up to the time -- every member of the cast, including the blankest of the beauty queens, could act better than Buster Crabbe of Flash Gordon fame! So the shots of the rocket in space were stock footage of V-2 rockets. What would you expect of a space travel flick of any budget from 1958. This was only the year after Sputnik. The United States had not yet managed to launch a ping-pong ball into space. Actually, Missle to the Moon is quite an enjoyable watch if you just think of it as a fun romp.I do have a couple of gripes though. 1) They spent too much time traveling to the Moon before they found the Moon Babes and the wonderful Alpha. 2) A major plot hole is the Moon Babes claiming they were keeping the earthlings captive so they could learn to fly their space ship to another planet before their oxygen supply ran out. Why did they need the rocket? With all the spandex the Moon bunnies had, they could have built a giant sling shot which could have launched space vehicles with velocity enough to escape the moon's low gravity. And you thought I wasn't the scientifical type! If you want to see space travel portrayed as accurately as 1950's technology could, watch Destination Moon, and be bored. If you want to have fun, watch Missle To The Moon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank goodness that this was not in smell-o-vision. I would have to have had a close pin on my nose. This ranks as one of the lamest movies of all time let alone probably the worst remakes of all time. The original version, Catwoman on the moon, is one of the worst films ever made, and to find out that there was a remake made just five years later,I rolled my eyes even before the film started. Well not entirely a duplicate of the original, this has elements that make it believe it or not even worse.Giant rocks that walk, a hideous looking spider the size of an elephant and an aging queen fighting to keep her throne are among the ridiculous elements of this wretched piece of science fiction. The women who live on the moon look as if they are living inside a Mardi Gras Festival, with K.T. Stevens as the Lido aka queen of the moon women. She has a rival to the throne in her assistant Alpha who defies her at every turn in her efforts to take over. The visitors from Earth includes two escaped convicts and several scientists who kick off accidentally from earth and end up on the moon which remarkably looks like a desert. All of a sudden, rocks break out of the formation, walking so slowly that there is no way they could ever catch up to those they are after. This monster as well as the spider ended up in that delicious 1982 spoof of bad science fiction/horror films, "It came from Hollywood", and in a way it was fun to find the film that I remembered the silly clips from.This just gets sillier and silly are as the movie goes on and I can't imagine driving audiences actually watching this without laughing or throwing things at the big screen. It is just so absurd. Yes the spider is gruesome looking and may give you the heebie jeebies, but the rock people are so stupid looking, like Teletubbies filmed in black and white. The acting is hideous, particularly by the space women and ranks up there with the worst performances of all time, although I did have sympathy for K.T. Stevens. In fact I would give this collectively the award for worst acting of the year, because everybody is so bad that I couldn't single just one person out. Veteran actress Stevens tries her best but you can see behind her character's apparent blindness in her own eyes that she was just thinking am I this desperate for a paycheck? Phony looking sets includes the earthlings looking out the cave palace window at supposed land which is really s bad drawing. So grab some popcorn, sit back and laugh. Because you are entering into what remains worse than even the stupidest of the early Star Trek episodes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best destination Moon themed movie from the '50s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is above average sci-fi movie from the '50s. There're few good characters in this movie that makes it a good science fiction movie.While not the grand production of the "Forbidden Planet", this movie definitely sticks out above similar moon themed movies such as "Cat Women of Moon" or "Operation Moon Base". The two ingredients that makes this movie higher quality is the choice of actors playing in this movie, and better props like the rock men of moon that can survive in the intense heat of moon's sun. Premise that moon's sun is intense enough to burn humans to the bones also was an interesting visual effect that left an indelible memory as a child.Interestingly enough this movie has similar elements to the "Cat Women of Moon" and the "Operation Moon Base" in that moon is inhabited by all women race vying for main character's love which doesn't settle well with his fiancé, and that there is non-legitimate crew aboard the spaceship.First part of the movie is somewhat slow and boring, but once the crew reaches the moon, the story starts to pick up, and becomes interesting.This is one destination moon type movie from the '50s that's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>plot to be too repetitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- Missle to the Moon, 1958. A private pair of spaceship makers want to travel to the moon. At the last minute, government officials intervene to take over their project. A hasty lift-off with a skeleton crew of two escaped hip-ster convicts and a couple of stowaways launch and land on the moon. On the moon, they explore and find a underground all female moon civilization thats dying. The moon maidens try to steal the Earth ship to use it to escape to their safety. *Special Stars- Richard Travis, Cathy Downs, Tommy Cook, K. T. Stevens, Nina Bara.*Theme- Spaceflight exploration is simple.*Trivia/location/goofs- Funny to see regular gym lockers in a spaceship for set dressing. this film is a remake of 3-D 'Cat Women of the Moon'(Cat Women had 'The Hollywood Dancers' for the eye-candy, in this film beauty contest winners) and 'Queen of Outer Space' with Zsa Zsa Gabor. The cave monster spider was also used in many other B-Movie films. The other special note was the use of rock-men that looked like 'Gumby' attacking the heroes. Location: Red Rock Canyon- Ridgecrest, California.*Emotion- I found this film' plot to be too repetitious of several other B-Movies to care very much. I did enjoy the unique elements of this film like the rock men and the moon maidens. This film is fun to see once, but not a second time. Go see it's original films for some much deeded and added entertainment value. *Based On- 50's moon flight technology and public knowledge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So clichéd it creaks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm amazed there is no "goofs" link for this movie because there are many, including: Space suits that don't have any connection between the suit and the helmet leaving the bare neck of the wearer visibly exposed.Characters able to hear things on the airless moon's surface.Clouds on the moon.A gantry clearly visible as the spaceship lands on the unexplored lunar surface (an effect achieved by reversing the stock V2 take-off footage used earlier in the movie with a couple of rock matted into the foreground).A civilisation so starved of oxygen that the main form of interior decorative lighting consists of lighted torches and flambeaux.Early in the movie Hunk hero and Girlfriend are trapped in the lower part of the ship that "has no oxygen". Luckily there are a couple of 'spare' oxygen masks lying around. Later one of the crew in the upper part of the ship raises a hatch in the floor of the upper section to reveal the two slumped bodies. No he wouldn't. If the lower portion had been unpressurised, the air pressure in the upper cabin would have held the door shut with the apparent weight of a couple of tons.Etc etc.None of these would really mar what is a pretty awful, hackneyed piece of junk SF assembled from bits salvaged from the great North Hollywood cliché mountain but for the fact that the whole plot revolves around the lack of air on the moon. This movie has no internal logic at all.If you are looking to buy this movie - and I cannot for the life of me understand why you would - please be warned: my copy is on one of those "3 Classic Sci-F- Films of the Silver Screen" on one disc jobs* and the print is just awful. Scratched, jumpy and, amazingly, out of focus for great chunks of the time.*Cat Number CE 040 along with Earth Vs The Flying Saucers http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049169 and Planet Outlaws http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046192</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This thing is so familiar you probably carry a copy in your wallet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five people--including a youthful pair of criminal escapees--blast off for the moon. But one of the five--the spaceship's designer--goes through his four pages of script a little too quickly and expires mid- journey. Trading their less than authentic moon rocket jumpsuits for even less authentic zero-gravity apparel, the surviving four narrowly escape ridiculously sluggard rock creatures on their way to b-movie sci-fi cave #26a where, after finding a burning torch and removing their oxygen masks, they are overcome by sleeping gas (aka smoke).They fall awake on set "2" which, for this movie, has been transformed from a low-budget b-movie throne room into a... low budget b-movie throne room. Enter the Queen--excuse me the Lido. And after her the girls: Miss Nomer, Miss Treated, Miss Understood and Miss Shapen... you get the picture. And of course Alpha, played by Miss Congeniality.Right here this b&amp;w non-classic goes colour: Green with envy and seeing red, the lady who played Barbara Billingsley on "Leave it to Beaver" (here the token earth woman) gives a black-hearted Alpha the wedding bell blues. But backstabbing (literally) Alpha isn't about to give up Barbara's man without a fight--or in this case sentence of death, which was probably easier to write into the screenplay. And so Barbara is sent to the cave to face execution by spider-puppet. They must have shot this thing on a Friday as the guy who played Jack Web is conveniently on set to cut the spider-puppet's strings in plenty of time to effect the leading lady's rescue. (How did I not see that coming?) Don't expect the guy who played Frankie Avalon in "Bikini Bleach" to be in the sequel for, while trying to escape with a pair of kfc buckets filled with rock candy diamonds, his last scene has him struggling with the problem of deciding whether to drop his diamonds and escape with his life or to perish in a most horrific manner. A hormone-raging dropout with a natural affinity for stealing cars, he does exactly what any good 1958 audience would expect him to do and unwisely elects to die for the benefit of intelligent movie go-ers everywhere. Sunlight roasts off his flesh and pomade both; though perhaps not to any degree of loss, as his bad-to-the-bone skeleton clearly shows the carefully inked markings mapped for cranial dissection at Hollywood med school, and I am confident he went on to further b-movie work once this thing was in the can. Perhaps even as the notorious sword-fighting skeleton of "Seventh Voyage of Sinbad" fame. Now THAT was a movie! I'm a sucker for b-grade sci-fi, and "Missile" earns three lollipops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More showgirls on planets...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And a remake of THE QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE.....let alone CATWOMEN OF THE MOON...all of which of course I loved. This one has some funny wobbly foam rock-men and the most hilarious big spider I have ever seen. The spaceship has army disposal double bunks and the two escapee crims are lewd and bumpkin level drowsy in that order. Even the 3 year old I was babysittng had to see it several times to believe it all. Tracy Turnblad level of showgirl Hairdoos and a dance number musical number using only a tambourine and bongos for music gives accurate indication to the fantastic cheapness of this demented extravaganza. Miss Hungary appears along with Miss Miami at one stage, I think. Awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Voyage to the moon no accident.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirk Green(Michael Whalen)wants to keep the spaceship he built to himself without any interference from the government. When he finds a couple of escaped convicts hiding in the craft, he forces Lon(Gary Clarke)and Gene(Tommy Cook)to become his crew and it is all systems go. The missile is launched and found aboard are Dirk's science technician and partner Steve(Richard Travis)and his fiancée June(Cathy Down). Before the ship even lands on the moon, Dirk is accidentally killed and nobody else knows that he is actually a previous inhabitant of the moon trying to get back. The adventurers land on the moon and find a dying civilization of beautiful women under the rule of The Lido(K.T. Stevens). There are also some "rock monsters" that look like man-size stone Gumbies. Thus this low budget affair has very primitive special effects and is no showcase for recognizable acting abilities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you improve upon perfection?At least you don't need 3-D glasses to enjoy this classical 50's bad Sci-Fi.Actually both movies are great, enjoyable "epics" of B-Movie sci-fi at its worst (best?).</fullReview>
