		<shortDescription>NOT BAD AND FUN TO WATCH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "It started with Eve" (1941) is a much more charming film, but still this well-paced remake is not bad either and is fun to watch, albeit too loud and farcical at moments. Director Wirth generally keeps things in check, but he could not make Peter Fricke (as Tobias) at least acceptable. Minuses are compensated by Heinz Rühmann as the grumpy but also charming Jonathan, his timing is immaculate. Other fine supporting actors are Paul Dahlke, the charming Franzika Oehme in the Deanne Durbin part and Beppo Brem in a bit part as the carrier. Considered in 1973 as too oldfashioned (too 50's), 25 years later this comedy is less dated than the then comedies that were considered contemporary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly well-done romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in the early Seventies, this is mainly old-fashioned family entertainment ? and perhaps a little more than that. Basically, it's a remake of the 1941 Hollywood comedy "It started with Eve". The script cleverly focuses on it's main character, a rich, old, grumpy and imperious Ex-Consul, named Jonathan Reynolds, who seems to be on his death bed at the beginning, but soon recovers to everyones surprise. All the dialog and comedic twists, like Jonathan constantly disobeying the House-doctors orders, seem to be tailored to fit Heinz Ruehmann in the title role. Ruehmann, who so often in his career had played average citizens, sympathetic at first sight, really makes fun of the wealthy but lonely old man, whose insufferable manners cover a heart of gold. The story unfolds, as the consuls son (weak: Peter Fricke) presents a poor girl student (lovely: Franziska Oehme) as his bride. Actually she is just a substitute for his real fiancé, who is absent, and he picked her up accidentally and hired her to appear before his father for a brief moment: A fraud, set up to fulfill the last wish of a dying man. But when Jonathan recovers unexpectedly, he demands to see his pretended daughter-in-law again ... Aside from fine supporting roles like Paul Dahlke, as Jonathans Doctor, who assists desperately in holding up the fraud, the film contains two music interludes, sung and piano-performed by the female lead (though Oehmes voice is clearly overdubbed here). They may sound a bit dated now but they work surprisingly well and add a warm hearted note both to the girls character and the movie.</fullReview>
