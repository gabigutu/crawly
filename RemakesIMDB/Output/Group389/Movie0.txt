		<shortDescription>Rodrigos character misunderstood by some.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know of what social class Rodrigo Santoros character had been before the war but I do know Mussolini did favor the aristocratic crowd prior to the war, causing the middle class Italian to increasingly fear and hate him. I do remember my grandmother talking about his breaking up the unions and doing everything to help the wealthy. Santoro did not need to speak, his expressions and his eyes spoke for him. I don't believe he was anyone to be feared. He was homeless and hungry and probably ill. This wealthy lady represented life and survival to him, but how was he to catch her eye when he had nothing at all to offer but himself? The night that she was standing outside the restaurant and jumped at him demanding to know what he wanted from her showed us she had nothing to fear from him. He backed away and appeared as if he was about to cry. When she finally threw him the keys his eyes filled with hope as if the gates of heaven had been open to him. I believe he went to her, not to harm her but with the hope of becoming a very devoted companion to her. That in their union he would survive and she would not be lonely anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirren and Bancroft are magnificent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This beautifully costumed and photographed update of the 1961 film is vibrant, honest, and wonderfully acted. Helen Mirren's performance as the aging actress is at times playful, as when she brushes off an old "friend" with a lie about having a tumor, and heart-breaking as when her eyes travel from the perfect body of her lover to her own arms and then breaks down. Unlike most Tennessee Williams' works, "Stone" relies more on silences than on dialogue. Mirren registers every step in Karen's journey from humiliated actress to grieving widow to woman in love to woman scorned. Anne Bancroft, as the Countess, is also dead-on. Her arch manipulation of Karen conceals a passionate outrage at her own poverty that pours out with devastating effect in the film's final moments. Martinez and Santoro as the two young men are also effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! I enjoyed this film in a strange way, but I do have to say that the original was better, although Helen Mirren's performances are always fantastic. On the other hand, I was not captivated by Olivier Martinez' performance and I used to be a big fan of his. However, I was intrigued by the stranger at the end and although everyone else believes it was Karen Stone's "death wish" to submit to this stranger, or whatever, and that she will probably die at the hands of this stranger, I have to disagree. I perceived the ending differently. I feel Karen Stone ends up with this person because she wanted to be wanted. This guy obviously did want her. He had been virtually stalking her throughout the film. He had even shown that he was sexually aroused by her. She saw that in him and just wanted someone to want her and make her feel like a woman again. Yes, it is dangerous, yes it is naughty, but she was going to be wanted again. That's it. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prefer the 1961 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the other users have provided details, ad nauseam, I will only say that Mirren seems to be channeling Vivien Leigh at times, especially in the last half. Many mannerisms are nearly identical to Leigh's actions in the 1961 studio version.Also, strangely enough, I prefer the sound stage artifice of the 1960s. This cable movie was actually filmed on location, but in muted, boring colors. The 1961 feature has the wonderful Technicolor hues.I found the actor portraying The Young Man/stalker to be far more sexy than Martinez's Paolo, even though he eats food off the ground, urinates in public, hacks up phlegm and never speaks.Bancroft is fine, although I would have loved to have seen Sophia Loren take a stab at it.And will you cable movie directors STOP overusing the "atmospheric" smoke machines?!! It looks like your entire film crew was smoking cigarettes during the interior scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Helen Mirren Brings Karen Stone's Passion to Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am old enough to remember when Vivien Leigh starred in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone. Although I was a fan of Ms Leigh, I remember that I was quite unimpressed with the film. It was not particularly well-received. It was not one of Ms. Leigh's greatest roles. It is not a classic. This version of Roman Spring starring Helen Mirren and Olivier Martinez harkens back to the original novella by Tennessee Williams. The setting is returned to post-war Italy, and the story is told with great passion and drama. The plight of the Contessa and Paulo is much more understandable in that setting. The greatest difference is in the performance of Helen Mirren. In Mirren's capable hands, Karen Stone is shown as a woman who has known love but never real passion. In spite of her intelligence and common sense, Karen cannot resist Paulo, and her life changes irrevocably. In Mirren's performance, the transformation of Karen Stone is revealed in her actions, her clothes, and every nuance of face and voice. I think Tennessee Williams would approve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..judging against the original..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..this is really a stretch, because it has been many years since I saw the film with Viven Leigh/Warren Beatty version. To compare the two versions, not really fair, because THIS "Spring" has such graphic sex-scenes, where as Miss Leigh would hardly have been filmed in such a manner, as I can remember. So, we must write on this particular version, only to say that Beatty was gorgeous, but what a rotten actor in that film. And, didn't "Mrs. Stone" have plastic surgery ????First-off, had I been married to "Tom Stone" (Brian Dennedy), I think I'd have become obsessed with sexual encounters, too. Dennehy was a perfect cast for that role, because he certainly had NO sex-appeal. As others have written, "the animal" was lurking in "Mrs. Stone" (Helen Mirren), who was brilliant in this TV re-make. Although she was never a great beauty, not many actresses will allow themselves to be filmed with age all hanging-out. To me, that aspect was absolutely necessary to fully make her role believable, because that's what the story is about. I don't think too many actresses would be filmed is such sexually orgiastic scenes, either."Paolo" (Oliver Martinez) certainly was engaging in his snooty, macho character. If he's 40-years-old, all men should hope to be so hot-looking, even in this day of gyms and work-outs. His narcissism was brilliantly played, most "users" saying it wasn't acting. Who cares? Actresses use their beauty, too. After all, he was a "conte" ! (some folk may spell it with a "U"). Robert Ackerman may have been reticent about his directing in some scenes, but he certainly knew how to let "Paolo" use his "animalistic" prowess: make the actress drop the script by opening the sheet; a hump in an open auto; "beg", beg"; "let me take-off my grandmother's locket". Wow ! (Similar sexuality in "Primal Fear"). That "Mrs. Stone" was a good business-lady didn't prevent him from trying - I suspect most "marcetta" (gigolos) would have cut-out a long time before he did. After all, he was a businessman, too.....I vaguely remember how wonderful Lotte Leyna was in the original film, but I thought "Contessa" (Anne Bancroft) was marvelous in that role. Her constant eating, when it was free, provided much-needed comedy in such a heavy story. Her slick role was well-played, as was her contempt for American ladies, as was her brow-beating to her guys. Tough luck that "Mrs. Stone" knew the value of a dollar......"The Young Man" (Rodrigo Santoro) was stellar in his role of a homeless man. As several wrote, what a face under all that hair and dirt ! Martin Sherman could easily have insisted that he play the "marcetta", but his face WAS too sweet. He may have been homeless, but he was smart enough to figure-out "Paola" was an employee....next in line? Smart move to urinate for the employer. His attributes wasn't lost on "Mrs. Stone".......the "key scene" was exquisite for "Mrs. Stone" for her realization she was a lost soul, and the humility of the smelly street-man. The fade-out of their faces was genius. That's theater !No one wrote that Roger Allam (the play-writer) could possibly have been playing the role of Tennessee Williams - very good impersonation; I've seen Williams up close many times. He had Brando as a model for "Paola". Nor did anyone mention the all-knowing expression on the hairdresser's face (Sara James), who could have narrated the whole movie with feeling.In retrospect, Mirren was perfect for this role. "Age", not "beauty", was the centerpiece of this story. The costumes were gorgeous and the cinematography very good - I don't remember the score, so it must have been appropriate. Although someone was right about saying a lot of the background was shot in a studio, not in Rome, it was good......this was a TV-movie, guys....... Being faithful in loving the original version, I did not like this movie till the second viewing. I didn't know it was shot for TV, and wondered why anyone would try to re-make such a classic. Trading-off different aspects of the two versions is pointless - this is a very entertaining film. I recommend it for any adult - teenagers already know about all this stuff. I rate this movie as a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best cinematic adaptations of a Tennessee Williams play that I can recall. As always in Williams' plays, people's desires aren't so pretty, but they ring true. This film does a great job of capturing the physical, spiritual and psychological realities of the immediate post-war period by documenting Mrs. Stone's "drift" into sexual awakening, social humiliation, and moral uncertainty. The movie poses difficult questions, but it asks them beautifully, and Helen Mirren gives an awesome performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An intelligent and multi-layered treatment of the 1961 film classic from Tennessee Williams. Helen Mirren gives one of her best performances. All the casting works well. The pacing and cinematography is beautiful. John Altman's music is brooding and portends of the emptiness and tragic self-discovery that Mrs. Stone will ultimately find herself facing. Nice job Showtime. Please consider a DVD offering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I own satellite TV and had to order showtime for just this movie. I was a big fan of Olivier Martinez so i was really excited to see him perform in it. But I never realized how great Helen Mirren was. She is a great actress. I am 23 yrs old and never have been interested period films to much but........ The two of them( Helen and Olivier) really were enjoyable to watch. I was mezmerized about how Olivier could be so delectable and disrespectful at the same time. This movie never lost me at any point and it really kept me interested in the story. The emotions I felt from Helens acting ability during the movie were so real to me. She expressed pain, agony, embarrasment and pure happiness SO well. The end of the movie left us wondering about Helens character. Which I could do with out because I hate to be left hanging. HAHAHA I really can not express how much I liked this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful theme that never grows old like its unfortunate heroine....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karen Stone (Helen Mirren) is a beloved stage star; Beloved by her public, social group and especially her loving husband (Brian Dennehy), a Broadway producer who believes her to be ageless. So what does he do? Casts her as Juliet, that's what. The fifty-something actress is still a beauty, but Juliet is 16, so guess what: she looks ridiculous. She is reminded that actresses of many ages have played Juliet, but in post-war America, with the media thriving and TV in its infancy, she is a bomb. None of her friends even show up after the performance on opening night to congratulate her. With Dennehy ailing, she decides to retire from the stage, and they go to Italy where the inevitable happens. All alone now, Stone is ripe for the picking, and the evil contessa (Anne Bancroft) sets her sights on Mrs. Stone to set her up to be fleeced by her stable of gigolos. Oliver Martinez plays Paolo di Lio, who is reminded by Bancroft that he is aging and must make one final swoop so he won't be left desolate when his usefulness is done. At first, Mrs. Stone is simply cordial to Paolo, which makes him want her all the more; But once they fall into bed, this sets up the plot for more games by Bancroft and ultimate jealousies and cruelties between each of the two. A mysterious homeless man keeps an eye on Stone, his own motives unclear...What was original a novel by Tennessee Williams became a decadent 1961 soap opera starring Vivien Leigh and Warren Beatty, and 42 years later, gets a more adult treatment for cable. The sex is more graphic, and the atmosphere much more sinister. Anne Bancroft is like the witch in a Grimm's Fairie Tale, an evil woman who blames the aftermath of the war on the American soldiers, and takes it out on all of the Americans who visit the desolated country. Once a rich aristocrat, she is basically a "pimp" who will fleece every American she can. Watch her reaction when she is politely "thanked" for a social fopot by Mirren who has been hostess to her on several occasions. She makes the character originated by Lotte Lenya in the 1961 film a lot more grotesque. But just try and take your eyes off of her. Bancroft is brilliant.As for Mirren, she brings out Karen's insecurities until they are painfully written all over her face. She is not the old lady she claims she is, nor is she not lovely enough to find the type of love she deserves, but she has a lifetime of exploitation behind her so she has no way out. First exploited as an actress by her loving husband who was devoted to her, she is garishly used by the countess, and it is sad to see such a lovely character be destroyed by that evil. Mirren only has minor bags under her eyes, and her body (exposed in several scenes) is in beautiful shape. The silent self hatred this character didn't know about until she lost her husband is heartbreaking. As for Martinez, he gives many facets to the character of Paolo; It is obvious that he has major feelings for her in spite of what he was hired to do, but is so wrapped up in his own macho world, he can't face his underlying tenderness. It is interesting to note that the sex scenes seem to get rougher as the film goes on, indicating an anger inside him that is about to explode like Mount Vesuveus.Then there is Rodrigo Santoro as the mysterious homeless man. What his intentions are certainly never become clear, and this will give the viewer the opportunity to guess how things turn out. As a fan of Tennessee Williams' work, I saw a similarity with him and the character who represents death in "The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore" (movie title-"Boom"). Whether or not he is will have to be in the mind of the viewer. The original version (as well as this one) gave me hope that the obvious conclusion wasn't true, but then this leads to all sorts of other pondering as to how Mrs. Stone's life would proceed. Only a conversation between Mirren and Martinez about how similar situations have ended give indication what is in store for Mirren. There is also the inevitable comparison to the gay lifestyle as some of the sexual longings of Mrs. Stone and the need for young companionship seem to come from Williams' own view of the gay scene in his time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pale and spiritless facsimile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remaking of an old movie is justified if something is brought to it which was lacking in the original. The 1961 "Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" was not an entirely successful venture. Unlike most of the other legendary Tennessee William's screen adaptations, "Roman Spring" originated as a novella rather than a play, making it trickier work for screenwriter Gavin Lambert. The relationship between ageing star and young gigolo could have been explored with greater candor. Despite the start quality of both Vivien Leigh and Warren Beatty there was a distinct lack of chemistry between the two. There is no way a remake can escape comparison with the original. In every conceivable way this television remake is totally inferior. Casting Vivien Leigh in the role would have been mandatory at the time. Her unforgettable Blanche du Bois in William's "Streetcar Named Desire", together with her real life mental problems plus the last vestiges of her famed beauty would seemingly portend a great performance. But this all seemed to play against her in a mannered and predictable performance. Surely there is no lack of glamorous ageing stars of yesterday who could have had a field day with this role. Instead we have the distinctly unglamorous Helen Mirren, hopelessly miscast in a role she should have had the sense to turn down. A young Warren Beatty, working desperately hard at his Italian accent at least possessed virile sexiness, the stock of any self respecting gigolo. Here we have the pretty faced yet completely uncharismatic Olivier Martinez. There are hordes of spunky, hunky, and hopefully talented actors who could have injected a much needed dose of youthful bravado in this limp intergenerational affair. With this lackluster couple given center stage the movie is hopelessly sunk.In the original, the Contessa, a pimp of inordinate greed, was played by Lotte Lenya with a thin veneer of social grace masking a menacing viciousness. Her scenes are the finest in the movie. Whoever cast the role in this remake must have thought the choice of Anne Bancroft as the Contessa especially adroit, with the expectation that she would tap into her Italian heritage. What they did not take into account were the many years spent in the company of Mel Brooks, plus a number of Jewish mother roles under her belt. There are moments when you may expect her to offer the gigolo in her stable a bowl of chicken soup while bemoaning the starving children in some far off country. It's a performance that makes one wince, especially with the memory of the inimitable Lenya. Despite it's faults, the original "Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" remains completely untouched by this pale and spiritless facsimile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo for Mirren and Martinez</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing of its cable provenance I rented this with mild trepidation. It bears a few telltale signs of Cable Drama 101 but manages at least partly to transcend. Mirren is superb as always and near the end even looked a little like Vivian Leigh. (Some credit due to costumes and makeup). Kudos to her for baring her breasts. The interesting surprise here is Olivier Martinez who is better than Warren Beatty in the 1961 original. WB was derailed by the Italian accent with which El Martinez has no problem. Also, Martinez is the right age for the part; WB was young and up-and-coming, wrong for the story. Both Mirren and Martinez seem to have been aware of the cable tendency towards obviousness because the best thing about the remake is the fact that they do bring layers and subtlety to their respective performances. Enough years have elapsed to make this is a period film, whereas the 1961 version was not. Any period film also has to finesse the sensibility of the time when it was made. This remake portrays the period fairly well and in some ways takes a rather fresh approach. Despite its shortcomings you too might find yourself liking it more than you thought you would.

		<shortDescription>The Loss of Dignity/Illusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess that this second filmed version is my only real familiarity with the story. I had heard that the end was supposed to represent a de facto suicide. It may actually help not to have too many antecedents in this case because the ending here seems to be suggesting (or at least allowing for) a resolution that is quite different from suicide. It is Paolo who introduces the foreshadow of death into the story by telling Karen a morbid cautionary tale about an unfortunate woman of similar circumstance in order to put Karen back in her place. I don't know that it has more of the inevitability of truth about it than any of the rest of his braggadocio. Paolo is abusive because he resents his economic need to prostitute himself. Karen is vulnerable to Paolo's cruelty because she is not facing facts, i.e., facts about her age, her talent, and her need for love. She speaks of their shared "loss of dignity," but it is actually illusion that she is shedding, especially the illusion that Paolo is anything more than a prostitute with aristocratic pretensions. The film helps us to see this by continually implying comparisons between Paolo and the unwashed but rather attractive young stalker who endeavors to capture Karen's attention. It seems to me that what is more inevitable than Karen's embrace of this man as a form of suicide is that she should be struck by the similarity between his importuning and Paolo's game. I can imagine as well that she should come to prefer the more straightforward, less pretentious arrangement that the final scene suggests. Would it truly be less dignified than what she has just been through?There is still ambiguity, of course. If in her need for love Karen decides to take beautiful boys twice a day "for medicinal purposes" until the love virus subsides (as her Tennessee Williams-like friend advises in the beginning) she may indeed be risking a violent end, but it also may cure her. She has already known the adoring love of her late husband. She may not need to replicate it after all. In dispensing with pretense, she would be in a better position to know and come to terms with her realities. At the end of the film, the way forward for Karen may well be a more honest accommodation of mutual need beginning with this stranger. It is certainly a delicious irony of Williams' writing that whichever Karen has in mind, either way she will set herself free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy Toys for the rich, horny, and bored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of Oscar winning Best Actresses star in this Showtime version of the Tennessee Williams novella The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone. Unlike in the big screen film, Tennessee Williams himself is in the story played under a pseudonym as an acid tongued southern fried playwright viper by Roger Allam. We all need a gay confidante in the line of work Anne Bancroft is in, supplying boy toys for the rich, horny and bored. Unlike the 1963 version, it is clear she caters to the male as well as the female.One of those is Helen Mirren taking over the part done so well in 1963 by Vivien Leigh whose own life was tragically close to character Karen Stone. Mirren after a happy marriage that has seen a wane in the carnal embarks on a new quest for that after the death of husband Brian Dennehy. It's how she ends up with Olivier Martinez, a callow and spoiled youth who wants his women to treat him in a lifestyle he's gotten used to.Having just seen Behind The Candelabra which is another story about an unequal sexual relationship in terms of power, it's given me a fresh insight into The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone. Even the best of gigolos should have a day job to fall back on.Just as in the original the ending with the ever present and silent young street kid played by Rodrigo Santoro proves to Mirren that she can get what really wants without as much maintenance charge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting But Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new version of Tennessee Williams' story, about a 50-ish retired actress (Helen Mirren) who finds herself adrift in Rome after her husband passes away. She is soon preyed upon by a gypsy (Anne Bancroft) and her gigolo (Oliver Martinez). What happens from there is how Mrs. Stone deals with the pair and how she tries to find her way in her widowhood and her retirement from the theater.Since this is a modern telling, there is a lot more sex, which Miren excels in, I have to say! As with most Williams' stories, this is about lost people, so things aren't going to turn out so happy. That being the case, it's a good film overall, and the Rome scenery is cool.The best part is the film score by John Altman. It is very reminiscent of Gabriel Yared's work. He scored films like "The English Patient."****** (6 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the character of the young man that follows Mrs.Stone like a shadow everywhere she goes with her lover what we are shown is the truer, uglier reality of her relationship with Paolo that she does not want to face. In letting herself be carried away by the romantic illusion she constantly denies that at the base of her relationship with Paolo there is just as much practicality as there is in the reason the homeless young man pursues her. His needs are much more immediate. He needs clothes because his own are completely ragged. He needs food because he has nothing to eat. Mrs. Stone repeatedly wines and dines her lover and takes him on fancy shopping sprees and yet she is in complete denial of the fact that these favors have been at least in part fueling their relationship. Until the very end she refused to see the truth and yet when Paolo finally departs her company for greener pastures she finally accepts the young man and comes face to face with the reality of what her relationship was really like at its core. The young man symbolizes the ugly side of her relationship that she constantly shelters herself from and refused to admit that it existed until I could be denied no longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This dark and sad tale of a middle aged lady visiting Rome and getting involved with some questionable people has been made before with Vivien Leigh but this newer version is worth watching for a more modern approach. The cast is top notch and the on location shooting is good.Helen Mirren as Mrs Stone is terrific as always showing all the emotions and insecurities that the role needs. She strikes me as slightly more together than Mrs Stone should be though. It's a pleasure to watch Anne Bancroft in one of her last roles.Olivier Martinez is a strange choice being French Spanish.

		<shortDescription>A depressing mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Helen Mirren. She is a beautiful, mature woman and a fine actress. Unfortunately, like a role undertaken by the character Mrs. Stone in the story, she is far too old for this casting. Likewise, Brian Dennehy is far too young to be her "much older" and ailing husband. I do wonder if the original 1961 film with Vivien Lee and Warren Beatty had similar chasms of verisimilitude and belief to leap.A failing, has-been actress and her wealthy and asexual or impotent husband take advantage of his bad health to book a face-saving trip to Europe. The husband dies en route. During her mourning period, Mrs. Stone is forced to occupy herself in Rome with post-war society, largely comprised of bitter and now-impoverished Italian royalty and a few lightweight and false-faced inter-continental "friends." I do not understand how Mrs. Stone's character unfolds and becomes so dependent upon the gigolo who has been assigned to compensate for her years without a sex life (and bilk her of whatever money he can) by a hungry Contessa. I also don't understand how she, starved in her marriage or not, is supposed to be so constantly sexually ready at the age of "50." Nevertheless, Mrs. Stone in some respects appears to be resigned to the loss of her youth and realistic about the affair; then, in the next moment, behaves like a lovesick girl. She has a great deal going for her and with her intellectual and financial resources one wonders why she did not move on voluntarily,geographically or romantically. She did not need to be lonely or immobilized. I suppose these developments say more about author Tennessee Williams, his mindset and prejudices, and his era than reality today.One curious character throughout the movie is a young, homeless and starving stalker, who is every bit if not more beautiful than Paolo the gigolo. He does seem to worship Mrs. Stone, who is indeed a handsome and well-put-together lady for her age. She is aware of and appears to be repulsed by his constant nearness, as he is socially beyond redemption, not just in his impoverished disarray, but his vulgar and undisciplined habits.The gigolo increasingly abuses and humiliates her, and inevitably breaks with her under pressure from the Contessa and perhaps his own restlessness. He has cruelly teased Mrs. Stone by comparing her to others of her ilk who are typically found with their throats slit.The final scene has Mrs. Stone flinging the keys to the gates of her villa down to the homeless stalker. You see him approach her and her standing in wait with a pained face and eyes downcast.I did not interpret this to be a romantic or sexual scene in the least. It was chilling and tragic. The phrase I used to my husband was "suicide by psycho."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering this was a made for TV, it does a respectable job of making itself comparable to the Louis De Rochemont-Jose Quintero production of 1961.Tennessee Williams' smarmy tale of the widow and the gigolo is enhanced by a fine cast. Helen Mirren's Karen is less physically attractive than Viven Leigh's, yet she's a strong actress and projects genuine pathos as the pathetic heroine.Olivier Martinez' Paolo is more personable and less edgy than Warren Beatty's, and has a more convincing accent. Anne Bancroft brings her own, distinctive interpretation of the Contessa, comparable to Lotte Lenya's.John Altman's score is serviceable (whereas Richard Addinsell's was hauntingly thematic). More standard is Robert Allan Ackerman's direction, compared to the distinctiveness of Quintero.Being a smaller screen work with a lower budget, this version of "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" adds yet another offering of a basically unpleasant subject. Williams really seemed to like spinning these tales of once-beautiful, aging women, desperate for love and addictively pursuing affection, literally at any cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirren was worth it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was not the best and Martinez has always been a little weak in his films... (I could not except the fact that he was the the other guy to Diane Lane in "Unfaithful" over Richard Gere... I'm not gay or anything but Richard Gere is much more appealing than Martinez)... That being said... I'm 30 years old... and I hope my wife is that sexy and looks that good when she is over 60 years of age. Mirren was downright sexy and so appealing for a woman her age. I'm a huge fan of hers. God bless her and her continued sexiness. Her measurements have barely changed in over 40 years. How does she do it. Has she had plastic surgery or boob enhancements? Does anyone know any info about her?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly delightful movie for home DVD viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having waited many years for the DVD to finally appear I've now watched this movie for the third time. How could one not enjoy the gorgeous photography and scenery combined with marvelous actors and a lush music score? Sure, some of the final scenes were a bit silly but overall it was a delight to watch. Much better than the original version with Warren Beatty's terrible Italian accent. Helen Mirren's acting was great, as expected, but I also liked Olivier Martinez' performance as the handsome sleazy gigolo. His natural accent was perfect for this role. Rodrigo Santoro's haunting face of the urchin beggar was very intriguing. I felt that Anne Bancroft rather over-acted as the Contessa, however. A lovely DVD to watch with a few friends at home and then discuss afterwards. Not to be taken too seriously, just enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A richly romantic tapestry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found myself reminiscing about this film long after having seen it. Initially expecting a probable pale imitation of the 1961 original; it seemed this new film appeared to possess many symbolic occurrences and images that seemed strangely familiar. For example, the homeless man knocking at Karen Stone's door reminded me of a picture I had seen as a child. The caption below the picture read "Look, I am standing at the door knocking. If one of you hears me calling..." Revelation 3:20I also remembered some of Helen Mirren's past performances as characters very unlike Mrs. Stone; therefore it required a preliminary adjustment to accept her as the more sensitive, deeply passionate, fading beauty. However, her outstanding vocal delivery and subtle nuances in voice and movement combined very effectively to bring Karen Stone to life. Karen Stone, a woman bewildered and lost after her humiliating final theatrical performance, the death of her husband and the loss of her youth finds herself "drifting" with no particular focus after finally deciding to settle in Rome. She meets an "old harpy" named the Contessa and her "man for hire" Paolo Di Lio. Olivier Martinez plays Paolo in stereotypical fashion as a vain, arrogant, self-centered rogue and Karen Stone is totally captivated by him. "Love is blind" is truly one of the film's major underlying themes as Mrs. Stone refuses to accept the total reality of her arrangement with Paolo anymore than he fully accepts the fact that he is, in actual fact, a purchased lover. Even Karen's physical appearance changes as her "addiction" progresses to the point where she resembles a heavily made-up caricature of her former self.The films heavily stylized 1950's costuming, artful set decoration, masterful cinematography and haunting, poignant score set against the backdrop of the "eternal" city serve as a very effective combination of elements in creating the films memorable romantic impression.For the most part, the characters are interesting and enjoyable to watch providing one accepts them strictly for who and what they represent. Anne Bancroft as the calculating Contessa appears to have a fun loving side as opposed to Lotte Lenya's vicious ruthlessness in the original film. Coral Browne's performance as Karen Stone's friend in the original film is, however, sadly missed.Rodrigo Santoro's performance as the homeless man presents an interesting character study because of his primary reliance on facial expressions which are powerfully supported by the films unique presentations of symbolism, colour and sound. When Karen Stone first makes eye contact with him on a bridge he responds with a provocative leer and exposes his chest, his hand held over the heart area. This gesture is dramatically different from her initial meeting with Paolo, wherein he lights her cigarette, a probable symbol of a fleeting but fatal pleasure.From the beginning the homeless man appears to be on a quest to establish contact with Mrs. Stone. His motivational perspective as a positive or negative force remains unclear throughout the film. At one point, there is a wonderfully effective camera shot circling around his head as he gazes up at Mrs. Stone on her veranda. An impoverished vagrant, he goes largely unnoticed as he eats scraps off the ground, gets kicked by a police officer, is laughed at by Paolo's barbers and is repeatedly viewed with disdain by Mrs. Stone. Thus begins a series of unexpected but plausible Biblically symbolic references: "...without majesty, we saw him, no looks to attract our eyes, a thing despised and rejected..." Isaiah 53:2 The homeless man's next couple of appearances are lewd demonstrations perhaps meant to reflect Mrs. Stone's "addiction" to physical pleasure at the expense of her personal dignity. Later, Paolo calls Karen to the window and asks her the identity of the man in the street. There are cathedral bells ringing in the distance as she refers to the him using the somewhat unusual description as a probable "money changer." Luke 2:14. When the mysterious man knocks on her door for the last time, Mrs. Stone finally confronts him with her impassioned plea, "Why do you follow me?" He responds with a mute, tear filled expression.The film is brought to a overwhelmingly unhappy, emotional climax at Karen Stone's final "party" when she overhears the Contessa describing her as "a harlot who has struck it rich." Karen looks to Paolo for reassurance. There is none. Mrs. Stone is at last forced to come to terms with the person that she has become.Left alone after throwing out Paolo, the Contessa and friends, Helen Mirren performs a wonderfully effective mime performance as a woman alone and humiliated while pacing around her clock as she silently acknowledges her helplessness over the passage of time.She then wraps the three keys to her apartment in a white handkerchief. Waving the handkerchief like a flag of surrender from her veranda, she throws it down to the homeless man waiting on the street. He takes the keys and looks up, his face a rich tapestry of emotion. As he approaches the first gate to her apartment, a "trinity" of lights shine in the background. In addition, directly behind him an obelisk-like formation reflecting an ice-blue light projects toward the sky resembling a "conduit" of sorts. As he approaches the second gate it becomes apparent that the stairway leading to Mrs. Stone's apartment has become awash in the blue light as well. When he opens her door the light enters her apartment and it also flows in through the windows. The blending of the various colours form an echo reminiscent of a renaissance painting. The homeless man moves silently toward her, his face half obscured in shadows, his eyes a profound reflection of love and understanding.As Mrs. Stone smiles back, the couple's faces go out of focus, as though each person had suddenly ceased to exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good production, but some miscasting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's much about this production that is very good. I think Martinez is much better than Warren Beatty, who was dreadfully miscast. Some things are better realized in the recent version, such as the young man who waits in the shadows. The camera work is outstanding and I think Mirren's wardrobe is better than in the earlier film.But I think there's a fatal flaw in the casting of Helen Mirren as Karen Stone, for the reason which I think made Vivien Leigh more suitable to the role. This goes to the heart of a major theme in Tennessee Williams: evil people bent on destroying those who are fragile and vulnerable.For all her greatness as an actress, there's nothing vulnerable about Helen Mirren. She's too strong and formidable a person to play a fragile flower. I always feel a sense of "Don't tread on me" when watching her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romancing the Stone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must have been an interesting film to attract such an array of comment which both support the film and criticises it. The interest for me lies not in the fact that it is of itself a good film or a bad film, nor in the fact that it is a remake of a Beatty/Leigh film. The interest lies in the fact that such a range of comments both approving and disapproving could be made about the performances of the actors, including Dennehy, with such vehemence. I must say that I do not find comments like; "He's hot! He gets to take his shirt off a lot" any more an objective comment about acting ability than Leigh was much better at acting 'the neurotic' than Mirren because that wasn't acting either, she really was that way! Williams often concentrates upon characters who are emotionally fractured or ragged: Kowolski in "... Streetcar ..." and Laura Wingfield in " ... Menagerie." Karen Stone is likewise emotionally frail. Cossetted by a rich husband for years and harbouring doubts about her acting talent, she is also physically unfulfilled. When her husband apologises to her for not fulfilling the physical role in their marriage, she retorts: "If I'd wanted to behave like an animal, I would have married an animal" but clearly she does want to behave like an animal as is evidenced by a string of marcetta that escort her in Rome. She is damaged goods, She is emotionally scarred and physically and emotionally vulnerable, a fact recognised by the Contessa, a vengeful, embittered, exploitative, parasitic harpy, whose business it is to know these things and arrange for a remedy. Ironically, Karen is anything but hardened like stone, whatever her name suggests. She embarks on a series of assignations culminating in Paolo, an arrogant aristocrat whose genius for story-telling rivals the Brothers Grimm. We cannot be sure he is even a Conte, when Karen attempts to phone him using the number on the gilt-edged card he has given her, the line rings strangely, but not unexpectedly, dead. Nor is Karen Stone unaware of what is going on. She remarks upon the series of young men that the Contessa has supplied, all of whom coincidentally had some friend in dire (fiscal) need. But she is content to be 'shook down' (to a degree) in order to have the attention of these attractive young men who could and would do with enthusiasm what her husband could not. I wanted to shake the woman, not for her stupidity because she wasn't stupid, but for her susceptibility and vulnerability. I wanted to say: "Act you age, woman, you're making a fool of yourself." Mirren's eyes flicker almost imperceptibly when Paolo changes his story about the six brigade members who were killed. First, they were killed "on the plains of Africa" but hours later they were killed "on the boat". He doesn't bat an eyelid, she does! But neither of them seem to care. He is so self-assured in his supposed aristocratic arrogance and she is so needy, the lie passes.Williams's preoccupations were generally local, or at least American. In this story, however, he has introduced a European/American theme and I wondered if Williams had not been recently reading some Henry James. Here we have the American ingenue confronted by the might and deviousness of the European sophistication and tradition. The Italians may be impoverished, they may be reduced to running scams and fixing up lonely ladies with gigolos, they may be living in penury and have to beg but they have the weight of the European tradition and culture to support them in adversity. So the age of Rome is mentioned at least twice, overstating its age by some hundreds of years, and Paolo draws attention to the oldest street in the city. Whether it is or not, it serves his purpose to say it is. But to Karen he says: "You are only fifty years old" which to her should be an unspoken criticism, and shocks her that he should say it aloud. But he is really saying: You Americans have no history compared to us", a sentiment espoused earlier by the Contessa who opines that any country with less than 400 years of history, has no tradition. We see in advance the pathetic contempt that the vanquished European has for the triumphant ( and sometimes triumphal) American. It is fully articulated in the last scene with the Contessa in a bitter attack born of frustration. Without assessing the relative moralities of Karen Stone or the Contessa or Paolo, it is the American who morally crumbles at the end, inviting an unwashed, unkempt, possibly very smelly young man (he's a bit too old to be an 'urchin') into her bedroom. Her degradation is complete. It doesn't require anyone to murder her. She is already destroyed. The Italians still have their culture, traditions, and history to fall back on.Much has been said of the acting of various characters so I don't want to comment on this other than to say that Olivier Martinez seems to have received special attention for being wooden. Having not seen him in anything else, it's hard to make a comprehensive statement about his acting but I thought he conveyed the stiffness and arrogance that one would expect of a 'titled' person. Others may disagree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****May contain spoilers***** Okay - where do I start. Although he has quite a pretty face, Olivier Martinez can't act his way out of a bag in this movie. He just wasn't convincing and his lines were stiff at best. I personally thought that Rodrigo Santoro who played the beggar in the street was better looking and more appealing - this should tell us something.Anne Bancroft was a miscast in the role of the "pimp". She came off as a comic character - you just had to laugh at her trying to be pathetic and evil. It lacked any feeling at all.Brian Dennehy probably was the best portrayed although he dies in the first 20 minutes of the movie.Then there is Helen Mirren who is quite a good actress, but is surrounded by lack luster performances. Nothing she could have done could drag this movie out of the ditch.I also think that the people who see the ending as some death wish are reading way to much into it - I can't give this director that much credit. I just think it shows how far Mrs. Stone has sunk - she wants so badly to be loved and wanted that she takes the beggar/stalker off the street.All in all - just pass this one up folks and get the 1961 original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More is Less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film starring Helen Mirren and Anne Bancroft, along with an attractive male lead in Oliver Martinez. How could it possibly miss? Let me count the ways. Better yet, just do yourself a favor and view the 1961 version. Although more of a soaper and not anywhere near as physically explicit, it has a far more honest feel than this definitely watchable but glossy neo-costumer. Not to say that the two top-notch actresses aren't truly wonderful in their respective roles, it seems to be more a problem of the director's interpretations of both story and characters. The actors seem to overplay at times, and some key lines and scenes taken from the original are treated as throwaways in this new version which is far too tailored for modern sensibilities. As completely riveting as she is, Mirren's Karen Stone never really comes off as the sympathetic character Vivien Leigh so bravely portrayed in the 1961 film. This retelling here is all very beautifully filmed and there's a lot to look at and lush music to hear. The film almost redeems itself with it's wonderfully staged final scene, full of suspense and sadness, almost operatic. Too bad I had to wait till the end to see such a worthwhile moment.</fullReview>

And it's a good thing Olivier Martinez is a hunk because his acting skills are pathetic. When compared to Warren Beatty's performance in the original movie, Olivier comes off as a high school novice actor. What is most funny, though, is that the imdb users who have rated this movie have given it a higher rating than the original movie. It's pretty obvious that most of the voters here have not seen the original. While it's not a great movie, it sure beats the Roman pants off of this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Tennessee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you did not know this was a Tennessee Williams story, you could not tell from this film. This was more of a Harlequin romance than a Williams tale. Obviously Mrs. Stone is Williams' alter ego, and a respectable female heterosexual is not the equivalent of a male homosexual, respectable or not. You cannot play any of Williams' female protagonists as though they were actual, realistic women, and end up with a result that is anywhere near what Williams intended.Much has been written of how the director wanted to play up the sudden poverty in post-war Italy which brought otherwise respectable people to remunerative decadence. That may very well be accurate, may very well have been noticed by Williams in his story, but that is not the point.This film was boring. I can't fault the acting, and it would be very interesting to see what Anne Bancroft and Helen Mirren could do in creating Williams characters. I think that with the right direction, either or both of them would set fire to the screen. But they didn't get a chance to do that here. All I can advance as an explanation for this tepid romance is that the director had no clue. Williams has an undercurrent of repressed desire and unfulfilled yearning that causes disaster, regardless of whether it is indulged or repressed. The Glass Menagerie is a memory play and not a sex opus, and Summer and Smoke had a generally hopeful ending (though Alma might still come to grief, perhaps becoming Mrs. Stone). But those are the exceptions. The closest play to this story is Sweet Bird of Youth. Take the melodrama out of Sweet Bird, and you should have Roman Spring. But you should still have the erotic tension.This production, though it had steamy scenes in its latter half, seemed more like a photo session for the cover of a romance novel than a Williams story.What a waste of talent! The film was not horrible--one unfamiliar with Williams might not notice--but we know what might have been.</fullReview>

Anyway, here's the best line in the film and am wondering if it was in the original novella/script: "You tell us how to behave??!! Hah! You hang our Mussolini upside down! You bomb our children!!! You tell us how to behave??!! Hah!!!" Anne Bancroft was great, as usual.....held up against Lotte Lenya.

		<shortDescription>Can a homosexual author accurately depict heterosexual women?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anytime you get involved with Tennessee Williams' characters, you are sure to find yourself at 3 AM in the dark night of someone's soul, when the last waltz has already been danced. But that someone is not necessarily a "real" person. Rather, it's a "creation" by an author whose own life was so "unquietly desperate" that reality had not much meaning for him, a fact which is reflected in his "unreal" characters. These "people" of Williams' certainly give and have given a number of actresses considerable work over the years, and Helen Mirren is surely one of the best. This novella is one of Williams' darkest tales, but should not be regarded as in any way a look at reality, unless you conceive that most of the people of this world are certifiably insane, a condition which Mirren limns admirably. Williams, I think, was intent on delineating a world, which he thought of as real, but which probably derived from his worst nightmares, waking or otherwise, could not actually be realistic. A look at this world is not necessarily an "entertaining" experience, and I doubt that Williams intended it to be. So why bother? Well, you can enjoy the work of the actors, if not the story, and you can speculate about the author as I have been doing. As he was a homosexual, I have considerable doubt that Williams can be taken seriously when he deals with women. Yet almost all his protagonists are women. I wonder why. Oh, I haven't even discussed the story, and I don't think I will, except to say it involves a woman whose actions will seem absolutely incomprehensible to us "normal" folk. My rating of 9 reflects mainly my admiration for Helen Mirren's work. Otherwise, the film offers many irritations, which you can select for yourself.</fullReview>

Helen Mirren is undoubtedly a first class actress and she plays the sordid role assigned to her with near perfection But that doesn't absolve the makers of this film from their responsibility in producing a thoroughly nasty picture peopled by unspeakably nasty characters.
