		<fullReview>"In a few years, a cut throat would be a blessing" that's what Karen Stone (Vivien Leigh) tells Paolo (Warren Beatty)letting us know that she sees her life in an inexorable descend into the unspeakable. Old age is the ultimate punishment for the vain and the selfish. Tennessee Williams dissects that theory with an expert hand. The depression that Vivien Leigh (magnificent, once you get over the wig) carries with her at all times is so pungent and vivid that when you see her smile you may emit a sigh of relief. She's looking for her angel of death and Warren Beatty really looks the part. So Italian in his childishness if not his accent that you understand why Mrs. Stone will let herself fall into his obvious trap, wouldn't you? The pessimism and the sense of tragedy - the most personal and embarrassing kind - leads us by the hand through this gorgeous, gelid journey through a life about to fade in a place, rightly know as the eternal city. Vivien Leigh is sublime looking into her terrifying future. Warren Beatty seems to fit perfectly the reason to go against everything you believe in. Lotte Lenya is great fun to watch and a wonderful villain if I ever saw one. Coral Browne looks enormous next to Vivien Leigh and as a close friend, she reminded me of Mame's closest friend, Vera Charles, the one who would tell you all the ugly truths. I must confess, I enjoyed it but I couldn't shake off the melancholia for days and days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivien Leigh Echoing Her Life At The Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read together the biographies of Tennessee Williams and Vivien Leigh, and you'll know why the depressing aspects of this movie are so realistic!! Vivien was, at the time the movie was made, going through her painful divorce from Laurence Olivier. In the middle of making the film, she had dinner with her beloved Olivier and Joan Plowright, at which time he told her that he was marrying Joan. Vivien had electro-shock treatments right after wrapping this movie. That desolate, soul-searing sadness in her eyes isn't acting!Tennessee Williams features gigolos, procurers and prostitutes in many of his plays and this was no exception, although the 'action' is disguised by the high-faluting manners of the Countessa (the madam, who lives off the earnings of her 'boys'). You wonder how much Tennessee may have fashioned the play on Miss Leigh's life, as 'Mrs. Stone' is an actress past her prime, whose husband has just absented himself from her life (and his, as well). Williams exquisitely portrays the way we use one another for our own advantage, and Beatty (with a crummy Italian accent) does a great job of 'playing' the self-involved, narcissistic, money hungry Lothario. Once he hooks her, he delights in sadistically attacking her for her 'weakness' in loving him. Ever been there? At that time in his life, Beatty was playing a similar but more innocent role with almost every woman in Hollywood. He has matured well.The writing was excellent, the scenery in Rome magnificent, but you will be so depressed after seeing this excellent movie that I suggest you also check out 'Bulworth' as a double feature to follow with. Beatty on two sides of his career is worth comparing: drama and comedy, villain and hero. I believe you'll have to say that Warren Beatty is an actor as well as a movie star.Even though Vivien Leigh did not care for Beatty's arrogance while making this movie, she was able to turn the horror of her personal life into something constructive (as did Tennessee Williams), for which we the public should always be grateful. To make art from the ashes of a marriage----destroyed by death or divorce----- is something each of us would do well to learn.For those of you with indomitable spirits, another Tennessee Williams film to see for comparison purposes is "Summer and Smoke". The interplay between the romantic leads is more equal, but both portray the sadness from Tennessee's sister Rose's life. She was a beautiful Southern flower, intimidated by her overbearing mother and alcoholic father, who wound up having a lobotomy (as did another sad victim /child of our nation's leading family). Tennessee paid homage to her tragic life in many of his plays, and these are no exception. Intelligent, beautiful but completely impotent at withstanding the aggression of those around her, Mrs. Stone is a prime example of a 'Rose by another name'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential truths beneath the artifice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tennessee Williams' gift for exposing the heart and soul - the core - of human experience was so fine-tuned it transcended clumsy handling and Hollywood censorship. "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" captures the essence of Williams' profound understanding. Even the film's missteps - the fake sets, the beige hair, Warren Beatty's Italian accent ? fail to detract. The surface artificiality contrasts with the underlying truths, making them that much more pronounced. In fact, the curious production values add another level of interest to the proceedings. There are lots of fine things about this film, which far surpasses the later television remake. Vivien Leigh's tortured persona brought added dimension to every character she played. Here she really "gets" what Mrs. Stone, and Williams, were about. Lotte Lenya's knowing performance remains timeless. Richard Addinsell's hypnotic score adds to the strange, foreign atmosphere. This is a rewarding, intelligent, entertaining film for thoughtful viewers. Obviously, it's not for every taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film ages like fine wine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vivien Leigh plays the aging, isolated Mrs. Stone with a tragic grace and beauty that only she could bring to this exquisite, lyrical film of Tennessee Williams' haunting tale of the human need of permanence in a transitory world. (I remember reading Williams' Memoirs in which he says that this was his favorite film made from his work.) It is only now that I've attained Mrs. Stone's age that I've really come to understand the "drifting" that is portrayed here. Lotte Lenya is also brilliant in the role of the Contessa.Lenya was nominated for the Academy Award as "Best Supporting Actress" for this role, and she should have won. She is unctuous, smarmy, and brilliant. Vivien Leigh should also have been nominated, for her alienated, unfulfilled, sad ex-star. She gave another excellent performance-- an interesting bookend to her magnificent Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire, the other of Tennessee Williams' "lost" ladies she immortalized on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to disagree with the comments that Warren Beatty made this movie. I thought his Italian accent was poor and most of the time he sits and pouts.Vivien Leigh made this movie for me. She related to Karen Stone because at the time she was a manic depressive and was receiving shock treatments. This role is very similar to Blanche Dubois and Mary Treadwell.I've read the novella by Tennessee Williams and the movie does make a very good adaptation of it.The cinematography is beautiful and so is the costuming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone is based on a novella by Tennessee Williams and I'm sure it was Tennessee who saw to it that Vivien Leigh was cast in the title role. After all Vivien had won an Oscar for playing that other Tennessee Williams sex starved female, Blanche Dubois.But Karen Stone is a woman very much like Vivien Leigh was in real life. Karen is an actress who's refused to grow old gracefully, when we meet her she's just been trashed by the London critics for a very bad portrayal of Rosamund in As You Like It. She's 50 trying to play a young girl in her teens. Better she should have played Queen Gertrude in a revival of Hamlet.Anyway she and her husband decide to take a long holiday in Rome, but as the plane is landing her husband has a heart attack and dies. He's left her well fixed and after a suitable period of mourning Mrs. Stone is ready for a little action in her life.This is Tennessee Williams so we're talking sex here. Vivien maybe too old to play Rosalind, but she's not too old to enjoy what Rosalind enjoys. And Lotte Lenya who makes a living procuring young men for her clients is willing to supply. Warren Beatty is what Vivien thinks she wants. Warren is the only real weakness in The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone. He does pout an awful lot in the role and his accent is phony. But Vivien who was going through mid life crisis for decades before she died in 1967 was perfect casting. I'm not sure how much of it is acting and how much she's just playing herself. The woman had a lot of emotional and physical problems and as her husband Laurence Olivier frankly admitted, she was a nymphomaniac in real life. Lotte Lenya got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress as the Countess. However this was the year of West Side Story and Rita Moreno beat her in that category.This was one of the frankest discussions about sex ever put on film up to that time. In fact though no gay sex is discussed, right at the beginning you see a couple of men meeting for a tryst and you can spot a few obviously gay couples strolling throughout Rome. The Code was definitely coming down.One of the big pluses The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone has is that it was shot completely in The Eternal City. The movie industry loved Rome at that time with Roman Holiday, Three Coins In The Fountain, The Seven Hills Of Rome and now The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone all showing Rome to its best advantage. The other three films were a lot more upbeat than this one was.Stage director Jose Quintero did a great job with his cast in his one and only big screen production. The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone was done with Helen Mirren in Vivien Leigh's part several years ago. You might want to see both to compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Drifting" through Rome with Leigh and Beatty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say flat out right at the beginning, that if you don't appreciate the talents of Vivien Leigh -- you will not like The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone. This is her penultimate film, which was really made as a vehicle for her talents, without much of an ensemble cast and she's in nearly every scene. But the great actress is certainly up to the task of making this material work, although she is let down at times by contrivances of plot and other aspects of believability.Taken from famous playwright Tennessee William's novella, the story concerns aging actress Karen Stone, who yearns to retire with her rich husband, who unfortunately expires while on their way to Rome for their extended getaway. Then the lonely widow starts dating a handsome young Italian guy who has an unusually close relationship with the sinister contessa who introduced them both.Vivien Leigh as Karen Stone "drifts" through the movie, an ethereal presence that's nearly translucent, extremely delicate and cautiously mannered. The machinations of the plot allow her many opportunities to overstate or exaggerate, which is something Leigh never does. Many have said that this source material is kind of second rate Tennessee Williams, but even if true, Vivien Leigh's work here makes the very best of it in an engaging style.And the movie has the added benefit of young future superstar Warren Beatty, making his second feature film. Needless to say, he looks fantastic, making it much more believable that Mrs. Stone would become so enamored with him. It's evident that Beatty clearly dove headfirst into an attempt to transform himself into an Italian gigolo. I find the Italian accent he attempted to be perhaps a little lacking at some points in the way of his hitting a few wrong pronunciations that sound artificial at very few and select times. Other than that minor detail, Beatty fills the role more than adequately, and his star power is in abundance.And no small mention must go to fabulous Lotte Lenya (who scored an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress in this), as this unctuous Euro-trash "contessa" who deals in romantic relationships usually for women of a certain class, age and wealth. She's extremely creepy, and look for a frightening scene set inside a cavernous discotheque where the camera follows Lenya slithering through the crowd, making her way to the fragile Mrs Stone. Every scene with Lenya is a highlight in this movie, and also see how her intense love for her pet cat is expressed in the way Lenya artfully handles the willing feline.The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone, surely a "must-see" for devotees of Williams, Leigh, Beatty or Lenya, and anyone who enjoys colorful European settings, vivid characters and glossy romantic drama.**** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique Lyrical Piece of film making...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have always wondered about this film so I finally got the DVD out of the library and gave it a try.The film had much more depth than I was expecting. I really enjoyed it quite a lot.First of all, the pairing of two screen legends, Vivien Leigh &amp; Warren Beatty was just too much of a curiosity for me to resist. Quite frankly I'm surprised it took me this long to watch it.Both lead stars were excellent in their roles.Miss Leigh was restrained and delivered a role that did not slide into caricature.More surprisingly was Mr. Beatty who was totally believable in his role as a Roman gigolo. Though I must confess in the very first minutes of his screen time I giggled, but that has more to do with my own lack of imagination then it did with Mr. Beatty's performance. Quite frankly, within five minutes, I was sitting up in my chair and realizing that this guy was delivering a very assured and compelling performance.Lotte Lenya in rare screen role was amazingly modern &amp; fresh in her delivery. She's one actress who's reputation holds up seen through 21st century eyes.I thought this interpretation of a Tennesse Williams' novella was extremely well done and refreshingly different from the typical studio fare of its day.I'd recommend this film to anyone who would take it seriously and give it half a chance. You'll be more than rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Are you trying to--touch me, Contessa?" No one who sees Vivien Leigh on film can remain unmoved by her for long, if they are sensitive to beauty. Or pain. Despite whatever faults it may reveal to some, this film is a truly beautiful representation of the singularly tormented art of a hypnotically compelling actress. Watch her eyes in the introductory scene on the sofa, as she glances at the Contessa and her boy, over the smoke rising from her filter-less cigarette. Or at the villa lunch party--is anyone more graceful on screen with a fork and an awkward plate of food in their hands while managing to consume, register taste, swallow, and speak "sophisticated" dialog in the best postwar style, in a foreign (American) accent? Watch her in the café scene with Lotte Lenya's voracious pimp zeroing in on its prey: Leigh was tormented by the word "Beautiful"--friends and fans called her that to her face almost involuntarily, yet she couldn't tell them it drove her crazy, that her English convent school upbringing made that word synonymous with "shallow", at least to her way of thinking--but what other word describes her? Vivien Leigh casts a spell on all who see her, long after her death from tuberculosis in 1967. Oh, and the 1961 Lincoln convertible is as beautiful as any of the "Roman" scenery in the background; it is the perfect choice for Karen Stone's car.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>La Dolce Beatty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A depressing Tennessee Williams' tale that is somehow still watchable --- in large part due to the excellent performance by Vivian Leigh. As a woman past her prime and feeling desperate for anyone, Leigh is stunning. This may not have been a stretch for Leigh since she was at the time passed her prime and at least desperate for a decent movie role. Her Mrs. Stone is sad, pathetic and lost. In other words, Blanche DuBois without the garish makeup and southern twang. The film's title may or may not be ironic...is it Mrs. Stone's spring? It's doubtful given the film's downbeat, ambiguous ending. Perhaps the Italian gigolo she gets involved with marks a new beginning for her? Jose Quintero's flat direction doesn't really dig too deep.As the gigolo, Warren Beatty is awful. Affecting a very phony sounding Italian accent, he's almost campy. Lotte Lenya, as the contessa who pimps Beatty out is luckier...with her reptilian looks and creepy accent, she's decadence incarnate. Jill St. John is in it too, but doesn't contribute much beyond an unusually tall hairdo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie and recently purchased the 2006 DVD version with accompanying 12-minute "analysis". The analysis features an interview with Jill St. John who admitted that not once during filming did Miss Leigh ever actually speak to her. Interesting. That certainly mirrors the relationship between Karen Stone, the aging and drifting actress, and Miss St. John's irritating bimbo-starlet character in the story. Yes - Beatty's accent is horrendous and distracting but otherwise, he captures the essence of a young Roman hustler. Lenya outdoes herself and is nominated for a Golden Globe and an Oscar for her performance as the procurer. But, Vivien Leigh IS this movie with her fading beauty/fame and related insecurities mirroring those of the title character. Miss Leigh's stunning early 60s couture by Balmain, the posh sets, and that baby-blue Lincoln convertible are wonderful props for a poignant and compelling tale of loss and the loneliness and desperation that can result therefrom.By the way, I am conflicted and unsure about the finale of the movie. I presume that's what Mr. Williams intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps "The Roman Fall of Mrs. Stone" would have been too obvious a title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a film that, perhaps, would lose some of its meaningfulness were one not aware of the condition of its leading lady, the subjects of loneliness and exploitation are explored. Leigh plays a celebrated, but fading, stage actress who, after suffering a humiliating premiere, flees to Rome to escape the world. Though her devoted husband isn't able to join her as planned, she stays on, secluded in her luxury apartment, occasionally venturing out wearing dark glasses. Enter the troll-like, but somehow captivating, local procurer Lenya who introduces Leigh to her latest prize, the handsome Beatty, who is eager to make some money off of his own tender flesh. Though Leigh takes more than a little wearing down, eventually she and Beatty become heavily acquainted, with Leigh becoming more attached than she ought to. Beatty feels he no longer needs Lenya, which leads to a scenario that spells despair for Leigh. Leigh, who grappled with physical and mental ailments for a large part of her life, was incredibly fragile during the filming of this movie, having lost the love of her life, Laurence Olivier, to Joan Plowright. Looking every bit and then some of her age (thanks in part to a relentless smoking habit), she nonetheless projects loveliness and grace and sports some chic Balmain clothes. She is hampered, particularly in the first half, by wigs of ill-judged color and style, but overcomes this to deliver a captivating and sympathetic performance. Her voice is low and lacking the ability to intone with the same nuance and she can't seem to leave certain of her clothes alone in some scenes, but the magic is still there. Beatty is really quite awful, apart from the inherently challenging attempt of playing Italian. Though he definitely looks good, he gives a self-conscious and, at times, overly emphatic performance that comes close to being laughable at times. Lenya is to die for. She handily steals the scenes she's in with her lascivious expressions and crafty ways. The cast includes Browne as Leigh's vaguely lesbian good friend and St. John as a hot, young starlet whose career trajectory is the opposite of Leigh's. Filmed partly on location in Rome, it's typically pretty obvious when the locales switch to British soundstages, but generally the look is sumptuous whether in Leigh's elegantly appointed home or Lenya's garish one. Interestingly, especially considering the time it was made, the notion of homosexual prostitution is not ignored. While it isn't necessarily blatant, keen viewers will see it presented matter-of-factly (even leeringly, as one gigolo draws attention to a bauble he has acquired from a sugar daddy.) It's been noted that author Williams use Leigh's character as an extension of his own feelings and fears and that comes through rather strongly despite the fact that he is not the one who wrote the screenplay. Languidly paced, it's not a movie that will appeal to all tastes, but fans of the author and of Miss Leigh will want to check it out, certainly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film well worth your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sad film about a beautiful woman who believes only youth matters. She equates aging with a fading ability to be loved. Perhaps this really is how aging actresses feel. After all, sadly, many only get parts based on their beauty and youth more than talent. Once they get older they feel useless and unloved. She has wealth and fame even a still impressive beauty, still that is not enough. She is vain, she must have youth too. Perhaps she also feels her youth was wasted on a much older husband. She looks for youth/love in the wrong places now. Places she knows are wrong. She lets obviously seedy characters take advantage of her, not because she was naive, it was because she didn't care. She's experienced enough to have known better in fact she did know better so did her friends. It's hard to sympathize with Mrs. Stone in this movie. We still do. All the warning signs are there for her, still she insists on driving off that cliff ahead eyes wide open to it. That said Vivian Leigh is wonderful in this role and makes the film well worth seeing. Her talents make her character Mrs. Stone and the film believable. I've read that some feel Warren Beatty was miscast in his part. Personally I thought he did fine for this early point in his career. No he was not on a par with Ms. Leigh's talent, still he pulled off the character well. The directing, the photography and secondary characters are all excellent. The feeling of sadness and impending tragedy hangs over the film like a fog. It's personified by Mrs. Stones stalker. The ending is left open for interpretation. Some people might find the final scene annoying, I found the ending appropriate. I won't go into that here. I'll save it for the discussion board to avoid spoilers. I'll just say...the ending was chilling !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tennessee Williams adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vivien Leigh is an aging beauty living in Italy in "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone," based on a novel by Tennessee Williams. Director Jose Quintero took on the job of directing and he does a fine job with quite a cast, which includes Warren Beatty, Lotte Lenya, Coral Browne, Jill St. John, and Cleo Laine.Leigh plays Karen Stone, an actress pushing 50 who travels to Rome with her elderly husband. Her husband has a fatal heart attack on the plane, and Karen doesn't return to the states. Instead, she stays in Rome and leases a gorgeous apartment. She is visited by Contessa Magda Terribili-Gonzales (Lotte Lenya) who, for a cut, pimps out gigolos to older women. Karen is hooked up with Paolo (Warren Beatty) and soon finds herself falling for him.Vivien Leigh looks beautiful, but haunted, and she's perfect for this role, which dovetails her own life, as she Olivier told the manic-depressive actress that he was going to marry Joan Plowright around the time of the filming.Warren Beatty doesn't have much of an Italian accent or, in my own opinion, much presence. He looks good, which is most important.A very good, haunting movie.</fullReview>

I don't understand why some luscious Italian couldn't have been used instead. This reminds me of Meryl Streep's casting in The Bridges of Madison County. Awful. Use originals, not poor copies.Vivien Leigh was superb in the film.....so I suppose I am contradicting myself as she played an American! Her pathos was on display completely. Lotte Lenya was wonderful as the Contessa. She devoured her scenes with aplomb. It's interesting to watch movies where some of the actors are seamless and others try really hard.

		<shortDescription>Anachronistic at Best; Tedious at Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three major problems here, and not just for millennial-era viewers: 1) Jose Quintero's emotionally numb direction, 2) Warren Beatty in a role he wasn't cut out for until ten years later, and 3) Tennessee Williams's severely dated high concept.Quintero's lack of experience in film is evident. He was a stage director, and it shows here. The lines are spoken for the words to be understood from a distance. Quintero seems to have little sense of using the faces of the actors to convey anything in the one- or two-shots... save for what the estimable Ms. Leigh manages on her own.Beatty's Paolo needed at least some of Richard Gere's Julian (in "American Gigolo") to make this fly, but either he had no sense of the character himself or Quintero got in his way.William's book is a reflection of Williams himself as the title character. "TRSOMS" is Williams trying to work through the fear of his own histrionic narcissism too many years in advance of what he pictured aging to be for a "queen" rather than what it really is. He was only 38 when he wrote the novella, after all. Leigh's character is him, but only insofar as he could project a future that he had merely envisioned rather than actually experienced.I've read plenty about Ms. Leigh's own struggles and supposed identification with her character. But if that is the case, I don't see much of it on screen, again, perhaps, owing to the wooden direction.Younger viewers will have to interpret this as a "period piece." 1950 and 1960 are to them what the Victorian Age was to us: Anachronistic. The conflicting values expressed by the characters do not make much sense to those raised on either Lady Gaga or "Cougartown." Today's 48-year-olds "go for it" on the basis of peer-approval, not despite it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Tennessee Williams tale...good performances...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a haunting, poetic quality to some of the lines in 'The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone' and this is as it should be--for the author is none other than Tennessee Williams.Once again, Vivien Leigh is perfectly cast as a sadly adrift Williams heroine and she is still a fragile looking beauty as the aging actress who finds herself strangely attracted to gigolo Warren Beatty, just one of the studs under the employ of the Contessa (Lotte Lenya). Leigh gives her role all the nuances she could always bring to a part and finally throws caution to the wind when she throws her keys to a man who has been following her, waiting for his chance while keeping a discreet distance. The ending is sheer Williams and does not disappoint.Ironically, at the same time this was being filmed in Italy, Olivia de Havilland (Vivien's co-star in 'GWTW') was doing an entirely different sort of Italian romance called 'Light in the Piazza' which also made handsome use of Italian locations. In 'Roman Spring' Warren Beatty assumes an Italian accent that is not quite convincing. In 'Light in the Piazza' George Hamilton assumes a somewhat better one and has fun in a more humorous role. Both pictures are entertaining and deserve wider recognition.Final note: As usual, in 'Light' de Havilland played a more wholesome role. In 'Roman Spring' Vivien was decidedly neurotic. Some say her character was very much like the real Vivien Leigh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Rome with Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Introduced to a handsome young man during a stay in Italy, an insecure widowed US actress fights back her knowledge that the gentleman is just a gigolo in this Tennessee Williams adaptation starring Vivien Leigh in her penultimate big screen performance. Suffering from real life marital problems at the time, Leigh provides a performance with an air of vulnerability that rings true, but even better is Lotte Lenya of 'From Russia with Love' fame, cast here as the conniving 'countess' who introduces Leigh to her young suitor. Rambling on about the virtues of love and companionship, Lenya seems like a benevolent force at first, but as the film progresses and we see just how hell-bent she is on gaining financially from her matchmaking, she eventually seems almost as sinister as her better known Bond villainess. Promising as all this might sound though, the film is let down by never really igniting romantic sparks between Leigh and Warren Beatty as the young gigolo. Leigh never seems less than delusional to believe that he really loves her and Beatty only ever seems opportunistic. Beatty's awkward performance does not help matters though. He certainly looks the part, but with a faltering Italian accent, he never feels real whenever he opens his mouth. The main sell point of the film though is surely the dark and deliciously ambiguous ending. One exits the film really feeling like Leigh has suffered a personal blow and the uncertainty of her eventual fate is pitch perfect as she herself is unsure what the future holds for her by the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is beautifully acted and the casting is spot-on. Vivien Leigh is perfect in this role, neither sickly sweet or icy cold. Beatty is great to look at and plays the gigolo without any histrionics. The Contessa is great and earned a well deserved Oscar nomination. The story is relevant even today (although unfortunately nowadays these things happen with far less elegance and finesse. What holds it back from a higher rating is that the character development between Mrs. Stone and Paolo should have gotten more focus and development. No real explanation is given for how the relationship developed as quickly and strongly as it did. Of course that aspect plays into the cool nature of the film in general which many might find correct for this material but I would have liked a bit more development between the 2 principles. Perhaps neither was able to express much in the way of "emotion" and that is surely part of the point, and the finale when Mrs. Stone throws the keys to the gigolo on the street because, realizing that love is elusive, physical needs can still be met and that provides a great ending to the film, very unsentimental and leaves one with a shiver.I enjoyed the film and recommend it but don't expect anything warm and fuzzy here because that is not in the cards, folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jose Quintero's only major film directorial episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tennesee Williams' first novel has more current interest focus depth and meaning than do the more sensational novels he later wrote on more sordid subjects many turned into famous motion pictures. THE ROMAN SPRING OF MRS STONE delves into a world of lonely people first seeking comfort any price not expecting their bubble to inevitably burst once they move to an expatriate gathering region of a world Capitol City. When it does they often make a hasty a mid life crisis choice to pursue joie de vivre then when this goes bust as it will eventually prefer companionship at whatever cost. Quintero's only major screen effort casts three distinguished Hollywood personalities in the leads whose much admired acting chops are truly given a fine workout here. Vivien Leigh is the comfortable woman whose life is about to go bust once she finds herself alone by surprise with no life and no friends in an expatriate's hangout district of Rome. Warren Beatty is the gay Roman gigolo hired by madam Lotte Lenya to pretend be an eligible straight suitor sincerely interested in showing Vivian a good time. Brilliantly paced, edited and blocked it holds your interest throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is on my list of "watch whenever it's on," since it speaks to the temptation for women of degrading themselves rather than be alone. I must have seen it a dozen times, and the scenery is a great travelogue. Tennessee Williams can be very depressing, and this movie is no different, but it does have a decent message pertinent to older women especially. Vivian Leigh is very good, but Warren Beatty absolutely stinks in this. Two comments: 1. Without a doubt, Beatty's Italian accent is the WORST ever in any movie (worse than Brad Pitt's German one) 2. If that theme song sounds familiar, it's because it was stolen for the theme song of "Random Hearts," many years' later</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather depressing...but well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, it seems that most big name actresses are loathe to admit that time has caught up with them. Too often, as they get older, the become vain about their age and often portray women MUCH younger than they really are. However, in the case of "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone", Vivian Leigh does something rather brave--she plays a woman who is about 50 (just like Leigh was at the time) and who can no longer play these young woman parts. And I can really respect her for playing a character who hits close to home, so to speak.When the film begins, Karen Stone (Leigh) is starring in a play. The problem is that her character is just too young for this aging actress to play. Not surprisingly, the audience members think the same and instead of continuing, she decides to quit and take her husband to Italy. He's been ill and this is the perfect excuse to allow her to gracefully pull out of the play. However, on the flight to Rome, he has a heart attack and the credits begin. Soon you learn that he died on the flight and Karen is in this strange city...alone and grieving for her husband.Because Mrs. Stone is so vulnerable, a horrid old lady has been grooming her--grooming her to be taken by a handsome young gigolo, Paulo (Warren Beatty). Slowly, Paolo insinuates herself into Karen's life and after a while, they become lovers. However, some possible problems occur--Paolo MAY be falling for her for real and Karen soon learns that Paolo has taken advantage of other women and is planning on doing this to her as well. Oddly, however, the relationship continues--even though his prey knows what she's getting into with him.As I watched this movie, I kept wondering why they cast the characters like they did. Although Beatty did a good job as an Italian, why not just get a handsome young Italian actor?! Also, while Leigh was very good, why have her play an American actress--why not change the story to make her a Brit? I just cannot understand the producer's thinking in both these cases.So is the movie any good? Well, yes. But you also have to have a very high tolerance for seeing a woman in pain and not mind how unrelentingly grim the story is. This isn't surprising, since it's a story from Tennessee Williams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Vivien Leigh died the New York Times gave her death front page news. Ironically, this magnificent actress and great beauty had a short career in films and a rather short life.As we all know Ms. Leigh conquered Hollywood with her Scarlett O Hara beating out Jean Arthur, Paulette Goddard, Susan Hayward and just about every major female star for the role of the Century. Ms. Leigh won an Oscar for her performance and another one as her peerless Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire. Jack Warner thankfully bankrolled this film shot in Europe. One sees a magical artist at work. The shame of it all is that along with Ship of Fools were Ms. Leigh's last films. Warren Beatty does a nice job as the Gigolo and the film is recommended most of all for a supreme actress Vivien Leigh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivien Leigh Specialized in Fading Roles-Roman Spring for the Winter Birds **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In her mid and later movie career, Vivien Leigh seemed to thrive in fading woman roles. Naturally, we think of her as Blanche, in 1951's "A Streetcar Named Desire." Her last film "Ship of Fools," she was also a fading starlet and 1961's "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone," she played a washed up actress desperately searching for a way out of her loneliness with a younger man, Warren Beatty with a great Italian accent.The 'Roman Spring' basically fails because it could be viewed in comic terms. Lotte Lenya's supporting Oscar nomination performance as a woman in charge of matching up young gigolos with older women is comic at best. I would have laughed heartily if I didn't realize that Lenya tried to be serious. As the Contessa looking for a quick buck, Lenya constantly came across as a Brooklyn or Bronx yenta constantly on the phone to drum up business. Lenya may have been talented but she was extremely homely. That ugliness served her better as Rosa Klebb in "To Russia With Love."Leigh's portrayal of Karen Stone presented one very sick woman with emotional ups and downs. The film is depressing at best, with an ending suitable for a Hitchcock thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to start off the Sixties with ... I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" in Syracuse, NY in 1981, because I was intrigued to see Jill St. John in an early role. She never looked lovelier, especially with longer hair.But beyond that, this is a film that reflected the beginning of the Sixties in so many levels. Vivian Leigh, in her second-to-last role, had just finished her 20-year marriage to Laurence Olivier, and was having her crises when she made this film. She gives a great performance. Warren Beatty, I think, manages just fine. His movie career was just starting, and would flower as the decade wore on.And for Lotte Lenya, her role her led to her turn in "From Russia With Love" two years later. Both she and Ms. St. John would become part of that Sixties phenomenon, the 007 films.Given that this was the last film of Ernest Thesiger (who died 14 January 1961), that alone means this was filmed in the final days of the Eisenhower administration. Given that we see Vivian Leigh's character rides in a 1961 Lincoln, we clearly get the feel that we're at the real beginning of a memorable decade.No matter what one thinks of the overall movie, it captures a moment when the world was changing. For Ms. Leigh, it seemed to mark the beginning of an end that took place in 1967. For some of the other performers, it was their beginning. And the overall gloomy mood of this film seems to hearken the unease of the Sixties. Worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Echoes of Alberto Moravia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moravia's later novels, largely forgotten today, describe the world of Mrs. Stone. In them, wealthy people drift purposelessly, attended by lubricious procuresses offering compliant young persons to either sex of either leaning. Nobody ever manages to find an aim, let alone achieve anything. It is almost a mark of honour among Moravia's post-war Romans to have lost all conviction, and to pay to indulge idly in empty sexual encounters with equally aimless rent-boys and rent-girls. The Eternal City provides the beauteous and cynical backdrop.Obviously a homosexual in the strait-laced 1950s could not write frankly about his mid-life crisis and encounters with much younger rent-boys, so playwright Tennessee Williams was obliged to sublimate himself into the role of Mrs. Karen Stone, failing actress and inheritor of her husband's fortune. His choice of Rome was a perfect 'objective correlative' (T.S.Eliot) for his own predicament, permitting a frank treatment of mercenary poncing in the heterosexual context, of the kind pursued in the world of homosexuals.The result is a cloyingly sad story of drift and failure on the part of Mrs. Stone (Vivien Leigh), who manages to delude herself into believing that she loves her Italian gigolo (Warren Beatty), and, worse, that he loves her. There's a double irony in the fact that Leigh/Stone really is very desirable. Her face is divine, her breasts superb when she wears her nightgown, and her smooth upper back uniquely dimpled near the neck, echoing the dimples that doubtless lie below. She is, quite simply, delectable, and obviously hungry for sexual fulfilment.There's a delicious ambiguity in the last scene, when (as far as I am concerned), in her newly-aroused identity Mrs. Stone feels able to embark on pure lechery, through which she will doubtless triumph and even go back on to the stage. Others don't see it that way, but a lover of Moravia's tantalising fiction of boredom certainly would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely flawed minor masterpiece still looks good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film many years ago. I was impressed with it, not so much for the direction, or the material, but because of the fine performances. The acting lifts it out of the domain of the "women's film" or cheap melodrama. Sure, its a strange, uneven little film, but I think that's part of its charm. Leigh's performance was masterful, sad, subtle and wistful. Some of the negative comments here tell me this sort of thing is not for everyone's taste. So be it--the incessant gloom, the odd arty touches (the exotic Roman backdrops, the lyrical depiction of a declining jet set society, the emphasis on shadowy, sombre atmosphere will not appeal to fans of lighter, action oriented fare. I never forgot Leigh's performance (was she really acting?), nor the fantastic, alluring decadence of the atmosphere swirling around her. The other performances were a mixed bag: Lenya as the creepy pimp/countess is superb. She, more than any other player, embodies the selfish spirit of this dreary society of drifters, beggars, pimps and poseurs. Jill St. John is just so-so as a tantalizing young starlet (some really big sixties hair makes her character visually interesting, though). Coral Browne as Karen's best friend is fine, but Warren Beatty as the callow young gigolo doesn't quite fit in. He has the look and the superficial cockiness of a young Italian, but his accent is so terrible--its a major distraction in this undeniably flawed work. For the story--aging Hollywood actress Karen Stone has recently found herself widowed and out of work, perhaps permanently. She jets to Rome to relax, to find a new life--(in other words, a new man.) She meets old friends, then falls in with a suspicious looking crowd of young men and aging American heiresses with time and money to lavish on these young gigolos. Pimps and procurers circle around the scene like vultures, waiting to offer anything, for a price. Lotte Lenya is one of these pimps. She introduces Karen to Paolo, a charming young stud (Warren Beatty, in his famously uneven performance). That relationship gradually spirals downward--Paolo doesn't enjoy being a kept man. Poor, lonely Karen's life spins out of control-she begins to drift, aimlessly. Does the woman have a death wish? After an argument with Paolo she notices a stalker who has been trailing her for weeks. Impulsively, she tosses him her room key, and stealthily he climbs the stairs to her room. What happens next? No explanation is given at the end. Does the man kill her, or does she just offer him a drink? At the end Karen, has, in her own words, "stopped the drift". I imagine the gloomier interpretation is closest to the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vivien Leigh was so brilliant portraying damaged-goods, faded beauty Blanche DuBois in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire" that it was perhaps inevitable for her to be asked to play another Williams character who's been beaten up by life, 10 years later. Thus, in 1961, Leigh--more damaged herself now after a recent split with Laurence Olivier following a 20-year marriage--appeared in the screen adaptation of the Williams novella "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone." In it, she plays Karen Stone, a middle-aged stage actress who has just suffered two major life traumas: professional retirement and the death of her much older, millionaire husband. She retreats to a villa above the Spanish Steps in the Eternal City to hide from the world and just "drift," and is soon romanced by a handsome young Italian man, Paolo di Leo (Warren Beatty). But what Karen only dimly realizes is that Paolo is nothing more than a lira-grubbing gigolo, working for an elderly pimp/procuress named Contessa Terribili-Gonzales (Austrian legend Lotte Lenya)....Those viewers who come to "Mrs. Stone" expecting some kind of light romantic comedy, a la the Katharine Hepburn/Rossano Brazzi Venetian affair in 1955's "Summertime," will surely be surprised at how the film unreels. Despite the fact that it is a quiet picture, with a sad theme song that plays in a subdued manner only occasionally, it is nevertheless a dark and seedy one, featuring some truly unsavory characters. The scene transitions are often accomplished in a manner that beggars my poor powers of description, and director Jose Quintero gives a brooding, unsettling mood to this, his first picture, a great-looking one with sumptuous sets. Leigh, of course, is just marvelous--touching and sympathetic--here in her penultimate film, but the real surprise is how convincing Beatty is at playing an Italian, in his second screen appearance. Lenya is snakelike and sinister in her role, plotting the destinies of her victims with a purring cat on her lap, a la Ernst Stavro Blofeld; two years later, of course, Lenya would play opposite Blofeld (and that cat) in "From Russia, With Love." And speaking of future Bond alumni, "Mrs. Stone" also features fine supporting work from Jill St. John ("Diamonds Are Forever"'s Tiffany Case) and Paul Stassino ("Thunderball"'s Maj. Derval). Coral Browne, the future Mrs. Vincent Price, is well cast as Karen's school friend Meg (both actresses were born in 1913), and how great it is to see Ernest Thesiger ("Bride of Frankenstein"'s Dr. Praetorius) again, here in his final screen role! From its lengthy pretitle sequence to its eerie, ambiguous ending, "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" manages to impress. As regards that ending, with the disillusioned Mrs. Stone tossing her house key down to the street ruffian who'd been stalking her throughout the film, Jill St. John, in one of the DVD interview extras, suggests that the thug is merely looking for a "soft berth," whereas Williams AND Lenya biographer Donald Spoto discerns something a lot more homicidal. I tend to concur more with Spoto here, but the matter is certainly open for debate. See the film for yourself and make up your own mind....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Tennessee Williams fan, a Vivien Leigh fan, a Warren Beatty fan, and a Lotte Lenya fan, so this movie was a joy for me. Heck, I even became a Jill St. John fan watching her in this.Being in my 50's, I've just started experiencing the horrible feeling that one is no longer the object of the sexual gaze that one was before. I think the film captures a sense of that beautifully. It is a feeling that transcends gender, so the film doesn't lose anything by having a heterosexual female lead instead of a homosexual male lead. Although, I'm sure Williams would have chosen to make the personal story about a homosexual male like himself if he had the choice.Vivien Leigh played in amazingly few films. She starred in four or five before "Gone With the Wind" in 1939, and nine afterwards. However, from 1942 to 1965, she only did six films, about one every four years. Strange that one of the most famous actresses in the world during that entire period should only choose to make six films. Consider that Katherine Hepburn did six films between 1942 and 1946 and 18 films over the same time period.Everybody agrees that Vivien is great in the film, giving a beautiful measured and restrained, yet effective performance as the drifting Mrs. Stone. The big disagreement is over Warren Beatty. Some people can't get over his Italian accent, but that isn't necessarily because it is a bad Italian accent, it is because we know he is not Italian. In 1962, when this was being filmed, his first movie "Splendor in the Grass" had not been released. I suspect if "Splendor" had flopped and Beatty had quit movies after this film, everybody would be asking, "Whatever happened to that handsome Italian kid who played opposite Vivien Leigh in Mrs. Stone?" Lotte Lenya was terrific in this and got a deserved academy aware nomination. Sadly, Her movie career essentially consists of "Three Penny Opera" made in 1931, this movie and "From Russia With Love". This is another example of a great actress being totally ignored by Hollywood.Jill St. John plays a small part as a starlet and rival to Leigh for Beatty's affection. She is fine in the role. She also starred in a James Bond movie "Diamonds are Forever" about a decade later.The photography is quite exquisite at moments, looking quite Felliniesque here and there and sparse elsewhere.This is a movie about a successful woman drifting into old age, and exploiting young men for sex, while a young man drifts into the world of exploiting older women for their money. It is sad, but funny and beautiful at moments.</fullReview>

First of all his accent is atrocious, you are never NOT aware that this is Warren Beatty making like an Italian. Lotte Lenya however steals every scene she is in. Now there was an actress! One just can't get enough of her on screen with her manipulations, her cat, her pimping, all with this extremely thin over-layer of civility. Fascinating people in bit parts scattered throughout, look for a very young Jill Ireland, ditto Jean Marsh long before the success of "Upstairs, Downstairs". Most of the movie was filmed in England with second unit only in Italy. this accounts for the stagey sets and obvious backdrops, another detriment.Vivien portrays the vulnerability, need and boredom of the character of Karen Stone incredibly well. This is her second to last movie (her last was "Ship of Fools". At the time her own marriage to Lawrence Olivier had fallen apart and she had had several nervous breakdowns and this comes across in her brittle performance and the sense of displacement she brings ("drifting" it is called in the movie). *****Minor Spoiler***** A riveting scene takes place when she and Paolo have finally parted and a party disintegrates to the accompaniment of herself and Paolo projected on to a home movie screen in happier times.

		<fullReview>" And when the time comes when nobody desires me for myself:I would rather not be desired at all"As with all Tenessee Williams adaptations it's the characters that keep the viewer interested, always intriguing and seemingly fractured with personal demons. The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone is no different, and much like the other adaptations the actors on show here come up trumps to realise the heavy dialogue driven story. This film centres on an ageing actress whose husband dies and leaves her to face her fears whilst holidaying in beautiful Rome. Here she is pimped a male companion for company and the film then fleshes out the respective characters to a craftily ambiguous ending. But it's the journey that each characters psyche takes that lifts the film above average.The back story to the film is a belter and knowing this back story helped me to enjoy the film much more than perhaps I would have. Vivien Leigh is here as the scared and alone ageing actress who falls in love with a much younger man, in real life Leigh's husband Sir Laurence Olivier had just left her for a younger woman. You can't help believing that the wonderfully tragic performance she gives here is really from the heart. The character of Karen Stone is actually based on Tenessee Williams himself, all the fears and stresses of the title character are how he felt has he penned this novella. Warren Beatty is a fine choice as the gigolo of the piece, he looks the part and actually looks like an Italian man, but I really can't vouch for his accent because during scenes where he gets angry he actually sounds more Soviet! That aside tho, he gives a well solid performance that didn't deserve the negative reviews that it got on release. Lotte Lenya {who later on would thrill me as the villainess Rosa Kleb in From Russia With Love} is brilliant here, in fact she almost steals the film as high society pimp, Contessa, all devilish charm with money signs sparkling in her eyes.Great writing, fine acting, and poignant to the last with a cracking and worth waiting for ending. 7/10.</fullReview>

Vivien Leigh is certainly well-cast as the recently-widowed, faded screen actress approaching fifty who, while residing in Rome, falls for a handsome gigolo. It's a slow, heavy-going soaper with extremely moody characters. Warren Beatty is pitilessly miscast as the Italian stud (though his wavering accent is good for a few laughs). The pacing does pick up after a deadly first hour, the cinematography is rich and the production has some sparkle, but otherwise there's no sting in this "Roman Spring".

		<fullReview>For myself, this movie is more than what it purports to be. It reminds of the beauty and charm which is Rome and all that its culture continues to present. Regardless of any individual actor's quality, good or bad- the judgement being up to each individual viewer; This film's story IS, more over, touching and bitter-sweet. Meant, I believe, to touch one's heart who has had love elude them while age continues to encroach and impinge on the reality of life this brings. I find this story to be typical of Tennessee Williams' work, in so many aspects. It is especially moving if you've been lucky enough to sit and purview the populace while sitting on the Spanish Stairs in Rome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Roman Streetcar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jose Quintero was a stage director who didn't know how to shape a movie so this screen version of Tennessee Williams' novel seems somehow flat and static. There is no momentum; it plods along, and yet it is entertaining. The players liven it up. Vivien Leigh is the ageing American actress hiding out in Rome after the death of her husband. The character is like Blanche DuBois before she went to seed. She's an innocent abroad, open and vulnerable and Leigh knows her well. As Paolo, the gigolo who ruins her, a young, fresh-faced and startlingly handsome Warren Beatty is first-rate. This was only Beatty's second film and there is no affectation in his performance. He comes across as not fully formed as an actor. As he sucks up to Mrs. Stone it's hard to know where Beatty ends and Paolo begins. He keeps us guessing; there is an edge to his performance.As the procuress, Lotte Lenya walks away with the film. It's a small part but Lenya knows its value. She dominates every scene she's in; she makes it look easy. She got an Oscar nomination for her performance and she should have won. The film itself is overlong and Williams did it better in "Streetcar" and "Sweet Bird of Youth", (this isn't a million miles away from "Sweet Bird"). It's middle-of-the-road but like I said, the players keep you watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps a couple of minor corrections...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other IMDb comments on this are quite appropriate, including the sad parallels of this film's plot with the real-life disappointments in love being experienced by its star, Vivien Leigh. When I saw this film during its theatrical release, despite finding Warren Beatty adequate in his role as Paolo, I wondered why an Italian actor hadn't been cast. With Mr. Beatty's star on a rapid rise, I suppose the filmmakers wanted to insure a better return at the box-office, but he had considerable competition from his fellow players: not only the beautiful and tragic Miss Leigh; but also the formidable Lotte Lenya, loathsomely effective as the Contessa; Coral Browne, making the most of her brief appearance as Mrs. Stone's rightly concerned friend; and even Jill St. John, allowed to reveal a little streak of viciousness as a vapidly silly movie starlet.Jose Quintero's direction seemed to emphasize the hothouse atmosphere of the storyline and the film appears to have been made almost entirely on, I believe, London soundstages. There are some second unit shots on the streets of Rome, but my eyes told me, when I saw it on the big screen, that the principals did all of their emoting within the confines of a studio, with back projections where necessary. The film was not made in the Techniscope process, as the "technical specs" on this IMDb site attest. The ratio was the normal one for non-widescreen films of the day. But the Technicolor cinematography is of a very high order and the production design was certainly first-class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie's reputation would lead you to believe it's a very bad movie. It's not. I was also willing to imagine it would be bad because 90 percent of Tenessee Williams output is such solidly over-the-top melodrama. This just barely escapes that fate and is entertaining, but Williams insistence on underscoring the morality here is still typical and tiresome. I had expected this scenario to be cleaned up and coded to please the censors. But the direct discussion of sex, pimps, gigolos, splitting profits, etc. is really startling and modern. Lotte Lenye, as a half-pathetic but not-to-be-underestimated pimpette preying on self-deluding older women, is amazing. She is almost assuredly a more provocative &amp; interesting study than Karen Stone. She has no pretense of respectability except that which she performs to sustain the self-respect of her clients.As a conflict, it remains unclear why Stone, a retired actress would think that a young stud could want her only out of love; other than that she wants it to be true. That's just not compelling or realistic enough for her to go to pieces over Beatty chasing skirts. What is interesting about the role is that there is no reason why a woman her age shouldn't feel free enough to explore her sexuality. Unless you consider 1950's conformism sufficient reason. It didn't stop Ingrid Bergman.Beatty is funny and absurd when he's supposed to be ("Would you stop eating and concentrate on ME?") so he seems to be in on the joke (and I'm the least likely person to cut this himbo some slack), but really my quarrel is: why cast a handsome American when Italy is bursting at the seams with attractive young male actors who could have done more with the part? All Beatty could have achieved here is "Yeah he passed as Italian." Those stakes are not very interesting. And his caucasian, boy-next-door, Joe College looks just don't put me in mind of Italy in any way. His accent is sometimes passable but usually just provides titters. Let's just say that for 1961, it was an adequate effort. That notwithstanding, Leigh and Lenya still totally blow him out of the water.Stage director Quintero really needed to abandoned his claustrophobic Italy set. It's almost believable as an exterior but when Leigh takes her final walk and passes every scene from the movie in about 5 steps... what's the point of location photography? Amazingly the soundstage lighting is occasionally believable as sunlight, which is almost never the case. When it's not bold and interesting it's at least campy. There are a number of laugh-out loud observations, line-readings and Coral Brownes lipstick applied rather liberally is a hoot. Add this title to the ever-popular "Americans who meet with trouble in Europe" genre: Don't Look Now, Comfort of Strangers, Hostel, Zentropa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Split Decision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently been going back and collecting many of the incomparable Vivien Leigh's works and reviewing them. Miss (not Ms) Leigh remains the only good reason to acquire this film.I keep wanting Karen Stone to "snap out of it," but it just never happened. Miss Leigh is still beautiful and talented even two decades after Gone With the Wind and Waterloo Bridge, but this Widow Stone character and weak plot gave her little room to develop a following. Karen Stone exhibits depression, despair and frankly just poor judgment but never gives a full range of emotions. Streetcar (1951) was a far better collaboration of Tennessee Williams and Vivien Leigh. Williams' material is often too depressing to entertain many people.Warren Beatty wasn't so bad here. Many other reviewers trash his Italian accent, but his role has more range and volatility. He does fine. Jill St John is a weak poster backdrop beside Vivien Leigh even at this late point in her career--just laughable.Lotte Lenya got the Supporting Actress Oscar nomination, and this is understandable. She inhabited her character and her scenes to the point of fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams Novel Adapted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty impossible not to have something worthwhile transpire from bringing together such titanic talents as these here for a film project.Louis De Rochemont certainly distinguished himself as producer of many extraordinary documentaries and dramas; Richard Addinsell (of "Warsaw Concerto" fame) lent his fine craft to many films; the name, Jose Quintero, is one of the most respected on Broadway, and, of course, the name, Tennessee Williams, speaks for itself. When the great Vivien Leigh was persuaded to play the lead, success was guaranteed--not only commercially but artistically. Leigh brings her incredible presence to the role of Karen Stone: at turns beautiful, worn, vulnerable and desperate. Leigh lays bare her full emotional range in this decidedly smarmy Williams tale, with his characteristically downbeat finale.Warren Beatty was obviously chosen for his physicality, and proved no slouch in the acting department, either. Lotte Lenya's casting was quite inspirational, and she does not disappoint.What could have been a completely depressing and sordid Williams affair is given considerable interest and spark through the combined talents of these outstanding artists. Alas, like most Williams creations, its end value cannot surmount the abysmal degradation of its inherently negative consciousness. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lenya steals the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps Warren Beatty's best screen performance- he is perfectly cast as the Italian gigolo and both his accent and his heavy-lidded loucheness, not to mention his beauty, bring Paolo to life. One feels more for him than for the person we are supposed to feel for- poor Karen Stone. Vivien Leigh with her newly developed deep contralto voice plays Karen in an emotional vacuum. She "walks through" the role and we never "feel" what she is supposed to be feeling. Perhaps this is Quintero but I doubt it. I just think Ms. Leigh was tired and unable to dredge up the required feelings on cue.The film goes on a bit too long - the languidity of certain scenes which merely repeat what has already been established draws it out longer than necessary.All said, the best thing in it (and deservedly Oscar-nominated) is Lotte Lenya's Contessa - in nine perfectly crafted and acted scenes, she steals the film and is the one character we remember the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't see it for the Vivien Leigh charm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wondered why I'd bothered viewing this film. It was interesting to see that Vivien Leigh still had some Scarlett left in her, although mainly in the voice, rather than her looks or her character of Mrs Stone. I also wondered why anyone would write a storyline like this and think it entertaining enough to make a film out of it, although I do think that, if this is your kind of genre, you'll enjoy it. In all, not a bad film, but if you (like me) saw it for the Vivien Leigh charm, I advise that you go back in time a bit and dig out Gone with the Wind, A Streetcar Named Desire, or Waterloo Bridge instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivien Leigh looks better at 50 than this film does at 40...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but it's bad enough to be good. Warren Beatty and Vivien Leigh in the same movie? Warren Beatty as a Roman? (It's laughable every time he says "prego.") Lotte Lenya is extremely funny, Rome looks great, and though this goes on a bit too long, it was perversely worthwhile to see it. Maybe 40 years ago "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" seemed sturdy, but the other night it was a good whimsical thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The set designer and the fashion designer had fun. I can say the lighting designer had fun and drew attention to his art. The movie seemed to try to be spooky but in the end, (and middle and beginning) I found I didn't care about any of the characters. The soundtrack was melodramatic organs from another era.It's not a subtle movie yet I don't get it. I suppose garish but hollow superficiality against the backdrop of mortality was the point in a way but there was only the one point, announced, acted out, over and over and over. Perhaps it is because in 1960s rote learning and repetition was in vogue?Everybody uses everybody. And? Woman is learned helplessness and a case study for those who don't listen to their instincts pay for it. So? Lady pimp doing something "evil" while hapless lead character victims go through motions of life. I kept expecting a turning point, more than a slow motion toy train wreck. It isn't so much what it was as what it wasn't. I guess it annoys me because there is not only no glimmer of hope, no wit, no sense of humor, no building drama, no depth or development of character. There was no plot tension. There was no unexpected turns unless you count erratic behavior and unpredictability of cardboard "friends" tracking her down.Sometimes when a movie character makes an error the audience laughs or groans and slaps their collective head and goes, no, no you fool. Except in this movie it's not huge enough mistakes for you to get that excited over; why is everyone so daft? If you don't like someone, don't tell them where you live and invite them for tea. If the guy doesn't want to be around the contessa, then he can go elsewhere. If people would just be upfront with each other instead of insensibly running away... there would be no movie, but a handy bit of time that could be used for say, household tasks.for me, boring and depressing. Clearly I'm missing something.</fullReview>
