		<shortDescription>Sternberg, Dietrich reach their zenith in opulently photographed romantic intrigue as extraordinary today as it was 70 years ago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Josef von Sternberg's Shanghai Express chugs out of Peking, squeezing through a teeming alleyway as it picks up steam, it marks the start of a momentous journey ? not only for its motley of passengers but for Hollywood. In this fourth teaming of the Svengali-like director and his Trilby of a star ? Marlene Dietrich ? they reach the zenith of their legendary collaboration and strike a template for the kind of movies America would do best and like best: voluptuous hybrids of adventure and intrigue, romance and raffish fun.Leaving for Shanghai to operate on the stricken British Consul-General, army physician Clive Brook climbs aboard only to find the woman he loved but lost five years ago (Dietrich). Now, however, she goes by another appellation; as she explains, in the script's most emblematic line, `It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily.' Her presence on the train, and that of one of her sisters-in-sin (Anna May Wong) is cause for scandal and indignation among the other passengers: prim boarding-house proprietress Louise Closser Hale (with her pooch Waffles smuggled on board); sputtering man of the cloth Lawrence Grant; sardonic gambling man Eugene Pallette; a Frenchman; a German; and the inscrutable, pre-Charlie Chan Warner Oland.Soon, China being embroiled in a civil war, they have more to worry about than Dietrich's morals. Rebel troops halt the journey lead the passengers, one by one, to be interrogated by their warlord, who turns out to be Oland. The various eccentricities, secrets and agendas of the passengers get brought into the open, affording Oland opportunity to avenge any number of racial and personal slights. But finally he finds what he's been looking for ? a valuable hostage to serve as a bargaining chip ? in Brook. And from then on Shanghai Express becomes a drama of reckoning, with all the characters scheming to save their own (and occasionally one anothers') skins.None of the players can be faulted, except for Brook, who gives a dead-earnest impersonation of the stick that stirs the fire; that Dietrich should have fallen for him is like believing several impossible things before breakfast. (Cary Grant was around in 1932; too bad Sternberg didn't catch up with him until his next movie, Blonde Venus.) But in his handling of Dietrich, Sternberg all but patents what came to be called star treatment. Stunningly lighted, her feline face is caught in a breathtaking range of moods and attitudes. But she's more than a passive vessel for the director's intentions ? her blend of worldly savvy and steely spine is hers and hers alone.She isn't the only beneficiary of Sternberg's eye. He shoots the movie in a haunting, intense chiaroscuro (few movies from this early in the 1930s were so richly and handsomely photographed). He cuts from scene to scene teasingly, layering new shots on fading images, adding a little rubato to relate incidents of the story to one another. Shanghai Express may be the first masterpiece of the sound era, one that's still no less extraordinary today than it was 70 years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dream of a ghostly train and shades of black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shanghai Express is another von Sternberg masterpiece, probably not appreciated in his day (no academy awards) and lesser known that it should be in this day. Film theory says this film was an attempt to shade degrees of blackness. At one point, Marlene Dietrich's face blooms like a white flower out of the shadows, then closes again.Beautiful is not a big enough word enough to describe the cinematography in Shanghai Express. The plot is dreamlike and unrealistic (Sternberg hated realism), the costumes are excessive (impossible to contain in Dietrich's supposed luggage), the atmosphere is deliciously layered with decadence, exoticism (good part for Anna Mae Wong) and deterioration (broken walls, slats and fantasies), punctuated by von Sternberg's caprice (chickens wandering in front of the train -- a symbol of Dietrich's husband's profession as a chicken farmer?). The storyline is basically a broken romance seeking to be healed between Clive Brook and Dietrich or "Shanghai Lily," the naughty lady who has sold her body the past few years to keep herself in glittery costumes and furs.The real "story" is "Dietrich and von Sternberg visit China" on some movie lot, on their way from or to Russia (The Scarlet Empress), Spain (The Devil is a Woman), North Africa (Morocco), or somewhere in the U.S. (Blonde Venus). Gorgeous and lots of fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Marlene Dietrich Romance Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nine first-class passengers board a train to travel the 3-day trip from Peiping, China, to Shanghai. Nine souls with widely varying backgrounds &amp; uncertain futures. For they are traveling into countryside racked by civil war and one of their number may not be all he seems. What dangers await &amp; who will survive the journey on the SHANGHAI EXPRESS?Marlene Dietrich is mysteriously beautiful as Shanghai Lilly, a `coaster' (a woman living by her wits on the coast of China) whom all men - and most viewers- find fascinating. Clive Brook, a silent film star little remembered now, is very effective as the British Army doctor who was once Lilly's lover. Anna May Wong plays an exotic Chinese prostitute who is used to taking care of herself. The supporting cast is equally good: Warner Oland as a sly Eurasian; Eugene Pallette as a jovial American gambler; Lawrence Grant as a grumpy old English missionary; Gustav von Seyffertitz as an invalid German with a dangerous secret; Emile Chautard as an elderly French Major with a hidden past; and wonderful old Louise Closser Hale as a feisty American widow who runs `the best boarding house in Shanghai.'Paramount put a lot of money into this pre-Production Code adventure drama, which has an exciting plot, good acting &amp; plenty of romance. The Peiping scenes, with the crowded tenements squeezing right down to the very railroad tracks, are especially well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many consider "The Shanghai Express" the best von Sternberg/ Dietrich film. Perhaps. I certainly agree that it is a very good movie. The story is a bit trivial: two lovers meet again after five years. They were separated due to the lack of faith he had in her. This film is a journey. In fact, two kinds of journeys: a physical one, since the set is a moving train, and a psychological one, since during this journey Captain Harvey (Clive Brook) gains fate, essential to a love relationship. The train movements seem to indicate the attraction Captain Harvey and Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich) feel for each other. This movie gives us one of the most beautiful images in movie history: Dietrich in the dark, smoking a cigarette, with the famous light that gave her that famous "butterfly shadow".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The China that Von Sternberg Gave Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a difficult, artistic personality, Joseph Von Sternberg was a deep romantic. While Marlene Dietrich showed in a long career that she had vast reservoirs of talent, Von Sternberg gave her career a lift in that series of films they made together from THE BLUE ANGEL to THE DEVIL IS A WOMAN. Remarkably, given the limitations of black and white film, Von Sternberg left some beautiful images (to this day) of the actress who may have been the most beautiful one in motion picture history.SHANGHAI EXPRESS is set in the China of the Warlord period (as was THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN). A group of travelers are leaving a Chinese city to reach Shanghai, before the railway link is cut by the troops of the warlord. They include Dietrich, Anna May Wong (her best recalled talkie performance, as the bride to be Hui Fei), Clive Brook, Lawrence Grant, Eugene Palette, Warner Oland, Louise Closser Hale, Gustav Von Seyfertitz, and Emil Chautaud. Each has a distinct personality, which sometimes clashes with the others. Dietrich was formerly the fiancé of Brook, an English officer and gentleman, but he dumped her and she has become a high class prostitute. Grant is a holy roller minister, who is disgusted at the acceptance of that prostitute by some of the passengers. Palette (my favorite character in the film - his role is like a comic afterthought) is an even tempered gambler who is returning to Shanghai to look after some properties he has there. He has no problems accepting Dietrich at all. Also, he sees no problem with the use of racist comments (for that locale) as, "I wouldn't give him a Chinaman's chance!", which fits his gambler's instinct. Hale is the owner of a boarding house in Shanghai, who is friendly at first until she realizes what Dietrich does for a living (devilish Dietrich then asks Hale, in pretended shock, "What kind of a house do you run?", much to Hale's annoyance). Seyfertitz is a silent, really abrasive type, who wants to be left alone (it's interesting in the comments about racism towards Chinese in this film, few comment about Seyfertitz and his role and how it dovetails with residual anger towards Germans in the wake of World War I). Brook is going to another post, and is shocked at how Dietrich has ended as she has - but he can't help feeling some of the romantic feelings of five years before. Chautaud is headed to meeting his sister, whom he has not seen in years, and who expects him to be a great military hero. And Oland is a half Chinese half White passenger, who is not the quiet businessman he seems.The train is stopped by the forces of the local warlord, whom everyone meets. Each is handled differently, as their secrets are wormed out of them. The best confrontation is the warlord and Seyfertitz, who learns a serious lesson in manners. But events soon turn about, due to an unexpected party, and move on to the satisfactory climax. I won't mention the details because this is a film that I think should be seen by everyone, for it's evocation of a China that is now somewhat lost (with it's teaming throngs of people pushing their ways to their destinations). China still has a really large population, but I don't think the disorder that Von Sternberg captures in his railroad stations scenes still exists. As a picture of the lost China of 1930, as a fascinating character study of over six characters, and as another romantic view of La Marlene, SHANGHAI EXPRESS remains a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the decades I've managed to see nearly all of the films Sternberg directed and I've always considered that this one was his best work. It was pre Hays Code Paramount for starters, with a marvellous cast and an unusual and simple story full of romance and action gripping to the end. It was also lovingly photographed from beginning to end, everyone and everything gleaming in a by turns savage and erotic dreamlike world.During the Chinese Civil War and travelling on the Peiping-Shanghai Express ("where time and life have no meaning") are a disparate band of Westerners plus a couple of enigmatic natives ? all sadly lacking in moral fibre except Clive Brooks who has too much of it. This makes him less of a human being, along with the rest of them. He's still in love with Marlene Dietrich whom he ditched 5 years and 4 weeks before thus unwittingly turning her into Shanghai Lily the notorious coaster - a woman living on the coast of China by her "wits" ? which is a bit of a serious problem to the upright Britisher even though she still loves him. Warner Oland plays a fundamentalist Chinaman with secrets and ashamed to have white blood in his veins while Eugene Palette is a gambling mad American capitalist. Inscrutable and sullen Anna May Wong is Dietrich's companion in vice, and 4 other international eccentrics make up the passenger list we're interested in. Favourite bits: Wong's dramatic announcement of her consummated revenge; the iconic image of Dietrich smoking in the dark; the all-too believable chaotic scenes of civil warfare. The interplay between the main characters is occasionally laboured but always fascinating and always thought provoking - there's plenty going on so attention is recommended! The only thing that gets in the way of this being an absolute masterpiece is Brooks' lousy stilted acting style ? entertaining in its own way to study the forgotten technique, but it's often jarring in its unconvincingness.An early talkie classic, mesmerising even after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It Took More Than One Man To Change My Name To Shanghai Lily"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Marlene Dietrich's most popular films from her early period with Joseph Von Sternberg was Shanghai Express. In fact her portrayal of the notorious Shanghai Lily is the main reason for watching this film today.Set in Kuomintang China, the film concentrates on a group of train passengers making a journey from Peking to Shanghai. These are the white passengers all heading for their extraterritorial enclaves on the China coast and a couple of richer Chinese. One of them is Warner Oland who is a seemingly respectable Chinese merchant, but actually a notorious warlord leader a group that Chiang Kai-Shek has sworn to exterminate. In fact during this period his government was doing just that. Oland is best known for playing Chinese detective Charlie Chan, but he's not dispensing fortune cookie wisdom here. He's a most menacing figure who when he's revealed holds all the lives of the passengers in his hands. The other Oriental in this group is well to do prostitute Anna May Wong. She and Dietrich find themselves kindred spirits and are shunned by the other passengers.It's a reunion of sorts for Dietrich, another of the passengers is Clive Brook a British army doctor who is on his way to China to perform a delicate operation on a big shot. He and Dietrich were once involved, but when he dumped her, she took the road that made her the notorious Shanghai Lily.The main weakness of Shanghai Express in fact is Brook. He's such a cold fish drip of a man, I can't see how Dietrich and he could ever have been involved. The film would work a lot better if the role had been cast with someone of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr's charm. Still Brook proves the old flame hasn't quite died down and in fact it hasn't for Marlene either.Other characters on the train are Lawrence Grant as a reverend Davidson type missionary, Louise Closser Hale as an old American dowager, Emile Chautard as a disgraced French Army officer, Gustave Von Seyfertitz as a hypocritical opium dealer, and Eugene Palette as a crass American businessman as only Eugene Palette can play them. They provide quite a cross section of the western powers who were nibbling on the Chinese body politic at the time.Shanghai Express won an Oscar for Cinematography and was in the running for Best Picture that year, losing to Grand Hotel which has a lot of similarities to this film. Dietrich is unforgettable as Shanghai Lily and this is a must for her fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty exciting stuff--and among Marlene Dietrich's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHANGHAI EXPRESS is an excellent film from 1932 that stars Marlene Dietrich but also benefits from a strong ensemble cast. In other words, while Dietrich is an important part of the film, she isn't THE film and supporting actors also help to make this a good film. I like this because too often in her early films all the weight of the movie rested on how sexy and alluring Dietrich's characters were supposed to be--and to me, this got very old after a while. It helped here, though, that Dietrich's usual angular and severe looks are a bit less pronounced (as was the case in her very early Hollywood films). Here, she plays "a woman of ill-repute" (a prostitute) but there are many others that give the film life as well--making this film a bit like GRAND HOTEL on the rails! This film has the distinct honor of being one of the only films in which Warner Oland plays an Asian yet this isn't necessarily insulting to real Asian actors. That's because Oland was Swedish-born and often played Asians (such as Charlie Chan)--while qualified Asians were relegated to supporting roles! However, in this film, his character is supposed to be half-Chinese and half-Western--so the casting wasn't a bad idea at all.Apart from Oland and Dietrich, Anna May Wong, Clive Brook, Lawrence Grant and Eugene Palette, among others, are on hand to provide some color. Ms. Wong, in particular, had some excellent scenes playing a Chinese prostitute and defender of the Chinese Republic (a strange combination, I know).As far as Grant goes, his was a truly unusual character. His Reverend Mr. Carmichael was odd because initially he came off as such a prudish and self-righteous jerk--so much so that the studio was forced to re-write his character and soften him up some as to avoid offending religious sensibilities of the audiences. However, by changing a few scenes, they made him one of the most unusual and three-dimensional minsters portrayed in film during the era. How he came to actually like and respect Dietrich (the prostitute) may seem a bit silly to some, but I actually liked the way they re-wrote the film. As a result, of all the passengers, Grant's came off as perhaps the most interesting.As far as the film goes, in addition to good performances, the writing, direction and cinematography were all exceptional. A top-notch film that sure will keep your interest as you follow this train through rebel territory in China.About the only negative about the film might be that it promotes the old film cliché of "the prostitute with a heart of gold"--in fact, it has this times two! Just once, I'd like to see a film where the prostitute isn't so glamorous (perhaps with a few herpes scabs) and isn't a nice person after all!! Imagine if PRETTY WOMAN had followed THAT formula!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always enjoy films from the 1930's and especially this one, which stars Marlene Dietrich,(Shanghai Lily),"Touch of Evil",'58, who looks very young and trim and plays a woman who has been around the block quite a few times. Lily is still in love with a long lost lover and she once again gets involved with him on the "Shanghai Express", along with quite a few other characters on the mysterious train ride. Warner Oland,(Mr. Henry Chang), a great veteran actor who performed in many "Charlie Chan Films in the 1930's, gave a great supporting role along with another veteran actor, Eugene Palette(Sam Salt),"The Cheaters",'45. If you love an excellently produced Classic Film, this is the film for YOU!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please refrain from further bashing of Clive Brook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly one of the greatest films yet made (even I still have hope there will be more!), not least for the beautifully restrained performance of Clive Brook. Apparently the depiction of nobility and restraint is lost on modern audiences. Not a surprise, since these qualities seem to be almost entirely lost to modern society! OK, off the soapbox. This is one of the most moving stories ever depicted on film (compare, too, with Nicholas Ray's "In a Lonely Place," which tells a similar tale of misunderstandings that destroy a deep love -- without the happy ending that is so welcome in "Shanghai Express.") All the supporting players brilliantly portray their variously flawed characters, and the direction is simply breathtaking. Note, for instance, the multi-layered dissolves in the opening sequence. A stunning film -- I think it the best of the seven magnificent Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations. (This is the fourth, and, perhaps significantly, it was made after Sternberg took a break from Dietrich with his "American Tragedy." Did Sternberg realize how much he missed having her... and was he inspired beyond all measure? So it would seem. This and the succeeding three films, "Blonde Venus," "The Scarlet Empress," and "The Devil is a Woman" make anything else from the period -- from any period -- pale by comparison.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Matter of Faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1931, during the civil war in China, a train leaves Beijing to Shanghai. Among the passengers, the British Captain Donald "Doc" Harvey (Clive Brook) that is traveling to operate the Vice-Governor of Shanghai; the courtesan Hui Fei (Anna May Wong); the Reverend Mr. Carmichael (Lawrence Grant); the boarding house owner Mrs. Haggerty (Louise Closser Hale); the French Major Lenard (Emile Chautard); the dealer Eric Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz); and the local Mr. Henry Chang (Warner Oland). Out of the blue, Captain Harvey stumbles with the notorious courtesan Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), who is a "coaster" ("a woman that travels along the China coast with her wealthy clients"), and he recognizes her as her former lover Magdalen. Five years ago, Shanghai Lily tested his faith and love for her and Doc left her, in the beginning of her promiscuous life. Their encounter rekindles the old flame of their love and he shows that he is wearing the watch she gave to him. The train is stopped by Chinese soldiers seeking out a rebel agent and they arrest him. But Chang telegraphs a coded message and the rebels take over the train along the trip. Chang, who is their leader, interviews the passengers to find someone worthwhile to be exchanged by the arrested agent and he chooses Captain Harvey. Chang also tries to force Shanghai Lily to stay with him but Captain Harvey defends her and knocks him down; then he rapes Hui Fei. When the government releases the rebel agent, Chang decides to revenge Harvey blinding him. However, Shanghai Lily offers herself to Chang to release Harvey. What will happen to her? "Shanghai Express" is a great Pre-Code Film with magnificent performances of the gorgeous Marlene Dietrich and Anna May Wong. The melodramatic romance about the lack of faith in love and the recounter of two former lovers in the environment of the Chinese Civil War in 1931 is engaging with wonderful black and white cinematography. Marlene Dietrich deserved a better romantic pair since the wooden Clive Brook does not have good performance. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Expresso de Shanghai" ("The Shanghai Express")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sternberg and Dietrich make this great despite Clive Brook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have mentioned this is one of the great films of the 1930's. All films eventually become dated even the movies our younger reviewers might think are timeless e.g. "Pulp Fiction" or "Lord of the Rings" will someday be seen as old fashioned or of their time . That said great film-making is always worth watching and Josef von Sternberg was one of Hollywood's first directors with artistic vision. It shows in the extraordinary opening sequence and throughout; particularly the night time search for the suspected spy. Dietrich was the sexiest woman in films at that time and she's still sexy. It's interesting to note that many of the top female stars during this time period were European. Dietrich, Garbo, Hedy Lamaar. Present day Hollywood has nothing to compare with them. The same can be said for astonishing Anna May Wong the scenes with her and Marlene are pure erotic fantasy on a grand scale. Shanghai Express would be perfect if it weren't for the god awful Clive Brook, as others have mentioned, he is terrible,wooden,stiff,corpse like. Brook is the films single most reason for appearing dated. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has an original concept of a story set almost entirely aboard a train. It nevertheless knows to keep things going in a fast pace and to keep things interesting at all times. This is also thanks to the many characters that are pleasant in the movie. The much present light humor in this movie also makes this an entertaining one to watch as well. It's a movie in which there is always something happening.But no, not everything in this movie works out as it should and it prevents this movie from being a true classic must-see in my opinion. Basically the core of the movie is that Shanghai Lily and Captain Harvey are still madly in love with each after haven't seen each other for years, before meeting again by coincidence on the Shanghai Express. However the love-story is ridiculously unbelievable, since Clive Brook is too wooden in his performance and Marlene Dietrich is too much of a femme fatale.The movie is further more a good looking one, with especially some nice Oscar winning cinematography. Von Sternberg's movies from the '30's were among the most visionary of the era. It's one of the reasons why he is such a much praised director.Movies in which Josef von Sternberg is directing Marlene Dietrich are always something above the usual, this movie forms no exception to this. They made quite a few movies together in the '30's. Von Sternberg by the way also directed quite some movies with Asian themes in them. He must have really liked the culture and he also seemed to have been inspired by its politics, much to the annoyance of the Chinese government itself, who wanted to ban this movie globallyA real good movie to watch!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A train across China, danger, mystery, interesting characters, and Dietrich looking amazingly beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic romance-thriller, in which a train full of miscellaneous people on their way across China encounter danger, mystery, and transformation of character. Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), aka Madeleine, meets up again with chilly former lover Dr. Donald "Doc" Harvey (Clive Brook), and they push around the old story of their separation. Meanwhile, a certain Mr. Chang (played by Warner Oland, the Swiss-born actor who specialized in "Chinese" parts, especially Charley Chan) turns out to be the rebel leader, halts the train, and holds the passengers, and especially Dr. Harvey, hostage for the return of his number two. Chang forces Madeleine to promise to go away with him in return for sparing Dr. Harvey his sight. Before everything can go completely wrong, the elegant Chinese 1st-Class passenger Hue Fei (Anna May Wong, of course) kills Chang. Doc scorns Madeleine, but led by a minister who had initially ranted about fallen women but recognized Madeleine's heroism and love, he manages at last to declare his love without knowing what happened, as an act of faith. It's a soppy and predictable plot, assuredly, and the stuffed-shirt woodenness of Brooke doesn't help, but several elements make the movie a real pleasure. The supporting cast of character actors is very good, and it's always a pleasure to hear the wry rumbling voice of Eugene Burdette, who plays a travelling salesman and compulsive gambler, a minor part but amusing The photography is outstanding, especially the scene of the train leaving Beijing very slowly, making its way through the crowded, narrow market street with crowds getting out of the way, and a few night scenes as when the crew swing the water pipe out over the engine, and nearly every scene with Dietrich. Students of film technique should study this one to see the magic von Sternberg did with lighting her face. She plays a part not so different from so many of the roles thrown to her and to Garbo, the woman with a history, smooth and self-assured, jaded, powerful, and either doomed or surprised by discovering she has a heart after all. This one has a happy ending. Another bonus?she acts, rather than just standing or moving and letting the camera adore her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jozef Von Sternberg was one of those legendary directors. Marlena Dietrich who is better known for other roles is one of the leading roles in this film. They are all on a train going to Shanghai, China in a time when it was fashionable to take the train on overnight trips. Anyway, she is the "femme fatale" of all time even now. Marlena along with many other travelers that are quite forgettable. I think there was a lady with a dog but I can't be sure since I haven't seen the film in years. This film is an early classic from a time when film-making was new, fresh, and exciting. Now, it's all violence, sex, and vulgarity. Can you imagine somebody like Marlena being an actress today without losing that unforgettable mystique about her? No, you can't because they don't have actresses today who have managed to maintain any sense of mystery without being penalized by the Hollywood system. It's a shame that most of old Hollywood is gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a monument to Marlene Dietrich Josef von Sternberg has made. We first see her backlighted and in shadow entering a train compartment. She's in a long black dress adorned with these black feathers. She pulls down the compartment's curtains so we can't see her at all. The viewer is less enchanted than curious, as in, "Who the hell is this supposed to be?" She's supposed to be Shanghai Lilly, notorious hooker of the China coast. Yes, "It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lilly." Von Sternberg lights her carefully so her facial features seem to be aglow in the darkness. Her wardrobe throughout is indescribable, a congeries of white feathers, gaudy robes, draped dresses, a Chinese silk garment with a design that evokes the rocket-filled sky over Fort McHenry when it was bombarded by the British. And, boy, does she carry around a reputation along with all of her frills. The stiff British army doctor that she once had an affair with treats her with disdain, although she still loves him desperately. And her terpitude shimmers in the veil of her badinage. A haughty old lady informs Dietrich that she runs a respectable boarding house in Shanghai. "Vot kind of a house did you say it vuz?" "A BOARDING house!" replies the snooty old lady. (It's a joke. Dietrich is playing with the expression "bawdy" house.)The other passengers are all ergonomically sketched in. A dodgy German invalid who claims to be dealing in coal but has a finger or two in an opium pie. (He pays for it.) A blubbery American gambler. A mysterious ur-Chinese woman, probably another hooker, wanted by the cops. A huffy reverend out of Somerset Maugham. A French officer who turns out to be a phony.The sets are deliciously Hollywood. The train is going from Beijing to Shanghai but is waylaid by "rebels" led by the half-Chinese Warner Oland, actually a Swede who was later to play Charlie Chan in a couple of features. Oland wants to hold the British doctor, Clive Brook, hostage. When Oland's demand is granted, he's going to release the arrogant doc but not before blinding him with a hot poker. Dietrich dissuades the rebel chief by the simple expedient of agreeing to run away with him. Events intervene and a happy ending follows.Dietrich's acting is measured in pace and deliberately sultry. It comes across as stilted compared to, say, her earlier naturalistic performance in "Der Blaue Engel." But then everyone's performance is overdrawn so hers doesn't stand out as especially artificial.I loved the sets. It's one of those movies that take place in an exotic setting, kind of like "China Seas", so some of the men wear pith helmets, and the rooms are partitioned by gauze curtains. I kept waiting for the beaded curtains but they never made an appearance. Disappointing. I like train movies too. Everything rocks back and forth like a cradle and the ricketing rumble of the iron wheels on the iron tracks sing a lullaby. Everything is crowded together but stable too. After all, what can go wrong on a train? Unless it's stopped and taken over by rag tag rebels?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtakingly beautiful, one of the best movies of the era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all Sternberg films I've seen, this one is probably the best. The plot is not that compelling, but then the same can be said about most films from the period. What makes this one stand out is, first and foremost, the cinematography. Forget Murnau and Lang, forget Vertov and Eisenstein - this is the real deal. Chiaroscuro lighting, silhouettes in the fog, cigarette smoke, and other film noir visual treats? Check. A Kubrick-style shot with long parallel walls? Check. Portraits of women that remind you of Lynch's achingly beautiful "Mulholland Drive"? Check. In a couple of scenes, Dietrich looks more beautiful than any woman you will ever meet. In at least one other, you feel like you're looking at a Renaissance painting.Of course, von Sternberg always had a wonderful eye for visually stunning shots. You can see hints of film noir in the earlier, silent "The Docks of New York", and one of the scenes in "Shanghai Express" is a direct quotation of one from Sternberg's first film, "The Salvation Hunters" (which is, by the way, the first American independent film - to add to Sternberg's influence). But in "Shanghai Express" this tendency reaches new heights. The movie looks and feels like a dream.As for everything else... I thought the acting is OK by the era's standards. You may have a problem with Brook's performance, though. The plot is a simple romantic story - if you're not one of those viewers who expect a twist every 10 minutes, you won't be disappointed (or at least, won't be *too* disappointed). And there is some very nice dialogue thrown in. In other words, I enjoyed the movie and would love to see it again. Even if its entertainment value is not as high as its visual value, it works just fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is one of those classics where the story takes almost entirely second place to the style and atmosphere and it doesn't bother me at all. It still works as well as it can. After countless times I have seen this film I always enjoy immensely watching it again. Somehow this thing refuses to grow old and tiring. It has a dreamy quality that seduces time and again.Sternberg and Dietrich have succeeded to build a timeless piece of Hollywood magic and a fantastically exotic female character. Dietrich performed in movies many memorable femmes, from which parts seemed to stick in her own image as well. But none as memorable as the notorious Shanghai Lily. Not a dull harlot, she obviously has a tremendous sense of humor also. Just look how much she cares about wooden and pompous Clive Brooks' doctor. And those wisecracks!A great supporting cast comes through flags flying as well. Those old people can be a bit annoying and silly but they are also very funny. Anna Mae Wong as a more mysterious femme almost succeeds to steal a scene here and there from Dietrich. And then there is Warner Oland doing one of his eastern military persons. This time luckily without those ridiculous eye jobs he had to wear in General Died at Dawn, which was made four years after this.Am I just imagining or remembering things wrong or do the sets look almost exactly the same here and in General Died at Dawn while the train departs the station at the beginning of both movies? Or is it just that old Hollywood magic gone to my head?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hot Dietrich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marlene Dietrich is Shanghai Lily on the "Shanghai Express" in this 1932 film directed by Josef von Sternberg. Lily and another woman of dubious reputation, Hui Fei (Anna May Wong) are on the train during a civil war, which might hold them up. On the train, Shanghai Lily runs into an old love, a British Army doctor, Dr. Donald Harvey (Clive Brook), who still loves her and she him. Seeing her now and knowing her reputation, can he ever believe she can become a one-man woman? When Chinese guerrillas stop the train, Dr. Harvey is taken as a hostage. Lily then has a choice to make.This film is really a tribute to the fabulous beauty and glamor of Dietrich and the direction of von Sternberg because frankly, I'd have left Dr. Harvey with the guerrillas. Clive Brook was an actor of the stiff upper lip school, and he was unbelievably wooden.Nevertheless, with Warner Oland as Henry Chang, one of the evil Chinese and Eugene Palette as a passenger on the train, this is a very good, highly atmospheric film. But it's Dietrich's show all the way with her incomparable acting, looks, and voice. One of our great screen personalities. A must see for Dietrich fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Selznick famously said that Sternberg's films dealt with ""completely fake people in wholly fake situations" and its absolutely true that we are not watching Josef Von Sternberg's movies for realism - he was a genius of escapism, creating dreamy works that were celebrated for their cinematic magic and beauty. All of his movies with Dietrich have very slim plot line that exist purely to show her celebrated beauty, though I must admit that his meticulous way with filming her makes me wonder why he never worked so successfully with others (he was surely talented enough to make anybody beautiful), in the whole history of cinema I have never seen such obvious admiration and obsession from director towards his star. Was he in love? You bet."Shanghai Express" is actually one of the best movies they made together - its almost pity that it had Dietrich in it, because it has interesting story that could have been made differently and used group of passengers on a train as a point towards adventure/thriller. As the train rushes towards the danger, these random characters could turn movie into "Murder on a Shanghai Express", alas that was not Sternberg's intention - he under uses the talented group of supporting actors just to build a platform for Dietrich and her love interest (incredibly wooden and cranky Clive Brook, who is completely unbelievable as love of her life). Once we understand its not about the adventure story but about camera making love to its main star, we can relax and simply enjoy the movie for what it is. True, Dietrich had a face that would launch a thousands ships and yes, she was one of the cinema's all time greatest beauties, however I must mention Anna May Wong who had such strong screen presence that she almost steals the scenes from Dietrich (and all of this with minimum of script,she hardly says a word). Do not look for realism, secret wisdom or deep meaning in Sternberg/Dietrich movies, they are classy and beautifully filmed escapism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shanghai Express is directed by Josef von Sternberg and written by Jules Furthman (adaptation) &amp; Harry Hervey (story). It stars Marlene Dietrich, Clive Brooks, Anna May Wong, Warner Oland, Eugene Palette and Lawrence Grant. Music is by W. Franke Harling &amp; Rudoplh G. Kopp and cinematography by Lee Garmes.Plot finds Shanghai Lily (Dietrich) meeting up with old flame Donald Harvey (Brooks) aboard the Shanghai Express during the Chinese Civil War in 1931. However, this train has many passengers with secrets to hide, so when some rebels ambush the train, such things as loyalties, friendships, hidden motives and the birthing of legends come to the fore.Stylishly crafted by Sternberg and brisker than the other collaborations with Dietrich, Shanghai Express thrives on atmospheric visuals, strong scripting and a sultry turn from the leading lady. The cramped confines of the train allow Sternberg to dally with trademark shadows, smoke and shafts of light for maximum effect, garnering Garmes an Oscar in the process, while there is deft deadpannery amongst the myriad of intriguing characters.Quality film making on both sides of the camera and also off of the writers desk. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So let's take a look at this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>with its multitude of not overly long exterior train shots that consistently depict the Shanghai Express within a narrow environment that is crammed with people, objects and movement which sets the scene by giving the impression of a heavily populated and somewhat chaotic country as well as, almost in passing, creates a tight atmosphere through light, shadows and uninterrupted takes that shy away from unnecessary edits, an economic approach that is shared by its overall to-the-point dialogue and rather minimalist but effective characterizations as all the characters have their particularities that make them memorable and in a way instantly classifiable.What can be said about this film in which characters behave like they have to spend the rest of their lives together with the other passengers given how everyone seems to communicate with everyone although they are strangers to each other (like that one guy who keeps talking to the Frenchman just to act all annoyed when he responds in a language he doesn't understand), and considering how concerned some of the characters are (especially the older ones) with other people's moral views, taking other people's (moral) business awfully serious and get all worked up emotionally over it, all this intensity could be attributed to the premise of strangers with a common goal being crammed into a small space with danger never being far away, which gives the film a certain end of the world mood that is also supported by its lack of non-in-movie music, only at the end after they arrive at their destination and everyone exited the Shanghai Express it boasts with typical movie music, an ending that seems surprisingly mundane in scale for such a meticulously planned film that during its 80 minute running time does a lot more than just depict a romance between two people?Well, I don't know, I guess I have nothing to say about it, except maybe that it seems to me that Marlene's close-ups are closer than anyone else's and that her wardrobe, especially in the first half of the movie, helps making her look rather imposing with coat collars that together with the close-ups fill out almost every square inch of the frame, something that also fits with the visual theme of having the images crammed with stuff that matters, obliterating everything unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>105: Shanghai Express (1932) - released 2/32/1932, viewed 7/5/08.DOUG: The titular train cruising through civil war-torn China is the setting for this worthy Best Picture nominee. In the seven films they did together, this was Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg's fourth (and possibly best) collaboration. Most of the film is carried by Dietrich's pouting and the exquisite cinematography. Von Sternberg keeps his camera close and the focus soft when it comes to her face. She always has a light above her head to make her hair glow and give her a darkly angelic quality, and she speaks every line with a smoky, darkly veiled accented flirtation. Clive Brook plays Lily's overly square old flame from England. The film boasts a decent ensemble cast who basically shoot the breeze while watching the two lovebirds fight it out. Anna May Wong, in one of the more high-profile roles of her career, is well utilized as Lily's Chinese BFF, Louise Hale plays a prudish boarding house keeper who's generally around to be spooked by Dietrich and Wong's "coasting" antics, and Eugene Palette plays a wisecracking gambler. Swedish character actor Warner Oland manages to come off none the worse for wear as the half-oriental robber baron who takes the passengers hostage. Overall, this is a fine Pre-Code entertainment, which coasts on the strength of its cast and its style more than its story or performances.KEVIN: I gotta say this movie was just plain cool. Definitely Josef Von Sternberg's coolest movie yet, and in a lot of unexpected ways. A well-rounded international ensemble comes together for a sort of Stagecoach-on-a-train scenario in Shanghai. Marlene Dietrich is a perpetual knockout as Shanghai Lily, the local loose woman whose reputation is almost as well traveled as the nasty warlord who also happens to be on the train. Warner Oland is surprisingly effective as the villain. Rather than a rampant scenery-chewing maniac that you might expect from a white guy playing a Chinese guy, Oland's performance is underplayed and very menacing. I imagine Oland is more convincing here playing a half-Chinese man than he was playing Charlie Chan or Fu Manchu. Clive Brook portrays Shanghai Lily's jilted lover and would-be savior. Rather than playing him as chivalrous and romantic, Doc comes off as exceedingly bitter and cynical. But that doesn't mean he won't be there to do the right thing. Anna May Wong plays Lily's oriental counterpart, and even the only major Asian actor gets to be cool in this movie. I am so glad she doesn't have to put on a hammy Chinese accent. There are many other standouts including Eugene Palette and Louise Closser Hale, though they're not as memorable as the cinematography by Lee Garmes and James Wong Howe. All in all this one was definitely worth the wait.Last film viewed: The Smiling Lieutenant (1931). Last film chronologically: Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde (1932). Next film: One Hour With You (1932).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great train adventure marred by Clive Brook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really smashing far eastern train romance-adventure whose romantic half is clobbered and left for dead by the awful, tedious, entirely sour character portrayed by Clive Brook. Sadly, the entire story hinges upon the tumultuous affair between he and Dietrich's "Shanghai Lily." The artifice of their relationship sinks what should have been a classic film, as it is impossible to believe that the high living 'coaster' Shanghai Lily would ever love the pompous stuffed shirt Captain Donald Harvey. (Even if she was once a more proper lady named Madeline!)And it's a shame, because the movie is loaded with great photography, wonderfully detailed shots of the train chugging through "China," an excellent (if entirely stereotyped) cast, and a crisp story and direction. Dietrich and Anna May Wong (as Hui Fei) steal one wonderful shot after another, Dietrich with her fetching, clipped English wafting through billowing cigarette smoke and the plumage of her ornate hats; Wong with her cool humored temperament and truly striking exotic beauty. The dialogue is a occasionally dated (and be forewarned, as racist/sexist as you might expect for the period) but in the hands of Dietrich and Anna May Wong, it's difficult to find much fault with the somewhat trite lines they speak.So mind your way through the dense fields of hokum, and see the film for the ravishing Dietrich and Wong..and oh, yes..the rest of the scenery!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie of Shadows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a long time ago and parts of it really stuck with me, but I couldn't even remember the name until I came across it recently. I think, part of the effect of the movie was the sultry Marlene Dietrich, but what I didn't realize is that this movie is so full of atmosphere and rich in texture that it stays with you no matter who is in it. To be honest, most of the acting in this film is pretty wooden. Dietrich rises above all others with her ability to convey her feelings through the camera. More than anything, this film's look and feel are what really make this film work; and to some degree the lighting and directing aid Dietrich's acting. Joseph Von Sternberg directed this film about a group of passengers traveling via train during a Chinese civil war. The passengers all have their own stories, but none is as interesting as the story of Shanghai Lilly (Dietrich) and her romance with the British officer Captain "Doc" Harvey (Clive Brook). Von Sternberg uses light and shadow to highlight different characters and the character's feelings long before anyone else used this technique to such a large degree. There are marvelous images of Dietrich, Anna May Wong and Warner Oland as a rather mysterious and possibly sinister train passenger that really make this movie click. Film students should be required to see this movie for the simplicity of the story and the complexity of the filming. I'd like to say no scene is wasted, but there are a couple scenes that seemed extraneous. Overall though, this is a classic movie that was way ahead of it's time. I wasn't really familiar with Von Sternberg until I went back and watched this movie again. Now I own the DVD and I watch it periodically to remind myself of Dietrich's allure and Von Sternberg's masterful direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complex Train Adventure Without Number Two Son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering this is 1932, Josef Von Sternbergs Shanghai Express is a masterpiece. It has some camera angles and scenery which are several years ahead of where other film makers were at this time.Marlene Dietrich is outstanding in this film as Shanghai Lily, the woman whose reputation gets in her way. Clive Owen is the heroic Surgeon whose love Lily wants and while his acting is stiff it passes in a talented cast. Warner Oland who did some great acting is outstanding in this one as the heavy Chang. Anna May Wong lights up the screen in a role that is very key to the plot, and in one sequence actually radiates more sensuality than Dietrich.While this is a period piece with stereotypes obviously as Oland would later explore often as Charlie Chan, what sets this above a lot of films of this period is the complexity of it's plot. The plot involves the Express being held up going to Shanghai because of a sensitive diplomatic exchange going on between China and other powers. The players on the Express become pawns in a game of diplomacy &amp; are also at the mercy of the evil Chang.This film is very much worth a look because of the plot and some interesting photography by the director. One major flaw that is easy to spot now is there are several sequences inside the train that obviously are not inside a train at all because while the train noises are there, the set is too stable without the swaying of a moving train. There is one sequence of Dietrich in a hallway where it is obvious behind her there is a stairway to a second floor which could not be on any train.That flaw is out weighed by some of the things like the train station arrival scene which resembles some outstanding train station scenes shot in films years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Dietrich/von Sternberg films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Shanghai Express' is arguably the greatest of the seven films that featured the collaboration of Marlene Dietrich and Josef von Sternberg. More coherent and exciting than 'Blonde Venus', better written and acted than 'The Blue Angel', visually more exciting than 'The Scarlet Empress', and starring a finer cast than any of their other films, 'Shanghai Express' works as a love story, as a comedy, as adventure, and [almost] as a war story. This is the most successful pairing of the two geniuses; in this film, there is no telling where one leaves off and the other begins. Smothered in feathers, laces, leather, and satins, Dietrich's long lean body and superbly lit face dominate the film with an air of poised languor. She masterfully conceals her feral, nocturnal energy beneath a lacquered, bored exterior, so that when she does erupt in a fit of violence it is truly shocking. Von Sternberg ordered the entire cast to mimic the monotonous cadence of the train in their dialogue, giving the long slow opening scenes a dreamy quality of suspension and anticipation. Von Sternberg and Dietrich build tension and excitement, sprinkled with well-placed brilliant comic bits, to a climax that is satisfying and delightful.Like a great novel, this film begins slowly, builds inexorably, and rewards intense scrutiny with the astonishing detail and lavish care invested in it. Far from a 'happy ending', this movie ends with a conquest and a surrender, with a betrayal and with hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If any film combines the glamour of 1930s Hollywood with the gritty underbelly of pre-Code cinema, then Shanghai Express is it. Shot in gorgeous black and white chiaroscuro, SE almost feels proto-noir in its aesthetic. It also exudes great atmosphere; when I think of this movie, I think of Marlene's outrageous outfits, smoke curling in the air, and gunfire echoing in the night.The plot is pure melodrama, with Marlene Dietrich starring as a "fallen woman" in China who encounters her lost love on a train to Shanghai. Clive Brook is the love interest, though he's rather wooden, making you wonder what exactly Marlene sees in him. The talented and beautiful Anna May Wong is given a part with some meat for once, though it unfortunately has "Dragon Lady" overtones. And that's not even getting started with Warner Oland's yellow-face villain out to bribe, murder, and rape, though the film does provide him with some sympathy in that he is of mixed race and thus alienated from both the Chinese and Europeans. Still, do come in warned that this is problematic.A fascinating pre-Code picture. I'd take it over the much glossier MGM all-star epic Grand Hotel any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a film title I had heard a few times, I may have at some point heard the name of the leading actress in it as well, but I was mainly going to watch it because of its inclusion in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, from Oscar nominated director Josef Von Sternberg (The Blue Angel). Basically on the Shanghai Express many of the passengers are aware that notorious Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich) is on board, they seem more concerned about this than the civil war that is occurring and could cause a delay of up to three days for the train journey. Before she became a famous "coaster", or "a woman who lives by her wits along the China coast", Lil was known by British Army doctor Captain Donald 'Doc' Harvey (Clive Brook), he is reunited with her on this journey, he was not previously aware of her reputation, but he was tricked by his former lover five years ago. The Shanghai Express is stopped by the Chinese guerrillas, and Doc is selected as their hostage, Lily saves him, but she has to convince him that she has not changed in five years and is still the same woman he fell for, it is in the end when the train finally reaches its destination that he does acknowledge his love for her. Also starring Anna May Wong as Hui Fei, Warner Oland as Mr. Henry Chang, Eugene Palette as Sam Salt, Lawrence Grant as Reverend Mr. Carmichael, Louise Closser Hale as Mrs. Haggerty, Gustav Von Seyffertitz as Eric Baum and Emile Chautard as Major Lenard. Dietrich over time has become an iconic star with many iconic images and unforgettable performances, I cannot deny that she is great as the notorious hooker on the train, but I agree Brook is a complete plank with his wooden performance as her love interest, and to be honest I couldn't really follow as much as I probably should have, it had some good love story bits and one or two thrills, but overall I don't know if I can agree with four stars out of five, I may watch it again one day I'm not sure, but for now I see it as a watchable romantic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Picture. Good!</fullReview>

"Doc" Harvey, that would have been cut to as little as three seconds if the Hayes code were in effect.The movie has to do with a train traveling from Beiping to Shanghai through Chinese rebel territory during the Chinese Civil War. On the train are a whole bunch of interesting characters including Shanghai Lily &amp; British "Doc" Harvey. As it turned out "Doc" and Lily had been lovers some eight years ago in China until Lily pulled a fast one, in trying to get "Doc" jealous by flirting with another man, on him. That had "Doc" head for the hills or his country of origin Great Britain heartbroken and very depressed. With the two ex-lovers now reunited It's "Doc" who plays hard to get in Lily wanting to resume their former relationship. **MAJOR SPOILER** What soon happens on the train will change "Doc's" opinion of Lily by her offering herself up as a sex toy for rebel leader and phony Eurasian businessman Mr. Henry Chang, Warren Oland. That noble effort by Lily was in order for her to save "Doc's" life as well as eyesight! Mr.Chang or General Chang blows his cover as a train passenger when his "Main Man" on board rebel spy Li Fung, Minoru Nishida,got caught in a Government sting and taken prisoner. Seeing "Doc's" value as a negotiating chip Chang holds him hostage in order to trade "Doc" in for Li Fung. "Doc" doesn't help his cause by belting Gen. Chang when he started grouping Shangahai Lily in his private compartment knocking Chang flat on his behind. Feeling insulted and humiliated Change still held off from offing "Doc" in order to get his #1 spy Li Fung released in exchange. Still fuming from what "Doc" did to him Chang plans to release "Doc" alive in exchange for Li Fung but have his eyeballs burned out for "dising" him! Lily seeing what Change is planning to do to her long lost lover offers herself up to him as his personal concubine in her effort to save "Doc"s" sight!***SPOILERS*** Things turn in "Doc" and Lily's favor when fellow coaster or loose woman Anna May Wong,Hui Fei,takes matters into her own hands by sneaking up on Gen. Chang and stabbing him to death before he can have his orders carried out. It was Hui Wong whom Chang raped earlier in the film and now with his back both turned and exposed to her Chinese dagger Hui Fei ran him through and put an end to his dreams of conquests both in him taking over China and and having Lily all to himself. "Doc" who all this time thought that Lily didn't give a Chinese noodle about him finds out from fellow train passenger Reverand Carmichael, Lawrence Grant, that she in fact was willing to give up her "honor" to save him. It's then that "Doc" finally realizes just what a snook he was in rejecting Lily's advances, as disguised as they are, towards him.The end of the film has both "Doc" &amp; Lily embracing in the crowded Shanghai train station not caring, among the hundreds of people there, who notices them as if the two were there alone all by themselves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Sternberg's vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having seen it in a while, we were interested in watching this 1932 film again. The copy that was shown on TCM, recently, was a good excuse to get reacquainted again. Josef Von Sternberg was reunited, once again, with a star that owed him perhaps her career. Marlene Dietrich was at an interesting point in the American cinema. The transition was almost seamless from her native Germany to Hollywood, where she became perhaps a bigger star than she ever was in her native country.Mr. Von Sternberg was, above all, a stylist that had a great eye in which to set his stories. Just by watching the camera angles in the film, even the most casual viewer will notice the artistry which this man brought to the finished product. Mr. Von Sternberg was generous to his leading lady as he bathed her in an aura of mystery and romance that worked well in Ms. Dietrich's way of acting. The film is dominated by Marlene Dietrich's presence, and rightly so, because it was clearly a vehicle designed for her. For the director, setting the mood and a style were more important than the narrative, which based on the story of Harry Hervey and the screenplay of Jules Furthman, does not make too much sense for a good story.What does not work with the film is the stiff presence of Clive Brook. The actor showed almost no chemistry with Marlene Dietrich. Their involvement appears to be contrived because he does not project much as the man he is supposed to be, consumed by a passion that never died. Now meeting Magdalen on the train, one could have expected fireworks between them, but alas, it was not be seen in the picture. One of the things that will appall viewers of this film for the first time, is the way acting was done in that era just a few years after the arrival of the 'talkies'. For having the excellent cast that was put together for the movie, the director did not get the best of the likes of Anna May Wong, Eugene Palette, Warner Oland and the rest of the supporting players.Mr. Von Sternberg was more successful with the technical aspect of the film because of the work of Lee Garmes, with the uncredited James Wong Howe clearly helping to enhance the way the audience perceived the movie. "Shanghai Express" shows how a genial Mr. Von Sternberg could have used San Bernardino's train station and made us believe were in China!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shanghai Lili becomes Madeleine again.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of Sternberg's "Shanghai" movies -the second one being "the Shanghai gesture" which I have a tendency to rate a little higher than the 1932 work:it has not Dietrich,but it does have Gene Tierney".The beginning of the movie is absolutely excellent: the depiction of the station,a station,which,like Mother Glin Sing's night club in "Gesture" is anything but realistic:it's a studio China,and that's why these movies are so fascinating.The travelers,the sacred cows ,the crowd ,Marlene Dietrich's extravagant wardrobe,all this give Sternberg's movie its incredible atmosphere.Like Dudley Nichols' "Stagecoach",Harry Hervey's story was certainly influenced by Guy De Maupassant's short story "Boule De Suif" :a group of travelers who cannot continue their way to Shanghai and who could ,if you paid the price my dear;besides,for the well-meaning bourgeois ,particularly the owner of the boarding-house where they serve Yorkshire pudding ,Shanghai Lili represents the Devil.A French military man is lost because he doesn't speak English,but Lili comes to his rescue:like her character,Marlene Dietrich was fluent in French .Essential viewing ,like "scarlet empress" "Shanghai gesture" "Morocco" ,of course "das Blaue Engel " ,to name but four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Dietrich film is a must for her fans...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A train ride through exotic China during a Civil War and involving a trainload of disparate passengers is the stuff for Josef von Sternberg to turn into a showcase for his favorite star, MARLENE DIETRICH. Never has he captured the Dietrich magic the way he has here, featuring her as Shanghai Lil, a notorious woman viewed with suspicion by the other passengers--a motley bunch if ever there was one--and engaged in a love affair with CLIVE BROOK (the only bad performance) in his typical wooden style.The photography by Lee Garmes won an Oscar, crisply detailed B&amp;W images captured in shadow and light and capturing all the bustling activity and atmosphere of a very colorful story.Aside from Dietrich's feisty and alluring performance as the dazzling Shanghai Lil, the cast includes ANNA MAY WONG, EUGENE Palette and WARNER OLAND as the cruel war lord who meets a cruel fate.Probably the high point of Dietrich's collaboration with von Sternberg and well worth viewing.Trivia note: Excuse the spelling of Eugene's name. For some reason, my software leaves out the double "l" in his surname.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No film created in 1932 can be separated from its historical relevance, no matter how classic the cinematic values. Talking pictures had only just been invented, and color was years away. Everything in cinema at that time was either experimental (innovations in lighting, multiple cameras, location shooting) or an extension of traditional stage drama.To talk, therefore, about things like stock characterization or racial stereotyping is to create anachronistic straw men in an attempt to change history. It would make more sense instead to try to place what happened either on the set or in the world at large together in one bag. One cannot understand or appreciate the contributions of larger-than-life figures like von Sternberg or Dietrich without contrasting this film with their "Der Blaue Engel" of only two years previous (yet light years away from this production in terms of contemporaneous world events).In the same vein, anyone unacquainted with or uninterested in such ancient historical facts as why these Germans had recently moved to Hollywood would do well to sample disparate films made either just before or just after this one like "All Quiet on the Western Front," "Rain," or "Flying Down to Rio" in order to get the feel of what appealed to audiences then as well as how fictional characters were created. For example, compare Dietrich's Lil to Joan Crawford's role in "Rain." I am reminded when reading some of these comments of something said to me by my nephew's rather ditzy wife some years ago when I was admiring a finely restored Model A at a car show, "But why did people in 1932 want to drive such an OLD car?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovestruck camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The highest grossing film in America for that year. One can see why; international intrigue and adventure in exotic China, then the set of real conflict, dangers from these, high contrasts, old loves fatefully rekindled, a sultry Dietrich. Her above all.We know it now because it was Sternberg filming Dietrich, as part of that oeuvre. He was filming like he was making love to her, that love trickles across the screen, a kind of spiritual devotion.So one reason to watch these films is always our placement in the cinematic world in such ways that we are seduced with the men around her. The Blue Angel worked the best, because it hinged on us investing in the same feverish fantasy as the man who went broke for her. She was elusive in that film, teasing from behind the stage. Another reason, deeply woven with the above, is the highly artificial movie world envisioned by Sternberg so that it abets the fact that it is a Hollywood dream we are watching, structured around this woman acting. Here a studio backlot China.This one in particular, however, lacks a more pervasive perspective. A lovestruck camera is not enough. So even though Sternberg was a powerful poet with a camera, capable of sublime splendors, and was savvy enough to understand that a film works deeper when imbued and consonant with rhythms and atmospheres from the world it reflects, here the film itself a train journey, spaces always tight, our gaze narrow, motions claustrophobic, the film remains a superb frame let down by disarmingly simple filler. Finer implications that would involve us watching are not teased.Oh, it's a story no more harmless or ineffective than most films from old Hollywood; but precisely because the wrap-around is so potent, it disappoints doubly with what might have been.The whole notion of Dietrich in her seductive aloofness as Shanghai Lily was so heady and pervasive at the time, it was borrowed for the Busby Berkeley musical Footlight Parade; a film about the efforts to stage a film, with this Shanghai dream about a sailor, the maker of the film, searching for his old flame Lily potent enough in itself to seduce love out of the participants outside the dream.As a primary text of the stuff that defined Hollywood it's great, but needs annotation like Footlight's for me to work. I suggest you watch and imagine a better film out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Train in Vain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the train from Peking to Shanghai during the Chinese Civil War poses problems for beautiful Marlene Dietrich (as Magdalen) and accompanying passengers. Ms. Dietrich, who renders her "services" as "Shanghai Lily", unexpectedly encounters five year old flame Clive Brook (as Donald "Doc" Harvey) aboard. Their chance to rekindle old romance is complicated by both her past and the encroaching war, which eventually infiltrates the train.Josef von Sternberg's "Shanghai Express" is a very good-looking production. Von Sternberg and photographer Lee Garmes go overboard in scene setting, with Dietrich's stunning model of fashion almost distracting from the storyline - it's style over substance. Performances range from stilted readings to expressive characterizations; Eugene Palette (as Sam Salt)'s American gambler is a fine example of the latter, with others always amusing. Dietrich and Anna May Wong (as Hui Fei) provide especially good eye candy. ******* Shanghai Express (2/2/32) Josef von Sternberg ~ Marlene Dietrich, Clive Brook, Anna May Wong</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brook derails express.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the lesser Von Sternberg Dietrich teamings Shanghai Express has an excellent look (lensed by Lee Garmes and James Wong Howe) but chugs ponderously along with an ultra reserved performance from Clive Brook that stops the film in its tracks. A train bound for Shanghai during the Chinese Civil War uncomfortably re-unites former lovers Doc Harvey (Brook) and the notorious Shanghai Lil (Dietrich). Along the way a war lord (Warner Oland) and his band of brigands way lay the train and take Harvey hostage. To gain his release Lil decides to sacrifice herself.How the stiff Harvey and the sultry Lil could have ever hooked up in the first place is the films biggest mystery and fault. Clive for most of the film borders on the effete official Graham Chapman played on the Python series while the seductive Marlene, ravishingly photographed as usual by Sternberg is clearly too much woman for Brook. Von Sternberg's habit of sacrificing story in favor of Dietrich's allure at least had Gary Cooper (Morrocco, Dishonored) to balance screen magnetism or an actor the stature of Herbert Marshall capable of being convincingly vulnerable where Brook is merely a fleshed out version of Dudley Doright.On board the express we have the usual assortment of pompous hypocrites, elitists and neophytes new to adventure getting their clichés punched but also the enigmatic presence of Anna Mae Wong who adds to the films eroticism and capable of distracting the viewer from Marlene. Oland's war lord is also a highlight but Brook in the male lead makes this choo choo film the little engine that couldn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Did All Those Feathers Come From</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of fuss about this picture. But all the fine photography, excellent staging, and first-rate production values can't make up for the banal love story. Will respectable British army doctor forgive former love Dietrich for being, shall we say, not too picky in her choice of male companionship. The movie is rather reminiscent of the Western classic Stagecoach so viewers shouldn't be too surprised by the outcome. However the Wayne-Trevor pairing remains a whole lot more affecting than the stagey Dietrich and stodgy Brook. Then too, Ford knew how too tell a story without hammering the audience with Madonna-like close-ups that may accentuate Dietrich's sculpted features, but do nothing for the drama.No, I can't really warm up to the movie. In my view it represents an empty triumph of style over content-- Sternberg would have made a first-rate fashion photographer but little else. Note the uninspired acting as the characters play out their stereotypes in wooden fashion. The script doesn't help in that regard, yet the director gives no evidence of wanting to transcend the stock characters. Sure, there's a humane message at the screenplay's core-- the doctor needs to give up his stiff-backed ideals and realize that social mores are too abstract to appreciate the individual. But the inherent tension of that relationship never really develops and had me wishing for a Nicolas Ray who could have brought out the human element that's otherwise lurking around somewhere.On the plus side-- this may be the busiest movie ever made. China was and is the world's most populous country. Sternberg apparently took that to heart by hiring just about every extra in Hollywood for the depot scenes. Note how people keep passing realistically alongside the principals as they conduct their business. Also, the tracking shots alongside the train create both atmosphere and a vivid sense of place. Without doubt, Sternberg was a visual artist with a strong sense of mise-en-scene. But while that may be enough to beguile many, it can't cover up the other deficiencies that fall far short of a masterpiece.</fullReview>

The group is stopped by rebels and it turns out that Warner Oland, on board the train, is a rebel leader. He is quite good in the film as well as the gentleman who portrays the pastor.The film is essentially a love story between a wayward woman, Dietrich, and a doctor who are reunited after 5 years. She agrees to go with Oland so that the doctor will escape a terrible fate for hitting the rebel leader.Anna May Wong is a mystery woman in the cast. With those glaring eyes, she is essentially up to no good, but she depicts a fallen woman without emotion here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers on a Train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHANGHAI EXPRESS (Paramount, 1932), under the direction by Josef Von Sternberg with a star-studded cast headed by protégé, Marlene Dietrich, is a story set on a train where passengers gather together for a journey from Peking to Shanghai that gets attacked by rebels fighting a civil war during its destination. The passengers include an assortment of strangers from different walks of life who would soon become involved with each other while being taken hostage. The people include: Henry Chang (Warner Oland), a Eurasian merchant; Sam Salt (Eugene Palette), a gambler; Mrs. Haggerty (Louise Closser Hale), a dowager who runs a boarding house in Shanghai traveling with her little dog, Waffles; Eric Baum (Gustav Von Seyffertitz), a dope-smuggling invalid; Mr. Carmichael (Lawrence Grant), a missionary; Colonel Lenard (Emile Chautard), a discharged French officer wearing his uniform so not to have his sister learn of his disgrace; Hue Fei (Anna May Wong), an American Chinese girl with a questionable reputation as with the infamous Madeleine, known to all as "Shanghai Lily" (Marlene Dietrich), and Captain Donald Harvey (Clive Brook), a British officer in the Medical Corps on his way to treat a patient who happened to have been Madeleine's lover five years ago. After Chinese rebels attack the train, it is learned that one of the passengers happens to be their leader with a reward for his capture. As the passengers are each being held for questioning by the head man, it is Sam Salt who places his wager whether or not they will come out of this alive.A very involved 80 minute story with some great technology of super imposing camera effects, lighting and shadows, quite commonly used in many Von Sternberg productions. The Von Sternberg style where he has his actors giving low-key performances is also his trademark. Who could forget Dietrich's manner of slow speaking when she tells Donald Harvey (Clive), "It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily." With this being Dietrich's fifth under Von Sternberg's direction, SHANGHAI EXPRESS became their only collaboration for which it earned an Academy Award nomination as Best Picture. Although it didn't win, it did get an award for best photography by Lee Garmes. Had there been a supporting actor category, Eugene Palette might possibly had been honored as well for his scene stealing performance. All others in the cast are good, too, but Clive Brook acting style comes across as a bit dull. As for Dietrich, she performs her task well as a tough but good-natured prostitute who at one point prays for the first time in years for the life of someone to be spared other than herself. Aside from some noticeably numerous costume changes throughout the train trip, Dietrich leaves a lasting impression with her closeup with dark surroundings as she nervously smokes her cigarette while listening to the sounds of the wheels of the train rolling over the tracks.SHANGHAI EXPRESS, which is close to being forgotten today in spite of its great theatrical success in 1932, was distributed to video cassette in 1993 as part of its Marlene Dietrich Collection, and, a decade later, onto DVD. Cable television revivals were limited in recent years, having been shown on Turner Classic Movies from 2003 to 2004. It should be noted the there was also a remake, PEKING EXPRESS (Paramount, 1951) starring Joseph Cotten and Corinna Calvet. For a ride to remember, all aboard the Shanghai Express. (***)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of what went wrong with Dietrich's career under Sternberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The black and white cinematography in this movie is often beautiful. Other than that, this is a largely forgettable venture, and a good example of how Dietrich's Hollywood career was sabotaged, unintentionally, by her regular director, Joseph Sternberg.The premise of this movie, while not original - a group of people on a long-distance train ride - could have led to something much better. But1. other than Dietrich and Eugene Palette, Sternberg gave most of the other roles to uninteresting actors and actresses, who didn't do much with their parts.2. the script is very weak. Other than Dietrich's part, the other characters are never developed as interesting people.3. the directing, while fine for atmosphere, does nothing to develop the other characters or create any sense of suspense.In short, you get the feeling that Sternberg felt he could get by for 90 minutes with just presenting a beautiful and intriguing woman, Dietrich, in often outlandish costumes and striking lighting. While I very much like Dietrich, that is not enough to make for an interesting movie. Perhaps an interesting silent film, where effective visual images counted for more - at least to some audiences. But it doesn't work as a good sound picture.A shame. Dietrich deserved better, and could have done more with better.Also: Another example of a Dietrich-Sternberg movie with a weak leading man. After Gary Cooper in Morocco, which is a much more interesting movie, Sternberg paired Dietrich with a series of uninteresting, weak men. As a result, there is no chemistry between them, and certainly no sparks. This, too, deprives the movie of a chance of holding its audience. When, at the end of this series of movies directed by Sternberg, Dietrich goes back to appearing opposite strong leading men, such as James Stewart in Destry Rides Again, she will go back to giving much more interesting performances in much better movies, leading to what is probably her finest movie role, opposite Charles Laughton, in Witness for the Prosecution, a performance that leaves us realizing what she could have been doing for all those largely wasted years between Morocco and Destry.</fullReview>
