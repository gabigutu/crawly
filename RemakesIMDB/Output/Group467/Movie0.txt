		<shortDescription>Still a Solidly Wonderful Fantasy After Sixty-Plus Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the boy thief of Bagdad (as it was once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of "Thief of Bagdad," to less imposing, more recent attempts. The best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. Those effects still work their charm.No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt. Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.)Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. Still, I don't think anyone under eight ought to see "Thief of Bagdad."This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. It was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them."Thief of Bagdad" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best "Arabian Nights" film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the genre of "Arabian Nights" films were silly, cheesy, low-budget things, like "The Prince Who Was A Thief" starring Tony Curtis as an Arabian prince with a Brooklyn accent. This is an exception: A genuinely magical film, one of the best fantasy films ever made.A beautiful film made in the most glowing of technicolors, it tells the simple story of a boy thief (Sabu) meeting a dethroned prince (the gorgeous John Justin), and helping him defeat the wonderfully evil usurper Conrad Veidt. Like "The Wizard of Oz" made the year before, the performances are so good that you believe in what you see on the screen. Flying carpets and horses, towering genies, dancing idols, it all seems perfectly believable and exiting. A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thief of Bagdad" is impressive in the shape of the evil magician Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). He plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young King Ahmad, and a gorgeous princess from her father...He falls victim in the end, as all tyrants do (in books and legends) to love and of the common man whom he ignored, here embodied by the little thief (Sabu).The armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms...The script is poetic, simply and very beautiful... The costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds, attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror...The radiant hero wears white turbans and robes, and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues...For spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before, while through its use of color, it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before...With flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant genie (excellently played by Rex Ingram), with evil wizards, and with the good acting of Sabu and Veidt, "The Thief of Bagdad" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian Nights... The 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gosh, it's colourful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the Arabian Nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (It must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first.) Like the Arabian Nights it tries to cram as many Middle-Eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work. A freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ... I don't know why it all works, but it does. Everything is just so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is especially beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being Hungarian in a Persian way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movies appeal to both adults and children.This one does .Although there are three directors,it is most likely Michael Powell who's the brains here,his later work proves it in a definite way.There are already the incredible color search and the fabulous settings which will emerge again in such works as "a matter of life or death"(1946).Magic is everywhere and there are plenty of visual strokes of inspiration :every picture is magic itself.The script writers adapt stories from the Thousand and one Nights but make them their own .The special effects ,although absolutely extraordinary for 1940,remain tasteful ,which is not often the case today when they mainly serve to hide the weakness of the screenplays.Conrad Veidt is a delightful villain,who might have inspired Walt Disney for "Aladdin" .June Deprez,whose talent is essentially decorative ,will play the part of Vera Claythorne in "and then there were none" (René Clair,1945).Sabu is certainly one of the best young actors of the era. John Justin is the perfect virtuous hero.Compares favorably to Jean Cocteau's "la Belle et la B?te" (1945).Remake by Arthur Lubin with muscle man Steve Reeves in 1961:although it's a far cry from this version,it's not bad .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Historical Treasure, And Good Family Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure. First and foremost, it is a good story. Though my four children's primary exposure to this tale, the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights, comes from the Disney Corporation, the Thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end. The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal, judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say, "He's c-u-t-e!" In 1940, the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, those effects seem very dated ("Look, it's Barbie flying through the air," declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying). Yet they fit into the story well. The film is, after all, over 60 years old. The effects fit with the script. Furthermore, what ones sees in The Thief of Bagdad remained pretty much state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years. One need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In that, it was quite an achievement.This qualifies as a family film, though there are a few stabbings near the end. The acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation.All in all, a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STUNNING DVD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first discovered Alexander Korda's (1940) Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in. True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950's. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the M-G-M DVD (3 Dec 2002) issue. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!! It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once, I watched it a second time. The only "Extras" are a Spanish Dubbed version, Sub-Titles in both English &amp; Spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now, one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation) will soon follow on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly "A Remant From The Golden Age"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An utterly beautiful film, one of a handful of I saw when young that entranced me then and still do, in Thief's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time. By the '90's my daughter and I had seen it many times on TV but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema ? when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and Miklos Rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again.Idealistic Prince Ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out, but evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne. After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu, Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love ? along the way they have many adventures (although apparently not enough for Sabu!) and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything. The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940, but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action ? but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later. Anyway, if I'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects! Favourite bits: the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Hall's suitably romantic song; the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend ? in fact, the stunning colours throughout; Sabu and Rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale. Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever, this and Casablanca, and then died. John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers, both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted, but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions: only pure love mattered.There's a couple of mildly violent images in it, but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100% positive message, it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer. One of my Top 10 film favourites, I can't recommend this too much ? may it be shown to the end of Time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is magic in the number three...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three flash-backs introduce the main characters (Abu, Jaffar, and the Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; three are the songs, each linked to those same characters. Three times does Ahmad pronounce the absolute word 'Time', in his declaration of love to the Princess, answering her three questions at their first of three meetings. So strong is the impression he causes, that the Princess will resist the three attempts by Jaffar to conquer her - by three successive ploys: deceit, hypnosis, and memory erasing. Yet, Jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword. Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical-horse, the Genie, and the The Genie and the magic carpet. The Genie offers three wishes to Abu at their first of three encounters; three times does the Genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges, and three are his considerations about human frailty, before he departs. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards, giant-spider, and giant-octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future, the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess, and the bow-and-arrow to execute Jaffar. There's magic in the number three, and there is magic in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer.As Europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames, Sir Alexander Korda's London Films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Replete with swords &amp; sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It also is a fine piece of film making, featuring good acting and an intelligent script.Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boyish Thief, Sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed &amp; action.The rest of the cast do fine work. John Justin is both energetic &amp; sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when he's not transformed into a dog) but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the film, massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film's screen play &amp; dialogue). Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer.The film was begun in Britain, but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites &amp; pinks.*************************Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and set before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the one great exception. His final movie, Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive fairy tale of good prince and thief versus evil vizier full of fantastic elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an Oriental fantasy about ¨thousand and one Arabian nights¨ plenty of incredible adventures, fantasy witchery and wizardly. The malignant vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt)with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdad(attractive John Justin)who loses his throne, then he escapes thanks a little thief named Abu(sympathetic Sabu). They arrive Basora where Ahamad and the princess(gorgeous June Duprez) fall in love. But prince and thief are haunted by Jaffar , Ahamd is turned blind and Abu is become a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring, a flying mechanic horse, magic bow, flying carpet and of course the colossal genie(overacting performed by Rex Ingram) who gives three wishes to Sabu , the magic eye, the figure of goddess Kali with several hands, among others.This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. Produced by London Fim's Alexander Korda and directed by the definitively credited Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson also dialogs writer and actor as Sultan fond to mechanic games. The WWII outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting, then the three Korda brothers and collaborators traveled USA continuing there the filming in especial on Grand Cannon Colorado.The splendid visual and glimmer Technicolor cinematography , setting and FX provoked the achieving three Oscars : Production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda ,Cinematography by George Perinal and Special effects by Osmond Borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn-out. Furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa. This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 60 some odd years THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is still one of the mostwondrous movies ever made. Filmed in wartime England and without theuse of digital imagry, the film soars and makes believers of us all.From Rex Ingram's memorable Genie, (has any laugh been better than hisrumbling "BoohooHAHAHAH"?) to the Flying Horse, the six armed murderousdoll, the immense spider and on and on, the film excites in a visceralway that no FX person could duplicate today. Though we can see throughthe primitive special effects, the genius of this film is that the storyis told so well that we suspend our disbelief and fly along on a magiccarpet ride that never flags for all of its almost two hour runningtime. Miles Malleson's script (he also plays the heroine's father in adelightful turn), is filled with what we now see as cliches, but theystill bring a silly grin to our faces as we acknowledge them, and lovethem all the same. The acting is WAY over the top and absolutely delightful. Sabu isperfect as the little thief Abhou, John Justin stalwart as the heroAhmed, Conrad Veidt all snarly and despicable as the evil Jafar and JuneDuprez all gauzy and creamy as the princess. The real star of the film, the glue that holds all the piecestogether,however, has to be Miklos Rozsa whose musical score evokesevery Arabian Nights fantasy that we have ever dreamed. What gloriousmusic, what a wondrous fim! (I was lucky enough to get an advance copyof the new DVD of THIEF OF BAGDAD. What a great print. Wait till yousee it! It will knock your socks off.)

		<fullReview>This film, was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that, unlike some other films I liked in that period The Thief of Bagdad has held on to it's quality while I grew up. This is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children, it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well. The only drawback there is, is that one can not see past the ?bad' effects (compared to the effects nowadays) like one could when one was a child. I remembered nothing of those effects, of course it had been about ten years since I'd seen this film, when I was about eleven years old. Who then watches effects? One only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides. In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. Coming to think of it I feel like the Indiana Jones films are quite a like this film. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern, it succeeds in not being dusty and old. All of that is mainly due to the great story, the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors. In that department Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. Great film and although an 'oldie', definitely a ?goldie'. I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD someday.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away by it's sheer fantasy content. I am a fan of fantasy anyway, and for a film of this time (1940) I was impressed by Alexander Korda's ability to completely immerse one so completely in the story. I believe that during the war-time period these films were especially important for a lot of people in order to distract them, in a positive way, and allow them a brief respite from the harsh realities and depressing aspects of the war. I think that this film had probably fit the bill at that time and even nowadays, it does take you away from the everyday and allows you to indulge in a wonderful tale of fantasy, romance, magic, throughout. June Duprez was stunning and otherworldly in her looks and performance. John Justin played a wonderfully enchanting Ahmed, although I found Sabu's character a bit tedious at times, the rest of the movie, for it's time, was top-notch. A great escapist, put your feet up and enjoy the afternoon, movie. I give it a 7.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect fairytale fantasy in gorgeous British technicolor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most enjoyable fantasies of all time (with flying horses, flying carpets, dancing idols, daring escapes) is given even more dimension by the performance of Conrad Veidt as the villainous Jaffar. He is the perfect embodiment of a fairytale villain and gives the film the extra punch it needs.June Duprez has never been more beautifully photographed as the princess and John Justin and Sabu do well as the prince and thief (respectively) who have to settle a score with Conrad Veidt. All of it is handsomely costumed and photographed in the subdued technicolor common to British films at the time (which has a washed out look in some sections of the video print I own).Filmed under harsh wartime conditions, it nevertheless managed to win three Academy Awards for Special Effects, Color Cinematography and Color Art Direction. An enjoyable treat for young and old.One has to wonder what Universal might have done with this story material if produced for their co-starring team of Maria Montez and Jon Hall.</fullReview>

He set the bar very high...I watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it. This film is an adventure for all ages..no-one too old to enjoy it. The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time...I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.S. was just about to enter WWII. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying "evilness" a few years later in "Casablanca." And Korda teamed up,I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers"....great film-making!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wondrous Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.Budget costs happen in US films too, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there. But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon. He certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the UK. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best art&amp;set direction for a color film, and best special effects. Only Miklos Rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez. This was Veidt's career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star. Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features. Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant. Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today. It's an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably well.It was filmed in England (nowhere near Morocco) in studios and on a few beaches. At the outbreak of war, everything was moved to America and some scenes were filmed in the Grand Canyon.Notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - "I want to be a bandit, can't you understand it". It remains a favourite of many people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is an original and authentic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the Jinn I guess. As any kid would be, I was delighted with the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film. Several years later, I realized how much of the satire and wit of the script I had missed on that first viewing. I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years. In addition to the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the storyteller at his very best. When you see Thief as a child you know that you`ve had a great time. When you see Thief as an adult you know that you`ve seen a masterpiece. It`s as timeless as the story it treats. An amazing work.Thomas McCarthy</fullReview>

There are Unforgettable parts in this film like the big spider fight between Abu and the spider, and then there was the magic carpet ride at the end. The most rememberable character is The Genie. I really loved that Genie especially when you and Abu first meet him.

		<fullReview>The story-line of "The Thief of Bagdad" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together. The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas. He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffar's deeds and hate him. He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief. The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra. There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by. Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. Then he is captured. When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog. Jaffar then asks for the Princess's hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra. The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog. The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. He does awaken her. She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard. She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmad's sight and turn Abu back into a thief. The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island. Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. For freeing him, he gets three wishes. His first is for sausages. In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death. Abu makes a second wish, to find Ahmad. The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the All-Seeing eye. Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess's statue. Abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees Ahmad in a canyon. He has the genie take him to Ahmad. Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. She smells a flower and forgets everything at once. Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad. Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the 'eye'. Abu finds himself in the "Land of Legend", where the old men who rule want to make him their king. He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess. The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution. Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him. Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be. This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda. The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography. The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating. The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong, Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes. The production, apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors, I claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar. Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima, and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan. As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role. This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also. Its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements. This is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thief of Bagdad is truly advanced for its time. It has very good special effects. The use of flying carpet sequences is very advanced for 1940. In good prints the color is spectacular. The acting is somewhat stilted, but acceptable for a period piece. Both costume and set design are superior. The music is excellent. Most elements of the film fit together to provide a superior piece of "fluff" entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a favorite of my childhood - I can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time. Now that I'm grown up and have a kid of my own, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We watched it last Friday, and he liked it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine - he was genuinely scared. "Is he gonna beat the spider, Poppa?" Just watch, you'll see. He has no historical frame of reference to speak of (eight years old), so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid might as well be Oz under Ozma.I think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring-do were perpetrated by the boy-thief, and not the grown-up king. In fact, if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit, the king is the thief's sidekick, not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying to imaginative, adventurous young boys. It's definitely a period piece - I suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve, my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the Princess? Because the narrative demands it." The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the clueless, love-struck deposed king is equally improbable. But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty-foot genies and the Temple of the All-Seeing Eye would be fatuous in the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous, as is the final shot of Abu triumphantly flying away on his (stolen) magic carpet, seeking "some fun, and adventure at last!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic fantasy that still has magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special.If you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the film. They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers.I've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this film dwells, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing. Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting. It doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it.Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eyes Have It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thief of Bagdad" reminds us that our perceptions of the world are challenged by those few film artists who know how to make movies properly. A great director is one who instinctively imposes his vision on us, and as a result, our way of observing the commonplace is transformed into something singularly akin to the artist's. We can never observe certain people and places or things in quite the same way again. Michael Powell was one of only a handful of "cinemagicians" who could affect us in such a deeply visceral way. And though two other directors are listed in the credits (not including Alexander and Zoltan Korda, who also took their turns behind the camera), it is Powell more than anyone else who is responsible for the film's overall look, mood, and tone. "Thief of Bagdad" is an Arabian Nights romance, interspersed with light comic moments and spiced up with a flying mechanical horse, a magic carpet, a scary 60-foot tall genie (played with magnificent aplomb by Rex Ingram), a Sultan with a childish fascination for lifelike toys (Miles Malleson, who also wrote the script), and a demonic Grand Vizier named Jaffar.Conrad Veidt makes this last character particularly nasty. He skulks about the edge of the scenery, plotting to manipulate the way other characters perceive him. He has a particularly special hankering for the Sultan's beautiful princess (June Duprez). He uses his Evil Eye to blind his rival, the young king Ahmad (John Justin), and to transmogrify the Thief, Abu (played by the young Indian, Sabu) into a dog. Thus the theme of perception and the ways in which one's perception can be altered is recognized through the re-current motif of circular representations--most memorably in the round center of the giant spider web through which the insect-monster perishes after Abu has bravely defeated it in battle. Indeed, the film's opening is a slow tracking shot of the bow of Jaffar's ship. As the camera moves in closer, we see a giant painted eye on the ship's prow. Thus, Powell clues us in early as to what he and the writer Malleson have in mind: something more than child's play for the Odeon circuit.However, "Thief of Bagdad" has its playful moments too. Sabu, one of the least pretentious actors ever, is a delight as Abu, the film's title character. His thievery is itself artful. Yet he steals as a means of survival -- as when he cons a street vendor into serving him free honey for his pancake. Abu knows that if he is ever trapped by his own mischief, he'll always find a way out. He represents the anarchist/prankster in all of us: he outsmarts everyone in the film, including the Genie who threatens to stomp him into a human pancake. It is chiefly because of his anarchic spirit that it is he--and not the handsome, romantic hero Ahmad--who should be the character to dispose of the villain Jaffar in the end.The film features a few songs, only one of which is memorable: "I Want To Be a Sailor, (Sailing Out to Sea)," sung by Abu. However, after being thrown into the choppy drink by one of Jaffar's henchmen, one would suspect Abu's dream of sailing the seas is over. And after discovering that flying all over the world on the back of a genie isn't such a scary experience, he opts for a magic carpet instead, stealing one from a Holy Man and promising Allah that this will be his last caper and that he will mend his thieving ways. So, at the film's end, he sails the air instead of the seas, and we are meant to feel that Abu has turned to the straight life, for if he steals again, the carpet will no longer function as airborne transportation. Yet, we also get the impression that Abu will find a clever way around his promise and will successfully compromise his oath to Allah. Abu will have his pancake and honey too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently viewed this classic fantasy on DVD in a near-immaculate print. It stands the test of time quite well.The screenplay (by Miles Malleson) is pleasingly literate. It captures the heightened romantic tone of myth surprisingly well, but does have its drawbacks.The structure is very awkward. The whole first half of the narrative is a flashback, but the remaining 55 minutes is told in real time. I am not sure why it was written this way. Usually, flashbacks are used to avoid long expository dialogue scenes, or else to tell the whole story retrospectively within a framing device. This is neither one thing nor the other and feels a bit clunky.I also feel it is short on physical action at times. For example, the movie cuts from the revelation that Abu has stolen the key to the prison cell to a scene of him and Ahmed in a boat, so that the actual escape is not shown. Similarly, Ahmed's fight with Jafar's guards and the final overthrow of his tyranny are both a bit perfunctory. The picture as a whole is inclined to be too talky: there is a tendency for people to gather in groups in wide angle shots and make speeches at each other.The production design is generally good, with a fairy tale ambiance that seems about right for the story. My only reservation is that many of the interiors look like large stage sets and don't cut that well into the back lot exteriors and the location shots. While this is very noticeable, it is only a quibble and I doubt if it would interfere with anybody's overall enjoyment of the picture.The special effects were not particularly special, even for 1940. They won an Oscar, but I suspect this was for their sheer number rather than their quality. The genie emerging from the bottle is effective, but the model of the flying genie needed some articulation to give it even a veneer of credibility. The full scale prop of his foot is never convincing, but is good fun anyway. There are highly visible matt lines throughout. The wires supporting the flying carpet are also very conspicuous.The performances are variable. They range from excellent (Conrad Veidt) to merely serviceable (John Justin and June Duprez). Sabu was clearly no actor, but his performance is energetic and winning. His limitations only really show when he is required to laugh: which he does a lot. Like many non-actors, he has trouble fabricating a convincing laugh and this aspect of his performance does tend to grate on the ear somewhat. Miles Malleson is just Miles Malleson. He gave pretty much the same performance in every film he ever made, but it is usually enjoyable and that is the case here.Despite all these reservations, in the final analysis, it doesn't matter how you choose to analyse the parts. All that really matters is whether the movie as a whole manages to engage and delight. It does.Viewed nearly 70 years after it was made, Thief of Bagdad is not just an interesting museum piece. It is a fun way to spend 100 minutes of your time and is well worth the trouble of checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check out the Spanish version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As great as this film is in its original version, something strange and wonderful happens when you watch it on DVD with the Spanish track on. Compared to the English track, the music is somewhat relegated to the background and is less forceful and booming than in the considerably cleaned-up and enhanced English composite track. This has the effect of giving precedence to the Spanish actors whose voices are made all the more clear and expressive by the fact that this voice-over must have been recorded at a more recent date than the English-language original, and on more faithful equipment, and that, despite all the sound engineer's efforts to simulate the environment of the original English actors (echoes, distance, volume, pitch), the Spanish voices come out more forceful and present. This removes some of the mystery of the original but adds an intriguing `soap opera' quality of immediacy to the script that represents an interesting change and comparison point when, as I have, one has already watched this movie 45 times in the English original. Another bonus for Miklos Rozsa completists: In the Spanish version, the first few seconds of the `Silver Maid' episode are punctuated by loud gongs, which are absent from the English soundtrack. As they sound very authentic and they take place over what, on the English track, sounds like a scratchy whirring noise coming from the mechanical doll, one may assume that these gongs were mistakenly omitted from the original English version editing and that this was only corrected on the music-and-effects-track made available later to foreign-language distributors. It could also be that the composer or director decided, on second thought, to remove the gongs altogether because they were too similar to the ones that illustrate Sabu's awe in the Temple of Light episode, which is very close at hand. These gongs are absent from the Rozsa-directed first soundtrack album of the film (1957, with narration by Leo Genn). Either way, it is always good to have a choice of two versions of this remarkable musical piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here is where Disney got Aladdin from</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thief of Bagdad is a 1940 British fantasy film classic remake of a 1924 classic of the same name. The movie is magical, each scene is inviting and you will love the whole effects used (that is if you are viewing it from the eye of someone from the 40s). Here is where the whole blue screen effect started, and if you are like me who watched Disney's Aladdin and liked it, you will love to see where Disney got their idea from.It won't be fair if anyone goes on listing fantasy films and skip this classic, this was one movie that I remembered watching when I was young when my lovable aunt introduced me to the love of movies, this movie made me wish I too had a flying carpet. Sabu, who played Abu in this movie, did not put up much of a classic acting that many say made him famous, but he was not that bad either to me the actor that stole the show was Conrad Veidt who played Jaffar.The movie plot is about a Prince named Ahmed (John Justin) who got fooled by his most trusted advisory Jaffar to leaving the palace and seeing life how life is on the street first hand. While there Jaffar had Ahmed arrested as a mad man and planned to kill him, while he Jaffar mounted the throne.But in prison Ahmed met a resourceful thief named Abu and together they broke out of jail.On their getaway, Ahmed got to meet and fall in love with a beautiful princess that Jaffar had eyes for and so Jaffar did all that he could to get Ahmed out of the way, and Ahmed with the help of Abu did all that they could to save the princess, which include meeting a Genie, getting a magic carpet and a crystal that can show you anything you want.This British classic made use of the best of the best in effects in the 40s it won the Academy Awards for Cinematography, Art Direction and Special Effects. The Thief of Bagdad marks the first major use of bluescreening in the film industry, all due to Larry Butler who introduced and pioneered it.This movie has greatly influenced many other movies after it's time especially those released about The Book of One Thousand and One Nights tales, let's not forget Disney's Aladdin and its franchise and The Prince of Persia video game franchise. The movie stands strong on a 100% approval rating on the critic aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, and it was a critical and commercial success. So if you have not seen this wonderful tale that happened down in Bagdad, about how a Prince and a thief took on the evil sorcerer Jaffar so as to save the beautiful Princess; then where have you been? Take the time out to go see this movie you will be glad you did.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magic carpet ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first books I ever won a prize for at school was "The Arabian Nights" - I could only have been about six. This magical, enchanting film took me all the way back to my childhood and for two hours blew away all my cares - isn't that what cinema's meant to be all about? My children's book comes to life spectacularly in this terrific Alexander Korda production and while director's duties are shared in the title, I suspect the bulk of the work was done by the marvellous Michael Powell, just before he hitched up with Emrich Pressburger for that wonderful series of "The Archers" productions, which turned out some of the greatest films ever to grace the cinema ("A Matter Of Life And Death", "Black Narcissus", "The Red Shoes" and many more).Don't look for characterisation - all you need to know is that the little thief Abu (Sabu) is mischievous, Prince Ahmad (John Justin) is good, the Princess (June Duprez) is beautiful and the usurper Jaffar (Conrad Veight) is evil, then mix them all together in a wonderfully episodic story which throws in almost every Arabian Night tale you can remember. The ambition of the special effects is colossal and even if some of them look ridiculous now (especially the static doll meant to embody the genie in flight and the string-laden giant spider) but many more of them are simply gorgeous to behold. There are far too many to mention but look for the evocation of the storm by Jaffar, Abu's freeing of the giant genie from the lamp, Abu's flight on the magic carpet, Jaffar's evil six-limbed toy's coming to life to slay the old duffer of a king, there's all this and more besides.The acting of course is a little Am-Dram, everybody acting principally with their eyes, but there's no shortage of conviction from anyone. More to the point, they're all convincingly dressed in colourful raiment and placed in hugely ambitious sets amongst convincing crowd scenes. The music is just fine too.In short, a fantasy film that would melt the hardest heart, which did the impossible for me in giving life to childhood memories, surely the hardest to live up to.Actually, I can't believe I've used so many superlatives in the one review, but really, this one's worth it and the fact it was made by the little old British film industry makes its achievement all the more remarkable. Truly a classic for all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Korda's "The Thief of Bagdad" is one of the most beautiful looking films from the 1940s; and, like good art, time does not diminish its appeal. The color cinematography, by George Perinal, is its most striking feature, although it's probably just as great in black-and-white - undoubtedly, its second generation of satisfied viewers enjoyed this movie on colorless little TV sets. The movie sets are spectacularly constructed and the music, by Miklos Rozsa, is glorious. Under scrutiny, the film's seams do show - especially in the area of "special effects" - but, if you can believe in magic, it won't matter. A line from the film sums it up perfectly: "Everything is possible when seen through the eyes of youth." ********** The Thief of Bagdad (12/5/40) Alexander Korda ~ John Justin, Sabu, Conrad Veidt, Rex Ingram</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My childhood favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. "The Thief of Bagdad" was my favorite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me. I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a boy of six who had started reading "The Arabian Nights." I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros, Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including "A Matter of Life and Death" (aka "Stairway to Heaven") and "The Red Shoes." He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles.As with all great works of art, the beauty of "The Thief of Bagdad" lies in the detail. Every frame has its own magical charm. The story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving. Here is a film that will never grow old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic Arabian Nights fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the finest fantasy film ever made. Sumptuous colour, spectacular sets, incredible, spot-on Miklos Rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood. Acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands, but here the poetic dialog is deftly, sensitively spoken (the humour is subtle and delightful as well).Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were enthralled by this one. Along with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two finest motion pictures released by Alexander Korda and London Films---and one of the finest motion pictures ever made.A true, compelling classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made back when "Arabian Nights" movies were still novel, this lavish production was already a "remake" back in 1940. I haven't seen the Douglas Fairbanks version, but after watching this Technicolor rendition I'm eager to give the earlier film a watch. Unlike that 1924 incarnation, this film has no major stars. It doesn't even have a single director (at least three are credited). But with Alexander Korda producing, and Michael Powell directing much of it, "Thief" retains a singleness of vision and purpose. The undisputed star of the film is Conrad Veidt as the devious usurper Jaffar. It's a tour de force by Veidt, who superbly renders Jaffar's menacing countenance, but in a surprisingly complex and at times even sympathetic way. Both he and John Justin's Ahmad are vying for the affections of the gorgeous princess, played by June Duprez. Sabu, playing Abu the young thief, and Rex Ingram, playing the djinni, are outstanding.But the real star, which shocked me for a 1940 film, is the special effects. Flying horses and carpets, child's play in the CGI era, were no mean task back then, but the results are believable and at times spectacular.I highly recommend the 2-disc Criterion release, which in addition to a making-of documentary contains two commentary tracks: one with directors Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese, and one with film historian Bruce Eder. Both Coppola and Scorsese relate their boyhood introductions to the film, and provide valuable insight into the visual and musical aspects of the film. Eder supplies fascinating historical context. Also included is a feature, "The Lion Has Wings," a rather heavy-handed bit of propaganda and in no way the equal of "Thief," but interesting nonetheless as a reflection of England's entry into World War II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of a kind fantasy, contains elements never matched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another film where reviewers seem a bit shy about going for the high numbers. This production came out of left field even by the standards of 1940 and was not only brilliant then, it is brilliant now. How is it possible for a project almost a century old to hold up against CGI today? Maybe it really is magic. There are elements here that are unforgettable -- the genie, who yearns for nothing but to be free ... free ... free. The evil magician who does hesitate to kill or tamper with the mind of the heroine. The use of mechanical/magical devices is especially memorable because these paradoxes were indeed part and parcel of the "arabian nights" mythology and remain as big a mystery today as they were centuries ago. Agree with those reviewers who insist that this movie has never been equalled. True. A one-of-a-kind, fun for old and young, and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even After Seventy Years, This Fantasy Still Packs a Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The special effects of this classic fantasy might seem rudimentary by today's standards, but THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is still wonderful entertainment. Partly this is due to the wonderful performances: Conrad Veidt is an eminently hissable villain, set against John Justin's clean- cut Ahmad and June Duprez's untouchable Princess. Sabu doesn't take himself too seriously - even in the midst of the most difficult situation he uses humor; while Rex Ingram's Djinn has a full-throated belly-laugh. The sets and costumes are quite simply out of this world - a riot of color complemented by futuristic designs (reminiscent of Menzies' 1936 hit THINGS TO COME). While the story has a contemporary resonance for 1940, with the defeat of tyranny and the triumph of virtue, the movie as a whole is an experience not to be missed. Share in the magic-carpet ride that AAbu (Sabu) makes to rescue; enjoy the thrills of watching him take the all-seeing eye, watched over by the Djinn; and enjoy the climax where Jaffar (Veidt) meets a predictably sticky end. One to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading love letter after love letter to this film from just about every critic, as well as filmmakers like Scorsese and Coppola, I feel a bit churlish and Scrooge- like doing anything other than embracing it without reservation. I certainly enjoyed and appreciated this great looking early Technicolor spectacle, It's fun, sweet, always entertaining, but the effects, while impressive for their day are distractingly dated, and the character development is sketchy at best. The two romantic leads in particular are pretty shallow, and seem to fall instantly in love for no other reason than the story tells them to, On the other hand both Conrad Veight as the sometimes over the top, but enjoyably hateful villain, and Sabu as the lovable lad who helps a king regain his kingdom fare much better. There are sequences I did find flat out wonderful (the whole very famous interaction between Sabu and the genie he finds and frees holds up to all the clips I've seen over the years), And given current politics, seeing Islam treated as benign and poetic is certainly refreshing. Maybe I was over prepared, or expecting too much. I didn't fully 'get' the greatness of 'Citizen Kane' the first time I saw it either, because I was so over-hyped. In any case, it was enough fun that I won't regret giving it another look, and seeing if it grows on me even more with a second viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Special Effects Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story about how this film came to be made is almost as interesting as the film itself. Thief of Baghdad was a break-through film in many ways. British director Alex Korda put everything on the line for this film. Technicolor was new, and no one knew what could be done with color including the inventors of Technicolor. Korda placed his future in the hands of a young man who had dropped out of Burbank High School, Larry Butler. Butler was a budding genius who went on to make many important films over the next 30 years. He went to work with Korda after working in his father's special effects shop in Los Angeles, one of the first special effects workshops in Hollywood.For the Thief of Baghdad, he developed the "traveling matte" and the "blue screen." The effects first appeared in this film and have become ubiquitous in films ever since. Every special effects film since this one has made use of the visual techniques developed by Larry Butler. Butler won the Oscar for this 1940 film, and he was nominated again and again for his many achievements in special effects. Korda's bet on Butler paid off, as this film is generally considered to be a landmark in the history of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unadulterated delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-directed by Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelen (along with three uncredited co-workers, Alexander Korda, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies), this lavish fantasy-adventure tells the tale of blind beggar Ahmad (John Justin), who spins a yarn about his life as king before the evil current king Jafar (Conrad Veidt), usurped his place and left him desolate. The story is told in flash backs, and follows his story beginning with his incarceration by jafar, where he meets Abu (Sabu). They escape and go on a quest to regain Ahmad's' rightful place as king.Filmed in technicolor, the sumptuous visuals are exacerbated by the stark, beautiful colours. It has been hailed by the likes of Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola as a masterpiece. It is a very beautiful fantasy. It reminded me of a contemporary travelogue, that shows its mystical, exotic landscapes for an untraveled spectator - although, this is clearly fantasy environments, and was not filmed on any locations except for sets. It also reminded me of the fantasy films of my childhood such as the Sinbad and Jason and the Argonauts adventures, sans Harryhausens fantastic monsters. The simple tale of redemption and fundamental achievement against evil is a story over told. However, with the cinematography and set pieces, this film is pure unadulterated delight. It genuinely is the perfect Sunday afternoon movie. (Although John Justin's diction and general performance does begin to grate).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six directors (three uncredited) were responsible for bringing this magical Arabian Nights fable to the big screen, including Michael Powell, William Cameron Menzies, and the old mogul himself: producer Alexander Korda, the self-styled sovereign of the British film industry. But the real heroes of the wartime production were its two art directors: Menzies, and Korda's brother Vincent, who created the fabulous Middle Eastern set designs to complement the vivid Technicolor photography. The sometimes flamboyantly melodramatic story is almost impossible to resist, with a handsome, wrongfully deposed prince seeking the aid of an ingenious boy thief (played by the sprightly young Indian star Sabu) to help him regain his throne from the evil Grand Vizier, a master of the Black Arts. During their quest the pair encounter a flying horse, battle giant spiders, liberate a mammoth genie from his bottle, steal the All-Seeing Eye, and meet a lonely, beautiful princess, upon whom no man may gaze and live. It's a classic fantasy, requiring an effortless suspension of disbelief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thief of Baghdad has all the ingredients that make a fantasy adventure magical, and considering when it was made, this was an absolute delight from start to finish. It is sumptuously designed, and the stunning photography made it more beautiful to the eyes than it already was. The music was gorgeous, and during the film there were plenty of jaw dropping moments from the giant genie, the really scary spider to the flying carpet. The Thief of Baghdad is also benefited by a well written screenplay and a fabulously told story. The performances were most impressive, Conrad Veidt deliciously evil as the evil sorcerer Jaffar and June Duprez the picture of ravishing beauty as the princess. John Austin is the very likable hero known as Ahmad, and Sabu gives a spirited performance as Abu. I will also say the length didn't bother me at all, this is a truly fantastic film in every way, no matter how old it is, and is easily the definitive version of the 1001 Arabian Nights tale it is based on. With a wicked magician, a totally unpredictable fight with a spider, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet and a genie, what more could you ask for? 10/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Build it four times as big and paint it crimson"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was usually producer Alexander Korda's advice on set to many of his underlings; the film is credited with three directors but in truth Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped out, pushing it to six.For John Kobal's 1987 book, "The Top 100 Movies", his survey of 81 film critics saw The Thief of Bagdad reach 55th place. A closer examination reveals only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half-way mark.The outbreak of the Second World War saw the movie's production shifted around England and America, eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars. Like Citizen Kane, it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love.The special effects, outstanding for the time, are still reasonable, and actually hold up if you squint. But it's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions. Among them is an amusing horse, constructed out of a kit model, which, when a key is inserted up it's rear end, begins to fly. There's also a killer toy of the six-armed Goddess Kali, (perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her) and a quite horrific-looking giant spider. Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet. But most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn (genie) nearly a thousand feet tall! Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. And look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle!John Justin does well as the Arabic king who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a stiff upper lip. Sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15?year-old, is near-namesake Abu, a likeably cocky thief. After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog. When it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind Ahmed's (Justin's) perspective, we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues. In truth, the second half is someway the better, being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature.Three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient; I wouldn't classify this as a musical. It's all great fun; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, Veidt is the boo-hiss villain, and Abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber. It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies, but once you've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in. Quite commendable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaffer (Conrad Veight) was not the magician as stated above. He was the romantic lead. Achmad was the magician. This was one of Sabu's best parts. It's interesting to note that he, so far as I know, was the only Indian to ever gain star status in Hollywood. He died at age 39, and was the richest actor in Hollywood at the time. The movie as started in London in 1942. The production and cast were soon moved to Hollywood because of the Nazi Blitz. You might recognize the actor that played the Djinn as 'Jim' from the Mickey Rooney version of 'Huckleberry Finn'. I've watched this film at least five times over my lifetime and still find it pleasing. If for no other reason, it's clean, adventurous and has a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the director Michael Powell visited Russia in the 1980s, he was surprised by the number of people in their mid-40s who came to personally thank him for creating one of their fondest childhood memories ? the Thief of Bagdad. For a film to have such impact, to have created such an impression on the mind, it must be quite an incredible achievement. Not everyone considers this to be a genuine Michael Powell film, as the production was famously moved out of the UK upon the outbreak of war, and was eventually directed in stages by six different directors. It's not always clear who directed what, but I would estimate Powell was responsible for enough key scenes and the overall feel of the film to classify it as one of his. There are some which clearly bear his stamp, a good example being the haunting opening shot of the ship drifting towards the camera. There are others which he definitely did not direct ? for example the location shots from the Grand Canyon. Of the rest, some are well done while others are of fairly low quality. Since the other directors involved do not have nearly as good a reputation as Powell, it's fairly easy to join the dots in these cases.Thief of Bagdad is certainly in the Michael Powell tradition (perhaps the start of the that tradition) of being enchanting, eye-catching and full of colour. The Technicolor cinematography is absolutely stunning. The choice of colours does not seem geared so much as to convey certain themes or moods, but more to constantly dazzle and enchant the viewer. Powell arranges his shots carefully, aiming to show off the wonderful set design at one moment, bringing us in for a shimmering close-up the next. There is some fantastic expressionistic use of shadows and low angles. The overall feel is dreamlike and otherworldly. The score, by Miklos Rosza, adds considerably to this sweeping, fairy-tale feel. The mysterious choral melodies are perfect for the film.Then we come to the cast. As a romantic lead John Justin is not the best actor in the world but he is certainly handsome and dashing enough to have become a British Errol Flynn. Conrad Veidt is, as always, the perfect sinister villain. Rex Ingrams seems to be having great fun as the giant, bellowing genie ? a forerunner of the madcap Robin Williams creation in Disney's Alladin. But the real show-stealer is young Sabu as the titular thief ? there's just something so genuine and effortless about his performance that was so rare in that era when cinema was still trying to work out where it stood amongst melodramatic and theatrical traditions.As is well documented this was a troubled production, and it shows. The varying of directors, not to mention the shipping of sets and actors across the channel halfway through filming, has given it a patchy, disjointed feel. It also seems a little short in places, as if bits have been cropped to save time. Ahmad and Sabu's escape from jail, and the Princess' escape, capture by slave traders and being bought by Jaffar are skipped over with a cut and a few lines of dialogue respectively, when there is no reason they couldn't have been scenes in their own right. The editing is sometimes a little clumsy. There are a few shots that look like they ought to have played a little longer to be given full justice. The dialogue is rather clunky and stiff, whereas it ought to sparkle like the images. But despite all these problems, Thief of Bagdad still has the power to entertain and captivate us. While the special effects may have dated, the incredible imagery has kept all its power. Perhaps if Michael Powell had been able to see the project through to its completion it would have become his first masterpiece. I can imagine it having been accorded the same reverence as its contemporary The Wizard of Oz, whereas it has sadly become something of a forgotten film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages--to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful, colorful production, and, to adults, for a literate script, fine production values, good casting/acting, all bound together with a fine Rozsa score. Two roughly contemporary films accomplish this--"Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Some of the back story on this production is fascinating. This production, commenced in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood, and proved a cover for British intelligence efforts! The producer, Alexander Korda, was subsequently knighted in 1942. Here is a unique case of the intersection of art, commerce, and politics! By all means, secure a good CD of this film for your library!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Next to "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz," this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It's a true shame it's not as well-known as the former films (maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci-fi settings, and that it's British, meaning a smaller market for films) but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation.Like all great family films, one can be a child, an adult, or even a teenager to enjoy this film (I'm currently 18), but one must appreciate classic films first. I absolutely adore this film. It has an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film score) that rivals any John Williams "Star Wars" score, a fast but not flashy pace, beautiful sets, dialog, and use of color (both the sets and cinematography won Oscars), and state-of-the-art Oscar-winning special effects (for the time, and some are still stunning). And, of course, June Duprez's sultry looks as the Princess rivals that of Catherine Zeta-Jones' (she even looks like Jones in a way!).In conclusion, this is one of my all-time favorite movie (next to "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and it truly deserves more attention. It is a true adventure of enchantment throughout, and, along with "Robin Hood," it's my desert island film that I could watch over and over again without getting annoyed.Stars: **** (excellent)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I was so thoroughly entertained and thrilled as when I just watched Alexander Korda's 1940 masterpiece of adventure hokum.Achmad, Prince of Bagdad, is manipulated out of office by his evil grand vizier, and takes refuge amongst his subjects with his new best buddy, an irrepressible teenage thief, Abu. He worships the Princess of Basra, also coveted by the vizier, and he and Abu summon all powers natural and supernatural to win the day.Korda's film is infinitely superior to the famous Douglas Fairbanks version from 1924. William Cameron Menzies did production design for both, and while his sets to the earlier film seem unused and devoid of life or texture, in the newer version Bagdad looks lived in. It is not supposed to look realistic or even feasible, so it is in keeping with the fantasy that the sets maintain a degree of dreamy artificiality, it is not a fault or a proof of some technical shortcomings.Special effects are astonishingly well-executed and brilliantly imaginative. I loved Abu's fight with the giant spider, very stylishly filmed, the magic carpet, the flying white steed, the diabolic gigantic genie fresh out of the bottle ...All very exhilarating stuff, constantly arousing, vividly edited. The actors are all personable and have a winning charisma, led of course by the ebullient young Sabu (teen girls of today would lose all sense of propriety!), the handsome romantic lead John Justin and the creepy Conrad Veidt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie; I really did. I figured that since I have always loved "The Wizard of Oz," "Forbidden Planet," and "Samson and Delilah," that "Thief" would appeal to me. After all, I figured, it would combine the best of the art direction and fantasy of "Wizard" with the otherworldliness of "Planet," along with the lush Hollywood exoticism of "Samson and Delilah." Unfortunately, this was not the case. I am sorry to say that all of those previously mentioned movies are much better than "Thief of Bagdad." For starters, I was particularly disappointed in the story- it seemed to jump all over the place, and there was a lack of any really convincing character arcs for the leads. Sabu, who is adorable and energetic as always, made for an appealing hero, but we didn't really see enough of him- instead, we saw more of the insipid romantic leads, John Justin and June Duprez, who are only stunning in their absolute inability to emote. Conrad Veidt made a good villain, but I wanted to know a little more about why he was doing what he was doing. Granted, in "The Wizard of Oz," the Wicked Witch of the West is not given a detailed backstory, but Dorothy's house landed on top of her sister, which is a very good reason for the Witch to be after Dorothy! Unlike the Wicked Witch, I did not ever feel that Conrad Veidt's character was ever a real threat or menace. Perhaps it is because in "Thief" the characters are given precious little personality and motivation; also, there seems to be little continuity in the colorful incidents that occur. For example, one moment Abu, Sabu's character, has smashed the magical all-seeing eye- the next moment he is being bowed to by a bunch of elderly sultans in white. Huh? Did I miss something? Now, I understand that this is supposed to be a fairy tale, but even in fantasy worlds, things are supposed to make sense within the context of that world. Again, "The Wizard of Oz" is a good example of an early fantasy movie with excellent continuity and world-building.The movie, on the whole, was very pretty to look at, and the sets, crowd scenes and matte paintings were spectacular. However, I must say that I found the color scheme of the film to be very irritating- everything seemed to be in shades of pastels, mostly pale pink and baby blue, as if it were one of those old "My Little Pony" commercials. I understand this is a matter of personal taste, since in movies I tend to prefer vivid colors. However, whenever I read the "Arabian Nights," I always pictured a very rich color palette, with scarlets, blues, golds, and desert browns. Maybe it's just me, but a pastel palette doesn't seem to go with the very nature of the stories "Thief" is claiming to represent.In any case, I am glad that I have finally seen "Thief of Bagdad," but I would not see it again. Perhaps it's something that I needed to see when I was little to make any impression on me. All in all, I personally found it to be too mannered, precious and dull to sufficiently convey the earthiness, vigor and gusto of the original "Arabian Nights."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1940 Thief of Bagdad is a delightful picture, well-paced and colorful. Populated by fine actors, most notably the exuberant Sabu and deliciously sinister Conrad Veidt, this is a fantasy classic which has stood the test of time in the ways that matter.Sure the special effects, cutting age in 1940, are dated now; but that is inevitable, even with our modern blockbusters and all their CG action. But it is the charming characters and sense of wonder which hold up.The Fairbanks version from 1924 is also excellent, but poorly paced, running at two and a half hours when the plot is too frail to sustain such a length. This film is leaner and also a lot more fun, and I rarely say that of 1940s/1950s remakes of silent films.A magnificent film, watch it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Colour Rendition of the Arabian Nights Saga!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was really a feast for my eyes to watch this wonderful, amazingly interesting, magically charged Arabian Nights adventure after so many years. I really enjoyed it and felt the beauty of the golden age of Hollywood unleashing before me like some dream come true. This is a superb Technicolor movie sporting special effects of those seminal times of motion picture technology. The story and the plot is extremely well scripted and filmed. The characters of Jaffar, Princess and the thief played by Sabu, all perfectly get under the skin of their respective roles. Considering the year 1940, it was a far cry for even big Hollywood productions like Casablanca(1942) and Citizen Kane (1941) to be filmed in Technicolor. The special visual effects are more catchy, attractive and thrill oriented than those filmed today with computer aided technology of the 21st century. I, therefore pay my glowing tributes to the producers and directors who endeavored to magically enthrall their audience well over half a century ago. The bewitching music score by Miklos Rozsa adds stymieing ambiance to this fine episode of One Thousand and One Nights. A must see for all the sci-fi crazy generation of this computer graphics age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for the child in all of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They don't make 'em like this anymore". It's a clichéd and overused phrase, but one which stands true ? especially when spoken of a film like THE THIEF OF BAGDAD. This glorious fantasy piece, filmed in a Technicolor which has never looked so good, is a movie which is effectively the ultimate Arabian adventure. Evil viziers, deposed kings, genies in bottles, flying horses and carpets, huge palaces, swordfighting and much more besides ? THE THIEF OF BAGDAD sets the template for many a fantasy film to come with special effects which even hold up today.Even though the film's now over seventy years old, it remains hard to fault. The screenplay and dialogue (by Miles Malleson, who also appears as a delightfully childish sultan) are old-fashioned in the best sense and designed to appeal to the child in all of us. The heroes are decent (John Justin), the villains are wicked (Conrad Veidt is particularly dastardly) and the princesses are beautiful (June Duprez). Best of all is Sabu (THE JUNGLE BOOK), the Indian boy star who just happened to be one of the most charismatic actors of his era. No wonder he made it so big. As a film, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is hard to beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun...but I still prefer the Douglas Fairbanks version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, but the 1924 silent version had a distinct advantage over this remake. Because it was a silent film, the singing at the beginning of the film is noticeably absent--a plus because the singing tended to detract from the film. Additionally, I think I liked the special effects more in the earlier version because they seemed more spectacular for the time. This may surprise some, but I just think they looked better in the good ol' days--not that this 1940 version looked bad--it was still very nice for 1940.The film bears some similarity to the more recent ALADDIN from Disney, though only a similarity. Some of the names and characters are the same--to a degree. Jafar is named 'Jaffar' in THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and the characters of Abu and Aladdin are actually combined into one character--and this time, Abu is a dog! As for the Princess and her father, they are quite similar but a king who had his kingdom stolen is a major character in this film. Finally, the genie in THE THIEF is a jerk--not especially nice and not to be trifled with by anyone! The story is a rousing adventure set in what would today be Iraq, though this was set during some undisclosed time period. The story is filled with love, magic and the like and is not especially deep but a lot of fun. Not a great film by today's standards but quite nice for 1940. Also, as you watch the film, notice the unusual Technicolor palate--it sure has a lot of intense colors and emeralds and pinks and baby blues seem to dominate.The final verdict is that this is a very good film and should appeal mostly to people who appreciate older films. Some people may laugh at the special effects, as they are used to CGI and amazing effects today, but if you can appreciate anything made before 1990, then by all means give this a try--it is a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes it's very easy to be critical of old films,when watching them from a perspective of 60 years.After the special effects of the Harryhausen films,the Stars Wars and Indiana Jones films,we might be a little too harsh,having seen the improvement since 1940.Let's face it-this was top of the line back then.And the plot,which might seem dated or stereotyped now,was original at that time.The exuberance seen in this flic is really rather refreshing.My only complaint is with Ingram,as the Djinn.He sounds a little too much(to my ear)like the Lawd(Green Pastures).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Arabian Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kids ought to love this good-natured, fast-paced fantasy adventure from the Arabian Nights. The color photography is splendid, but then everything else is as well -- wardrobe, makeup, production design, special effects, and the magical mystery score by Miklos Rozsa.It's got just about everything in it that we associate with Arabian legends -- the genie in the bottle, the flying carpet, the jewel in the idol's eye, the luscious and exotic princess (June Duprez), the handsome blind hero whose sight is returned (John Justice), the black-clad bearded villain (Conrad Veidt), the giant spider, the laughing little thief (Sabu). The plot is just coherent enough to bring these elements together.I was thrilled as a kid when I saw it in a theater, and my kid was equally enthralled when he was of that age.Not that adults won't enjoy it too, just that it presents them with a more demanding epoché than most movies they're likely to get a kick out of. For grown men, at any rate, the foxy princess of June Duprez is a feast for the eyes. Speaking of eyes, her irises are a deep brown and they look slightly outward of her saggital plane, and her canthi tilt upward and outward at an alarming angle. She looks part predatory cat, maybe a margay, except that the rest of her features are so chubbily sensual. Her voice sounds like that of Jane Randolph, the girl friend in "The Cat People," only with an English accent. Any normal man would want to pinch and bite her.It has no pretense at meaning anything. It's only goal is to entertain and that it does. You'll probably get a kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arabian fantasy in Technicolor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all fairness, this movie has basically very little to do with the 1924 version of the movie with same name, starring Douglas Fairbanks in the main lead, despite the fact that this movie is listed everywhere as an official remake of this movie. Both movies are good and entertaining in their own unique ways. There always had been many different interpretations of the story over the years.It's an early movie in color and like most early color movies it features lots of extremely bright colors, as if they were trying to show off. This means that the boats, costumes and sets are all in very bright colors, or at least in colors that in no way would be used today. Yes, it's quite fake looking all at times but I always like this fake and bright look of these early color movies. It definitely has a certain charm over it.With its 6 different directors, production must have been a mess but luckily none of this can be seen back in the movie. Not the least directors were at one time involved with this movie; Michael Powell, Alexander Korda, Zoltan Korda, all did some great and well known movies in their careers. In the movie can't really been seen back in its style or storytelling that so many different directors were at one point involved with this movie. The movie feels mostly consistent, which is of course a great but also amazing thing. The movie has a great story and is told pleasantly with a good fast pace, which helps to make the movie really entertaining to watch, despite the fact that there isn't really an awful lot of action or anything else like that occurring in the movie. It's above all things an adventurous movie with lots of traveling and exotic locations. Too bad that the movie sort of sleeps in in its second halve and the movie looses its focus on the main character, in favor of other characters.The lead actors of the movie are mostly going over-the-top with their performances, which can be expected from young, inexperienced, handsome looking actors. Luckily the supporting cast is way better, with the always fantastic Conrad Veidt as the villainous Jaffar.The musical score from Miklós Rózsa is also a classic and is also one of the things that gives the movie its pace, adventurous feeling and color.An all in all colorful adventurous movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Viewing - Really Enjoyed It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that all the fantasy elements 1001 Nights (Arabian Nights) have been incorporated into this film - flying carpet, genie in bottle, magic, etc. In fact, the scenes are so full of life (particularly the marketplace ones), and exotic and fantastic, that one wishes he were in it instead of just watching on a screen. The special effects were especially good for the period - and this without the benefit of the computers and high-tech gadgets used in today's action movies. The colour was just so -well, colourful - but you must remember that the setting is supposed to be in the Middle East, where bright and vivid shades of clothing and scenery are the norm.Of course there are the downsides. I found the songs rather boring and not contributing much to the story. The dialogue is at times stilted and flowery especially when Ahmad declares his love for the princess; that he would wait for her till the end of time, etc. Like he was reciting lines from some Arabic tips-to-dating guidebook or something. The genie's laugh seems to be rather artificial, reminiscent of the canned laughter of modern TV sitcoms albeit done by only 1 individual and much louder.Understandably by today's politically correct standards, The Thief of Baghdad could be also accused of stereotyping or even racism. Like male slaves are depicted as black, Arab merchants as fat and pompous, and the evil magician Jaffar as a dark menacing thick-browed character (seems to me that the name Jaffar is a popular one for wicked Middle-Eastern characters - read, Walt Disney's Aladdin - which from what I've read from other comments and on the message board, borrows heavily from this movie)Magical effects, colour and cinematography help create fantasy and yet, it is the the human element which makes it more special and important. The scenes with Abu especially, with his clever ways and no-nonsense approach to life, make for the best viewing particularly when he helps the dreamy-eyed Ahmad in his quest to win the princess's heart. As for the message that the film wants to send, it is the standard one of the fight between the good and evil, and how good always wins in the end. The amazing thing is that although the Abu is a thief, one can't help but cheer and encourage him when he escapes from sticky situations. This fact reflects the human element of psychology that usually makes the audience side with the main character and supports him even what he is doing is inherently wrong (read - Robin Hood robbing the rich to help the poor). It is needless to say that in The Thief of Bagdad, the good eventually overcomes bad , which does not always happen in real life. Though it can be rated as an escapist film fit only for viewing on a rainy weekend afternoon by today's computer-orientated moviegoers, yet it combines the elements of romance, adventure and action to make it one of the best fantasy films ever produced in the last century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hokey but rather wonderful Arabian Nights adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning of the film with the trumpets-and-brass choir, the human choir singing the exotic wordless parallel portamento chords and the striking songs with the totally pedestrian words ("I want to be a sailor, sailing out to sea, No plow-boy, tinker, tailor's any fun to be..." And it gets even worse!), Miklos Rosza's score sweeps you along into this hokey but rather wonderful Arabian Nights adventure and, in its memorable images, it still has never been equaled.In few other films has the heroine (June Duprez) been so beautiful, (I don't know why she should be expected to act as well but she gets the job done well enough.) the villain (Conrad Veidt) so hissable, the hero (John Justin) so dreamily handsome and the real hero Sabu so exotically lovable (And he can sing too!). And the rest of the cast trying to double as Arabs is hilarious; some of the dialogue is even intentionally funny! The film started life shooting in England but the blitz made it too dangerous to continue so they all moved to Hollywood. When the Genie (Rex Ingram) appears, he becomes the most memorable of all movie genies as he "oozes" forth from his bottle and when, towards the end he exults that he's "free, free, free", the Civil Rights movement, which had yet to happen, is nevertheless evoked for modern audiences or at least for me.The in-depth "beefcake" only adds to the exoticism of the film. The use of the "traveling matte" is about the height of the special effects at this time. When the enlarged Rex flies over the Grand Canyon, in the distance shots he's obviously an inflexible doll but it works well enough.This was always one of my favorite films and continues to be, even if it now seems rather "campy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is fun for the whole family! The 1940's had an innocence all its own &amp; that can be viewed in this 'round the world romp from Bagdad to the high seas. Fantasy, colorful surroundings &amp; even the standard animals for the kids enjoyment are all here. When the king is lonely &amp; looking for his true love, he finds her when he goes down among the common people of his kingdom. He runs into a thief (Indian actor, Sabu), befriends him &amp; finds his true love in the princess he sees from a distance. She thinks he's a genie, falls in love with him, too but things get adventurous when a 3rd party enters with evil intent. One line you'll remember is uttered by that 3rd party when the princess finally sees who he is - "Yes, JAFFA! It's always JAFFA!" Yes, he's the one who's always causing a stir, meddling where he ought not. All 4 main actors are a treat for the eyes, so you won't be bored but 'fantasized'. Have fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is, The Thief Of Bagdad the shining light of the fantasy genre?.It's turned out to be a very enlightening revisit to the film for me, because as a child I was never that taken with this particular piece, to me the fantasy genre began and died with the wonderful Ray Harryhausen pictures. Yet here I am in my middle age, positively purring at the wonderment that is this remake of the 1924 silent Raoul Walsh classic. The fact that this film even turned out decent is something of a fantastical tale in itself, but the fact that it actually turned out to be a benchmark defies the genre it's the template for. Having three credited directors {it's believed six actually worked on it} doesn't scream out a successful production does it,? and thanks to the nuisance intervention of a World War the film ended up being shot on three continents, yet the final result is pretty much as close to tight knit seaming as you could see.This Arabian knight heavy leaning story sees bulging eyed nasty vizier, Jaffar, tricking Prince Ahmad (the rightful heir to the throne of Bagdad) out of his crown, but after a meeting in prison with young urchin thief Abu, their destiny's are about to encompass magic in all its forms.If this wasn't made in 1940 one could view it now and shout out at the screen that it's a collage of genre staples, but it is 1940,! and it is here that The Thief Of Bagdad defined the fantasy film genre. It is with no surprise to me that I have read that heavy hitting modern day directors cite this film as an inspiration as regards structured craft, because the film is simply awash with class. The Technicolor is amazing, watch as blue &amp; pink palaces literally dazzle the eyes {thank you George Perinal}, marvel at the effects that today may seem basic to the modern day viewer, but in reality they set the standard, and listen to the story enhancing score from Miklos Rozsa, and then take in {and be taken in by} the incredible Vincent Korda sets. Everything a genre fan could want is here, dastardly villain versus the good guy, a flying horse, a magic carpet, a giant spider, the worlds loudest Genie, and a beautiful princess make this is a magical tale that is given class care and attention by the makers. The sound mix on the DVD isn't quite right, and that is the only reason I can't go for a maximum 10/10 for the film, but as it is, it's a very high 9/10 for a film that's importance should never be understated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stuff Of Dreams....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Take 2** Since my initial posting, it is so heartwarming to see all the viewers who have followed with their fond remembrance of this classic. We all seem to share the same childhood memories of having first been exposed to this magical film...mostly, if not all, through the medium of television in the 50's. With the recent DVD release, I can only hope all the new viewers will pass on the magic, because as most of us will all agree, this film has not been given the due respect it truly deserves.As I so posted originally, the "Thief Of Bagdad" is best remembered as a Technicolor dream well worth revisiting.****** ******* ******* ****** The "Thief Of Bagdad" is one of those rare films that one can watch and remember viewing it as a young child...and still be impressed. This wonderful Technicolor dream holds up better over the years (special effects notwithstanding)and wraps the viewer in it's web of fairy tale magic. It has it all, the beautiful princess (June Duprez) the eager prince (John Justin) and the most sinister villain (Conrad Veidt)one can imagine...and of course, the young thief (Sabu). Noteworthy is the lush music of Miklos Rozsa, the beautiful theme for the princess is haunting, and try not to hum the "I want to be a sailor" tune for Sabu. All in all, a simply magical exercise in movie-making that has influenced so many filmmakers since. Movie Magic at it's absolute best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS of the British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! Some of the most ravishing early Technicolor, a SUBLIME and shimmering Miklos Rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of Sabu, the theatrical and malevolent villainy of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well. Miles Malleson who plays Duprez father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose. DON'T MISS THIS ONE! Since posting the above comments, I have obtained the recently released DVD and can honestly say I'd never seen the picture properly until viewing this DVD version-The clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that I was stunned-This amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer.

		<fullReview>The first half of the film's outdoor shots were filmed on location in Morocco, but was interrupted in the middle of production by World War Two. The second half of the film uses Hollywood soundstages and locations in the United States (the scene were Sabu is reunited with John Justin after capturing the All-Seeing Eye was filmed at the Grand Canyon).Special effects were cutting-edge at the time the film was made and are still passable by today's standards (though come off a bit cheesy). At times the actors' voices are drowned out by the background noise, and I had to continually adjust the volume on the my tv set as the film changed scenes.I felt that the 1940's film censors handcuffed the producers in some of the scenes, such as the harem shots where the princess is bathing, an execution scene in the town square, a couple of swordplay scenes, and a later scene where the princess has been imprisoned by Jafaar. Still, there's enough to let us know what's going on off-camera and the plot moves along at a nice pace.June Duprez is a pleasure to watch, even though her acting skills are never really stretched. I wish her costumes had shown more skin and less bodysuit, but then again this is 1940. Sabu turns in a solid performance as the boy-thief who helps John Justin reclaim his throne and save the princess. Justin's performance is good but a bit flowery at times, but then again, this is 1940 so I suppose it was standard for that period.No nudity, no blood, no harsh language, no really scary scenes, some violence as Justin tries to fight off the enemy guards with a sword, a treat for the whole family (though adults may find one viewing to be sufficient).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With so much incredible talent gathered together for this film, it must have left audiences of the 40s and 50's spellbound and breathless!Directorial greats (several!) weave an endless trail of eye popping treats throughout a well written screenplay. This fantasy adventure is crammed with colour and movement of the more intelligent kind. Completed within two continents, after a great deal of difficulty ~ during a time when the world was embroiled in the stupidity of WW11 ~ this film still offers an abundance of thrills. Audiences used to looking at today's C.G.A. may find the special effects lacking, but hey, this is pioneering movie making of the best caliber. Look, and see where Harryhausen got much of his inspiration (and copied some characters I'm sure) Look, at the magnificent visual design, striking sets, fluid camera, and glowing 3 strip Technicolor (no color ever looked as good as this and it never faded). Names like William Cameron Menzies, Michael Powell --too many to name-- created one of the first all time great Arabian stunners...But wait there's more! This work features one of the most impressive of all Miklos Rozsa's music scores....dare I ask if he ever bettered it??Can't overlook a marvelous cast, remarkable Dog, Oscar winning photography of Georges Perinal and Osmond Borradaile, topped off with Rex Ingram's damned scary Genie ~ even more physically menacing than Conrad Veidt's terrific Jaffar. It could be said that this set-the-scene for so many fantasies that followed... The re-issue print I was kindly given by a good friend (The Korda Collection series from Magna Pacific) is a little unkempt, with much neg dirt left to show as white dots on the image and yet, while not a digitally re-mastered DVD transfer, the image is thankfully quite sharply focused. I see that Criterion (and maybe another) may have given this masterpiece a serious clean up, so shop around before buying. Highly recommended to all appreciators of classic cinematic milestones...

		<fullReview>Ambitious Arabian Nights Adventure that has Found Itself in the Fond Memory Banks of Grown Up Children and Child Like Adults. Viewed from a Pre-CGI Perspective and from an Age of Innocence that was Soon to be Bombed Into Oblivion, this is a Remarkable Achievement.The Appeal is Obvious, Mostly as Escapism Fantasy into a Foreign Landscape and World from Long Long Ago with its Stunning Architecture and Vibrant Colors Meshed with a Culture Complete with Flying Carpets, Blue Skinned/Multi-Limbed Goddesses, Genies, Horses that Take to the Air, and Other Fantastic Flourishes.The Incredible Set Design, Lush and Lavish Color Schemes, Gaudy Costumes, and a Standout Musical Score All Add to the Movies Universal and Timeless Appeal. However, it's Not Without Some Clunkiness. Leading Man John Justin has Absolutely No Screen Presence and is Extremely Stiff Almost to the Point of Distraction. The SFX are Mostly Impressive but it Must be Pointed Out that there are Times When they Do Draw Attention to Themselves. June Duprez as the Princess has a Beauty that is Standard and Nothing Resembling Royalty or Fictional Females of Supreme Enchantment. Conrad Veidt as the Villain and Sabu are More than Passable. There are Many Highlights, the Most Mesmerizing is the Spider Battle and Overall "Seeing Eye" Temple Scenes that are the Best in a Movie that is Filled with Such Things. The Genie SFX are Inconsistent and the "Real" Wooden Exaggerations Like the Foot and Ear, as Like a Few Other Attempts Here and There are Hopelessly Dated.Overall, a Charmer that Can be Forgiven its Limitations Because the Best Parts are Oh So Good and the Film does Wonders to Transport the Audience to a Land Beyond the Senses. Must See Viewing for Film Historians, Fantasy Film Fanatics, and Children from 6 to 60.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great adventure movie that has everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an entertaining 1940's adventure movie based upon one of the stories of the Arabian Nights (though I have not read that particular book). It is a story about the king of Bagdad who is usurped by his vizier and forced to flee for his life. In doing so he meets up with a young thief and together they go on an adventure to restore the king to his throne and to rescue the king's beloved from the clutches of the evil vizier.As mentioned, I found this movie entertaining, and for an adventure movie it has everything from evil sorcerers to genies to flying carpets. However, it is very noticeable that the makers of this movie had no idea about the intricacies of Islamic culture during the golden age. One notices that most of the main characters look American, and the females have their hair arranged as if they were 1940's Americans. For purists this would most likely put them off the movie, however if one can get past the discrepancies (and of course the 1940's special effects) then as a movie it is not bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could it not have dated?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few people complain that this movie has dated. Duh!!! How could it not have dated ? It is 68 years old for Chrissakes. One has to acknowledge that it is a product of its time, and not many movies then had black characters at the forefront of the action. Kudos to the producers for casting Rex Ingram and Sabu at a time when it was not commonplace. The special effects must have been state of the art at the time and stand up well even in todays cgi world. The one area which is poor is the acting though. One exception is Conrad Veidt who is magnificent as a really believable villain. I think it is he who holds the movie together. Hall is awful and Sabu is so-so but engaging nonetheless. Miles Malleson entertained as the Caliph and the sets and music are great. I think it cries out for a careful, reverential and really well done remake but I really have no idea who should be cast in such a project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technicolor lends well to fantasy films. It's one of those technologies that can be a little too proud of itself, but not here. Powell is a master of it, and while I'm not well enough versed in film history to speak to his innovations, all the effects do still seem fresh, and many of the images will haunt me for a long time.It's a film about seeing -- how we see, and how we interpret worlds around us. The most important boundary to be breached is that between viewer and character, and it's done effectively: we each inform the other's experience. There are many ways of seeing in this universe: crystal ball, water reflection, by proxy (Abu as dog), over the mountains, through a veil, through a haze of forgetfulness, etc. The two genies underscore an important distinction (Abu's beach giant, and Ahmad's reflective disguise): fantasy and reality are different perspectives on the same objective world. Fantasy is in fact a distortion of reality, often just a unique way of looking at the real world (as the giant tells us above the mountains). The shots I found most moving were of the ship bobbing on the ocean, and any of the flight sequences -- graceful choreography prefiguring what we'd see 8 years later with The Red Shoes. The camera dances in lock step with the objects it films, perfect grace. This came out around the same time as the Wizard of Oz, and it's just as good (note how the final scene is a ride over the rainbow). By the way, Krull completely ripped off this spiderweb sequence.The thing that dates this film is the acting. As transformative and Welles, and Kubrick, and Griffith were, Brando had as much an impact not only on acting but on the shape of films. The theatricality of the acting in this movie (and its contemporaries) grates to the point where I have trouble understanding it ? almost like reading Chaucer in middle English ? the visual vocabulary still stands tall, but the acting style is long vanquished, and sadly the world of the film is too heavily informed by the acting.Also of note is the political suggestion. The king disguises as a citizen; his underling usurps the throne; the princess hides from him ? all are thieves. It's not quite as powerful as it might have been had real Arabs played the roles, but it stands to point that there are usurpers of that city to this day, and this makes the notion of fantasy and escape from a world of brutal tyrants, and usurpers of those tyrants, all the more powerful still.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Glorious Film Score of Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is THE masterpiece of its type, never even remotely equaled by any other Arabian Nights film. But all of this has been said before by IMDb commentators, movie-goers and critics. I would just like to state that, to these ears, Miklos Rozsa's score is arguably the most beautiful and all-encompassing one ever written for any film. Some of his later ones may have been more "progressive", but for sheer melodiousness, lushly colorful orchestration and larger-than-life musical drama, not even John Williams or Erich Wolfgang Korngold have produced its equal. Most of even the greatest film scores have one or two special melodies or musical effects, and the rest, when heard independent of the film, is pretty much musical filler. But Rozsa's every track seems to be a highlight; to prove this, simply listen to the reconstruction of the score recorded on LP about a quarter-century back. Indeed, I could well imagine some relatively conservative (ie. tonal) composer taking the dozen or more wonderful Rozsa musical moments in this score and working them into a truly beautiful, if old-fashioned, opera! I mean, the Love Theme alone would sell it to any romanticist out there. Anyhow, this has been my single favorite film score (out of at least twenty thousand I estimate having heard) since I first saw the movie in the late 1940s and I thought it a good idea to have at least one commentary which concentrates solely upon the music heard in this grand film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Approx. only 1923 votes are registered for this movie? I Other classics from the 1940's have already 12.000 votes and more. I fear, this is one of this classics, that are unfortunately forgotten by the most people today. A destiny, that this fantastic good movie surely not deserve! It is simply a stunning and captivating story from the golden era of the cinema. Nearly perfect until today and one of my favorites. It captivated me as a child, when i was 7 or 8 years old and saw it for the first time on TV, i hide behind the sofa when Sabu fights with this awful giant spider. Until today it is the best and most frightening scene of the whole movie and predicts Frodos fight with Shelob in "The Lord of the Rings" 60 years before. The story contains all, what a good movie needs: A hero, a villain, a lot of adventures, colorful and (until today) fantastic good special effects and so many little gags, that never standing above the actors or the story... and a gorgeous happy ending!I was lucky to get my hands on the restored DVD (Region 2 - Germany) a few days ago. Time to see it again in my new home-theater with a projector on the big screen. And it captivated me again! As the enclosed info-sheet reported, the film was a work of unlucky circumstances in an unlucky time. At least 2 directors with different ideas how the story shall be told remained to work on it. In nearly all cases such differences will end up in the canceling of a project or in a total flop, but seldom, very seldom, like it happened to this movie, the ideas of both directors fusions to a perfect combination that get the very best of both directors ideas (very similar rare circumstances happened nearly at the same time with Walt Disney and Sidney Franklin during the work on "Bambi").If you can find it on DVD, don't miss it. It is the "blueprint" for so many scenes and plots in modern fantasy (and this including "The Lord of the Rings" too) and it lost nothing of it's power in the last 66 years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's One of a Kind -- This Thief of Bagdad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am now the proud possessor of a DVD Thief of Bagdad version which has been digitally transferred. What a pleasure it is to watch, in spite of the fact that I have seen it easily 20 times, on the first occasion 68 years ago. Despite the color film being in its infancy and special effects rather crude in comparison to that of today, the effects of both are remarkably and convincingly well done. The clarity and color of this version have only enhanced the value of this singular film that dates from the Golden Age of Filmdom.Conrad Veidt -- that incomparable film villain, Princess (June Duprez) more beautiful here, I am convinced, than Elizabeth Taylor ever was; genie Rex Ingram and of course the little "Thief" Sabu, only a short time before tending the elephants of the Sultan of Mysore, along with the rest of the cast, do a splendid job. Miklos Rozsa's musical score has to be one of the best in the annals of filmdom. I believe he won an Academy Award for it. All this and much more contribute to the ultimate in fantasy/escape cinema -- and who doesn't need escape these days, an item all too rare in contemporary films.Including interviews, outtakes, and eclipsed scenes plus a wartime Brit propaganda film, undertaken and completed with Korda's crew due the delay in completing "Thief" because of wartime problems, make this Criterion Collection version a steal at about 40 dinars -- I mean 40 dollars. Could it conceivably be any better? The answer is Yes, it could -- on a full size screen in a darkened movie theater. Sadly, I must concede, something I am not going to hold my breath waiting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you feel that if you haven't seen them make you feel slightly inadequate. I finally caught up with it some 67 years after its initial release but can't say I'm now a better person. The major selling points were the 'special' effects which are still fairly passable and must have been really impressive in 1940. The casting is, of course, all over the place; on paper all the lead characters are native to Bagdad yet top-billed Conrad Veidt was German, nominal 'star' Sabu was Indian, the romantic lead, John Justin was English and the Djinn, Rex Ingram was a Black American but probably nobody minded at the time and just revelled in the fairytale plot, the technicolour and the special effects. Pleasant enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fantastic Arabian adventure. A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus) search for Ahmad's love interest, who has been stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There's hardly a down moment here. It's always inventing new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring (there's no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is listed fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle. I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. He collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. This probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, though fictional, scenes from "The Thief of Baghdad" such as a public beheading are actually truer to the old (and current) Middle East and less slavish to political correctness than supposedly well-researched contemporary movies like "Kingdom of Heaven." Second, images of a genie materializing from smoke, flying horses, flying carpets, and a man residing underwater are dated visual effects by today's standards, but are clever, imaginative, and groundbreaking for 1940. "The Thief of Baghdad" no doubt set the stage for swashbuckling special effect successors like "Sinbad the Sailor," "Clash of the Titans," and "The Golden Voyage of Sinbad." Third, this movie has good guys versus bad guys (Ahmad &amp; Abu vs. Jaffar), romance (Ahmad &amp; the princess), humor (the battle of wits between Abu and the genie), and a series of mini-adventures within the larger adventure. It's a good formula for popcorn &amp; fun. Recommmended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the talents of numerous directors (including Ludwig Berger, the estimable Michael Powell, and Tim Whelan, as well as the uncredited contributions of producers Alexander and Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies), "The Thief of Bagdad" is a variable collection of adventures structured in the style of Saturday afternoon serials. Overrated by most critics, the fantasy concerns a deposed Arabian ruler and a young native boy thwarting the evil new king with help from a genie and a flying carpet. Classy British production aimed squarely at kid-audiences of this era; today, only nostalgic adults may go for it. There's no Robin Williams here, and the special effects are hit and miss. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ambitious, Yet Insubstantial and Insipid Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most highly rated IMDb titles, majority rule typically connotes an undeserved rating based on highly flawed perspectives of nostalgic praise, and, unfortunately, the 1940 remake of The Thief of Baghdad deserves such insinuation. As with most Technicolor films, each shot is a display of vibrant beauty and the marvelous colors that made the Technicolor process such a joy to look at; however, here is where the admiration begins and simultaneously ends, for this is a film that seems so highly ambitious that it forgets what truly counts in adventure films: the adventure! A very loose remake of the Douglas Fairbanks 1924 masterpiece of the same name, based on the writings of One Thousand and One Nights, one would imagine that a film with the credit of three(!) directors, 16 years of (presumably) increased talent in special effects, and the marvelous aesthetic of Technicolor would be such a film to behold! I can only surmise that such ambition and the seemingly unnecessary amount of directorial credit is the consequence of a rather insubstantial and insipid adventure.By far one of the most egregious anomalies in the film is the odd bisection of the thief/prince protagonist into two separate entities, rather than the use of the singular archetypal "rags to riches" character of Fairbanks' character. Here the character is split into the prince, played by John Justin, and the thief, played by Sabu, as seen and often credited in first name only. While Justin's character plays the love interest and na?ve prince to the isolated damsel-in-distress, Sabu seems almost relegated to the simpleminded thief, partly playing the lead to what little on screen adventure happens, but almost ostensibly as a vehicle of the noble savage that constantly and selflessly gets in harm's way to the benefit and protection of Justin's prince.While there are other flaws both in characters and on screen chemistry, the narrative and pace also suffers from an odd mixture of overly long flashbacks. Nearly half of the almost two hour runtime consists of a broken up flashback in the prince's perspective, and when finally told, accomplishes almost nothing but poor storytelling. The actual adventure of the film begins too late in the film to really accomplish anything, and while some of the sets are a wonder to behold, little excitement takes place to warrant the long and convoluted buildup to a weak finale.One can see a very liberal amount of "inspiration" here that would later serve Disney's Aladdin (1992), including almost identical representations in both the diabolical Jafar (here Jaffar,) and the bumbling Sultan, amongst other small details. While I don't consider it entirely fair to keep comparing it to the Fairbanks film, or even films after, I do not understand how this film is not considered an objective failure on many levels, both in direction and purely in entertainment value. Previous reviews tout a generous gaze of rose colored glasses under the guise of nostalgia, with a seemingly unanimous majority unaware of the previous silent film, while others seem to claim that such a film is nothing short of a technical and aesthetic masterpiece, and in summation should be considered a great film as a whole. Furthermore, past praise by Ebert and a generous DVD release by The Criterion Collection further project the idea that such a film is a deserved masterpiece, despite such obvious shortcomings.In conclusion, while my review may seem at times harsh, it is not a complete failure. It's certainly a lavish and pretty production with a few notable things of interest, but I would seek elsewhere in need of adventure, starting with the Fairbank's 1924 film of the same name, and especially the special effects wonders of Ray Harryhausen, be it the Arabian Nights themed Sinbad films, or the more mythological Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts. As for another film by a 1/3 of the directorial effort starring Sabu, there is always Michael Powell's (and Emeric Pressburger's) Black Narcissus, a wonderful film both technically and cinematically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prince Ahmad may well be the Prince of Bagdad but he will not rise higher due to the power of the evil wizard Jaffar (not to mention the fact that Ahmad is a dull man who cannot even spell his kingdom). So it is not long before Jaffar has betrayed him and cast into a dungeon where he is fortunate to meet young Abu ? the bestest thief in all of Baghdad. They escape the dungeon together and, in attempting to restore Ahmad to power, undertake a series of great adventures.From the very start of the film you can tell this was once a big Technicolor adventure that must have been one of the big "event" films of 1940; and bearing this in mind it is interesting to see how our current blockbusters will appear in 60 years because Thief certainly has not stood the test of time well. The basic story is good of course and it makes for an enjoyable yarn but the problem is not here ? it is in the delivery of this story. The strongest part of the delivery is the art direction which, as I said, is colourful and imaginative throughout. However this is not enough to carry it the film when so much of the film is so flat by comparison. The effects are part of this; I can cope with outdated effects but what is more difficult are very poor effects ? and shoddy superimposed jobs and things clearly on strings fall into that category. Here we have such problems and, although imaginative, I must admit that I thought they could have done better in 1940.The cast can do very little to help the situation as most are OK at best. Veidt dominates the film because he is lively and enjoyable. Sabu is fun but he can't really act and seems to think that widening his eyes will cover things ? it doesn't. Of course compared to Justin, Sabu is Brando because Justin is about as bland a matinée star as you can get. He has little character and is nothing but a chest, a chin and a smile ? a bit of a problem when you are the star of a film and certainly a problem here. Ingram is quite good as is Selten but mainly the cast are quite stiff (although not quite wooden) and more could have been made of them.Overall this is a bright and colourful film and I can understand why it won over audiences at the time and why it will still appeal to kids or those looking for some old fashioned entertainment. But, although the story and art direction is good, the cast are quite stiff, the effects very, very dates and the sense of wonder has somehow faded with them (as opposed to the impact of King Kong, for example, that is still great despite the effects being from a similar period). Worth seeing but you need to get your mind in the period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting is terribly hammy, the sets are drenched with artifice (yet are still incredibly well designed) and the plot is predictable. But that's the kind of film The Thief Of Baghdad is. It's a larger than life fantasy adventure constructed by some very capable filmmakers. Fans of Michael Powell's work will certainly see his signature here in terms of the shot designs and uses of colour. The special effects photography is quite brilliant for it's time and the film is loaded with these visual tricks. The most exciting parts of the film are the thief's adventures without the presence of the lead character King Ahmad. His encounter with a genie, fight with a giant spider and travel by magic carpet serve as the more memorable moments that will likely appeal much more to younger audiences (and this viewer) than the main plot line involving Ahmad and his love for a princess. This film has made it onto a lot of top 100 lists and I was a little bit disappointed by what I saw. It's magical and well done, but likely serves more as a nostalgia piece for a lot of viewers than a work of excellence.The film scores a few points in the cheese department. When Ahmad goes blind (not a spoiler, he's blind to begin with) he screams "My eyes! I'm BLIND!!!!" In a manner that's so over the top it parallels the performance of the lead in the last movie I watched: Maniac (1934, see reviews). The absurdity reaches a high point when the thief battles a giant spider while hanging over a pit of giant octopi (which is pretty cool). Ahmad couldn't sword fight his way out of a wet paper bag, yet he manages to defeat numerous guards. Lastly the "Arabs" in this film are so blatantly British that it's almost funny. It's indicative of the artificial nature of the picture. Nonetheless, this film is a fun fantasy adventure however when it comes to that genre, I'd much rather spend my time with a film like The Never Ending Story or Labyrinth.</fullReview>

Jaffar wants to wed a beautiful princess (June Duprez) but Ahmed also loves her. And then there's the annoying Abu (Sabu) running around...OK--this LOOKS great. The sets are beautiful, the costumes too, the Technicolor is breathtaking and the special effects are actually pretty good. But that's about it for compliments.The opening is a flashback which is VERY confusing and is really not needed. It starts the movie off badly. There's a LOUD score which is very obtrusive (I had to keep turning down the sound) and some really out of nowhere songs. The acting sucks--Justin and Duprez are wooden and have NO chemistry; Sabu is annoying--Veidt is OK. Also Rex Ingram has his moments. The plot is lousy--it wanders all over the place and has some terrible dialogue. I was basically bored. Kids will probably love this but it IS a bit violent at times.I give it a 10 for production values alone--but a 1 in every other department.</fullReview>

Well, the script aims no higher than distracting a child from moment to moment, the director settles for lousy takes, and the entire production is undermined by low values which make the movie look really shabby. This is as shallow as any blockbuster from recent years.The production is ambitious but the results are hit or miss. You have to forgive old films their small errors, but this becomes a distracting catalog of mistakes. When the Sultan gets on Jafar's mechanical horse to go for a ride, he's so heavy he shatters one of its ankles (you're not supposed to notice). Build some gigantic columns, and maybe viewers won't notice you didn't build the room (What are all these columns holding up?). The Wizard of Oz from the previous year doesn't look this bad. There's poor acting here, stupid leads, a homely princess, a grotesque post-pubescent mustache on the hero, the use of countless shots that are out of focus, horrible writing ("She lives, but isn't dead.") the continued mispronunciation of Allah (rhymes with snail-uh. ?). Worst of all is the editing which mangles the pacing; shots are held too long or matched poorly. The story feels endless and episodic, and lurches along fitfully.Conrad Veidt physically makes an excellent villain, but his German accent is a head-scratcher. Let's call it even, for giving Michael Powell some of the experience he needed to make Black Narcissus.</fullReview>
