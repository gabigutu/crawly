		<fullReview>I can't see why a retelling of a really good story gets panned. It stayed true to the original concept, that believing in something good, even if it only comes once a year, can make us better. If I may reference another Christmas classic of which there have been several worthy interpretations, "Scrooge" (1951), the young Scrooge says to the young Marley upon their meeting, "I believe the world is becoming a very hard and cruel place...". If it was that way in the 1800's, it's ten times worse today, and therefore all the more reason to be reminded of our better nature. I especially enjoyed the scene where the streets of New York City were filled with throngs of people, traffic on the bridges was stopped, all waiting for the verdict. I know NYC well, and how its people rise to such occasions. These scenes were not in the 1947 version, and I think they added a uniqueness to this version. Better, worse than the 1947 version? Neither - just different, and just as valid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humbug!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a normal level of cinema, this film is only mediocre. Where it fails is that it is a terrible remake of a well-known, well-loved film. And even worse for this film, it's a lousy remake of a well-known, well-loved film that just happens to be my favorite Christmas film of all time.It has a few positives. All right, it has one positive, and that is Richard Attenborough. He brings a genuine delight to the role of Saint Nick, and it is not hard to believe this guy could be the genuine article. Unfortunately, his performance highlights the lousy performances of many of the principles.Dorey Walker is played by Elizabeth Perkins with none of the sympathy given to her by Maureen O'Hara. It's impossible to even dream of her getting married to anyone. Some of this is to be blamed on the script, though, which spends so much time establishing Dorey's cold heart that it forgets she's supposed to be getting our sympathy, not our scorn. Which brings us to the flat performance of Dylan McDermott. He could be replaced with a cardboard cut-out without affecting the flow of the movie. Then we have Mara Wilson. She tends to be more snobby and over-confident than confused, but Wilson is up against Natalie Wood. To be fair, we never get to see Wilson chattering like a monkey for comparison purposes. That delightful scene was excised from the modern version.A rather ridiculous subplot has been added to this remake with a rival store, Shopper's Express, trying to put Cole's out of business (Macy's refused to have their name put in the film). It is headed by the popular 90's villain of choice, the Greedy Evil Mean CEO, Victor Landbergh. He doesn't play much of a role, yet he is supposed to be the encompassing bad guy, evoking images of Lex Luthor plotting the demise of Superman. He even has his own flunkies who attempt to sabotage the department store, skittering around almost like Boris and Natasha. This subplot tends to weigh down on the film, feeling forced in rather than meshing with the film. The pompous psychiatrist of the original works because it was simply one guy with a chip on his shoulder instead of a wicked retail overlord. The former is funny, while the latter is overkill.Actually, that addresses another problem with this film - it takes its subject matter far too seriously. The original film was an enjoyable farce. This one is a somber story, filled with the right glurgy turns to renew our souls or something. Basically, it's way too serious considering the subject matter (an old guy who thinks he's really Santa Claus.) The original had some laugh out loud moments of sharp humor - this one instead attempts to force you to shed tears of sadness and joy. It usually just shed tears of boredom from me.The court decision at the end of the film is not only anti-climactic, but doesn't really address the actual issue - Kris is on trial for lunacy. The only decision to save him is to prove he's REALLY Santa Claus, thus making him sane. This movie can't seem to make up its mind why he's on trial and its ultimate answer for Kris obvious acquittal would fall upon under the lightest of legal scrutiny, where the original film made a compelling legal argument. I can't answer that, but I will say that this film's answer is far off the mark. Please, I beg of you-if you have NOT seen the 1947 Black and White original, then please correct that. This is not an adequate substitute to a film that didn't need one in the first place. They even colorized the old one, so if you hate black and white, then you still have a color option without wasting your time on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch it every year. I've read negative reviews of Mara Wilson's performance but I think she is charming and smart but not at all obnoxious or know-it-all as others have said. She is acting over maturely as she was raised by her no-nonsense and jaded mother. Her subtle winks and expressions are very apropos to her role and she interacts very well with Mr. Kringle. (Perhaps I like her because she looks like my daughter when she was little.) Regardless, I love the way this story is told and Mara makes it for me. Even though logically she was taught that Santa was not real, as a little girl she was still willing to believe. Take a little joy in believing! I hope you enjoy :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Attenborough returned to acting after 14 years behind the camera in "Jurassic Park", and followed it swiftly by daring to challenge comparison with Oscar-winner Edmund Gwenn in this remake. As a heartwarmer for those inadequates who won't sit through a 60-year-old monochrome movie-- albeit one which rivals "It's a Wonderful Life" as Hollywood's answer to "A Christmas Carol"-- this John Hughes revamp will probably serve. Anyhow, there are plenty of copies on sale at the checkout of my local supermarket. But it is a bit too laid-back and, latterly, too bogged down in argument for younger kids or older boys. It may warm more cockles among the grandparents.The main thematic interest is how Hughes chooses to tweak the original screen story as adapted (unusually for the time) by the director, George Seaton. Whether he sought to or not, the remake has thrown up some intriguing twists for a more skeptical and secular time.The oldie caught the mood of an America yearning to get back to normalcy amid the perils of the post-war, Cold War world. Location shooting in New York City, with much co-operation from Macys, gave a touch of realism to the fantasy, whereas in 1994 it's an imaginary store and (for Americans, at least) an incongruously "veddy British" claimant to the chair of Santa Claus- although his nationality is not the issue when the legal meanies of the State of New York try to get him confined to the bughouse.What is striking is the judge's rationale for allowing Kris's plea for freedom. Because US bills have "In God We Trust" on them, he reasons, it means New York is allowed to have blind faith in the existence of a supernatural being who lays presents on 1.7 billion children in one night, operating from invisible workshops with reindeer which cannot be made to fly in a courtroom demonstration of his powers because it isn't Christmas Eve. Besides, the sneery prosecutor's kids were raised to believe in him, so there- case closed.In real life the ACLU would be appealing such a judgement all the way to the Supreme Court for allowing too much religion into the law and the public square. "In God We Trust" was only put on the money during the Cold War, to cock a snook at "Godless bolshevism"; but this film is refreshingly disrespectful to the newer orthodoxy of playing down most Americans' beliefs in their films.Kris asks if he should swear in the Bible, the Pope's ruling on Nicholas's sanctity is debated, and the ethos is quietly but unmistakably Christian. No "spiritual" Santa or "Happy Holidays" here. In a very light fashion, the film does revolve issues of how far it is legitimate to maintain a metaphor as a source of inspiration when rationalism of the Dawkins and Hitchens strain is sniping at it. The screenplay also looks quite beadily at the way commercial operators use holy myth to make money, even if the message comes muted from Hollywood.That is the good news. There's plenty to carp at as well.Attenborough's quiet, gentle but firm performance (most atypical of one who spent his previous acting time mainly playing unreliables or martinets) suffuses the film. He gets little competition, save from the contrasted crustiness of Windom. Most of the support is so-so, on the level of a Yuletide TV special, and not excluding little Wilson as the girl who has faith in Mr Kringle's claim to be St Nicholas. She is no Margaret O'Brien, if no worse in her way than the kewpie-doll Natalie Wood. In fact, she's a John Hughes moppet who did little later and nothing since 2000.The narrative's departures from the well shaped original are no help. Once off the legal hook, Kris, wearing a brown suit, just disappears-- we don't see any triumphal sleigh ride to bid him adieu-- while attention shifts to a ridiculous post-midnight-mass impromptu wedding in a Catholic church. Then follows a trip out to a dream house in the snowy country, ushered by a silly salesman. The film does not seem to know when to call a halt, and there's not so much as Clarence's tinkling bell to bring back Kris at the close. It's as if the whole object of the exercise was to unite two bland characters in matrimony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't tamper with perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there ever was a film that did not need a remake, the original "Miracle on 34th Street" was such a film. The original featured a virtually perfect screenplay in which everything works out right against all odds. Above all, it softened the sentimentality with some genuine satire (corporate heads who are so afraid of losing sales that they have to admit that Santa Claus exists)and, above all, with a delightful sense of ambiguity as it leaves open the possibility that Chris really is Santa Claus. The remake just pours on the sentimentality and (spoiler) even changes the ending.</fullReview>

Me and my boyfriend were up watching TV, when we ran across ABC Family and them premiering the 1994 version of Miracle on 34th Street. My boyfriend immediately stopped channel surfing and asked if I liked the movie. When I told him I had never seen the movie, he insisted we watch it. I do have to say, this movie was happy, and at time cheesy, but overall it was a good movie. It's honestly not my favorite Holiday movie out there?still, I enjoyed watching it and feeling the spirit of Christmas?believing. If you're looking for a good holiday movie that will lift your spirits, try this one out. But me, personally, I would grab Elf or the Grinch before I would grab this movie?but that's just my opinion.For daily movie reviews visit: http://kimsmoak.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good effort, but not up to par with the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is a decent film on its own, but can't compare to the original version. It lost me right from the beginning with juvenile humour (making the bad Coles Santa the butt of jokes), and never won my interest back. I was particularly disappointed in the ending. The original ending drew the necessary distinction between proving that Santa existed and proving that the gentleman known as Kris Kringle was Santa. For some inexplicable and unjustifiable reason, the remake glosses over that distinction. This cheapened the rest of the film for me. I also preferred the ending in the original version. While I like the direct God/Santa comparison in the remake (suggesting that Santa works through others his miracles to perform), I prefer the manner in which the family obtains their house in the original version. It's a lot more meaningful if they have never seen the house before that minute, as the randomness factor hints more strongly at Kris's actually being Santa.In the same vein, I thought Kris acted too mentally inadequate in this version, talking about the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny as if they were real, and addressing a local reindeer as if it were one of his own. Santa becomes less a person than an ideal of behaviour and attitude, as the overly sentimental script keeps reminding us. He inspires other people to do things instead of being able to do them himself. I suppose that's the point the film is making, but all the same I prefer the less heavy-handed approach of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read many reviews of this film and the original and I was shocked by some of them. I saw this version of the film first and I was amazed. It is a warm, decent, traditional film about courage, faith and hope, that motivates to fight against evil and protect the good. Later I saw the original 1947 version and I liked it, but I can't say it was better than this version. It is difficult to compare after you see one film and love it and then see another version like it more than than the first you saw. But after all I like the new ideas of this film. They are really improvements of the story and the film fits more for the current audience, since less generations lie between it and the film. The film is really well done and Richard Attenborough is a fantastic Santa Claus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty darn awesome remake. It may bring some extra 90's cheese, mostly due to the needlessly dramatic music, and it may be overlong in places, but this certainly works. Attenborough is the only person I could imagine taking over this role. He comes across as a genuinely kind and considerate man, with nothing but kindness in his heart. Like the original, it keeps silent as to whether he is Santa or not. The court scene is particularly funny, with a few fist pumping moments. I'd still pick the original, but if you can't sit your whole family down in front of a black and white film, this certainly doesn't offend the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely remake of the incomparable 40's classic, another gift from John Hughes to the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorey (Elizabeth Perkins) and her daughter, Susan (Mara Wilson) live in New York City, where Dorey works for a long-established department store called Coles. It's Thanksgiving Day and Dorey is in charge of the Coles' parade through Manhattan. Naturally, things don't go as planned when the Santa she hired turns up tipsy and belligerent. But, very fortunately, a kind, white-bearded gentleman, Kris (Sir David Attenborough) is in the right place at the right time. He saves the day with his wonderful parade presence and Dorey hires him to be in the in-store Santa from that day forward. Going home to Susan, the two gals have a handsome dinner guest, lawyer-neighbor Bryan (Dylan McDermott) to share their turkey and trimmings. Bryan is in love with Dorey but, she is very reluctant to encourage his affections for she was jilted long ago and left with the sole responsibility for Susan. A nearby department discount chain, Shopper's Express, is mighty peeved at Coles' new Santa, for he begins to turn things around for the ailing Coles. Sabotaging his performance, they get dear Kris sent to jail on various charges. Dorey begs Bryan to represent Kris in a trial that will decide if he is, truly, Santa Claus. But, can Bryan succeed at winning Kris' freedom and stature as well as securing Dorey's heart? We'll see! The old classic, with Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara, is still the definite version of this tale but this one comes awfully close in charming its viewing audience. First, the cast is marvelous, with Perkins, McDermott, Attenborough and darling little Wilson giving very nice performances. The supporting cast, including J.T. Walsh, is also wonderful. Then, director and writer Hughes has added some nice touches and modern situations to the timeless tale, making it feel "more up-to-date". All of the production values, from costumes to sets to camera work, are of the finest. In short, don't shy away from this new version, even if you love the original. Both of them are magical in their own unique ways. March up your street and get this one for the holidays, or, indeed, any time you need a shot of that warm, happy feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the 1970's version of this on TV. I had not yet seen the 1947 version until after I saw this one. I liked all three versions but I really like this one the best. I usually don't like remakes because they tend to totally change the story or they just add some unnecessary dirty words, nudity, violence or sex scenes. This remake was very good. I don't see why people are so against it. There are many versions of A Christmas Carol and yet few seem upset by that. I liked the dollar bill evidence much more than the post office evidence near the end. I loved the scene in which the citizens of NY city showed their belief in Santa Claus. I also felt that the reason why Kris Kringle struck out at the man was much more realistic in this version than in others. Maureen O'Hara is one of my favorite actors. ( yes the screen actors guild uses the term actor meaning "one who acts" for males and females. ) The 1947 version is well acted and charming. The 1994 version is a movie that stands on it's own and is delightful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some movies in which one watches in life which has no real intention but to make a person feel good about not only themselves but for the collective people. Miracle on 34th Street does this for me. Not only does the performance of all the cast make this memorable but the there is no real person which you end up hating, except maybe 2. This is a must movie for all Christmas lovers out there who just want a tale told to them which will make them as warm as that eggnog they drink that night, (unless you drink it cold like in Australia). Brilliant movie which I watch every Christmas. In conclusion, it is a movie which once watching it and allowing one's self to be captivated by its charm, one finally feels like a kid again. And anyway which is worse? 'A lie that brings a smile, or a truth which draws a tear' Best Santa I have seen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the original movie which has since become a classic. When the movie was remade, I was excited about seeing an updated version. The remake is not heartwarming and this sort of movie should be heartwarming. Parts of the remake are very good and, with the exception of Richard Attenborough, all of the actors were very good. The much respected Mr. Attenborough just did not seem like Santa. I watched the movie this past Christmas with family and friends (about 20 of us) and discovered that I was not alone with my discomfort with the part of Santa. The children made comments about him that were surprisingly uncomplimentary. I'm sure the comments were not intended to be commentary on him as a person but almost everyone thought that another actor could have played the part better than he did. The end of the trial, while an interesting twist, did not quite come together well as in the original movie. The end of the movie did not bring a smile to my face. I really wanted to like this movie but after seeing it again, it still falls short. While the original movie is very dated, it remains the superior movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as magical as I'd hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake wasn't as magical and full of Christmas spirit as I hoped it would be. Unfortunately, the movie was kinda boring and dull instead of being sweet and fun to watch and enjoy. Elizabeth Perkins was good in it though, and was well casted in her lead role. So that's one plus to it. The little girl that stars in the flick was pretty good, not the best though. But I didn't have a real big issue with the casting overall. It was the lack of substance and weak script I took issue with here. The script and dialogue is kind of dull and lack luster in this movie. It's not a god awful film, but it's certainly not the magical Christmas ride you might expect. It is family friendly though, with the exception of a couple of bad words. So if you want a Christmas movie that's OK for the kiddos, then this might be for you. But in my opinion, this movie just wasn't that good, it had some potential, but I feel like it squandered that good potential. 4/10 for Miracle on 34th Street.</fullReview>

If... you can't believe, if you can't accept anything on faith, then you're doomed for a life dominated by doubt. Kris Kringle tells us this, and the movie tells us this. It shows us that Kris Kringle, Santa Clause, Saint Nicholas.. is a symbol. A symbol of faith, and a symbol of hope. Christmas is not for children, or for those who are young. Christmas is for all, and if you believe Christmas Miracles can come true. Hope is the greatest of the gifts you'll receive. Christmas and Santa Clause gives us hope.</fullReview>

Mara Wilson's performance is second to none, possibly the best of her career, and Richard Attenborough and Dylan McDermott shine. The soundtrack is great, with none of those modernised commercial (and fake-sounding) carols, but orchestrated re-creations of old favourites by Bruce Broughton. Of course, it's not just the actors (and of course, actresses) and soundtrack that make a film; cinematography and direction play just as big a part, and Miracle on 34th Street (1994) proves this. Les Mayfield and Julio Macat do a great job reworking of George Seaton 's 1947 screenplay.Again, if you see one Christmas movie this year, make it Miracle on 34th Street (1994); I gave it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this is without question my favourite Christmas movie, and am disappointed with the number of people who feel the need to bad mouth it. This movie should not be viewed as a remake of what is admittedly a very good film, but as a modern classic that stands on its own two feet and successfully imparts the spirit of Christmas to a new generation who would otherwise be uninterested in the 1947 version. Indeed, I myself would never have bothered watching the original, until I had seen this. The performance from all the leads is excellent, and Richard Attenborough (who's yet to prove that he's not Santa) and Mara Wilson, are particularly strong. Miracle on 34th street, successfully warms the heart and in places (the scene with the deaf girl, the signs all around NYC declaring people's faith in Kris and the crowds outside the courtroom to name but a few) still sends tingles down my spine every time I see it. Maybe I am overly sentimental, but hey, this is a Christmas movie after all... This film demonstrates just what humanity is capable of if we would just open our minds and, for once, maybe just accept something on faith alone. And I ask you... what can be wrong with that?</fullReview>

A good holiday flick for the whole family.

Mara Wilson is fantastic as the young Susan Walker. I feel that even though she is the smallest of the cast members, she leads them perfectly. If Chritmas films do nothing for you, then show it to your kids, because i am positive that they will love and cherish it. While some disagree, i would say that this movie was a great remake of the 1934 film. If this movie wasn't re-made i don't think i would of even heard of the original. I think the movie was in much need of a re-vamping so that younger people, like myself, would be able to addapt the movie more and to understand it a little bit better. I felt Richard Attenborough was a great Santa who was believable. I would recommend this movie 100%.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1994 remake of Miracle on 34th Street was updated by writer and producer John Hughes already flying high with his Home Alone films and he manages to snag Richard Attenborough who was coaxed out of acting retirement a year earlier by Steven Spielberg for Jurassic Park.The original is regarded as a classic in America but not as well known in the UK and here I could see this film in its own merits.Hughes has followed the story of the original film with a department store executive Dorey Walker (Elizabeth Perkins) and her young daughter Susan (Mara Wilson) who do not care much for the spirit of Christmas. Dorey hires a venerable old man Kriss Kringle (Richard Attenborough) at the last minute when the usual Santa is found drunk. Kriss quickly becomes popular even if it means by always telling the truth that he directs people to rivals stores for toys because it would be cheaper there.The store is subject to a hostile takeover from a rival and part of the shenanigans means that Kriss believes that he really is Santa Claus and finds himself in court to be declared insane.The film is a decent family drama and although updated for a more cynical age which includes more disbelievers and non-nuclear families it does have plenty of festive spirit that families would enjoy but is never spectacular.The film turns on the revelation contained on a dollar bill but personally if I had written the film I would had just told the Judge to look behind him. Most American courtrooms have the Judge sitting in front of the words 'In God we trust!'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the message is the important detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it is not exactly a remake. it is not , in real sense, a version of 1947's movie. because it looking be different. using new scenes, imposing new images and new sides of known characters. Mara Wilson is far to be another Nathalie Wood. she has the usual charm and courage to create a role in her style. Miracle on 34th Streed is a good demonstration. Richard Attenborough is a profound different Santa. and that is the essence of film - to say a story, its story, to a public who is not the public from 1947. the result - a Christmas movie who is more than decent. it is nice, moral, a lesson about the essence of mankind, a smart and touching definition of the spirit of a special holiday. a film who must be discovered not as adversary of the original but as package for a noble message. because that is its fundamental purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great Richard Attenborough but not a good reason to remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorey Walker (Elizabeth Perkins) is the producer of the Christmas parade for Cole's department store. Kris Kringle (Richard Attenborough) is shocked at the drunken Santa in the parade. Dorey quickly puts Kris Kringle in to replace the drunk. Her daughter Susan (Mara Wilson) doesn't believe in Santa because her mother explained it all to her. Bryan Bedford (Dylan McDermott) is Dorey's boyfriend. Dorey hires Kris Kringle as the store's Santa who becomes popular for recommending shoppers to other stores. Susan is taken with the new Santa and starts to believe that he's the real deal. There is a rival store Shopper's Express which tries to sabotage Kris Kringle by getting him arrested.There is the great Richard Attenborough and a cute little girl. There is nothing wrong with the acting. The script is a little dated. Some of the simpler elements seem charming in the original but seem naive in the modern version. This one has very little to offer other than Attenborough. Also for some reason, they got rid of the post office plot line. The mailbags piled into the courtroom is probably the most compelling scene in the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was first introduced to the 1947 classic of the same name , when I was just eight years old. I knew nothing about Natalie wood , , New YORK or MACY's department store. Watching the original, was nothing short of a MAGICAL experience!! I feel in love with New York, Ed Gwynn , JOHN PAYNE , MAUREEN OHARA , and of course , Natalie Wood. , and MACY's !! It became a tradition , each year that followed, that MIRACLE ON 34th street , would be required viewing as son as the American thanksgiving was underway!! I've lost count of how many times I have watched this movie ( I went out and bought the DVD because for some insane reason , 3 years ago , the movie was not being shown on any channel ?!? )All that being said, I have to admit , I was a bit disappointed with the 1994 version. Yes Mara Wilson was cute as a button , and spot on as the the skeptical little girl. But I found this version lacked one key factor - MACYS !!! In this version , Macy's isn't even mentioned. For some reason, after the producers when all out to find the perfect cast , they couldn't get the real Macy's to agree to let miracle, use macys !!! This , I beili really hurt the film . What they should have done was worked harder to get the Macy's name, or not release it at all . I think not getting permission, was a game changer / deal breaker .Trust me., forget this version , and watch the original, and experience the magic!! And whatever you do stay FAR AWAY from the so called television remake that was released in the 70's that starred Sebastian Cabot , and JANE Alexander and David Hartman ewwwwww.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull But Respectable Remake of a Classic Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" director John Hughes has done an admirable job reworking writer &amp; director George Seaton's Santa Claus on trial classic "Miracle on 34th Street" but he has made some interesting as well as creative changes with the narrative. The names of various characters have been altered and certain incidents from the original have been enlarged. First, the psychiatrist named Sawyer has been omitted. Second, Hughes has added some melodrama in the form of a villainous department store owner struggling to implement a takeover bid. This villain has a henchman who exploits the drunken Santa Claus that Kris Kringle revealed. The names of popular department stores, such as Macy's and Gimbals', have been altered, too, to fictional stores. .Hughes has taken certain liberties that were not done in the original. Elizabeth Perkins is far more reserved than Maureen O'Hara as the heroine, but she is incredibly sincere. Dylan McDermott is perfect as John Payne's replacement who is an attorney who desperately sets out to woo the Perkins heroine. If anybody bestows a sense of dignity to this respectable remake, actor/director Richard Attenborough does so as Kris Kringle. The strong supporting cast consists of James Remar as the rival department store owner's henchman; J.T. Walsh as the public prosecutor, and Robert Prosky plays Judge Henry Harper. Unfortunately, the remake lacks the passion of the original. There is no mail bag scene, and the Judge issues his ruling based on the circled words "In God We Trust" on a one dollar bill that secures Kringle's release. Like the original, the Santa Claus definitely believes that he is the one and only Santa. This "Miracle on 34th Street" is appropriate for our enlightened, cynical age and doesn't touch the commercialism of Christmas issue. Les Mayfield does a good job of shepherding the remake through to its inevitable conclusion. Alvin Greenman is the only cast member from the original, but he doesn't play a department store janitor this time. Instead, he is cast as a doorman. Although it lacks the spontaneity of the original, you may enjoy this version more. Inevitably, the two romantic leads unite at fade-out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>None of the fun the 1947 version had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I believe a great film can be updated to fit more recent times, the 1994 remake of the 1947 classic Miracle on 34th Street is an example of how good intentions can go astray.I thought Richard Attenborough did a fine job in the lead role. The spirit of the film was truly much like the original version. Where they went wrong was getting too heavily into the serious plots?the scenes between Mrs. Walker and the attorney were too long and too detailed, without being humorous at all.{Spoiler alert} One scene near the end was troubling to me. They appeared in a Catholic church after midnight Mass and the priest was happy to marry them even though they obviously had not agreed to get married beforehand. This isn't Las Vegas. Any normal minister on seeing that the couple had not really planned on getting married, but were just then considering it, would have wanted to wait until they were sure before performing a ceremony.What really hurt was that most of the scenes from the original that made it such a fun film were eliminated in the remake. The comical interaction between Kris and Susan as he tried to let her learn to pretend, and, most significantly, the great courtroom scene where all the huge bags of mail were carried in, convincing the judge that the postal service considers Kris to be Santa were not in the remake.In fact, the "big courtroom scene" had the judge all ready with his verdict, then, on seeing one familiar phrase on the back of a dollar bill, suddenly rendering a totally different verdict on a rather flimsy bit of logic. In the original, the judge's dilemma was saved by thousands of pieces of unexpected evidence. In the remake, the judge changed his mind over seeing something that he could easily have thought about on his own?the concept of trusting someone or something you can't see is not unique to the phrase on the our money.I will agree that the 1994 Kris had more reason to strike his antagonist in the remake?but the scenes of him being tormented were not fun to watch. When he struck at the man, he swung his cane quite hard?hard enough to have done some real damage, which is something I'd like to think a real St. Nicholas would simply not do. In the original, he was simply frustrated at the annoying Macy's employee and gave a light tap that clearly would not have seriously hurt anyone.Even the opening scene in the remake removed the humor of the original. I remember well how I was impressed the first time I saw the original, where Kris is walking down the street and happens to see reindeer and a Santa figure in a display window, and he knocks on the door and proceeds to instruct the man that he has the reindeer misarranged. The 1994 version simply has Kris standing at a stop light and when the man beside him says that the little boy next to him thinks Kris is Santa Claus, he leans over and whispers, "I am Santa Claus." Ho-ho-dull.</fullReview>

It gives a preview of the Christmas season and what's its all about.While the original Miracle on 34th street is a classic, its very, very dated. I actually prefer to watch this updated version. I wouldn't change a thing except Elizabeth Perkins. She didn't quite fit the part. It's also a pleasure to listen to the symphonic score soundtrack. Bruce Broughton did a wonderful job catching the emotions and feelings of both the actors and season.Some would argue that this movie should have never been made. I say shame on you. There is always room for the re-telling of classic stories. While this movie isn't perfect, it still catches the spirit of the original and simply finds a different path to the end. It will always be part of my Christmas season movie list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, in my opinion, is another one of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen. If you ask me, it was really funny when Kris Kringle (Richard Attenborough) punched out the drunk Santa (Jack McGee). I was also really moved when Bryan (Dylan McDermott) and Dorey (Elizabeth Perkins) started dating. Also, in my opinion, Susan (Mara Wilson) was a really well-behaved kid. She makes this holiday smash worth seeing. In conclusion, I highly recommend this holiday smash to everyone, especially all you Richard Attenborough or Elizabeth Perkins fans who have not seen it.

		<shortDescription>You Really Can't Get Too Much of This Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few things are more amusing that reading the comments from the crybaby dishrags who whine about remaking a classic like "Miracle On 34th Street" (1947). How are these weepy rants helpful? Did it need to be remade? No. But the source material is good enough that any number of professionally done remakes would still be entertaining. If this 1994 version had been the original, people would already be crowning it with the classic tag.But it is not the original. It strikes a decent compromise by keeping many of the original story elements, deleting some, updating others, and making a few generally ill-advised additions. There are even some clear improvements. Elizabeth Perkins and Mara Wilson are a much better mother and daughter match than Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara. There is a real chemistry between them and the producers appear to have grasped this connection. This "Miracle" is told much more from their respective points of view and in that sense is much more their story than in the original. Wilson brings a focus and intensity to her roles that few child actors can match. She gave a similar performance the next year in Matilda. Perkins is one of those actresses you don't really notice at first, memorable in "Big" and "Speak" for performances filled with subtle nuances.It is no surprise that Richard Attenborough falls short of the Edmund Gwenn standard but that was Gwenn's signature role; and as much a part of cinema history as Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch. But look for the sequence where Wilson pulls his beard and discovers it is real-this is one of the great all-time scenes.As long as Perkins and/or Wilson are being featured, the film works quite well. And it really only stumbles seriously during the courtroom scene and during the subplot elements featuring James Remar and Jane Leeves. The film staggers along a bit but recovers itself in time for an original and very effective conclusion. As Roger Ebbert said, while it will never replace the original; this is a sweet, gentle, good-hearted film that stays true to the spirit of the original and doesn't try to make everything slick and exploitative. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Film For The Christmas Season</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th Street is a movie fit for anyone who has become jaded and cynical over the years. It encompasses everything that makes the Christmas season beautiful and fun including the parade after Thanksgiving many look forward to, characters with an overflowing amount Christmas spirit, as well as the incredulous characters that are always present in Christmas movies. The film shares the plot of the 1947 classic, Miracle on 34th Street, however the director, Les Mayfield, incorporates a few differences to fit more modern times. The movie's beginning scenes take place at the Cole's Thanksgiving Day Parade. In the film, Cole's has replaced Macy's on New York's 34th Street. It opens with white-bearded Kriss Kringle scolding an intoxicated man who was hired to portray Santa Claus in the parade. When the drunk makes a complete fool of himself, the Cole's parade director, Dorey Walker, approaches Kriss Kringle and asks that he take on the role of Santa Claus, not only for the parade, but also for Cole's department store. Miracle on 34th Street conveys an important message to every viewer, that there is a hope for skeptics that have lost all hope in magic and miracles. Kriss Kringle is not just a man in a red suit sitting in the middle of a department store, he is a symbol of all that is good about Christmas.The film argues that if people no longer have any faith in Santa Claus and all he represents, then the world has become a sad, hopeless place. Dorey Walker, and her daughter Susan, are non- believers. The mother and daughter are both very practical, and to them, Santa Claus is nothing more than a myth. Susan even says talking to Santa in Cole's is, "a pointless exercise" due to her disbelief. Because of their lack of faith, the Christmas season is extremely bleak for the two of them. Bryan Bedford, a lawyer and the Walkers' neighbor, teams up with Kriss Kringle to teach the Walkers about the spirit of Christmas.One of the most memorable events throughout the whole film occurs when Kriss Kringle is declared insane after allegedly beating another man with his cane. These events tug at your heartstrings, and will have you rooting for Kriss to beat the evil guys. Kringle experiences a trial that would ultimately determine his future. Bryan Bedford fights with Kringle to prove his innocence and his true identity. During this portion of the movie, Bedford calls upon many witnesses, one of them being a child around the age of six. Bedford questions the child of Kringle's authenticity. The young witness, Daniel, then states that he believes Kriss is the one and only Santa Claus. When asked how he can be sure Daniel says, "Cause he looks like Santa Claus. Oh, and he's very nice."Although the plots between the 1947 and the 1994 versions are extremely similar, the director, Les Mayfield, made a significant change in the script in how Bedford chooses to verify Kriss' identity. In the 1947 version, Kriss Kringle is identified through the post office forwarding all of Santa's mail to Kringle's home. However, in the remake, Bedford uses brilliant logic on Kriss' behalf. He utilizes a $1 bill and the phrase "In God We Trust" to validate Kringle's identity. Bedford uses the expression "In God We Trust" to signify that it is socially acceptable to put your faith in something that you can neither see nor physically touch.Casting for 1994's Miracle on 34th Street varies from brilliant to unsatisfying. Richard Attenborough's excellent portrayal of Kriss Kringle recollects Edmund Gwenn's Oscar-winning performance without copying it. Young Mara Wilson performs as a captivating character who grabs hold of your heart and doesn't let go. However, Elizabeth Perkins and Dylan McDermott, who portray Dorey Walker and Bryan Bedford, pale in comparison to the 1947 edition's Maureen O'Hara and John Payne ("Internet Movie Database"). Les Mayfield, the director of the 1994 classic, took on an almost impossible challenge when he decided to remake the beloved 1947 film. The original had set standards for every Christmas movie created afterward. This modern update is a charming, compassionate, sweet movie that stays true to the spirit of the original. It captures the true meaning of the Christmas season, and remains an outstanding family feature even today. The movie itself is nostalgic, sweet, and manipulative, which makes it so easy to love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't yet seen the original Miracle On 34th Street film, so until then I'll focus on Les Mayfield's pristine 1994 update. It's a warmhearted delight of a piece, painted in bold, kindly strokes and starring Richard Attenborough in a wonderful, childlike, good natured yet vulnerable performance as Kris Kringle, and elderly gent living in New York City who is convinced that he is really Father Christmas. Like.. for real. Little Susan Walker (Mara Wilson) believes and befriends him. Wilson was a child actress staple in the 90's, also making adorable impressions in Matilda and Mrs. Doubtfire. She's precious here, full of wonder and blooming compassion that's kindled by spirited Kringle. Her mother (Elizabeth Perkins) is in charge of the Macy's Christmas parade and when the drunken Santa she's hired acts a damn fool and is fired, Kringle steps up to the plate. He's a hit, and when word gets out of his belief in himself as the real Santa, controversy stirs, in trademark obnoxious New York fashion. And so a media hooplah leads to a hysterical court case to prove whether Kringle is the real deal. He's defended by compassionate lawyer Dylan McDermott and prosecuted by a smarmy J.T. Walsh, always welcome. There's also work from James Remar as corrupt hoodlum Jack Duff who has a hilarious turn of faith near the end, Robert Prosky as New York's crankiest judg, and appearances from Jennifer Morrison, Jane Leeves, Allison Janney, Mary Mckormack, Jack Mcgee and Joss Ackland. The film comes out a winner thanks to Wilson and especially Attenborough, who plays Kringle with a frank naivety and beaming soul, qualities which everyone hopes and expects to see in Father Christmas, should he really be out there somewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20 year later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so happy to watch this movie 20 years after it was first released. First, i am still kicking but second, the movie has held up well. Like the first version this version seems just as timeless. For anyone who avoided the thinking the remake would not be as good. I think it's time to cast those fears away and give it a try. Much like the First, his court case is dismissed due to Federal Government's benignly coming to the rescue. Unlike the post office (which we know today would not send Santa Mail to the court) a perhaps better escape comes in with "In God We Trust" on a dollar bill... But in another 20 years this too may be something of the past considering the direction we are heading.Some scenes like the wanna-be Santa and the doctor needing a new x ray machine are missing and the tangible proof of the Cane are gone (shame since this cane was so ornate). But all in all, I found I could watch both the old and new back to back and still enjoy them both.Mara Wilson (Susan) take the spotlight just a Natalie Wood did in the first release. What is strange is her name in the credits and here on IMDb... 10th down the list here on IMDb and hard to find in the film's Cast List.... Seems the Hollywood People were to vein to give her a higher billing.... Shame... but that's Hollywood - Actors - Phhhh - almost all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1994 Attenborough-Perkins-McDermott re-make is a mixed bag, but overall I like it. I look forward to seeing it every year.PROS:1 - Mara Wilson very nicely plays the part of little Susan, a child old-beyond-her-years.2 - Attenborough is thoroughly touching as a Santa burdened by the troubles of the world, but soldiering on. His set scenes (e.g., with Perkins, and the little deaf girl) are quite moving. He trumps Gwenn here, but this is a post-modern interpretation, and may not appeal to those expecting a traditional, but less deep, interpretation. Edmund Gwenn really set the standard for Santa as a holly, jolly elf.3 - I like the more heavily-emphasized "romantic comedy" aspects. Perkins and McDermott make an attractive couple. (But sometimes Perkins is a little too jaded. Showing a bit more vulnerability under her facade of toughness would have helped in one or two scenes.) But overall, as a man and woman who are destined to be together, I thought they worked well.CONS:1 - The "evil business man" is very disconnected from the plot, overly dramatic, and clichd. He is the "devil" here, but none of the key characters knows that. 2 - The trap set for Kris is a little too realistic.3 - The outed Santa is a little too evil.4 - Jane Leeves is practically missing on screen. 5 - I don't like Santa movies that mix references to the Legendary Figures with Church history. Pick one explanation and stick with it. And since this is supposedly a more adult version of the tale, the references to the Legendary Figures and magic really strike a dissonant note.I imagine that the early script meetings for this remake focused on "modernizing" the key conflict and pushing the "rom-com" aspects. In that regard, they succeeded quite well. But in so doing, they lost some of the sappy heart of the Gwenn-O'Hara-Payne version.The 1947 Gwenn-O'Hara-Payne version is relentlessly upbeat and comedic, with just a few downbeats to establish a little bit of conflict and dramatic tension.This 1994 version adds more (and deeper) down notes. I find the result interesting and more mature. It is enjoyable but not quite fully satisfying. And I suspect it won't be everyone's cup of tea.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this modern-day remake of the old Christmas classic, but with some reservations. First of all, let me compliment Richard Attenborough's performance as the is-he-or-isn't-he modern-day Santa Claus, even if he plays it with an avowed English accent. He interacts sweetly with the children in the cast in particular and with a twinkle never far away from his eye, gets you rooting for him at the climactic trial scene by the end. He performs no "miracles" per se but still convinces you of his identity with his innocence, charm and sincerity. As for the rest of the cast, I'm not so sure. Elizabeth Perkins and Dylan McDermott as the yuppie couple bound to get together, lack warmth and seem just too perfect with their stylish clothes and coiffured hair. Worse, Mara Wilson as the little-miss-know-it-all 6-going-on 60 daughter of Perkins, really could just be a female Macauley Culkin, which was no doubt the aim but still isn't a good thing. There are some nice support turns though, especially Robert Prosky as the humane judge and JT Walsh as the persecuting counsel but they don't quite offset the main leads mentioned above. The seasonal shots of New York are a treat for the eye and with a pleasant Christmas-themed soundtrack too, this is enjoyable seasonal fare, well worth taking a break from gift-wrapping, to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tend to be cautiously optimistic when it comes to remakes, and had a little more faith than usual in this one, as much as I like Richard Attenborough. What bothered me more than anything is that what I'm seeing in this film is "Santa with an ego." For all of Santa's selflessness, compassion, and belief in what he does, it goes against all those qualities to see him on the defensive in terms of any heckling in a department store where kids are waiting in line to sit on his lap, as well as being quickly drawn to strike the same guy who presented no real threat to him on the street other than continued heckling. What also bothered me was the lack of substance I saw in the resolution. In the original, Kris's lawyer found a legal loophole for the government to recognize him as the real Santa, while here an apparent parallel philosophy to the belief in Santa is enough for a judge to make his ruling of--I'm not sure what. There is indeed plenty of holiday warmth in this film, but no strong reasoning to what is at stake, on either side, in the plot. I've read enough reviews to see what reasons others have found that lead them to like the movie, and I have no problem if they keep watching it based on that. For me, it just simply did not have a strong foundation to make it a good movie, even without comparing it to the 1947 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch the original again.I often but NOT ALWAYS like the originals a little better than the remakes. In this case I like it WAY better. One of my main problems is Mara Wilson. I can't put my finger on it but I didn't like her for the role of Susan.Other than that it just didn't have the presence the 1st film had. I'd have to re-watch it to give you more specifics and I don't intend to do that.If you haven't seen the other one I recommend you watch this one and then watch it.If you've already seen the 1947 version just walk away you will not care for this one. It might stand on it's own but it doesn't hold up in the shadow of such a classic work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much better that I thought it would be, but why would John Hughes choose a movie that's practically impossible to top an earlier version.The parts that I found irritating were trademark John Hughes like the drunk Santa showing his butt-crack. Still the story maintains its Christmas charm, with good performances from Richard Attenborough as Kriss Kringle and Mara Wilson as Susan Walker, but neither compare to Edmund Gwenn and Natalie Wood, respectively. I wonder how $$ Santa had in his sack to convince George Seaton, the 1947 version's director and screen-writer, to write another version of his inimitable classic There are so many other better Christmas movies out there, not to mention the 1947 version. It seems a shame that the film-makers tried to redo a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great example of a good Christmas film that can be enjoyed by all ages. I haven't seen the original so cannot compare the two but the fact that both are often packaged together on DVD shows that both must be equally liked.The story makes for by and large easy enough viewing with some captivating performances by Attenborough and young Mara Wilson. The film captures the spirit of Christmas well and the action moves towards its conclusion well. There are several well crafted scenes and some magical moments that make this a classic Christmas film.It may be a little long for some people and the ending a little contrived but it remains a fun Christmas film that is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better remakes out there, but I am not going to lie, the original is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is for me one of the better remakes out there, but it lacks the charm, magic and heart of the original, which I consider one of the best Christmas movies of all time for several reasons(Edmund Gwenn's performance being a pivotal one).So what were the film's flaws? Well while I thought the last act was very well done and strong, the first act especially is rather juvenile and is hard to get into. The script lacks sparkle and could have done with more sophistication, and I found Dylan McDermott rather flat as Bryan Bedford.However, it is beautifully filmed, perhaps looking a little more slicker than the original, and the score is sweet. The direction is good on the whole, while with the exception of McDermott the acting is fine. As Kris Kringle, Richard Attenborough positively twinkles and is easily the best actor in the film(though I still prefer Edmund Gwenn), and Mara Wilson, a very talented child actress, is undoubtedly charming as Susan. Elizabeth Perkins also gives a good performance as the somewhat cold-hearted yet sympathetic Dorey Walker.Overall, a decent remake but lacks the sparkle of the original. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1994 version of Miracle on 34th Street is a remake of the classic 1947 version. It is known to be a great movie to bring holiday cheerfulness to everyone who views it. It is about a little girl who doesn't believe in Santa Claus and then meets a white haired, jolly old man who says he is St. Nick himself. It is a very cute movie to watch with family and friends.The 1994 version goes into more depth than the old version. It also has a different ending. I'm not a fan of how the '94 version ends. I feel that it never should have been changed. This might be a spoiler for anyone who hasn't seen the '47 version, but I enjoyed how all the mail sent to Kris Kringle (Santa Claus) was dumped on the judge's desk. It was a very clear and cute ending. I feel that the newer ending is kind of unclear. All that it says is that everyone must believe in something or someone.I also don't agree with the love scene in the new version. In the old version, the director successfully got away with excluding a love scene. The attention was more toward Kris Kringle and Susan spending time together. It seems that almost every movie has a love story these days and I feel that the love scene between Dorey and Bryan is very unnecessary.If I were to recommend someone a good Christmas movie, Miracle on 34th Street would be a great choice. Except, I would recommend the original 1947 version, but they are both</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that Hollywood likes nothing better than setting up lovable eccentrics as funny farm fodder and then having them beat the rap in a courtroom finale - think of Mr Deeds Goes To Town, Rosie, even Harvey for God's sake. Often, of course - Longfellow Deeds, Rosie - there is money behind the motive and in this ill-judged remake (if it ain't broke don't fix it) money is once again behind the rival store's framing of Kris Kringle. Okay, the last movie that needed remaking was the original Miracle On 34th Street with its charismatic cast of Edmund Gwen, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne and Natalie Wood, but it HAS been remade so we're stuck with it. Dickie-all-I-want-is-knighthood-Attenborough is surely one of the most overrated actors on the planet yet he gives it the old college try even if you can see the technique a mile away. As for the lovers the less said the better and it surely speaks volumes that Macey's - who were more than happy to be associated with the original - wanted no part of this turkey even passing up free publicity. Okay, if you're ten years old and have never heard of the original this is acceptable, if you're between ten and twenty it's just about passable but if you're older than twenty why bother with this when the original is out there just waiting to be discovered and/or rediscovered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie on numerous occasions and although it's pleasant it's just not as good as the 1947 original, which is timeless. Maureen O'Hara and John Payne were superb in the lead roles. Richard Attenborough, for my money just wasn't quite Santa-like enough in the remake. Maybe more beard? I don't understand why anyone thought that a remake was a good idea. It's hard to do better than an original which is almost perfect already. The only thing I would say is that young Mara Wilson turned in a better performance than Natalie Wood. Dylan McDermott is also cute and was right for the role in this movie, but to be honest the performance was different but no better than John Payne's in the original. The money spent on making this film could have been better spent on something more original. They were onto a loser from the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as remakes of classics go this is certainly one of the better examples. The great strength of this film is the casting which throughout matches the excellent class of the original, and this is no mean achievement.Occasionally the writers felt the need to deviate from the original - perhaps once or twice too often, because the original story was quite modern anyway, i.e. it did not need much updating. Some of these deviations work pretty well (the midnight wedding was a great new idea although left a bit underdeveloped), others very much less so. Using Joss Ackland as a cross between Ebenezer Scrooge and Ernst Stavro Blofeld was a bit daft, but the only real disaster is the resolution of the court case, one of the highlights of the original and a MAJOR let-down in this version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dylan McDermott (Mr. Gailey), Richard Attenborough (Kris Kringle), and Mara Wilson (the girl) are fine, but Elizabeth Perkins is miserable as Mrs. Walker, the girl's mom. She mumbles her lines with no intensity or feeling. Also, in the original there were some dramatic twists that were interesting and advanced the plot; here, all the twists are planned ahead of time and telegraphed to the audience. I liked the Walker girl watching the parade out of Mr. Gailey's window -- all the floats were (in color!) right there. And, Dylan McDermott does his best to be an engaging boyfriend wannabe, and Richard Attenborough tries to be a charismatic Santa, but the movie really falls flat with poor writing, poor acting by Elizabeth Perkins, and probably poor pacing, staging, and dramatic narrative by the director. Take a pass on this faux remake and go back to the original with great actors like Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara, and Natalie Wood, and a narrative that was actually dramati, real, and interesting.</fullReview>

WAY too many sappy close-ups of Mara Wilson's would-be "cute" expressions (of which she has exactly one, used ad nauseum in both this and Mrs. Doubtfire) and brings in a completely bizarre and irrelevant Christian angle to the end. As others have pointed out, "In God We Trust" was NOT originally on currency, and was only added in 1957. It was a sign of the times and should not be assumed to be a government endorsement of religion. Americans believe in literally thousands of "gods" and yet only one Santa Claus, so his "god" argument was ridiculous and nonsensical.It's no wonder Macy's didn't want to be associated with this film. Treacly sentimentality, mawkish pandering to religious fanatics, and lackluster acting make this movie more akin to a made-for-TV film than a remake of a classic. If you want to watch "Miracle On 34th Street," then watch the real one. Give this gooey, inferior imitator a wide berth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special but festive enough to do the job and featuring a good performance from Attenborough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friendly but dubious old man is walking on the street when he sees a parade Santa Claus trying to do his job while drunk off his ass. As the real Santa Claus the man (Kris Kringle) steps in and summons the police ? but finds himself escorted away. However, when the drunk can't do his job, Kris steps in and is so good that he is offered the job of store Santa by Cole's toy store. Taking the job, Kris is in his element but cannot convince his boss's daughter that he is the real deal. Things get worse when a rival store, so worried by the business Kris is drawing to Cole's, set out to set him up and taking him to court to get sectioned. Can Kris prove he is Santa, not only to Susan but also to New York State.It is a weakness of Christmas TV that so many interesting movies are wheeled out on so many channels that, in late January, I'm watching a movie that never really sees the light of day outside of the month before Christmas. Anyway, when this came out I ended up going to see it at the cinema and felt that it worked as a Christmas movie but was somewhat lacking as a film. Watching it on television now it seems a lot more serviceable, feeling more suited to the small screen rather than the large. Of course you could question why anyone felt the need to remake the original film but, now they have, I suppose at least it is reasonably good. The plot starts enjoyably enough and features an enjoyable court case, it is only in the sentimental conclusion where it became an average film; up till this point it is structured enough to be enjoyable even if it is a bit "straight" but at the end it succumbs to the season but does it too late to really do damage.Slighter older children will enjoy it even though I felt like it could have had more of an edge for adults to appreciate as well. The cast are good, although the film noticeably drops when Attenborough is offscreen. He is an affable character and creates a sense of wonder that the film really benefits from; he is well matched by a cute but enjoyable performance from Wilson. The rest of the cast don't have it so good and Perkins and McDermott are really left with a difficult "serious" narrative that is only going to mush. The supporting cast has a lot of well-known faces who are interesting even if they only have minor roles; Walsh, Remar, Prosky, Janney and Ackland all provide an interesting cast even if the whole film belongs to Attenborough.Overall this is an OK film that will play well to older children as well as undemanding adults. Parts of the film are overly sentimental and devoid of the clever modern touches that it could have really had if it had not done it so "straight". Hardly earth shattering stuff but has enough festive cheer to do the job, partly thanks to a performance from Attenborough that adds a sense of wonder to it.</fullReview>

I watched this and while it was a very nice remake, and an excellent cast, the original is still the best. I think what really disappointed me about this one is the judge's ruling. I realize that the original ruling is no longer relevant, but still it was such a major climax for the original film, that this remake left me asking "That's it? That's his ruling?"This movie stands better on its own apart from the 1947 original than it does as a remake of the original.

The actors in it are very good actors but the movie itself was the pits and has all the warmth of an a container of ice cream left out in the snow! It is so cold and cynical and mean spirited compared to the original and even the teenage janitor that befriended Kris in the other versions and was depicted as a sweet almost simple minded kid was mean in this movie and did things that he would never have done in the other movies. In this movie he only pretended to be his friend and betrayed him. Yes he may have seen the error of his ways in the end but I preferred how nice he was in the other movies and he would never had treated Kris that way by talking behind his back and being in cahoots with the bad guys!

		<fullReview>For a Christmas film this is quite a nice children's film where someone tries to prove the existence of Santa Claus, and that Kris Kringle (Lord Sir Richard Attenborough) is him. Kringle is hired as a Santa Clause in a local department store by Dorey Walker (The Flintstones' Elizabeth Perkins) to bring more children and customers in, and it works. But there are those who hate him sometimes, especially when he suggests other stores to shop at. After a while lawyer Bryan Bedford (Dylan McDermott), also in love with Dorey, wants to help Dorey's young daughter Susan (Mara Wilson) have a Dad, and prove that Kringle is Santa. The reason the case came up by the way was because Kringle hit someone for calling him names. They won the case because of a dollar bill with the words "In God We Trust", I'm not sure if that is the original film conclusion. I think Attenborough and Wilson are the only reasons that this film works, but I really need to see the original. Worth watching!</fullReview>

We can reflect in our own childhood when watching this film through the eyes of a child to prove that Santa does exist and what Santa is.The only downfalls of the film were some of the acting and some dullness in the story.

Attenborough was perfect for Kris Kringle. Even though I know the "secret" of Santa Claus, he made me believe in him for the 114 minutes the film lasted. The part with the deaf girl is really sweet, and you can't help but feel devastatingly sorry for Kris when those slimeballs at Shoppers Express set him up. It's a real shame Attenborough is threatening to never act again if he doesn't get to be Albus Dumbledore. He's a great actor, but not what I had in mind for Dumbledore.Mara Wilson is also adorable and convincing, and, just as Brian says, talks like she's 64. *SPOILER* And the speech she gives about it being highly unlikely she'll get arrested as she gives the judge the card that determines the verdict of Kris's case is priceless!*SPOILER'S OVER.All in all, your heart has to be two sizes too small to not like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost the as good as the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version really stayed true to the 1947 classic, until the end and that was John Hughes downfall. Mara Wilson is every bit as good as Natalie Wood, and the support charactors are good too. But the trial strays away from the 1947 solution, and it is confusing and falls flat.Still, a wonderful family classic!</fullReview>
