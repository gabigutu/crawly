		<shortDescription>Sweet movie not without social comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly a lovely warmhearted movie, but since other reviewers have described the plot in detail, I'll move on to other topics.I love movies like this for the insight they provide into the customs of a lost era. Watch the clothing - everybody is so dressed up! - women in dresses, gloves, and hats, men in hats and suits. Notice that when O'Hara enters a room filled with Macy's executives, even though they are the bosses and she is lower management, they all stand up instantly.The social satire, most on display in the courtroom scenes, also is very 1940s. Apparently audiences of that era took a kind of genial corruption in the judicial system in stride. Business leaders, like "Mr. Macy" were expected to be sharp and profit-oriented, but also decent people like the rest of us. It's a much more nuanced view than the "businessman as criminal villain" so common in today's movies.The character played by Maureen O'Hara probably needs explanation for modern viewers. Late 1940s audiences knew that the social and economic situation of a divorced working woman with a child was much more precarious than it is now. Divorce was still somewhat shocking - this is brought out neatly in the movie when her would-be lover does a double take when he learns from her daughter about the divorce - he probably had assumed she was a war widow. Divorced moms were still rare in the middle classes. Society universally agreed that women should stay home to raise their children. Economically, women in management positions were still very rare, couldn't expect promotion, and were last hired, first fired. I think O'Hara's performance brings out these qualities in a way that the audience of the 1940s would have understood easily. The character's stiffness, fear of losing control, and anxiety about her job make a great deal of sense. It would have been nice to see a few scenes showing her loosening up, perhaps at dinner with her boyfriend; no doubt those got left on the cutting room floor.I really like the scene where Santa talks to the little Dutch orphan. First, this scene also must have resonated with the audience; in 1947 the western European countries had only started to recover from World War II, and probably many Americans were familiar with the idea of adopting a war orphan, just as many sent CARE packages. Second, by making Santa fluent in Dutch, the writer cleverly left the viewer thinking that hey, he might really be Santa Claus (isn't Santa Claus fluent in all languages)? Some reviewers don't like the acting and think that modern actors are "better". I think the older actors aren't better or worse, just different. The audiences of the 1940s expected a certain style of acting, and the directors and actors gave that to them. Then as now, Hollywood paid top dollar and got very talented people, but like all of us they were shaped by their own time and place, more particularly the requirement to make movies that audiences would like. Move Maureen O'Hara to 2004, or Tom Cruise to 1947, and you'd see them acting in the style of that decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic holiday fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its very easy to see why this movie won the Oscar for Screenplay that year. Its very intelligent and has a lot to say about several topics - how to raise a child, how a person of questionable sanity gets treated, how greedy businessmen are, how politics play out in a courtroom..and what to do with all that damn mail addressed to Santa Claus!Its also very mature in some ways - Doris (Maureen O'Hara) is divorced and the mother of Susie (Natalie Wood). Doris has raised Susie to be very practical and to think for herself, but she neglected to teach Susie one thing - how to be a child, when you ARE a child. Enter Mr. Gayley (John Payne), a struggling lawyer who befriends Susie as a way to get to know her Mom better. Doris works at Macy's and is organizing their Thanksgiving Day Parade, when the Santa they've hired is intoxicated. In a pinch they hire the REAL Kris Kringle to appear in the parade. He ends up being such a big hit that he gets hired to work at Macy's also. He is not the traditional employee, however, and this comes to light when he sends a customer (the venerable Thelma Ritter) to ANOTHER STORE! Schoenfeld's, he says, has what she's looking for. Then he is overheard, by the store manager no less, sending another customer to GIMBELS!Don't want to give away any more, but the movie is touching, dramatic and hysterical - Doris on the phone with her co-workers' wife, who has been given too much liquor, is worth a million bucks alone. Whenever I want to make my sister laugh, I do a pretty decent imitation of her saying "HELLO?" Also, I can sing the song Kris sings to the girl from Rotterdam..the girl who is so thrilled that Kris can communicate with her in her language. Susie overhearing this is beginning to think that Kris might be the real thing, and she's a pretty hard nut to crack, for a little kid. See it, own it, memorize it..and pity the 31 souls in 'User Ratings' who gave this a '1', which is ridiculous but it takes all kinds I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Santa is in New York!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts out in a festive atmosphere. It is Thanksgiving and the employees of Macy's department store are busy with preparations for the annual Thanksgiving day parade. Doris. Walker (Maureen O'Hare) is in charge of the parade. She anxiously hires Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) to replace the man she hired to play Santa Claus when she discovers the original Santa is too intoxicated to even get on the float. Kris does such a good job that Mrs. Walker asks him to stay on in the role and be the department store's Santa. She soon has serious doubts about her decision when she discovers that her new Santa really believes he is Santa Claus.Mrs. Walker is working, single mother, who works for Macy's Department Store in New York City. Natalie Wood plays her daughter, Susan. As the result of a failed Marriage, Doris raises her daughter to accept reality. There is no room for fantasy or make believe in her life. Susan is a quiet, child who acts more like a grown up than a 6 year old. She has difficulty using her imagination, and has become just as skeptical as her mother.Since Kris, believes that "the important thing is to make children happy," winning the affection of Susan and her mother is his main objective.Whether or not Kris is the real Santa Claus, there is no doubt that he seem to have an influence on almost everyone he meets--except for Macy's staff psychologist .Mr. Sawyer believes that Kris is delusional, and has him committed to thrown into a mental institution. In order to get out, Kris must face a court hearing, where not only is his sanity questioned, but the state of New York will decide if there really is a Santa Claus. Fred Gailey (played by John Payne) a neighbor of Doris Susan Walker agrees to represent Kris. The predictable end to the story is that Fred and Doris become attracted to each other, and as Fred works hard to secure Kris' freedom, Doris finds herself not only believing in Kris, but also in believing in fantasy.Maureen O'Hara portrays Doris Walker with poise and sophistication. Although the movie is over 55 years old, the idea of a single working mom trying to raise her daughter after a bitter divorce, tells a story that is relevant by today's standards. Natalie Wood does such a good job at playing as the bright six year old, Susan, that you can almost imagine her going straight from being a baby to being an adult. John Payne, as Fred Gailey, predictably plays the handsome attorney who falls in love with Mrs. Walker. Even though it seems a bit unbelievable, this movie is all about fantasy, so we'll allow a bit of romance. Finally, Edmund Gwenn's portrayal of Santa Claus is so believable, that you almost believe that truly is the jolly old elf himself! This reviewer would give the movie a 5 out of 5 rating. It is a Christmas classic that will be remembered for years to come as one of the best Christmas movies ever filmed. The message of the movie is not about the real meaning of Christmas, nor is it about the commercialism that has overshadowed the holiday for years. The message of the movie is that make believe and fantasy play an important role in our live. Without them we would have no basis for our hopes and dreams</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visit From St. Nicholas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great Edmund Gwenn shines as Kris Kringle, an elderly, eccentric man who may or may not be the real Santa Claus. Little Natalie Wood thinks he is, though, and that's all that matters. This movie, written by Valentine Davies, has become, along with It's a Wonderful Life, a Christmas classic, and deservedly so. It is not, I imagine, in the same league as the Capra film (what is?), but it's an awfully good little movie in its own right; and while it presents its characters and issues pleasingly it does not push the envelope too much in any one direction, as one can respond to its whimsical little story any way one pleases.Like so many films of the immediate postwar period it stresses the faith and wisdom of small children (as,--literally--opposed to adults); and its message is that children are perhaps wiser than we think. Considering the mess that grownups had made of the world in the previous two decades it must have been difficult for movie audiences of the time to disagree. Indeed, much of the mood of the postwar era was based at least partly on this premise, as children became central to our culture as never before. Their whims and wishes became paramount. Perhaps, in the end, too much so. One can see the start of all this in Miracle On 34th Street, whose gentle message still rings true today, every year, in the waning days of December.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You'd Better Watch Out, You'd Better Not Cry.................."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...............Santa Claus has come to town. Or at least that's what a gentlemen appropriately named Kristopher Kringle played by Edmund Gwenn complete with full white beard is claiming. He makes his appearance at the Thanksgiving Day Parade as sponsored by R.H. Macy's Department Store and finds the Santa hired for the occasion, Percy Helton, full of a little too much Christmas cheer already. In charge of the parade is one of Macy's middle level executives, Maureen O'Hara, who fires Helton and hires Gwenn right then and there.Gwenn's obvious sincerity makes him an ideal Santa Claus for Macy's and for us. He spreads the real meaning of Christmas around even has Macy's declaring a holiday truce with its rival Gimbel's. That's a part of Miracle on 34th Street that might be lost to viewers today. Gimbel's was Macy's big department store rival and it's flagship store in New York stood across 34th Street at the time. Gives a meaning to the title that is lost on today's audience.But wiser and more sophisticated folks like the majority of us know there ain't no such thing as Santa Claus. Even Maureen O'Hara knows that and imparts it to her daughter Natalie Wood. Gwenn's just a kind old man in a white beard. But when his sanity is questioned, Gwenn's belief becomes a matter for the courts where Gwenn is ably defended by O'Hara's boyfriend, lawyer John Payne.Like that other holiday classic It's A Wonderful Life, Christmas is never complete without seeing Miracle on 34th Street. Though New York has changed considerably since 1947 the year I made my earthly debut, the film has lost absolutely none of its charm.Edmund Gwenn won the Best Supporting Actor of 1947 and in doing so, beat out his best friend, Finlay Currie, who was up that year for playing Magwitch in Great Expectations. The two had met in stock companies in their native Scotland and were friends right up to when Gwenn passed away in 1959. The Oscar was the high point of his career.Maureen O'Hara in her memoirs says that Miracle on 34th Street holds a special place in her affections. In fact until Gwenn died, she had hopes of doing some kind of sequel. She bonded on stage with young Natalie Wood who later played her daughter in Father Was A Fullback also and kept in contact with her right up to her death in 1981.Maureen also had a deep affection for John Payne who she made four films with and says was one of the nicest men in the world. One story she related was on the set of another film they made, Payne was served with divorce papers right on the set from his then wife, Anne Shirley. She said he broke down and cried like a baby. If it weren't for the fact she was married, she said she definitely could have gotten something going with Payne.In the supporting cast note the presence of one grinch in the person of Porter Hall who played one of his patented nasty little meanies. His meddling and general misanthropy cause Gwenn to have that trial in the first place. Look for a bit role from Jack Albertson as the postal employee who inadvertently saves the day. Also making her film debut is Thelma Ritter as the mother of a child looking to meet Santa Claus, the one official Santa Claus, courtesy of Macy's Department Store.Although Miracle on 34th Street has been remade several times over the years, this one is the genuine article. As genuine as the fact that Macy's has the official Santa Claus as certified by a higher authority.One thing has always puzzled me though. How long did it take Edmund Gwenn to grow that beard for the part?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Genuine Article, Still A Miracle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a "legend" connected with this film, one which has recently gained new life via AMC: Supposedly, upon completion of principle filmmaking, 1947's "Miracle On 34th Street" then had to be submitted to the heads of Macy's and Gimble's department stores who -- had either man withheld approval -- could have cost 20th Century Fox a small fortune in rewrites and reshootings.Frankly, in view of the fact that much of "Miracle" had already been shot on location in Macy's New York City store (to say nothing of the fact that studio heads of that era -- or any era, for that matter -- were notoriously prone not to take such financial risks), this "legend" is likely just so much "hype," otherwise known as "nonsense."Thankfully, this is the only trace of phoniness attached to this jewel of a movie. "Miracle On 34th Street" is just that, in every sense of the word: a miracle.Take a perfectly-crafted, thoughtful screenplay. Add an impeccable cast (from top-to-bottom, by the way; catch, just as one example, Thelma Ritter's uncredited turn as "Peter's Mother"). Throw into this mix an on-location "shoot" (along with Macy's, there's the store's actual 1946 Thanksgiving Parade, footage in a post office facility and a courthouse) which gives this film a nice sense of verisimilitude . . . just in case you're not already prepared (courtesy of Edmund Gwenn, in a totally-deserved Oscar-winning performance) to recapture your belief in Santa Claus."Miracle On 34th Street" is many things: a celebration of the Christmas spirit, a heartfelt plea against the "over-commercialism" (even in 1947)of Christmas, an examination of faith itself . . . just to name a few.It works on every level. Every bit as well today, 54 years after its initial release, as then. Don't waste your time with the remakes -- both on TV as well as theatrical productions (and the less said about an abortive 1963 Broadway musical adaptation, "Here's Love," the better.)Go for the original film. Go for the genuine article. Again and again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edmund Gwenn as Santa: a deserving Oscar winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perfectly-cast Christmas confection that surpasses all expectations and really does make viewers laugh and tear up. Corny? Yes. Overacted? In some scenes, yes. Dated? Perhaps. But the message of belief, ultimately, is timeless and the silvery black and white cinematography is wonderful. And yes, there's Edmund Gwenn as the department store Santa who really is. A most deserving recipient of the Supporting Actor Oscar, Gwenn seems like an incredibly nice man--maybe because he never has to force kindliness; more than that, he has an innate happiness and twinkle that comes from within. He truly glows in this part. Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Thelma Ritter (in a wonderful bit) and precocious Natalie Wood are also excellent in this classic fairy tale. It is a film without artifice. It glows, too. **** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holiday Combination That Works Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still among the most worthwhile of the familiar holiday movies, this classic version of "Miracle on 34th Street" has a combination of cast, story, and production that works well. Maureen O'Hara, young Natalie Wood, and Edmund Gwenn would probably have carried it pretty well by themselves, and they are joined by a very good supporting cast. The screenplay is nicely done, bringing out the fantasy elements of the story without letting it become trite.Gwenn, who played many solid character roles, gets the chance here to play a role for which he was ideally suited, and it works very well. O'Hara and Wood make a good pair to balance him out. The supporting cast gets some very good moments of their own, especially Gene Lockhart and William Frawley, whose scenes are entertaining while also offering some occasionally pointed commentary.The style of the production is well-suited to the material, offering an innocently upbeat story without overdoing it on sentimentality. For all that this style of the production and acting are out of fashion, they are able to capture a theme like this in a worthwhile way that is simply not possible with the kind of false "sophistication" that permeates so many present-day movies.That's not to say that this is some kind of masterpiece, which it is not and did not try to be. Instead, it's a light, enjoyable, positive movie that does make a worthwhile point or two. That kind of feature will always find an appreciative audience somewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes you want belive that Santa Claus really exists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miracle On 34Th Street was a great Christmas movie. The major conflict of the movie was whether or not Santa Claus really existed. The movie begins with Kris Cringle (Edmund Gwen) walking by a store with a man setting up a display of reindeer and notices that they are not in order. Kris tells the man politely how to fix them in the right positions, but the man gives him a strange look and goes back to work. Kris Cringle believes himself to be Santa Claus although most everyone else thinks he is crazy. Even little Susan (Natalie Wood) thinks he is a fake and doesn't believe in any ?fairytales'. Her mother, Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara), taught her that to believe in ?fairytales' is childish and impractical. Kris is later made a part of the Macy's parade when the Santa Claus that was supposed to be in the parade is found drunk. When asked if he had ever had any experience, Kris replied, `Many times.' Doris makes him the department store Santa Claus at Macy's where he tells many people that he is the real Santa Claus. As more people find out about Kris Cringle calling himself ?Santa Claus', they get upset saying that no such person really exists. Many people took it more literally and said that it would be impossible for reindeer to fly or for anyone to live in the North Pole. He is forced to take a mental examination and the doctor convinces Doris that Kris is mentally ill after he gets in a fight. Kris is arrested and taken to court and his lawyer is Mr. Gailey who starts to believe, along with Doris and Susan, the he actually is Santa Claus. I thought that this was a really good holiday movie that focus on something that all of us as little kids went through- believing or not believing in Santa Claus. It even feels like I should believe in Santa after watching it. I thought that Edmund Gwen was a really good actor and perfect for his part. He played his role very innocently, which made him very believable as Santa Claus. Natalie Wood was a great actress who played very well the typical role of the cynical child. The acting and the plot was very well written. It was a very innocent movie that is entertaining for all types of audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing to me when one single movie can brighten your spirits, Miracle On 34th Street is one such movie that has the ability to do just that. A viewer can't help but to wear a smile after watching, which is what makes for a great film. There was nothing bad about this film at all. The acting and the sets were very good. And the whole spirit of Christmas shone throughout the entire movie.  Like I said above, that acting in this movie was superb. Edmund Gwenn playing the role of Kris Kringle was marvelous. He seemed to be happy and jolly throughout the whole movie, all the qualities one thinks of when thinking about Santa, Edmund Gwenn embodied. He even made a believer out of me, well, not really, but close. Natalie Wood as Susan Walker had so much talent for someone her age. The emotion that she put into her role was so great that I kept forgetting that she was only a child. As for the sets, all of them were well done, but the set that stood out the most was definitely the courtroom scene. The detail that went into the making of that set was so good, it surpassed all the other sets in the movie by far. Personally, I love Christmas movies and am really critical of what ones are good and what ones I'd have rather gouged my eyes out than have to watch. Luckily, Miracle On 34th Street was not one of those movies. The spirit of Christmas was portrayed really well, this was one movie that one couldn't help but feel warm and toasty after viewing. What is probably one of the greatest things about this movie is that it is one that the whole family can enjoy, and more importantly enjoy together. On a scale of 1- 10, Miracle On 34th Street is undeniably a 9, one movie that I wouldn't mind watching over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I too old or what. Very few places on the Internet do people talk about the missing scene in this 1947 version of the movie. When I was a kid I saw the movie and there was a scene about the football helmet at the end. The attorney needs to get the helmet but it's too late but it mysteriously shows up. He says to the wife I am glad you were able to get it and she says I didn't get it I thought you did. I thought that scene was the best and sealed the case that it was Santa in that court. No one even talks about it and it is not in any of the remakes or made for TV versions. Too Bad! I would be interested to hear from anyone that has seen the version I was talking about.I went on the Internet to see if I can find an original copy but no luck.

		<fullReview>Great film that came out one year after "It's a Wonderful Life" and is still probably the second-best film dealing with the Christmas holidays behind the aforementioned movie. The Macy's Santa Claus (Oscar-winner Edmund Gwenn) claims he is the genuine article. Lawyer John Payne actually starts to believe him, but employee Maureen O'Hara thinks that Gwenn is just a senile, old man. The dilemma for O'Hara is that young daughter Natalie Wood believes in Gwenn as well. What follows is Gwenn being committed and actually ending up in court to prove that he is who he says he is. A really smart comedy that has good drama, a fine story and top-notch acting from all involved. Gene Lockhart and William Frawley are great in supporting turns and look for a then-unknown Jack Albertson as a postal worker. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, let me say that if you're selective about your taste in movies, and you happen to be someone that is into action, action and more action?this movie may put you to sleep. Miracle on 34th St. is focused on fun with your family and having faith in the wonderful things that you used to enjoy as a child. You could say this has a `cuddly' feel to it, and is a perfect example of Christmas joy. Made in 1947, this stars Maureen O'Hare as Doris Walker, Natalie Wood as Susan Walker, Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle and John Payne as Fred Gailey. The movie starts out with Kris walking down the streets of New York, while the people are starting to decorate for the Christmas season. He notices the annual Macy's parade and heads over to see the floats in preparation. Noticing that the Santa they have hired is drunk, he goes to inform to the head director. After finding her, he discovers that it's Doris Walker. Kris ends up filling in for the Santa and, since he did such a good job, he gets hired as the seasonal Santa at the local Macy's location. When Doris returns home, she discovers that her daughter, Susan, is with her neighbor, Fred Gailey, watching the parade. Doris is a headstrong woman who doesn't believe in fairy tales, nor `childish myths,' such as Santa Claus. Suzie, being her daughter and under the influence of her mother, also is a firm believer in fact and doesn't have faith in such things. So, from the moment Kris discovers there's no sight of Santa in their minds, he attempts to make a believer of Doris, Suzie and the rest of the world. Miracle on 34th St. is a good, wholesome movie that everyone can enjoy, yet doesn't have any of the unnecessary cussing, violence, or sex scenes that you see in the movies today, which makes this classic spectacular. If you enjoy Christmas and the good cheer that is attached, you'll love Miracle on 34th St. It's a `feel good' movie that anyone of any age can enjoy over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doris Walker Did Not Believe in Santa Claus or Any Magic at All. All That Will Soon Change Once She Witnesses the Miracle on 34th Street.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all began one afternoon on 34th Street of New York City. Outside of Macy's department store, the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade was underway. The store director, Doris Walker, was overseeing preparations. That's when a kindly old man with a long, white beard made his way onto the parade grounds and discovered that the man hired to play Santa Claus was collapsed drunk. The old man was furious with him, and so was Doris because she had no replacement. That's when she turned to the old man and noticed his beard and asked him to fill in for the drunk. The old man said he would be delighted. He told her his name was Kris Kringle. Well, as always, the Macy's parade was a success. Doris, meanwhile, went home, and discovered her daughter, Susan, was visiting her friend, attorney Mr. Gailey, and were watching the parade together. When Doris came to pick her up, she and Susan invite Mr. Gailey to Thanksgiving dinner. Gailey accepted. After the parade, Kris was hired on as the Santa Claus for the department store. Instantly the children lined up.Mr. Shellhammer, the store manager, told Kris to distribute some overstocked toys that the store could not sell. Kris did not like that a bit, so he refused. When one little boy say on his lap, he asked Kris for a fire engine with real water hoses. Kris tells him Macy's doesn't carry them, but told the boy's surly mother of a store across town that did. Shellhammer was shocked when he heard Kris directing Macy's customers to other stores, and, above all, to Gimbel's, Macy's big competition! Amazingly this sending customers to different stores seemed to make the customers more loyal to Macy's. When the big boss himself, Mr. Macy, heard about this, he loved the idea. He encouraged all his employees to send their customers to other stores. Doris was at the meeting with Mr. Macy, this was after she fired Kris. Not because of any wrongful misdeed on his part, but because she caught Kris talking to Susan, and Doris had brought Susan up not believing in fairy tales or Santa Claus. And Kris firmly believed himself to be Santa. The REAL Santa. After the meeting, Doris hires Kris back but makes him get an examination from the company psychiatrist, Mr. Sawyer, Sawyer runs tests and concluded Kris was nuts, but Dr. Pierce from the place where Kris was currently staying, the Brooks Home for the Aged, said Kris was harmless. Mr. Sawyer was a selfish, conniving, sleaze ball anyway.Mr. Gailey invited Kris to stay with him, and he accepted. Susan told Kris what she secretly wanted for Christmas: a nice, big house. That evening, Kris discovered that Mr. Gailey wanted the same thing. The next day, Kris was talking with his new friend, janitor Alfred, who told him that he's been seeing Mr. Sawyer too. Sawyer had Alfred believe in all sorts of crazy things, such as he made Alfred think he hated his father. Kris had heard enough, he marched right up to Sawyer's office, lambasted him, then raised his cane and hit him on the head. Sawyer pretended to have been seriously hurt, and he declared that Kris was a complete lunatic and should be locked up. Mr. Shellhammer decided to do something about this, so he lured Kris into a car outside, which took him directly to Bellevue! When Mr. Gailey heard, he came running. He would represent Kris when the hearing for his commitment came. Judge Henry X. Harper presided. Judge Harper was incapable of making decisions on his own, but he had a lot of help from his friend, Charlie Halloran. Gailey pleaded their case, while D.A. Tom Mara made it as complicated as possible. Unfortunately, they had no real proof that Kris was in fact the real Santa Claus. But everyone believed in him, even Mr. Macy himself. Meanwhile, Susan wrote Kris a letter because she heard he was sad. Eventually, all the children of New York did the same thing. The post office was overrun with letters to Santa Claus, so the postmaster decided to have those letters delivered to the courthouse. About 8 men, each carrying two full sacks, entered the courtroom and dumped the letters directly on Judge Harper's bench. Well, after weighing this evidence, and a gesture from Halloran Judge Harper dismissed the case. Everyone was overjoyed. Kris invited Mr. Gailey, Doris, Susan, Alfred and Mr. Macy to a Christmas party at the Brooks' home on Christmas Day. On the way home, Susan ordered them to stop the car because they had just come upon the house of her dreams! They all go inside. This house was for sale. Gailey and Doris embraced, but they stared in absolute shock when they saw the cane lying against the fire place.Miracle on 34th Street. A good movie to watch around Christmas. Everybody was good in it. Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, Natalie Wood, and Gene Lockhart. Unfortunately, Payne, Gwenn, Wood and Lockhart have passed away, but Maureen O'Hara is still alive. There was a remake of this movie in 1994 with Dylan McDermott, Elizabeth Perkins, Mara Wilson, and Richard Attonborough as Santa. I saw the 1994 version in theaters. About the 1947 version, it was a good movie and all, but it was kind of dated. It was something a person of today's generation might not enjoy as much as a person from yesterday's generation. I guess we're in to modern day Christmas movies, not the old fashion ones, but there's nothing wrong with that. Watch for cameo appearances by Jack Albertson from as the post office employee, and William Frawley from I Love Lucy as Judge Harper's friend Charlie Halloran. So if you haven't already seen it, this Christmas I recommend you check out Miracle on 34th Street. It's a good movie, although the ending leaves us curious. Check it out! You will believe!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great holiday movie full of cheer :o)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will put you in a great mood. It is very uplifting, and it is great for all ages. The movie is about a man who claims to be Santa Clause, and people do not believe him and they think he is crazy. They want to put him in a mental institute. Some people believe though that he is not crazy, which includes his lawyer, so they fight and try to prove that he is not crazy.Santa Claus a.k.a Kris Kringle played by Edmund Gwenn did a great job playing Santa Claus. Not only did he look like you think Santa would look like, but he also portrayed the character as a very caring, loveable man. Natalie Wood who played little Susan who is a serious little girl with no imagination. Wood did a great job playing that character. Maureen O'Hara played Doris Walker ( Susan's mom). O'Hara's acting was also good playing a character who is overly serious, with no imagination. She teaches Susan that there is no Santa Claus. The directing in this movie was good. The legal battle over Kris Kringle really being Santa has the viewer wondering which way you would decide if you were the judge. The theme to the story was good for the holiday season.Miracle on 34th Street is a great movie to get you into the Christmas spirit. It is great for kids and adults of all ages. You will not only want to see it once, but maybe every Christmas to start a tradition. It is a well-rounded movie with drama, comedy, romance and fantasy.This movie is 8 out 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th street is a great holiday film for the whole family, young and old. It's fun, dramatic and romantic. This film raises the issue of whether or not there really is a Santa Claus. The movie stars Natalie Wood, Maureen O' Hara, John Payne, and Edmund Gwenn. The beginning scenes introduce the characters and already give the viewer the plot of the film. The first scene has Edmund Gwenn (Kris Kringle) walking the streets of New York City as he window shops. As he is doing so, he comes to a shop were a man in putting out a reindeer display. Kris tells the man that he has all the reindeer out of order. The man in the shop gives Kris a weird look and says thank you for the help. This scene is to help create the image that there really is a Santa Claus. Kris comes to a crowd and sees that it's the Macy's parade and the Santa on one of the floats is drunk. Kris proceeds to tell Doris Walker (Maureen O' Hara) the parade director, of the problem.The next scene really sets the theme of the plot. A little girl named Susan (Natalie Wood, and Doris Walker's daughter) is sitting in her neighbors' apartment watching the parade go by and talking to her neighbor Mr. Gailey (John Payne). They have a conversation about fairy tales and little Susan replies that she doesn't believe in fairy tales. Throughout the whole movie, the viewer is being persuaded to believe in Santa Claus. The sanity of Mr. Kringle is questioned and taken to the New York Supreme Court to prove that Mr. Kringle is the real Santa.The costumes in this film were very realistic and believable especially the Santa costume and all the other costumes that are shown in the parade scene. The attire of the rest of the characters are very plain and normal. There was not much music in the film but holiday jingles such as Jingle Bells and simple back round music that the viewer doesn't really notice.This is a great heart warming film, that I would highly recommend to someone seeking a family holiday movie. And well after the film, the viewer is still wondering whether there is or is not a real Santa Claus out there. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Faith is believing in something when common sence tells you not to," is Kris Kringle's charge to little Susan. And, lo and behold, this motto, first ridiculed by mom Doris, ends up being her own affirmation.That's the turn around that transpires from jolly Kris' effect on a "completely realistic" mom and daughter. And in the process of this delightful modern fairy tale, the audience joins in believing: not only is there a Santa, but Edmund Gwenn's Kris is indeed the one-and-only.Along the way, we're offered thoughtful parables about free speech, human rights, trusting our friends, and supporting the right to be different.John Payne's lawyer Fred sees an opportunity to court divorcee Maureen O'Hara's Doris through being nice to her daughter (Natalie Wood). Great idea, were it not for some odd ideas mom has about dreaming and wishing.Slowly Writer Valentine Davies' tale chips away at these hard-headed types, who have no time for fantasy. Until the end, when even tough judges and lawyers must succumb to the miracle on 34th street: Kris is indeed our real Santa!Finally, all have come to have a change of heart (except a pesky pseudo-psychiatrist, who's nicely discarded) and everyone lives happily ever after--in a house of little Susan's dreams. Makes one want to hang up that stocking and wish upon a star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Christmas should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have felt ashamed to have never seen the original version of Miracle on 34th Street. I have watched the 1994 version and my Christmas movies are more like Home Alone or the Grinch.This said, I have to tell that this movie and story line is touching and very clever. This is about Christmas spirit and how it should be felt. This is about happiness family and magic instead of 'make a buck make a buck this is only about make a buck' like Alfred liked to say. This theme is quite actual.Maureen O'Hara's character, a heartbroken divorced woman who doesn't believe in any magic and faith anymore is representing this situation all on herself. She lost the spirit and is drowning in her work. She educated her daughter in a way that she don't believe in anything either. So the fact that both of them starts to believe again alongside Santa Claus is really symbolic. Even more importantly she believes in love again which is the real essence of Christmas.I wish we would keep this authentic spirit. Being less selfish and more sharing. Believe in something even when we think everything is dark and lost. This is all Christmas is all about. And I am thankful that there are movies like Miracle on 34th Street to remind this to us.</fullReview>

To me, its not Christmas until I see Its a Wonderful Life, White Christmas, and this movie.Do yourself a favor, ignore all the remakes and watch this. Edmund Gwynne makes you want to really believe he is Santa. Great roles by Maureen O'Hara ( whom I could watch all day anyway), and Natalie Wood. Combines love elements, a pointed commentary on faith, humor, and a little bit of suspense ( not much, but enough to make it fun). Detractors would say it is predictable and I cannot argue with that, but I also believe that it is part of the magic of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If "The Great Gatsby" is the "perfect" American novel . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . then MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET is the flawless U.S. flick. Just as some English professors have said you cannot improve upon one word in F. Scott Fitzgerald's literary masterpiece, it's exceedingly difficult to second guess one casting choice, line of dialog, or subtle gesture during MIRACLE's perfectly brief 96-minute running time. If only Ebenezer Scrooge had watched this film, he could have avoided Jacob Marley and the other three ghosts altogether. Where Dickens' tale is haunted by the Spectre of Death, MIRACLE delivers but a single bump to a well-deserving noggin' (Mr. Sawyer's). If you haven't viewed this feature in years, you may remember it as PROVING that Edmund Gwen's "Kris Kringle" IS the one and only Santa Claus, with all the magic powers ascribed to him in the countless cartoon and live-action films that have cluttered the big screen almost every holiday season since MIRACLE came out in 1947. However, anyone who cares to actually WATCH this holiday classic (as opposed to merely letting it play in the background when relatives are filling your house) will discover that MIRACLE is pretty even-handed and agnostic regarding the Santa Question. For example, you may notice no effort is made to indicate WHERE this "Kris Kringle" keeps his reindeer, OR how recently he's even seen them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect "10"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclosure. Even though this is one of my favourite films and I have seen it about 2 dozen times, I had trouble putting together this review. I will try to explain why. The job of the reviewer is firstly to try to tell the story. If I do that, I may give something away and make the film less interesting to a first-time viewer. My affection for this film is such that I cannot do that. The second role of a reviewer or critic is to criticize. I would love to, but I have gone through every scene and every reel and cannot find anything to criticize. It is a nearly perfect film, even the slower scenes are later found to be merely setting up the action for what comes later. Edmund Gwenn is pitch perfect in the lead, so good that it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role. (A hypothesis proved correct when looking at the horrendous modern remake - WHICH I URGE YOU NOT TO). The same applies to Maureen O'Hara who creates a very gentle character to offset the hi-energy performances of Gwenn and little Natalie Wood (who steals all her scenes, of course). The script is flawless, not only poking fun at marketing and consumer practises of the day, as well as cronyism and cynicism in the court system, as well the paradox of mental illness, but the ending is pitch-perfect and unforgettable entirely in its own right. The film is hypnotic, it just reaches out and grabs your heart and keeps you watching. And there you have it. Did I forget to mention this film is a perfect "10"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th Street is one of those movies which definitely tries to tug on the viewer's heartstrings. Now perhaps this movie is not quite as effective in its tugging of heartstrings as that other famous 1940s Christmas movie. Yes, Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed...that other movie was indeed "Wonderful". But Miracle on 34th Street is a very good film in its own right. This movie will definitely entertain and, yes, warm the heart as well. It's a movie which is fondly, and rightly, remembered as a holiday classic.The film centers around kindly old man Kris Kringle who believes himself to be Santa Claus. Is it really possible that he could be? Well how much faith do you have? That's what this movie is ultimately about, faith, believing in something which common sense dictates you shouldn't. And if you have faith some rather good things can happen. Maybe even a miracle or two. When we meet her Doris Walker certainly doesn't believe. This young divorcée, responsible for overseeing the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, ends up hiring Kris Kringle to portray Santa when her original actor proves to be quite a hopeless drunk. Kris is so perfect in the role that he is hired to be the Santa for the Macy's store during the Christmas season. And it is in this role that Kris will meet Doris Walker's nine-year-old daughter Susan. Doris has raised Susan not to believe in Santa Claus, not to believe in fairy tales of any kind. Susan it seems has rather sadly been deprived of having any imagination at all. Kris Kringle will set out to fix that.As Kris Kringle sets out to open Susan's mind to all the possibilities of the imagination it is left to attorney Fred Gailey, Doris and Susan's neighbor, to work on restoring Doris' faith. And Fred will also need to put all his lawyer's skills to good use when Kris Kringle gets himself into a bit of a predicament. All the key performers do excellent work. Maureen O'Hara is wonderful in portraying Doris, tracing the arc of her character as this very serious-minded career woman opens her heart and allows herself to really believe in something. John Payne plays Fred and, dare I say it, there's a hint of Jimmy Stewart to him. Yeah, there's that other movie again. Natalie Wood is perfectly precocious in her portrayal of Susan, a child who seems impossibly mature for her age, credit for which must go to the actress playing the role. And then of course there is Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle. Kris certainly is steadfast in his belief that he is in fact Santa Claus and thanks to Gwenn's winning performance you may well believe it too. Gwenn could not be any better.All in all it's a charming, heartwarming, and undeniably uplifting movie. The story takes a little while to kick into high gear and even when it does it still is a very simple, basic story. There may even be a moment or two where the film feels a little bit mundane and there is that nagging sense it never quite hits the emotional heights another film might. But this Christmas, when you're tired of watching It's a Wonderful Life...OK, so maybe nobody ever gets tired of watching It's a Wonderful Life. But when you're done watching Jimmy Stewart and friends make time to watch Miracle on 34th Street too. There's room for more than one holiday classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Xmas Day, 2007, and I find myself watching this delight yet again. Fox TV decides to show the original 1947 Edmund Gwenn version, alternating it all day with the 1994 Attenborough modernization. I want to state here and now that the Gwenn film is not simply the best, but it could be used as a primer for anyone studying dialogue and screenplay structure. It was cast perfectly, a light touch with a good old-fashioned story full of uplifting ideas on a universal theme.It's interesting, not to say astonishing, that the writer/director, George Seaton, should have wanted to make stabs at improving his own original, as he did by contributing to the writing of the forgettable '59 and '73 television adaptations, and to the '94 film version.This film classic should be the last to be seen, in order to overwrite and obliterate any memory of the others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the First (and Best) Christmas Holiday Movie Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This work has been a comedy joy for over sixty years now, and has even been redone on television a few times - but the original is still the best. It takes a totally fantastic situation (the possible existence of Santa Claus) and looks at it from the real world's point of view.It has been said that the eventual recognition of Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn, in his Oscar winning role) as Santa is due to the necessity of people and organizations in society that can't decry the Christmas spirit. It's too unpopular to do that. Mr Macy (the fictional owner of the Department store) is not going to denounce Santa, who helps bring holiday shoppers into his store at Christmas (neither - although he is not involved in the court case - would his fictional rival Mr. Gimbel). The wisdom of the entire matter is summed up in a great speech by Charlie Halloran (William Frawley), the political wizard behind Judge Harper (Gene Lockhard). If Harper decides to deny the existence of Santa he'll make enemies of merchants, toy manufacturers, kids and their parents, and others who get some satisfaction from the material side of the holiday season - Harper will ensure his total defeat at the polls! It is a lesson the astute Judge takes to heart.I suppose that the materialism of Christmas is to be denounced by purists, who think of the spiritual aspects frequently forgotten at Christmas. But the film reaffirms that the materialism of the holiday actually is an engine to the meaning of the holiday. In celebrating the birth and life of Jesus Christ, one is affirming a belief (ultimately) in the goodness of mankind and the truth of love. To show love frequently means sacrifice - here in expensive gifts to loved ones. If the pressures of modern advertising make this materialism too visible, the underlying purpose of gift buying is not to be materialistic but to show one cares for those one loves.Oddly enough Kris himself is willing to advertise the materialism to a point. At the Thanksgiving Day Parade he is last seen telling the children in the crowd that there are plenty of toys to be bought at Macy's (which, by the way, would be what he or the original "Santa" (Percy Helton) would have had to say in any case). Only later is Kris able to show more selective honesty here - he does tell one customer (Thelma Ritter) where she can get a toy at a cheaper cost than at Macy's. As a result the Department Store picks up on this and starts a policy of guiding people to other stores. In the real world I must admit it would not occur, but one likes the concept and wishes it would.The characters (for the most part) are likable, the one exception being Sawyer (Porter Hall) the obnoxious store "psychologist". Sawyer misuses his so-called knowledge to make people feel mentally ill(telling one nice guy that his yearly stint at an orphanage as Santa is really from some bad act of his from many years past). Kris tells off Sawyer very easily, separating this vicious quack from genuine therapists who can help people.* (*Kris tells his friend Fred Gailey that he can easily control his visits with therapists, because he knows the answers to their questions which are usually the same ones. Actually this happens to be a common problem in therapy when dealing with criminals in prison who know what the therapists want to hear. But Kris actually does know what good they do, and how Sawyer is misusing his power. By the way, Kris/Gwenn makes a mistake in showing how he knows the right answers. He says John Quincy Adams' Vice President was Daniel D. Tompkins. Tompkins (who was Governor of New York in the War of 1812) was James Monroe's Vice President - Adams' Veep was John C. Calhoun.) The real spiritual sense of the holiday is shown in the relationship of Kris and Fred with Doris and Susan Walker (Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood). Fred begins the process by softening the divorced Doris with his own version of kindness to her and Susan. But it is hard to reach Susan at first (though she likes Fred) because Doris is so determined to make her daughter a realist. It is only when Fred realizes that Doris does not like fancy or the outlandish because of her own hard fall into reality through her marriage that he shakes her up regarding what exactly makes life worthwhile (and it is not an adherence to reality all the time).As for Susan, her view is softened by Kris, who becomes a surrogate grandfather to her. The snagging point is that her world would be complete if she had a home, not a cramped apartment with her mother. Kris is concerned about the possibility of granting Susan that wish, but does not give up on it. And (as it turns out) it does complete the relationship between Doris and Fred - who will probably marry and move into such a house. We never see this, but we see (in the last shot) a symbolic approval of such a plan from Kris to the young couple. Again an affirmation of love, the center of the Christmas holiday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part of Christmas Eve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every Christmas Eve, one cable channel or another has this movie on all day!! The "Miracle on 34th Street" marathon is as much a part of Christmas eve as is the Sherry Trifle!! I like the original black and white version the most!! "Miracle on 34th Street" is a story about what Christmas should really mean to all of us, and that Santa Claus does in fact, exist as a paragon for humanitarianism!! This movie incorporates commercialism as the culprit to losing sight of what Christmas is suppose to be!!! It also stresses a lot of the positive aspects of faith and kindness towards your fellow man. You, the movie viewer, realize that an idealistic figure such as Santa Claus serves as a symbol who nurtures our quest as individuals to be better people.. Without question, this film vitiates iconaclasm by making Santa the purveyor of the perennial philosophy that it is better to give than to receive!! "Miracle on 34th Street" embraces traditional values, such a tenet is a must in strengthening our endurance for today's overall tumultuousness!!I thought the acting by Maureen O'Hara and John Payne was extremely well thought out, as well as very entertaining!! The movie "Miracle on 34th Street" is very delightful to watch, especially on Christmas Eve where it is as much a part of Christmas Eve as are the presents. goodwill towards friends and family, and of course, like I previously mentioned, the Sherry Trifle!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endearing Christmas classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be hard to imagine anyone who has ever viewed a television that hasn't seen then movie or just as unimaginable anyone who hasn't seen it more than once. The only problem I have with this film is it's overexposure. An Excellent cast with Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle, a man who lives in a retirement home but bears a resemblance to the image of Santa Claus and possesses an uncanny knowledge of Santa and his reindeer who becomes a last minute enlistment to be Santa in the annual Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade. It leads to him landing the job of the in-store Santa at the department store for the Christmas shopping season. Gwenn's performance earned him the Academy Award for 1947 for Best Supporting Actor. He is the principal character of the film and I wonder why he wasn't nominated in the Best Actor category rather than supporting. This film won two additional Oscar's for Best Original Story for Valentine Davies and Best Screenplay for George Seaton who was also the film's director. It also received an Acadmey Award nomination for Best Picture losing out to Gentleman's Agreement. The film also received two Golden Globe nominations. Both Seaton and Davies were screenwriters. Seaton had recently written Song of Bernadette and had gone into directing his own screenplays. Davies was a playwright and was just beginning to turn to films. Seaton had experience with child actors and had directed Peggy Ann Garner in the title role of Junior Miss. Here he directs Natalie Wood who was not yet nine years old when this movie was filmed and was already appearing in her fourth film. Seaton would direct Wood again a couple of years later in Chicken Every Sunday. Wood plays the daughter of a divorced mother played by Maureen O'Hara who believes in only presenting her with facts and has instilled in her that believing in a myth such as Santa Claus is silly. Ironically the mother works for Macy's and is in charge of co-ordinating the parade and hiring it's Santa and Macy's in-store Santa. john Payne plays their bachelor neighbor who has more than a passing interest in the mother but unlike her he believes a child's imagination is something to nurture for an essential balance in growth by opening doors through wonderment. Also in the cast are Gene Lockhart, William Frawley, Thelma Ritter and Jack Albertson. Macy's store psychiatrist has problems with Kris Kringle because Kringle apparently believes he really is Santa Claus. The store itself has further problems when he recommends Macy's rival down the street Gimbels to look for items that Macy's doesn't have in stock. Macy's and Gimbels were or course actual stores and real rivals. Macy's was more upscale and had their name attached to the city's biggest parade but Gimbels had their famous Bargain Basement. Director Seaton took it upon himself to meet with the owners of both stores to secure their permission to use their names in the film and their stores for location shooting. It impressed studio boss Daryl Zanuck to give the go-ahead to the picture but he released it in July to capture what was then the biggest month in movie ticket sales and didn't release it as a Christmas picture. Critics loved it. It made the Top 10 films for 1947 lists for both the New York times and Film Daily. I love the scene where the little Dutch war orphan is bewildered and frightened in her new country and can speak no English so her American foster family takes her to see Santa and he magically brightens her day and her new life. This film has been shown on television more than any other Christmas film because it actually begins on Thankgiving so it can run throughout the entire Holiday season. Kind of ironic that the central character of this film is concerned with the commercialization of Christmas but the film would go on to serve as a vehicle for advertisers for a 30-day stretch each year. It's a classic and I would give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

He is kind through out the entire movie, and many believe him to be a `cooky' old man. This also includes his employerDoris Walker who has shamedly convinced her daughter that there is no Santa!He daughter Susan is skeptical at first but soon wishes that she could believe, but will not until her mother does.

		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th street is a classic Christmas story revealing that sometimes you don't have to see something or someone for that matter to necessarily believe in it or them. This touching story will make you laugh and cry along with the characters in the story. Edmund Gwenn playing Kris Kringle, Fred Gailey acted by John Payne, and Maureen O'Hara plays Doris Walker who is Suzie Walker's mother who is played by Natalie Wood all do wonderful jobs in the film.  The story starts when Kris Kringle (who is really Santa Claus) meets an actor playing Santa for the Macy's Day Parade past out and drunk on his sleigh right before the parade. Kris is insulted and notifies the person in charge, which is Doris Walker, she decides in a last minute thought and makes Kris the new Macy's mall Santa. The people and even Mr. Macy himself fall in love with the new Santa. Although after everyone is told by Santa himself to go elsewhere to shop, Kris is fired but brought back again because consequently his news was bringing in more business. Only under supervision is Kris brought back into the store and Fred Gailey, Doris' neighbor, decides to take him in. Kris is sent to the company psychiatrist to have his head examined for his abnormal thoughts that he himself is Santa Claus. The real drama in the film starts here as it turns out the company psychiatrist is a little looney himself. Kris struggles to make believers out of Doris, Fred, and Suzie, but when he is put on trial even the judge must question his own beliefs.  Overall it was a good Christmas time movie, it was entertaining, funny, frustrating, and you're left with a good feeling. The locations were good; setting the movie in New York during Christmas was excellent. Also, using an actually department store made the movie seem more realistic. There is also a good lesson to be learned from the film, and that is seeing is not believing which I thought to be very true. The casting was great, although there were some points where the characters got a little phony.  I give this film a 7 out of 10 for good casting, good story and plot, good location and for leaving it in its original black and white. I recommend this film more than the newer version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this film really does belong to a different era of movie history doesn't it? This classic 1947 Christmas film, along with A Christmas Carol and It's A Wonderful Life, should be shown, seen and enjoyed every December. Everything about it harks back to a more innocent age of both Hollywood and society in general.The film revolves around an old man who claims to be the real one and only Santa Claus, and challenges the claim that he is insane simply because of who he believes himself to be. He must thus prove himself to be the real Santa Claus at a New York hearing.It is such a shame that many of the scenes of the film, which were so innocent at the time, would now never be allowed, again indicative of the society we live in today. No mother today would allow her child to spend the afternoon in the house or apartment of 'the nice man across the hall', or allow a strange old man to tuck her daughter in to bed at night alone. But Miracle on 34th Street belongs to a different era, and it is heart-warming and refreshing to see how people once trusted each other with no suspicion of hidden sinister agenda.But enough social commentary. Miracle on 34th Street is one of the most important, nay definitive Christmas films of all time. Anyone who claims not enjoy the unashamed sentimentality of the film is either dead inside or lying. Films back then always contained impossibly generous, noble and honest heroes and villainous, malicious and vindictive villains who were almost positively evil ? characters you could really shake your fist at! In today's special effects-heavy complex story plots, it is wonderful to behold a truly innocent story where plausibility is never even considered, just simply ignored, and instead counts on suspension of disbelief and the ability to appeal to the inner child in all of us.Miracle on 34th Street is simply a Christmas special that is typical of the standard films produced by Hollywood in the first half of the twentieth century. Good guys were very good, bad guys were horrible, and somehow everything always turned out for the best no matter what. Set aside your preconceptions and your disbelief at the simplicity of the film, revel in its refreshing innocence and re-awaken the child inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the magical performance of a 10-year old that makes this special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th Street is the enchanting 1947 holiday classic that made a star out of a 10-year girl named Natalie Wood.The film stars Maureen O'Hara as Doris Walker, a no-nonsense executive at Macy's Department Store who has to replace a drunken Santa Claus for the parade and hurriedly hires a replacement (Edmund Gwenn) who identifies himself as Kris Kringle. Though Mrs. Walker temporarily accepts his identification, she is bothered when, even though he is smashing success as the department store Santa, he makes an impression on her daughter, Susan (Wood), who is aware of her mother's job and has already been taught by her mother that there is no such thing as Santa Claus. However, evidence that Kris might be the real thing keeps piling up and when the man won't say he's anyone else, he is threatened with being institutionalized.This film pushes all the right emotional buttons, thanks primarily to the smooth direction of Seaton and his Oscar-winning screenplay with Valentine Davies. Edmund Gwenn also won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Kris Kringle, which fascinates because he actually makes you believe this guy is who he says he is. Natalie Wood is wonderful as little Susan, who somehow manages to make the character mature without being annoying. Wood's performance is probably my favorite performance by a child actor ever. Maureen O'Hara's crisp performance as Doris Walker is a nice anchor to the story and John Payne is charming as Fred Gailey, the lawyer who ends up defending Kris during his sanity trial who also falls for Doris.If you've never seen this classic, it's a must-see that will surely become a holiday tradition. The film was remade for television in 1973 and theatrically in 1994.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many miracles happened that Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War II had ended less than two years before this film made its debut in early May 1947. It would open in Western Europe in early December, in time for Christmas. The world was in no mood for a court in the United States to declare that there is no Santa Claus. Besides the loss of loved ones in the war, the U.S. and other countries had endured years of rationing, sacrifice and going without. The post-war economies were gearing up, people had jobs and money to spend, and families that had gone without now could buy holiday meals and gifts for everyone. The screenplay of "Miracle on 34th Street" doesn't say anything about all of this. But, it is implied and it was surely understood by the movie audiences that watched the film on its release in 1947. Keeping that in mind today will help one understand the commercialization aspects the movie addressed at that time. Interestingly, Valentine Davies wrote the story for the movie in 1944 while serving in the U.S. Coast Guard. He had become disillusioned by the commercialization of Christmas ? and that was during the war years. Imagine how he would see the major holiday observation in the world today. Davies won one of the three Oscars the film garnered. His was for best original story; and his close friend, George Seaton, won the Oscar for the screenplay. The most recognized Oscar was that awarded to Edmund Gwenn for best supporting actor, as Kris Kringle. One scene in the movie puts the author's point clearly. Kris is talking with Alfred (played by Alvin Greenman), a young Macy janitor who plays Santa Claus at an orphanage. They have talked about the changes in attitudes and loss of the Christmas spirit. Kris, "That's what I've been fighting against for years ?the way they commercialize Christmas." Alfred, "Yeah, there's a lot of bad 'isms' floating around, but one of the worst is 'commercialism.' Make a buck. Mack a buck. Even in Brooklyn it's the same. Don't care what Christmas stands for. Just make a buck. Make a buck." What would Alfred say today with one more 'ism' added ? secularism?This film surely is a holiday classic and favorite. Besides Gwenn, it has a sparkling cast. Maureen O'Hara plays an unusual role for that time ? a divorced single mother who was working in an executive position. Doris Walker was raising her little girl in their mid-town Manhattan apartment. This was 8-year-old Natalie Wood's fifth film and first major role, as Susan Walker. John Payne plays a young attorney, Fred Gailey. Porter Hall is fantastic as Granville Sawyer. He's the twitching neurotic Macy company personnel psychologist (who doesn't have a license to practice, by the way). Much of the comedy occurs in the courtroom sequences. Some of the funniest occurs between Gene Lockhart who plays Judge Henry Harper and William Frawley who plays Charlie Halloran, his campaign manager. All of the cast are excellent. Over the years as I watched this movie with family members, I would "see" the miracle in the story. Only, it changed from year to year. Or rather, it multiplied. So, in answer to a question that someone might ask, "What is the miracle?," it seems clear that there are several. Indeed, this is a film about many miracles, large and small. I'll let the viewers ferret out those themselves. In the meantime, here are some bits of trivia related to the movie. The parade that takes place in the film is the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Macy's started the annual event in 1924. But, that was four years after Herald Square rival department store, Gimbols had held the first such parade in Philadelphia. At the time, Gimbols was the largest department store chain in the world. If you haven't guessed by now, one of the miracles was the coming together of the heads of those two companies in the spirit of Christmas to direct shoppers to others stores if they couldn't find what they wanted in their store. Here are a couple of favorite lines from the film. Doris, "He's crazy. He thinks he is Santa Clause." Julian Shellhammer, "I don't care if he thinks he's the Easter Bunny. You've got to get him back." Doris, "He's insane, I tell you." Shellhammer, "But, but maybe he's only a little crazy ? like painters or composers or some of those men in Washington."Fred and Doris are talking about his defense of Kris in the court hearing. Fred, "You don't have any fat in me, do you?" Doris, "It's not a question of faith. It's just common sense. Fred, "Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Lovely Intangibles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Timeless Christmas classic about a nice old man (Edmund Gwenn) who claims to be the real Santa Claus and must go to court to prove it or else be committed to an insane asylum. What a perfect movie. Edmund Gwenn shines in the role of his career. He is everything you imagine Santa to be when you're a kid. Maureen O'Hara is the divorced single mother of precocious Natalie Wood. She's raising her daughter to be serious-minded and not believe in things like Santa. That's no fun at all but hopefully they'll see the light by the end of the picture. For her part, Wood is adorable with such a brilliant performance for someone so young. You're not likely to find a better child actor than little Natalie was. Like Gwenn, all of her scenes are golden. John Payne is good as the lawyer pursuing O'Hara who also gets the unenviable task of representing Gwenn in court. Supporting cast is full of solid actors like Porter Hall, Gene Lockhart, Philip Tonge, Jerome Cowan, and William Frawley. It's a charming, funny, heartwarming movie that everybody should see once a year. Christmas isn't the same without it. Oh, and the shilling for Macy's and (now-defunct) Gimbels is hands-down the least obnoxious product placement in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Christmas Classic Must Not Be Overlooked!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first did see the remake version of this movie with Richard Attenborough and Mara Wilson in it, but never I saw this one at a young age. I do remember the remake being good, but now I do not know if it holds up well enough if I watch it again or so. Maybe someday I will, but now I must talk about the original. Before talking about it, there is a colorized version of this movie which it is interesting to see, but I do like it better when it is originally presented in black and white. So, anyway, "Miracle on 34th Street" is about an old man name Kris Kringle who claims to be Santa Claus but others believe that he is crazy, and thought that Santa Claus is nothing more but a myth. So it is up to a young lawyer name Fred Gailey to defend him that he is the one and only Santa Claus. You know the story; the characters; etc. Also, you already know how wonderful this movie is. Heck, even the trailer that features a few men working on a trailer on what kind of movie that "Miracle on 34th Street" really is beside being a Christmas movie. Guess what? They are right about this movie as I quote from the trailer: "It's Hilarious!" "Romantic!" "Delightful!" "Charming!" "Tender!" "Exciting!" "Yes, and groovy!" So that is what this movie really is, and the trailer itself says it all. I thought most of the cast were all wonderful in their own roles. Maureen O'Hara and John Payne were great together for making their scenes romantic. A young Natalie Wood is so adorable, and she nails her role really good. Edmund Gwenn is absolutely marvelous as Kris Kringle, and he fits the role perfectly that you buy him the fact that he is Santa Claus. Of course, he really does deserve to win an Academy Award for best supporting actor and I believe that this is the role that he will always be remember for. The movie is funny, but it is also heart warming at the same time. The script is very well written, and very well directed by George Seaton. "Miracle on 34th Street" is definitely a Christmas classic, and it should not be overlooked by today's standards. I give this wonderful movie a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Santa Claus on Trial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer &amp; director George Seaton's "Miracle on 34th Street" qualifies as a classic Christmas movie. This simple but sentimental saga about an elderly individual in a nursing home who insists that he is Santa Claus is both clever and well-intentioned. Is there a Santa Claus? Of course, everybody knows the answer to that question. Seaton and scenarist Valentine Davies have contrived an effective but feel-good movie that challenges cynicism. The miracle in "Miracle of 34th Street" is that faith supersedes cynicism. The romantic leading man, an attorney, sums up the theme of film when he tells the leading lady that: "Faith is believing when common sense tells you not to." Like "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "Miracle of 34th Street" urges us to embrace the positive things in life despite the clear, incontrovertible truth. Of course, Santa Claus doesn't exist because he is too good to be true, and this is why this fantasy flourishes even in the face of the obvious. Edmund Gwenn fielded the Best Supporting Oscar statuette. Not only did Davies land an Oscar for her original story but also director Seaton took one home for his screenplay. Before "Miracle" became miraculous and coined?according IMDb.COM?four times its production costs, studio executive Darryl F. Zanuck had little faith in the project and negotiated with Seaton to helm three other studio projects in exchange for being given the reins to "Miracle." Seaton delivers a polished parable about the issue of consumerism at Christmas time that still resonates with our time. He champions the idea that a little fantasy is good for the soul. The idea that you can overlook one truth or white lie in favor of a greater truth pervades this 1947 epic.An old man replaces a drunken that is masquerading as Santa during the yearly Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Kris (Edmund Gwenn of "Them!") tries to show a rank impostor how to crack a whip. Instead, he discovers to his disgust that the pseudo Santa (Percy Helton) is as drunk as a shrunk. Kris reports this misbehavior to the lady in charge of the parade, Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara of "The Quiet Man"), and she promptly fires the lush and convinces Kris to replace him. Doris is a divorcée who resides in an apartment with her eight-year old daughter, Susan (Natalie Wood), who has never known her father. Doris has raised Susan to focus on facts rather than fantasy. Naturally, when she meets Santa, Susan doesn't believe he hails from the North Pole. Eventually, kindly Kris Kringle changes Susan's mind. Meanwhile, Doris hires Kris to play Santa at Macy's. Not surprisingly, Kris is overjoyed at the prospect of perching yearning children atop his knee and listening to their dreams. Macy's Toy Department supervisor Julian Shellhammer (Philip Tonge of "Witness for the Prosecution"), briefs Kris about what to tell children when they ask about something Macy's doesn't sell. Kris lets Shellhammer's advice go into one ear and out another. Instead, Kris tells the children where they can get what they genuinely want, even if Macy's doesn't have it in their inventory. Before he goes out to listening to the youngsters, Kris has an interesting conversation with the Macy's janitor, Alfred ( Alvin Greenman of "One Minute to Zero") who plays Santa Claus to poor children because it makes him feel good. They complain about the crass commercialism that has infected our twentieth century lives. Alfred indicts the profit motive, "Yeah, there's a lot of bad 'isms' floatin' around this world, but one of the worst is commercialism. Make a buck, make a buck. Even in Brooklyn it's the same - don't care what Christmas stands for, just make a buck, make a buck." Ironically, Kris' altruistic notion about telling kids where they can find their ideal gift doesn't get him fired. Indeed, Mr. Macy (Harry Antrim) loves the idea the parents of these children applaud what he has done. Macy decides to create a directory where kids as well as adults find what they want. Later, our hero comes under fire from the Macy's psychiatrist, Granville Sawyer (Porter Hall of "Double Indemnity"), assures Doris that Kris should be committed to a mental institution. When he learns that Sawyer is brainwashing poor Alfred, Kris assaults him with his cane and winds up in Bellevue. Fred Gaily (John Payne) agrees to represent him in court. Predictably, Doris thinks that Fred has lost his mind, but he takes the case. Miraculously, Fred uses all the mail that children have sent to the Post Office to validate his claim to being Saint Nick. Along the way, Sawyer is fired, and Fred wins his case. "Miracle on 34th Street" is a wonderful picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Christmas movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie again this year and as always, it is great Christmas entertainment. Now 67 years old, the cast still delights us and the story still sparkles. The movie makes me recall the "Dear Virginia" letter written in the late 1800's to reassure children of the existence of Santa Claus and to deliver a short lecture to a cynical world that would undermine his existence. To me, no movie speaks more to the heart of Santa Claus than this one. Edmund Gwynn is superb as the man who takes on the Santa persona. Maureen O'Hara is Doris Walker, the organizer of the Santa Claus Parade for Macy's Department Store, who asks him to substitute for a hopelessly inebriated Santa before the parade. John Payne is the lawyer Fred Gailey, who tries to win her hand in marriage and soften her hard-hearted view of the world, robbing her daughter Susan (played by Natalie Wood) of her childhood. The cast is rounded out by Gene Lockhart as Judge Harper and William Frawley as Charlie Halloran, a Tammany Hall boss who gets embroiled in the politics of having Santa declared to be a fantasy. Jerome Cowen is the district attorney in a hopeless battle against public opinion and his own family. The one and only Thelma Ritter appears briefly as a no-nonsense Manhattan mom. The whole thing is as sugar coated as Christmas lollipops and Susan's vision of a home in the suburbs fits beautifully into Fred Gailey's aspiration for a home in Long Island, certainly a dream shared by many young men in 1947 New York. The courtroom where the drama reaches a climax is a hilarious episode with a surprise ending, that is already well known for many viewers. The views of the district around Central Park and 34th Street are wonderful in this movie, and the on-location shooting in Manhattan and Long Island greatly enhance the movie. This particular format of the movie was colorized and while I am not a big fan of this technique, it didn't detract from the movie and was an asset to the parade scenes and views. All in all this is great holiday fare that everyone should see. To me, it is one of the two or three best Christmas movies ever made. Highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful Christmas movie. Yes, its kind of idealistic, cheesy, sentimental and emotionally manipulative at times, but that's part of its charm. It requires you to leave your cynicism at the door, and just go with the flow.While it's mostly a Christmas message, there are some more all- encompassing and timeless messages. Most particularly, the anti- consumerism and work-life balance messages.Simple plot with a beautiful story. Has some very funny moments too.Good performances by Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara and John Payne in the lead roles. An 8/9-year old Natalie Wood gives a fantastic performance in one of her earliest roles.Second only to It's a Wonderful Life as far as Christmas movies go. Shares with that movie the same simple yet wonderful idealism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charming Movie From A Very Different Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very hard not to love this movie. It's been remade over the years at least a couple of times that I can think of - but I've never bothered watching the remakes. Some movies just don't need it. This movie (this basic story) was a product of its time, and in that context it works. The basic story is around the question of whether Santa Claus is real, and whether this "Kris Kringle" (Edmund Gwenn) - who's been hired to play Santa at Macy's Department store in New York City - is the real thing, as he claims to be.If that were the only issue this would be a simple and yet charming movie. Gwenn was perfectly cast in the part, and he brings a low key joy to the role, as he seeks to spread Christmas cheer, even as his very sanity is questioned. Primarily his goal is to convince Susan and her mother Doris to believe. Susan was played by a very young Natalie Wood, and Doris by Maureen O'Hara. Doris is a mother grounded in reality. No pretend or fairy tales or Santa Claus for her daughter. And Susan struggles to be a child in that very adult-oriented world. You see, there is a darker side to this story. Doris is a divorcée - a rather risky proposition for movie going audiences in 1947, who wouldn't have been very accustomed to seeing single mothers being portrayed. Doris is also a different character for the era in that she seems to have a pretty significant executive position at Macy's. Doris hires Kris to play Santa, then struggles as she realizes that he really believes himself to be Santa. Is he or isn't he? Her struggle increases as Susan starts to believe in him as well.Doris has a love interest, of course. Fred Gailey (John Payne) is her neighbour and a lawyer who ends up defending Kris at his sanity hearing. Here was one thing that jumped out at me immediately as a sign of a more innocent time. Gailey befriended young Susan long before he met her mother. A grown man befriending a little girl? Our 21st century minds are jarred by the concept, and immediately suspicious. But Fred not only befriends Susan, he uses Susan to meet Doris - and in the context of the movie and the era, this all worked surprisingly innocently. The characters are all likable and well portrayed.There are other issues - portrayals of the profit motive of big business, and of politics intruding into judicial affairs. For a movie with a seemingly innocent premise, it has some surprisingly deep subplots that are interesting to watch.This certainly has to rank as a Christmas classic that's not to be missed, and it deserves a spot in the list of movies to watch annually at this time of year.

		<shortDescription>An admirable achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd vaguely heard of this film but never actually seen it: I watched it because of Edmund Gwenn, and ended up both admiring and enjoying the picture much more than I had expected to.Perhaps it is because of its date, but this is not actually nearly as saccharine a film as I would have assumed; in fact, the thing that appeals to me most of all is the way that the 'miracle' is very cleverly built up as the result of individual human impulses, undertaken for believably selfish reasons, all dovetailing together. The children end up getting their dream presents not by magic hand-waving but through the thoroughly practical constraints of the real world, and even the adult leads don't really believe in Father Christmas... and then at the very end of the film, there is the subtlest of suggestions that just maybe the impossible can come true after all.A picture that manages to satisfy both the cynic and the romantic, with credible relationships and appeal to young and adult alike. Sweet-natured without being sickly, humorous without being facetious, respectful and inventive of old legend at one and the same time, with a clear-eyed and yet optimistic view of human nature.Recommended to the film buff and the general viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rare Excellent Christmas-Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christmas time, in terms of cinema, is an unfortunate minefield. You know nothing good will come of entering it, but you'll let yourself be sucked in, regardless. Yet, 1947's "Miracle on 34th Street" is a truly rare film of its genre that, even if momentarily, makes you forget all the trash produced in this genre.The script is what makes the picture the joy it is. Where most films involving Santa Claus go wrong is in creating a world of magic, then asking people to believe it because of the sprinkling of some mindless pontifications to why it should be suitable even within one's sense of reality. The advice for adults to buy Santa Claus is, of course, preposterous, and I imagine those children who actually believe in the character don't much care what are the plots of such generic movies."Miracle on 34th Street" takes a very different, and tremendously successful, route: that of painting a real world in a very engaging, clever, charming way, that presents the argument for "belief" in a tone perfectly between sincere and tongue-in-cheek.I feel most "good" Christmas movies came about after the 1970s, when effusiveness was traded for sharper, darker humor (though, by the 1990s, for a deplorable, nauseously saccharine stupidity). As it is, "It's a Wonderful Life" and this picture stand out as two truly special pieces of holiday cinema from before this era, albeit they do in very different ways from each other.Altogether, with "Miracle on 34th Street," the performances are perfect, the characters are intelligent, and the film is simply too marvelous to skip during any month of December.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miracle on 34th Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th Street is one of those classic holiday films that everyone should view at least once. It reminds us that we all need to have a little bit of belief within. This film, actually shot on 61st Street in New York, is based on the story by Valentine Davies. When straight laced PR executive Doris Walker played by Maureen O'Hara hires new "Santa", Kris Kringle played by Edmund Gwenn for New York's Macy's Department Store she gets more than she bargained for. Doris' daughter played by a young Natalie Wood becomes attached to the gentle old man and irritates her Mother because she has always told her daughter not to believe in fantasies. As the film progresses and Kris Kringle insists that he is the true Santa, his mental status is questioned. Doris' neighbor, Fred Gailey played by John Payne who is an attorney is convinced of the old man's sincerity and agrees to represent Kris at a formal hearing to determine his stability. In the end Fred relies on the fact that The US Postal Service allows mail to be delivered to Kris at the courthouse and thus proves that a Government agency believes in Santa. The judge, who because of the publicity was being pressured by his own grandchildren, finds in favor of Kris Kringle and drops the case. This is a great holiday film for all ages. All will enjoy this film with it's theme of faith and believing what you can't see or prove. Several threads in this film meet this theme. Doris and Susan's relationship, even though strong, is strengthened after Doris finds that after an unpleasant divorce, she has built a wall around herself emotionally and has unknowingly projected these same feelings onto her daughter. A new sense of friendlier competition is forged between Macy's and Gimbal's. They find that business for them will never be the same again. Fred who has feelings for Doris but unable to find a way to get close to her, finally makes her see that it's really okay for her to lower her emotional walls. We also see that in a court of law matters of faith and believe can be successfully defended.This black and white film released in May 1947 although a holiday film expresses the spirit and wonder of Christmas time. The wardrobe and settings of the film are true to the period of time and give the viewer a correct feeling of holiday time in the late 1940's. If you enjoy other films of this period such as A Wonderful Life you will enjoy Miracle on 34th Street. Both are films that promote faith, belief in yourself as well as importance of belief in what you feel in your heart. And let's admit it, what better time of year to produce films of this caliber than the holidays. ReferencesValentine Davies (Story), William Perlberg (Producer), George Seaton (Director). (1947).

		<shortDescription>Magical and imaginative- a true delight for the Christmas season</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit it, I may be biased. I love Christmas movies, such as Scrooge, It's A Wonderful Life, Muppet Christmas Carol and the first two Home Alone movies. But really your Christmas is incomplete without the original Miracle on 34th Street, which is quite simply a timeless Christmas treasure. It is magical, imaginative and in some ways witty as well. The simple but effective and sparkling plot tells of a man believing himself as Santa is institutionalised for being insane, but sets out to prove he is the genuine article. The screenplay is lovely, spirited and pleasant, maybe it needed to be a little more snappy in places but compared to how wonderful the film was I am past caring. The cinematography and scenery are fabulous, the whole film is stunning to watch, and the music is gorgeous. And the acting, one word superb! As Kris Kringle, Edmund Gwenn is just marvellous. He positively twinkles in the role, and did he deserve the Oscar win for best supporting actor. Why am I asking that, of course he did. Maureen O'Hara, who was a stunning actress is so lovely as Doris, and as Fred John Payne also shines. And Natalie Wood is believable and absolutely adorable as Susan. What makes this movie though is that it teaches great morals, without preaching. All in all, a truly great film, that made me believe in Santa. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transcedent film that leaves you amazed at the film's artistic merit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that tug at your heart - "Mr. Smith Goes Washington," "Old Yeller," "Its a Wonderful Life," "Saving Private Ryan," etc, etc,; and for sure "Miracle on 34th Street is one of those films. However, having seen "Miracle on 34th Street" at least a dozen times as part of my family's Christmas tradition I have come to appreciate that it is far more than just a cute, feel-good Christmas classic.Yes, this film takes on the commercialization of Christmas and gets us to rethink what is so wonderful about being "realistic" and "practical;" but beyond telling a good story, it is in fact an amazingly well-directed and well-acted film with inspired casting. From the talented and beautiful Maureen O'Hara (see her in the "The Quiet Man" if you want another fun film well worth watching multiple times), to Edwin Gwinn as Kris Kringle, to Natalie Wood as Susan Walker, to William Frawley of "I Love Lucy" fame as the world-wise political adviser to Judge Henry Harper, it is hard for me to think of a movie with better casting.Director George Seaton creates so many memorable and amazing scenes that picking one out as being exceptional is difficult in that they are all exceptional relative to what you get in your average film. He also effectively develops even the lesser characters so that they become endearing and enduring characters despite getting very little screen time. (Something I have seen many modern films attempt to do, but fail at miserably.) Yes, the "Miracle on 34th Street" is clever, cute, funny and poignant, but don't let that obscure the fact it is a triumph in the art of film-making that is matched by precious few films.If you have not seen this film you are in for a treat. If you have seen this film I encourage you to take the time to appreciate the artistry of it as you enjoy this timeless classic once again. Definitely worth buying!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th Street is one of those movies that you want to watch every Christmas. (Obviously because it's a Christmas movie.)It stars Kris Kringle. He believes he is Santa Claus, and everybody else believes that he is crazy. So, a lawyer (I forgot his name.) tries to prove that he is the real Santa.Miracle on 34th Street talks about the existence of Santa, but never seems corny, like we expect most Christmas films to be. No, instead it's sweet and somewhat charming.The ending is pretty interesting too. Although I liked the ending of the re-make better, I still enjoyed this one. (I'm talking about the ending of the court battle.) The characters seem to have depth and the film seems to have a certain charm and warmth in it.8/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director/Script: George Seaton, Story: Valentine Davies, Cast: Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, Natalie Wood, Gene Lockhart, William FrawleyWhile this may not be the classic that 'It's a Wonderful Life' is, this warm hearted holiday film is a classic in its own right and I prefer it to its more famous cousin. This great fantasy film takes me back to what seems like a simpler time. Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara)one of the managers at the giant Macy's department store on 34th St. in NYC, hires a man by the name of Kris Kringle to be Santa Claus for Macy's parade after he reports to her that their 'Santa' is drunk! As the story unfolds, we discover that Mr. Kringle claims to be the real Santa. However, Doris is a very modern and sensible women and she does not believe in the likes of Santa Klaus. Her little daughter,Susan(Natalie Wood) is very influenced by dear mom so she does not believe in Santa either. The villain in this story is Macy's so called company psychiatrist. When made do do a psych eval, Mr. Kringle upstages the psychiatrist. Out of anger the psychiatrist has Mr. Kringle institutionalized. Doris's neighbour who happens to be an attorney, comes to his rescue and not only gets him out of the institution but by the films end he is able to prove to the court that Mr. Kringle is indeed the real Santa.Miricle on 34th St. and It's a Wonderful Life came out at about the same time (1946 and 1947). Here we have two holiday classics from the same time period but in many ways they are complete opposites. It's a Wonderful Life was a very typical film for its time whereas Miricle was way ahead of its time. In many ways, with the exception of the clothing styles and black and white photography, it could have been made in the 1970's. Maureen O'Hara plays a very practical, intelligent and independent professional women who is also a single mom. The dad is not around and not even mentioned in the film. This was very uncommon for 1947! It's a Wonderful Life dealt with more traditional family mores which could be why it is more known. I like the performances of all the actors in this film. Maureen O'Hara was a great actress of the time. We get a chance to see Natlie Wood as a cute child actress before she became a big star. She did very well. Edmund Gween plays a great Santa. He is my favourite live film Santa. What I especially like about this film above all other things is the sense of mystery that Seaton and Davies were able to convey. All the 'evidence' that proves Mr Kringle is the real Santa is circumstantial. They really leave it up to us to decide. Never do we see anything supernatural associated with him like you do in most Christmas stories. We never see any reindeer, sleigh, elves etc. The scene in the courtroom where Fred(John Payne) is finally able to prove he is the real Santa is hilarious. Much funnier and more convincing that in the 1994 John Hughes remake which is incidentally a much more conservative film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAUTION: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSMiracle on 34th Street was such a delight to view. This film had such an impact that I actually wanted to watch more and more, hoping it would never end.It tells the story of a mother and daughter, neither of which believe in fairy tales and myths (including the infamous Santa Claus) and their newfound friend, Kris Kringle. Kris, to the public, is just a nice old man who plays a really convincing Santa, and actually is Santa! Because he refers to himself as Santa, people believe he is insane, and he is taken to the supreme court to rule out the existence of Santa Claus, and because of Mrs. Walker's (the mother) new beau, who is Santa's attorney, he is considered a real person, and makes the unbelievers believe again.This is a very touching story. This reviewer never thought that this would be a movie I would genuinely enjoy, but as the beginning credits came to an end, and the film began, I became entrapped. The acting was done very well. Even for a time where movies were in an almost primordial state, the film had become an instant favorite, and the reviewer can say that many other people feel the same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie to get you in the Christmas mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th street is a great movie, perfect for getting into the holiday mood. This movie starts out with just a nice old man, until on day people begin to suspect him of much more. These people believe him to be Santa Claus. Kris Kringle is then met with a very unimaginative girl Susan and her mother Mrs. Walker, with no child like feelings. Being Santa and all he takes on the job of giving this little girl Susan a fun childhood and helping the mother to remember a time when she used to do the same. Santa with his new day-job at Macy's department store starts to raise some wonder of his true identity. Many skeptical adults decide that a nice, caring man could be nothing other than insane. Where he is then put on trial. A child a heart and a young lawyer, Mr. Gailey, decides to take on the case and prove to the world that Kris Kringle is the one and only REAl Santa. During the movie there is also a theme of love. Mr. Gailey while helping Kris, also has Mrs. Walker and Susan on his mind. He spends the whole movie thinking of clever ways to be with her.  This movie overall is a really cute, light hearted movie about remembering what is was like to be young, innocent and still believe the unbelievable. I recommend this movie, especially during the Christmas season to get you to think. Maybe you have lost you inner child, and this is the perfect antidote to being an adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really was a miracle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The `Miracle on 34th Street' was a one in a million. It is a story about a heartbroken, divorced mother (Maureen Ohera) and a young child (Natalie Wood) who was lead to not believe in santa or even Christmas. Doris Walker (Ohera) was a divorced mother and she wanted her daughter (Susan Walker (Wood)) to not believe in things that are not really there. The acting in the movie didn't seem to be real at all. You could totally tell that it was fake. Susan seemed to know more then she should, she was very mature for the time period and for her age. It was kind-of weird to see a little girl that had to be about 8 or 9 to act so mature. The floats in the parade also seemed to be fake, but they were cool too. There wasn't much music, but whenever there was music it did fit the movie, and the time period for the season and the year. You may not have noticed it but in the being shot there was a shot of the walker's apartment and through the window there was the parade going on and you could see the street sign that it was 34th street that the parade was going on and that's their apartment was on too. In the ending Fred Gailey (John Payne) became Doris' boyfriend and helped out Chris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) in a law suite and near the end they were driving by a house and Susan wanted that house for Christmas and she ran in side when Doris and Fred went into the living room Fred said `maybe I did do a great thing today' then they notice the cane that Chris (Gwenn) always had with him was leaning against the fireplace and Fred says `maybe it wasn't such a good thing after all' meaning he didn't have to prove that Chris Kringle was really Chris Kringle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heart Warming Christmas Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER! This classic Christmas story is about a mother and daughter who live in New York City. The mother is named Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara). She works as a Macy's department store event coordinator and meets a man named Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) when he is disgusted with a man who was supposed to be portraying Santa Claus at the annual parade. Kris then goes on to become a controversial Macy's employee. He claims to be Santa Claus himself and sparks a court case that attempts to both prove his sanity and legally prove he is Santa. Obviously that seems like an impractical task. But Doris' neighbor and love interest takes on this enormous job. They work to prove that Kris is in fact Santa Claus and succeed. In the end, all get what they want and have a merry Christmas. Miracle on 34th Street is an uplifting story that shows viewers that miracles can happen. But it also shows a lot about how our society is. It shows how close minded we are and how we really won't believe in something that couldn't possibly be realistic. Doris' daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) was taught not to believe in imagination and intangibles, but Kris teaches her and her mother that imagination and those intangibles are the most important things in life. Nothing really sticks out to the viewer as far as music or camera techniques because the story is so good, those things don't quite matter as much. Miracle on 34th Street won 3 Academy awards in 1947. One was for best supporting actor, one for best writing-original story and another for best writing-screenplay. A quote from this movie that really sums up the theme of it is, `Someday you're going to find that your way of facing this realistic world just doesn't work. And when you do, don't overlook those lovely intangibles. You'll discover that those are the only things that are worth while'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Christmas classic at it's `best', Miracle on 34th Street (the original version) is a `heartwarming' tale of Christmas spirit, American style. While this movie is cute and fun to watch, this reviewer is left wondering, `is this what Christmas is all about?' The storyline is wholesome and positive. Doris Walker, a single mother, (Maureen O'Hara) seems to be skeptical about the way children are brought up and raises her own child, Susan, (Natalie Wood) to believe in only the truth. In particular she doesn't believe in fairy tales or, Santa Claus; Santa, coincidently, is on vacation in the city the month before Christmas. (Doesn't it seem a bit odd that Santa is taking a holiday until Christmas Eve?) Well Santa, after crossing paths with Doris, ends up playing Santa in the big Thanksgiving Day Parade and then proceeds to play a shopping mall Santa. Once everyone that he works with starts to constantly hear from him that HE is the real Santa they start to question his sanity. After a few mishaps Santa ends up on trial and has to somehow prove to a world of non-believers that he is the real and true Santa. Imagine filming a parade and how ridiculously hard it would be, there is so much action going on and it's not even a real parade it's just a bunch of actors doing the same scene over and over again, in a public city street, but the way it's shown on the big screen it looks truly live and well thought out. There are so many things big and small that go into putting together a parade and then to just place one in a movie that also has a million other things going on just seems nuts. However, George Seaton direction of this film did a great job of both. The parade seems flawless (besides the obvious predicament that occurs) and the movie flows so well from scene to scene, act to act. From beginning to end this story is sweet and charming but leaves this reviewer a bit concerned. Is this what Christmas all about? Is true Christmas Spirit the feeling that one gets when opening the X-box that Santa dropped off? Isn't Christmas Spirit supposed to be a feeling of goodwill and helping one another in the same way that Jesus, the whole reason for the holiday, did? This movie seems to allude to the idea that getting what's on the list is what Christmas is all about. Don't get this reviewer wrong, opening gifts is great fun and so is watching someone else's joy when opening a gift. This movie is also a good movie with a great cast and it's a cute story. This reviewer is just concerned that with all the lovely holiday magic the real Christmas Miracle is becoming lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic better then the newer version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th street is a wonderfully made movie, they traditionally start the movie with the thanksgiving parade, but the Santa that Doris Walker hired in the beginning is drinking, and this older man mentions this to her. She first tries to sober the Santa up, but then realizes that it is not going to work, but right in front of her eyes is an older man that would be perfect for the part. So this man plays santa in the thanksgiving parade, then later on after the parade he is employed by Macy's store to be the Santa in the mall. During this movie miss walkers daughter develops a friendship with this old man, through the movie miss Walker and her daughter begin to realize that this old man believes that he is in fact Santa Clause. Miss Walker always thought that he was lying but Susan Slowly started believing that he was Santa Clause. Other people did not want to believe him and thought that there was no such thing as Santa Clause. But he goes to court for the judge to decide whether or not he is Santa Clause. I will not tell you what happens in the end but this is a must see movie, I was not that interested in watching it because I was not a fan of black and white films. Also I had seen the newer version and was unsure that an older film would be better then the new one. To my dismay I found out that once you begin watching the film you forget it is black and white, because of the drama, and comedy. This is a family movie that most everyone would enjoy, it makes you question whether or not you believe in Santa Clause. This is a wonderfully made movie, it made me feel extremely happy about what wonders there are in the world. Also if you are in the mood to watch a great Santa Clause movie, this is one you should defiantly watch. It makes your spirits rise to their fullest, specially during Christmas time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps the most up lifting movie ever made. This movie is great for people of all age mixing a court room drama with the classic story Santa clause except this movie adds a twist. Instead of the viewer knowing for a fact that the person portraying Santa is in fact the real deal the viewer has to make up their mind as to both what Santa really is (an idea, a symbol, or if the take everything literally and a person who lives in the north pole and flies rain deer and can't possibly exist). The way the viewer interpreters Santa speaks wonders for there Christmas sprit and the general happiness in life. This movie is also likely to change the viewers mind about what or who Santa is.The first set of scenes were designed for the viewer to see who the main character Kris is and what he stood for and to provide proof to the conclusion that the viewer has drawn. The first scene in this movie has Kris Kringle walking down the streets of New York with a smile on looking into various shops to see the window displays that are being changed to Christmas themes. Kris stops at one window and instructs the man setting up the display that he is doing in incorrectly and is very polite about it. The director seems to this to show the viewer that this man will be playing Santa in the movie. The next scene Kris is walking and sees a drunken Santa trying to use a whip Kris offers his help and finds that the Santa is drunk so he tells the director of the parade and tells her she offers him the job and he agrees. The writer wrote this scene seemingly to provide more proof that Kris is Santa. After Kris's excellent performance as Santa he is offered a job as the Santa at Macy's he agrees and brings his own costume to the job (it is much nicer then the one that the company has provided). This was done again by the writer to build evidence that he is the real deal. After a few days at his job Kris has to go through psychological testing because he has mentioned that he is the real Santa he complies and says that he has taken dozens and hasn't failed one yet. This sequence of events demonstrates to the viewer that he has been questioned and doubted about is identify before and has never been proven wrong.The next set of events show the different types of people whom are split up into two groups the first those who believe in Santa and the second those who do not. This set of scenes starts with the results of Kris's test the man who administered the test claims that Kris is delusional and likely to hurt someone but a man who has tested him before (whom Kris's employer has called in) disagrees strongly saying something to the effect of though this man is delusional his is a delusion to do go and wouldn't hurt a fly (at this point Kris's employer is a non believer). In this scene the believers and nonbelievers argue about Kris's ability to do his job. Scenes continue like this for a while climaxing and towards the end of the movie when Kris is legally declared the real Santa thanks to his friends and his employer who has now has become a believer and gives Kris hope.This is a great Christmas movie for people of all ages it has drama an intelligent plot that is but to the children's story of Santa. I would give this movie a 8 out of 10 because though it isn't the best movie I have ever scene but is still a very well done movie that make the viewer think and may even change the viewers mind.</fullReview>

EdmundGwenn is excellent as Kris Kringle, department store Santa Claus extrodinaire who happens to be really Santa Claus! Of course, this sparks trouble to those that don't think that wise old elf exists, and the nice old man who claims to be Santa is just a screwloose.

		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th Street (1947)Well, this is an amazing and imperfect movie. It's smart and original. And the full HD black and white original version has popped up on Netflix streaming and so here's my two cents.Besides being a classic, there are some curious quirks to the movie. One has been much talked about--the portrayal of real life people and real life department stores, especially Mr. Macy and Mr. Gimbel, the owners of the two big stores featured as competitors. When the movie was screened, the stores apparently didn't mind either of the portrayals. (The original Mr. Macy, by the way, died in 1877--yes--but he was the one who, by terrific coincidence, installed in-store Santa Clauses as a selling gimmick. The original Mr. Gimbel was really one of two brothers. Both Macy's and Gimbels started as Midwest stores, and the New York successes came in the 20th Century.)The movie was released in snowless May and was very popular. Even against all the great post-war films released that year, this was considered by many to be the best of the crop, and was nominated for best pic. It won a whole bunch of Oscars for acting, screen writing, and so on. The one key person behind it all was the writer and director George Seaton, who earlier contributed to some other minor productions like "The Wizard of Oz" and to a couple of Marx Bros films. But this is really his one larger than life success in the movies. He was also the voice of the Lone Ranger on radio.The movie is very New Yorky, which is great. Not only the parade scenes, but the sets in the big department store (that's really Macy's) and the dialects of some of the actors (in court, or in the post office sorting facility) make it sharply regional. Santa, being from the North Pole, didn't need to sound like the Lower East Side, and the great Edmund Gwenn performance has his English accent intact. When he won the Oscar for Best Actor, he said something like, "Now I know there really is a Santa Claus." The movie was shot in New York, and the parade is really the parade, with the shooting timed to go around its progression, which was not to be stopped in any way by the filming.I don't like colorized movies just because I like to watch things the way they were conceived, just like I'd prefer to read a classic book the way it was originally written and not spiced up with more recent slang, or whatever the equivalent would be. But if you simply hate black and white, there are two colorized versions, the painstaking handmade one from thirty years ago, or a recent computer-driven version. Check the DVD packages to be sure. The Blu-Ray, true to good form, is the b&amp;w version, and that no doubt is the one Netflix is streaming. It looks terrific.What exactly is on 34th Street? Why Macy's itself, the department store, billed then and now as the largest in the world, though a new Korean store is far bigger. Gimbels was only a block away on 33rd Street, so sending shoppers there for a better deal was very logical, at least geographically. After the movie came out, Macy's tried exactly this policy for a year, using what it called "Mrs. Claus" to do the good deeds. Macy's had right of refusal on the film, and viewed it before release to give its approval. Of course they loved it--what free publicity it has had for half a century--and the movie took off. Oddly, it is with home video that the real legendary holiday status took hold, as it did with "It's a Wonderful Life," the dated aspects of either movie reading now as pure glorious nostalgia. It's not as well constructed as Capra's 1946 uber-classic, but it has a similar fanciful, redeeming warmth that fit the country in the year or two after the war, and fit the country now. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those times when I'm more than happy to be in the majority and endorse the view of every poster here who found this to be a delight. Perhaps not surprisingly given the season it has just been screened on television in England and it compares more than favorably with the contemporary fare surrounding it. For one thing it has a wonderful period 'feel' and a fine cast toplined by an outstanding Edmund Gwen who was technically a 'supporting' actor here as he was time and again in a long and illustrious career. Nominal leads John Payne and Maureen O'Hara are more than competent but light years behind Gwen and there are some great cameos not least from Thelma Ritter, then at the start of a distinguished career, Porter Hall, Jerome Cowan and a pre-teen but still recognizable Natalie Wood as single mom O'Hara's daughter. It's hard to find anything negative here so I'm not even going to try. This is really what real 'film' is all about despite what the Academic-Psued axis would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful and the best use of an umbrella ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the Manhattan Christmas parade and the actor playing Santa Claus is discovered to be drunk by a jolly bearded old man. Upon being told of this, organiser Doris Walker begs the old gentleman to take the drunk Santa's place, which he does with brilliantly believable results, resulting in a residency at Macy's department store as their Christmas Santa. It's during this stint at Macy's that the staff learn that the old gent goes by the name of Kris Kringle and proclaims himself to be the real Santa Claus. After passing medical checks, Kris goes about his duties by bringing joy to all those he comes into contact with, even prompting the big wig store owners to alter their approach to Christmas selling strategies. But the devious Macy's doctor is not convinced and after one heated confrontation with Kris manages to get him to lose his temper, thus paving the way to having Kris committed for being insane. Those close to Kris, namely Fred Gaily, take up the challenge which results in a court hearing where Fred will argue that Kris is sane because he is actually the real Santa Claus, beliefs are to be tried and tested!Delightful Christmas picture that lights up many a living room at the festive season. Seeping with sentiment and nudging the ribs of commercialism, Miracle On 34th Street stands the test of time for being the heart warmer that it is, winning three Academy Awards for Best Actor: Edmund Gwenn, Best Original Story: Valentine Davies and Best Screenplay: George Seaton, all are richly deserved. If you haven't seen it then I suggest you let it into your life as soon as possible, if you have seen it then I hope amongst hope that you feel the same way as do, charming and essential for the Christmas period. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must see for the Christmas season. It's the best one of all. My video copy seems to have a missing scene though. I have seen only once a scene after the courtroom verdict where the district attorney goes to his car and there on the seat is an official football helmet as requested by his son!! This scene is missing from every other screening we have seen. I think this is an integral part of the movie and would be very interested to know why it was ever removed and would also be interested in a copy with this scene present. Maybe an anniversary edition DVD will include it. One other must see each Christmas is Scrooge, the only one, with Alastair Sim. Truly a gem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other movies have tried to do a remake of 1947's "Miracle on 34th Street". The original is still the best. It is certainly a part of our holiday viewing. I love the look and feel of this black and white classic. The movie shows its age, with the men wearing big 3 piece suits and hats, and the big 1947 automobiles in abundance. The women all wear thick long dresses, and bobbed hair. But that classic look is what adds to the quality. It is a vintage look and a vintage script. Natalie Wood is special, and Edmund Gwynn becomes Kris Kringle. Maureen O'Hara and John Payne are very good. "Miracle on 34th Street" is like viewing a animated post card from 1947. It is a gift from the past, and reminds us of a simpler time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kringle Has Been Declared A Menace To Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doris Walker works for Macy's department store in New York and hires an unusual man, Kris Kringle, to play Santa Claus. The problem is Kringle claims he really is Santa Claus and wants to convince Doris and her daughter Susan of the need to believe in magic ?Everybody likes a good Christmas movie (my favourite is Gremlins) and this is one of the best, with a funny script by writer-director Seaton, excellent performances throughout and a cheerfully whimsical atmosphere. What I particularly like about it is that it lets you make up your own mind about Kris Kringle - is he really Santa Claus, or just a somewhat deluded but nice old man ? What's important is not so much whether you believe in Santa but whether you believe he believes he's Santa, and the story wisely never resorts to having him perform some miracle, thereby ruining the wonder and mystery. Gwenn is fabulous in the pivotal role, but then he's always good (check him out also in Foreign Correspondent, Them! and particularly The Trouble With Harry). He plays scenes like the one where he talks to the Dutch girl without ever overdoing it or sentimentalising; he's more irascible and down-to-Earth than your average movie Santa. For me, this is also a quintessential Noo Yawk picture, with Bugs Bunny accents, bubblegum kids (eight-year-old Wood is remarkably sassy and straight-laced) and a slightly cracked wiseguy sensibility. It somehow manages to be both tender and streetwise, but most of all is just good fun. There are a lot of Christmas movies - everybody from Monty Python to Arnold Schwarzenegger has tried one - but this is one of the best. Remade several times for TV and again as a feature in 1994, but none of them are as good as this original. An Oscar-winner for both Seaton and Gwenn, and a warm-hearted classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of All the Christmas Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to Christmas movies, of course, everyone has his or her favorite. But among all the selections, this witty and thought-provoking tale may just be the very best Christmas movie ever made. And the 1973 and 1994 remakes simply reinforce how a movie more than 50 years old, and set in a particular era, can nevertheless be timeless.There is so much to cherish here. The script was years ahead of its time, portraying Maureen O'Hara as a driven, yet competent and self-confident career woman who is also a single mother. (A more conventional script for 1947 would have made the main character a widow rather than a divorcée, or a single father who had lost his wife tragically.) At the peak of America's postwar prosperity and confidence, it questioned the commercialism of Christmas and of our consumer society (not that it did any good -- the fifties were still to come.)And it even had the chutzpah to use real 1940s department stores as the setting for a business rivalry, making this one of the few mainstream works to use real American businesses, and not the make-believe ones we often see in the movies, as examples of what might be wrong with America. This not only makes the film seem more real-to-life, but also gives it, all these years later, more resonance than it would have had if it had been set in some fictional America that never existed.The real gem, here, though, is in the cast. O'Hara walks a fine, difficult line in a strong woman's part which broke many stereotypes for its era. John Payne is quiet, yet thoughtful as the lawyer who gradually comes to believe in his client. Natalie Wood gives a wonderful performance, at once as hard-headed as her mother, yet completely believable as a child. And, of course, presiding over it all, is Edmund Gwenn in the part of a lifetime, utterly compelling as Kris Kringle. As one critic has put it, one has to wonder if that *isn't* the real Kris Kringle up there on the screen, simply using Edmund Gwenn's screen actor's guild card.This is a movie to be seen, and seen again, for all its wonderful moments -- Kris' charming, gentle efforts to get Susan to practice using her imagination; the look on Natalie Wood's face when, as Susan, she sees Kris begin to speak Dutch to the little girl; William Frawley as Judge Harper's political adviser explaining the rules of life to his 'candidate' (Gene Lockhart, in another marvelous role); and, finally, the climactic courtroom scenes, which actually play out better and more realistically than in a lot of in so-called "law movies."Yes -- it's enough to make anyone believe in miracles; in the spirit of Christmas; and, most certainly, in Santa Claus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuine Holiday Mainstay That Deserves its Reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a lot for me to fall for a sentimental Christmas movie, but this one has excellent balance, charming actors and an original angle that still remains pertinent seventy years after the fact. It all thrives on Edmund Gwenn's definitive performance as Kris Kringle, of course, the man who professes to be the true St. Nick despite the protests of his bosses and coworkers at a busy New York Macy's. His warmth is enveloping and genuine, from the twinkle in his eye to the snug connection he shares with the children. The film's cornerstone moment is an unexpectedly touching little interaction between Gwenn's Santa and a freshly-adopted little Dutch girl who blossoms when he speaks her native tongue. It's stuffed with such surprising bits of whimsy, even as the drama ratchets and we find ourselves in the midst of a courtroom drama, which keeps things from feeling excessively heavy. In short, a heartwarming bit of holiday cheer that nails the spirit of the season without feeling too cheesy, preachy or religious. Well worth its reputation as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful and charming film (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) employs a kindly old man to be her Santa Claus both on parade and in Macy's department store after discovering that her intended Santa Claus is intoxicated. Doris is initially happy with her new Santa Claus as he actually looks like Santa Claus (real whiskers and all). However, when Santa Claus (played by Edward Gwenn) starts claiming that he is the real Santa Claus Doris is horrified especially after she's explained to her young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) that Santa Claus isn't real. Santa Claus AKA Kris Kringle ends up institutionalised as a result of his claims (and also due to the behaviour of unscrupulous psychiatrist Granville Sawyer). Having established enough evidence to believe that Kringle is the real Santa Claus lawyer Fred Gailey (John Payne) takes Kringle's case to court to prove once and for all that he is the real Santa Claus.I think one of the key successes with a film like Miracle on 34th Street is that it is a film that has great appeal to very young children but it also has some themes running throughout the film that adult audiences can also pick up upon. Clearly children are the key target audience here (given the nature of the premise it's probably a film that will work better with very young children). However, if you delve deeper then it's clear that there is also plenty of content and commentary on offer to an adult audience as well.The selling point for an adult audience is that the film also remembers what Christmas is actually about and actually manages to turn negatives into positives - the film focuses on such things as Christmas being far too commercialised, it also focuses on corporate greed and consumerism (department stores trying to manipulate kids into buying items they're overstocked with rather than toys that they actually want). It then turns these negatives into positives by Kringle's notion of being honest with the kids by referring them to another store if Macy's doesn't have the toy that they want. Initially, the head of Macy's department store is angry about the idea of losing business, but Kringle's actions have so much positivity about them that it ends up bringing good PR to Macy's. This leads to a funny moment where the heads of the two biggest department stores are actually encouraging shoppers to buy things from their rivals store which is both ironic and very clever.I think some of the best moments in the film are the scenes between Kris Kringle and Susan Walker (Natalie Wood). As mentioned, Gwenn is excellent here and is probably everything that kids imagine Santa Claus to be - kind, wise, caring, selfless. Considering Natalie Wood was only around 9 years old when this was made I thought her performance here was terrific and at times she almost steals the show from Gwenn. She's neither overly-cute, annoying or bratty and basically just portrays a young girl who slowly starts to believe in something that she's always been told isn't real. The chemistry and warmth displayed between the two characters was a joy to behold. Of course the film had other strengths as well, but Gwenn and Wood were the real stars of the show here.Miracle on 34th Street is a film with plenty for children and adults alike to enjoy. Young children will bear witness to a wonderful interpretation of the mythical man with the white beard who delivers all their presents on Christmas morning. For adults there's a bit of escapism and subtle nods about commercialisation, corporate greed and consumerism and again I liked the idea that these negative aspects were given a positive spin. It's certainly a film I wouldn't mind watching every now and again at Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suitable for the Entire Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Doris Walker" (Maureen O'Hara) is an employee of Macy's department store in New York City and is in charge of the big Thanksgiving parade which is held every year. Much to her chagrin, she discovers at the last minute that the person she hired to be Santa Claus has gotten himself quite intoxicated and cannot do his job. Fortunately, she just happens to find a person who is both capable and willing to fill in and so she hires him on the spot. He then does such an outstanding job that he is hired to work in the department store from that moment until Christmas. Unfortunately, Doris soon learns that the person they hired actually believes that he is "Kris Kringle" (Edmund Gwenn) in actual life and this results in his sanity being questioned. Now rather than reveal any more of this film I will just say that, although it has aged quite a bit, it is still a fun and enjoyable movie which is suitable for the entire family. As a matter of fact, Edmund Gwenn won the Academy Award for "Best Actor" and the movie itself was nominated for "Best Picture". Again, it's a nice little film and definitely worth a watch--especially during the holidays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gained Innocence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Macy's, a prominent department store in New York City, hires Edmund Gwenn to play Santa Claus during the Christmas shopping period. Maureen O'Hara is the store's representative. She's a divorcée with a small daughter, Natalie Wood. John Payne is a lawyer who lives next door to O'Hara.It develops that Gwenn believes he actually IS Santa Claus. However, his avuncular presence and his shopping advice make the store very popular. Should he be fired because he lives in Cloud Cuckooland? Or should he be retained as a mere eccentric. Conflict develops and is resolved.It's a feel-good movie for the family, especially valuable now that "It's a Wonderful Life" is no longer in public domain.Gwenn is okay but a bit actor-ish. It's as if he KNOWS he's an actor playing Santa Claus. John Payne is a tall, cheerful, handsome American male out of Esquire. He gets the job done in an unthreatening way. Maureen O'Hara is made anxious by the prospect of losing her job, and she gets it across. She's oddly beautiful, a radiant red head in the colorized version. She's enticingly sassy and the underlying Irish tint lends precision to her speech. You can hear every "t" at the end of a sentence. It's impossible to imagine her saying something like "Lemmie" instead of "Let me." Natalie Wood, at nine or so years old, is astonishing really. It may be the best performance she was ever to give.The movie is unpretentious, well made, and charming. The kids should like it, although I'm not sure anybody over the age of two believes in Santa Claus any longer. By the time kids are three, they're all tattooed and sexually experienced and they sit around in phat pants smoking weed. They're jaded at four.Gwenn, as Santa Claus, prattles on about "imagination" but the movie is really about the necessity of myth. Myths like those about Santa Claus -- or about Christmas -- are vital to our lives. Materially, the shopping spree means that a good deal of money changes hands, but its more important element is social. Christmas -- or rather "the holidays" -- gives us a chance to display our allegiance to each other.It makes us feel good to take part in a vast and intricate ritual. It may have begun as a pagan celebration of the winter solstice and its meaning may have changed dramatically but it still serves the same function. As Santa Claus points out, it's more than a day, it's a state of mind. Alas, ephemeral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macy's Has Hired The Real Santa Claus!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is more than feel-good entertainment; it serves as social and political commentary as well. The story is about how a woman in charge of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade hires a bearded man to play Santa Claus at the very last moment when the existing one turns out to be intoxicated. The man proves popular with the children, and is also popular with them when he plays Santa Claus in the Macy's store itself. The woman is taken aback, however, when she finds that he calls himself Kris Kringle for real.The story not only deals with whether this man might be the real Santa Claus or just a "nice old man with a beard". The story talks about mental illness and how society treats it, about how Christmas has become too commercialized and kindness and goodwill forgotten; about how the woman and her daughter have been trained to reject any form of pretending, fantasy, or faith, and why that is not necessarily a good thing. The movie is old-fashioned but not by any means outdated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it was fun and packed lots of laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with a note that this may just be one of those feel good movies with no special twist, but then as it carries on you come to conclude that it is, but what you will not expect is the tons of laugh and excitement that it packs, all you have to do is hang on till you get to the court scene, from there down to the last scene where Kris cane is seen, I couldn't help but just laughing all the way through.Miracle on 34th Street is based on a screenplay by George Seaton, who also came onboard as the director of the film that was actually released in May 1947, instead of during the Christmas season as it is a Christmas movie. The movie is well acted and the screenplay is not bogus or too out of place that will make you think (as I thought, from the title) that one extraordinary miracle was going to happen to convince everyone that he is Santa, the movie rode on a logical note to prove his claim, although the plot leads you to believe a miraculous touch existed as this can be seen in the ending scene.The movie begins at the Macy's Department Store Thanksgiving Day parade, when the Santa meant to lead the parade was drunk and the lady in charge Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara), decided to put a funny Santa looking old man Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn), as the replacement Santa.Kris did well and was hired by Doris to work as a Santa for Macy, there Kris started something that helped bring Macy into the limelight by helping parents find toys that Macy didn't have.Kris also had a task he wanted to complete, which was to be able to make Doris and her daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) believe that he is really Santa. Well along with his plan things changed that led Kris to be taken and tested to be found psychologically incompetent and was almost institutionalized before a friend Fred Gailey (John Payne), who happened to have an eye for Doris decided to help him out.20th Century Fox idea to release the movie in May instead of December paid off in the box office as the movie made like 5 times its production cost. Also the movie was well received by critics and it won Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Edmund Gwenn), Best Writing, Original Story (Valentine Davis) and Best Writing, Screenplay.The film was revisited in 1994 by John Hughes, it was not as much a critical success likes its predecessor but the 1994 version (which starred Richard Attenborough, Mara Wilson and Elizabeth Perkins) is just as popular as the 1947 version.Here is a good movie to watch with the family on a nice Christmas day or any other day.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET works so well because it's refreshingly free of the kind of cloying sentimentality we've come to associate with holiday movies (case in point: I watched SANTA CLAUS: THE MOVIE yesterday). And who thought that a film about Father Christmas would end up as a tense courtroom drama? One word to describe this film would be 'timeless'.Despite being made back in 1947, in black and white too, this is very much a modern-feeling production. A man claiming to be the genuine Santa Claus finds himself assailed on all sides by disbelieving authorities, who court him off to an institution and then the courthouse to prove that he's an impostor.Edmund Gwenn seals the deal on this movie. The other actors are good, yes, but it's Gwenn who proves to be the icing on the cake. His jolly, exuberant character exudes the kind of warmth and giving that's all too often forgotten in place of Christmastime commercialism, and he possesses a knowing look in his eye which makes him perfectly suited for the role.Kudos, then, for a film which actually has something to say about the true meaning of Christmas in an original way, without shoving it down the viewer's throat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I had previously seen a colorized version back in 1986, this was the first time I had seen this particular picture in its entirety in black-and-white. During this revisitation, I had a newfound appreciation for the satire presented of rival department stores shilling willingly for each other because of Kris Kringle's generosity which resulted in the public willing to go to whichever one they choose (which turns out to be Macy's, of course). And seeing a pre-teen Natalie Wood, in her only noted role at that age, turn from a serious little girl to a more joyous one who loves blowing bubble gum and acting like a monkey was also such a delight! Oh, and let's not forget Edmund Gwenn who eventually won the deserved Oscar for becoming the Santa Claus worth believing in. What a role to be remembered for! And Maureen O'Hara as Ms. Wood's non-believing mother and John Payne as her slightly more-imaginative beau are also good. And, finally, kudos to writer/director George Seaton for his faith in Valentine Davies' original story which resulted in one of the finest holiday movies ever! Nothing more to say except Merry Christmas, everybody!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definition of a timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christmas Movies seem simple enough because when you find your favourite you can watch it again and again every year and just adore it like it was the first time. Best of all Christmas movies have this way of being literally timeless...standing the test of all time. Miracle on 34th Street is exactly that!! It is a lovely, fantastic, fantasy family drama about Santa Clause. Heart warming lovely, entertaining and brilliantly made! Made in 1947, over five decades ago, and it doesn't show age for even a second! This film could be watched anywhere and anytime and you'll take away from it the feeling of pure happiness when its all done. Quite plainly it is one of the sweetest movies ever made and just plain fun on top of that!! The legendary Maureen O'Hara plays no-nonsense business woman Doris Walker. One of the things I love about this film is that such a strong female lead is allowed to be strong even in 1947. Never once is she played down to and she does a terrific job. She's hard nosed but has a softer side that gradually comes out. John Payne is the fun loving and often child like (but in a good way) lawyer Fred Gailey. Both O'Hara and Gailey aren't really front and centre characters but yet they're very important to the overall picture. This film focuses on two characters. One is of course Kris Kringle, played absolutely brilliantly by Edmund Gwenn, who I think could make anyone believe he is Santa Clause. He will go down in my books as giving one of the sweetest most believable performances in cinema history for me. He is absolutely perfect. In one scene when he speaks dutch to a little girl...it brings tears to my eyes every time because he just exudes everything about the legendary character of Kris Kringle. Hollywood legend Natalie Wood is also perfect as equally hard nosed, realist Susan. Raised by her mother, who is clearly very loving, but also teaches her to be realistic and not let her imagination get away with her. This lovely little girl begins to open her heart to the idea of Santa Clause and by the end is a true believer.The film delivers another thing that goes down in my books as being legendary and that is the courtroom scene where the thousands of letters from children are delivered to prove Kris Kringle is real. It inevitably will make you smile like the whole film. Director and writer George Seaton clearly knows exactly how to tell a story and make everything just roll out at the perfect pace. The setting of the department stores, to the apartments of the various characters to the courtroom just fits together and works so well. Even if its not Christmas this is the perfect family film that everyone will find something to enjoy. Just simply a beautiful film, entertaining, fun and truly deserves to be called a classic. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chistmas Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, memories. A trimmed Christmas tree, dad doing dad things, mom doing mom things, the TV showing some Rankin Bass stop motion extravaganza followed by a black and white classic.Truth is this film used to air all year round back in the old UHF channel days. Possibly on a July afternoon during Summer Recess, or even during spring or autumn. It wasn't merely a Christmas film, though that's how it's remembered and presented.What we have here is the case of psycho-analysis gone wrong. We have the real thing himself, Kris Kringle, Saint Nick, Father Christmas, or, in American-ese, Santa Claus, come to work for one of America's most famous retailers, Macy's Incorporated. Only when Claus expresses some real human outrage he is cloistered into psychoanalysis to discover why he expressed himself so.Meanwhile we have a little girl whose maturity has far exceeded her biological age at the behest of her mother. Result; the childhood that most consider normal seems to have escaped this world weary youngster who lacks a certain magic and wonderment in her eyes. Is that a bad thing? Well, Santa Claus seems to think so, and helps the child rediscover her child through some quality play time.The mother and male lead in the meantime are distraught of what to do with a seemingly kind old man who, from their perspective, is off his rocker. He claims to be the one and only Santa Claus. He doesn't make a big deal of it, he just states it matter of factly, as one might site the weather or a baseball score. This makes him in need of help by the analysis of Macy's head shrink.Market forces and political pressure contend with corporate and civic leadership. Will heart or law win out? Or will the fact reveal something unique and unexpected?Look, we all know how this thing ends, but I can't risk revealing the ending and giving a good thorough analysis lest the IMDb Powers that Be tag my review with that unmentionable of words. But, I'll say this, the ending shows in a dramatic vein the hearts and minds of people at work via the democratic process. And in this way the common man and woman see the spirit of Christmas, both figuratively and literally, released to do his annual job.But then he disappears. And there's no sign of him. Nor hide nor tail. Or is there?Even if it's spring, summer, or autumn, go ahead and give it a whirl on the DVD player. It might lift your spirits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Christmas Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite Christmas movie.The story revolves around a mother Doris who doesn't believes in telling her daughter lies about Santa Claus. When her daughter insists that Macy's Santa Claus Kris is real, she confronts him and wants him to tell the truth. He still insists that he is Santa Claus. A cynical Doris is irritated by this and tells him to submit to a psychological evaluation.Things come to a fore when Kris is put in a courtroom and asked to prove that he is Santa. The conflict is resolved in a very clever way.I watched this movie as an adult, and to tell the truth throughout most of the movie I was siding with Doris, but Kris was able to win both me and Doris over. A very nice heartwarming, capraesque movie that would be enjoyable for both adults and kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant message today as it was in 1947.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the world we live in today with economic hardships, conflicts of all kinds and varying degrees, and adversity, it is important to remember that we must each have faith in something or we are relegated to the status quo. The film Miracle on 34th Street (1947) directed by George Seaton and starring Maureen O'Hara as Doris Walker, John Payne as Fred Gailey, Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle, and an innocent nine year old Natalie Wood as Susan Walker, delivers this timeless and poignant message in a holiday film which is relevant 365 days a year. Set in New York City, Doris as the parade manager for the R.H. Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, finds herself in a predicament where she hires a likable old man off the street named Kris Kringle with his white flowing beard to play Santa in the parade and eventually in the toy department of Macy's flagship store. Doris, bitter after being divorced after the birth of Susan, has raised her daughter in a world void of any fairy tales which has stifled Susan's imagination. It is Fred Gailey, an aspiring lawyer, who takes on the responsibility to show both Doris and Susan that they must have conviction and trust in something, for "Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to." It is Kris, whom breaks down the walls that Doris has built around herself and Susan, and allows them both to see that there are people and things in this world that are deserving of their faith. As in It's A Wonderful Life (1946) the Frank Capra film where George Baily must have faith that he can make the world better than Mr. Potter would have it, Miracle on 34th Street tells us that we are whom we believe we are, and with that belief unlocks a magnificent power within each of us. The movie delivers a powerful message on faith, but also broaches the subject of commercialism, one of the many "bad 'ism's in the world today" and how it had affected the spirit of the Christmas season even some sixty plus years ago. Miracle on 34th Street is a heartwarming story of faith that is as relevant to viewers in today as it was in 1947 when it was released. Viewers should heed its message that faith empowers us and that it is incumbent upon each of us to make the world in which we live a better place, not just during the Christmas holiday, but each and every day of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>34th street - the miracle mile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that puzzled me. Kris was busy with the court system. Did he still have time to spend hours at Macy's?That aside, I agree with those who declare "Miracle On 34th Street" to be the ultimate Christmas movie. What a great gift. As for the remakes, it is no wonder the department store wanted nothing to do with them.Regretfully, the movie was black-white, so we missed some of the O'Hara beauty which puts most of today's over-rouged stars/starlets to shame. As for her portrayal, it was utterly convincing as a lady who is the supreme realist. Back that up with Natalie Wood's job as her precocious daughter. We've all seen some good kid actors over the years, but Wood is double c -- cute and convincing.Then, of course, there was the man with the statue - Edmund Gwenn whose lengthy career alternated between bad guy-good guy. In this flick he was the goodest of guys. What a beautiful, beautiful portrayal of KK alias SC (initializing 'superb characterization').John Payne, who has also played a variety of roles, was excellent as the O'Hara paramour-to-be. He was underrated, but so good that he found steady work.The character actors in this movie were best of the bunch - Jerome Cowan, Porter Hall, William Frawley playing William Frawley and, especially, Gene Lockhart as the judge. Check those wonderful facial expressions.Also, much credit to the little boy who portrayed Cowan's son. Loved his delivery on those 'hi daddy' type lines.All in all, it must be repeated "Miracle On 34th Street" is a really moving movie. And, as Tiny Tim might have said, if he'd thought about it, "merry Christmas. Now, let's go see this movie."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're feeling a little depressed on Christmas morning and want to get into the holiday spirit,this is the movie for you. I'm not one of those arrogant critics,so I'm not going to say "oh,the plot is cheesy and not believable..oh,it's been done before,blah blah blah". This is the perfect Christmas movie in my opinion-it's fun,sweet and it reminds people why this holiday is so great. Edmund Gwenn is a lovable Santa who tries to convince people he is real and bring some of the Christmas magic back.He meets a young woman,Maureen O'Hara who doesn't believe in anything,especially Santa Claus and teaches her young daughter to do the same.For the rest of the movie,Santa tries to prove he is not crazy and get Doris and little Susie to believe in him I have to admit,this movie brightened up my Christmas and I fully recommend it.Just lighten up and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Combination of Christmas and the Law</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a nice old man who claims to be Santa Claus (Edmund Glenn) is institutionalized as insane, a young lawyer (John Payne) decides to defend him by arguing in court that he is the real thing.People who do not live in New York may be confused by the "New York Supreme Court", which is not actually the highest court in New York, unlike other states or the country. Other matters of law are also interesting.The film also stands out as starring a very young (8 years old) Natalie Wood. Wood would go on to be a much more famous actress after "Rebel Without a Cause", so this film is doubly historic: not just a great movie by itself, but a great record of Wood's early talent. Have you ever seen a more precocious child?As far as Christmas movies go, this ranks among the top echelon and is a must-see for all Christmas lovers. See this before the remakes, as it stands the test of time quite easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Christmas isn't just a day, it's a frame of mind".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a modern world under assault by agnostics and atheists demanding a politically correct place at the Christmas table, to them I say 'Bah, humbug'. "Miracle on 34th Street" is the perfect film to capture the whimsy and wonder of the holiday season, perfectly engineering events on screen to the improbable but conclusive proof that Santa Claus really does exist. Had the film been around in 1897, even Virginia O'Hanlon wouldn't have had to ask the New York Sun if Santa was real.What struck me the most while watching the picture today (Christmas Day 2009) was how much emphasis was put on the commercialization of the holiday as far back as 1947. Hard to imagine as a kid growing up in the Fifties that that could have been the case, but I imagine each new generation brings it's own perspective on the season and how it seems to change over the ensuing decades. I guess it's true that you need kids and grandkids around to bring the magic back each year.Funny how certain movies require you play them every season, even when you know the story inside out and can even recite the lines. For me it was Alastair Sim's "Scrooge" last night, and "Miracle on 34th Street" today. Watching films like these is one of the best ways to get that childlike wonder back into your life, not to mention a good helping of Christmas cheer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is the best holiday film of all-time. This is saying a lot, as other films such as A Christmas STORY and HOLIDAY AFFAIR are amazing films in their own right. I think the reason I feel this is the best of the lot is that it has a certain magical quality the others just can't reach. The story is tops--clever, cute and memorable. The acting is terrific--who could be better than Edmund Gwenn? Natalie Wood had perhaps one of the best performances by a child actor ever in this film--she is a child yet seemed so real. Maureen O'Hara, John Payne and the rest are simply terrific! Overall, a brilliant film. However, please don't assume that the sequels are worth seeing. Sebastian Cabot and Richard Attenborough are simply NOT Santa--and can't hold a candle to the original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure Joy. This movie is a lot of fun and it makes me happy watching it. I have seen this movie many times before, but this is the first time that I am rating it. It is a sappy movie, but the best kind of sap. It goes right up to the edge of making you sick, but it never goes over the edge. Natalie Wood was perfect and you cannot find a more charming child. Kris Kringle will always be Gwenn in my mind. He is really perfect. It really is just a perfect Christmas movie and the only reason that I give it a 9 instead of a 10 is that Maureen O'Hara and Gailey's relationship was not hashed out at all. If I have not seen the movie so many times it would have surprised me if this was my first viewing. But I do love this movie and will probably watch it at least once a year for the rest of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very charming and funny film from a more innocent era in American life. You get to see a real Macy's Thanksgiving parade, as well as representations of dedicated retail employees (!), one of whom (O'Hara) portrays an early professional woman and single working mom in the male-dominated world of retail management.The film's historical value alone has merit. Watch for the Macy's resource book of other key New York City retail establishments. See how many you remember or recognize! How many still exist 60 years later? You can watch this film a dozen times and still find new things and bits of business to amuse you. The creativity of the script, combined with the expressiveness of voice, face, and body language on the part of all the excellent actors involved--many uncredited but with huge resumes--is a joy to behold, again and again. And the Hats, Ladies, the Hats! O'Hara and Wood have the greatest hats and matching coats ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, for YEARS I've been telling people that there is a scene missing from every screening/tape/DVD of Miracle on 34th Street that I've scene over the (many) years of being a fan - but ONE. It resolves the "I want an official football helmet" plot line for the Prosecuter's son. I remember seeing this issue resolved ONCE only. I seem to remember the Prosecuter telling his wife next to their tree on Christmas morning that he didn't have time to get the helmet... but, surprise... there's an official football helmet under their tree... I believe this scene took place before the Christmas morning scene at Kris' "home." Over the years, I've found one other person (in this forum) that remembers a scene where the Prosecuter finds a helmet on his car seat after the trial. In any case, the whole "I want an official football helmet" plot line is resolved. Without it, the plot line doesn't make sense! Does anybody else remember this????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie contains a lot of excellence that gives me the confidence to rate this a 10. The actors were excellent, everything in the movie was excellent and gives you that good Christmas feeling that makes you wish that Christmas was here.Imagine Santa Clause, or at least a very kind man who you are almost sure is Santa Clause being charged for "thinking he is Santa Clause". Here's Kringle, a nice old man working for Macy's and changing everything Macy does. (Which is: They don't have the product you want? They send you to another store. Makes Macy's look great, huh?) That's what happens in this movie. Enjoy this movie with Doris, the event director for the Macy's parade and just works for Macys, and her daughter, their neighbor who is the soon-to-be husband, and Kris Kringle as they prove that Kris Kringle is Santa Clause and make the whole state of New York, the city rather look like fools.An amazing Christmas classic for the whole family to enjoy. So if you are stuck on whether to watch the 1994 remake of Mircale on 34th Street with bright eyed but terribly poor-acting Mara Wilson made after the invention of video games and other electronic devices or this simple classic, I recommend this one. Watch the amazing classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Version of the Classic, with a PERFECT Cast!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maureen O'Hara, the top-billed star of 1947's "Miracle on 34th Street", has proudly proclaimed that all three 'remakes' of this story were flops, which may sound a bit conceited...but she was absolutely right, the original IS the best! Based on a story by Valentine Davies (who wondered how the real Santa Claus would react to the commercialization of Christmas), with an Oscar-winning screenplay by director George Seaton, the film is a triumph of perfect casting, perfect timing, and a sentimentality and humor that post-War America desperately needed. Contrary to general opinion, 20th Century Fox did not treat it as a 'minor' film (studio head Darryl F. Zanuck loved the story), but location shooting (at the first Macy's parade since the war began, as well as inside the store, during the Christmas 'rush') would push the budget to the limit.O'Hara (unhappily yanked from a long-awaited return to her Ireland home), and popular Fox leading man John Payne were cast in the leads, but the real 'stars' of the film are Oscar-winning 71-year-old Edmund Gwenn (who is absolutely perfect as 'Kris Kringle', and convinced everyone on the project that he really WAS Santa Claus), and 8-year-old Natalie Wood (the most gifted of the post-War child stars), who brings young Susan brilliantly to life. Their scenes together are so sweet and irresistible that the film positively glows! While elements of the story are 'dated' (the competition between Macy's and Gimbel's, the Postal information, etc.), it simply gives the 1947 version a 'timeless' quality that the 1994 version lacked...and in not attempting to incorporate 'magic' into the story (as the Attenborough production uncomfortably does), it actually seems MORE magical! Several supporting players should be singled out; Thelma Ritter (in her screen debut), is wonderful as a frazzled mom; Gene Lockhart (the judge) and William ("I Love Lucy") Frawley (as the judge's campaign manager) are hilarious together; and Porter Hall, as the hiss-able 'psychologist', Sawyer, is a perfect foil for Gwenn. The entire cast is simply inspired! While the film was, indeed, originally released in the summer of 1947 (to maximize profits), it is a bona fide Christmas 'Classic', and should be an essential part of your holiday collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miracle on 34th Street House Location</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have had Miracle on 34th Street (1947 non-colorized version) on the list of my Top 10 movies of all time since I was a young boy. That was 35 years ago. I have always wondered where the house that is shown at the end of the movie was located. That mystery was solved this evening when someone on a blog that I was reading said that the house was located on Derby Road in Port Washington, New York.I quickly ran upstairs and watched the end of the movie and made note of the features that could be seen around Natalie Wood as she runs out of the car and up the walkway. I could see a cul-de-sac across the street, as well as two neighboring houses to the north and two houses with distinct roof lines directly across the street. I observed the placement and shape of the houses and noted their irregular setbacks/placement on their respective lots.I then went to Google Earth and what do you know but I found it. It took about three seconds and it was clear as day. Try this yourself.....watch the movie then go to Google Earth and type in Derby Road, Port Washington New York. Zoom in a couple of clicks and you'll feel like you've gone back in time.For those of you that want the exact address I am sorry but I have not been able to figure that out yet. I can tell you that the house is located on the Northwest corner of Derby Road and Essex Court in Port Washington. You can't miss it.Just a quick heads-up.....the roof line of the house has been slightly altered. When you watch the film you can see that the roof slopes from the top all the way down to the gutter and does so without change in direction or angle. In other words, it is completely flat. There is a small gable on the right side of the house, however, but other than that the roof is completely flat.When you look at it now on Google Earth you will see some sort of secondary roof line that has been added. My suspicion is that the owners added a room above the left side of the house and created some sort of tiered roof line to accommodate the space. The change is not drastic but it is obvious. I would expect that if you drove out and looked at the house you would see some sort of window on the upper left front portion of the house. In the movie this space is occupied by some white horizontal siding.In any event, how great would it be to go see the house from this great movie? It would be magical. I live in Seattle so at some point I'm going to have to plan a trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just re-watched this classic for umpteenth or more time, I was struck by an observation that hadn't occurred to me before.It goes without saying that this film is a classic in many respects. It is certainly one of the most highly regarded Christmas holiday films, if only judged by the number of times it is re-broadcast by many networks every year during the Christmas season.It is also a lovely and sensitive love story, bringing several important romantic relationship themes such as faith and trust to the surface.Perhaps sensitized by the many popular TV series based on law and legal firm themes, I noticed this year for the first time what an interesting legal angle is presented by the 1947 film as well. The defense of Kris Kringle is as clever and as unexpected as any the more recent TV series writers have concocted going all the way back to Perry Mason.So, this year watch it for its triple impact: wonderful feel-good Christmas story, endearing love story, and also the legal thesis of what constitutes "hard evidence." Merry Christmas and/or Happy and Warm Holidays to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet holiday fantasy, though Kris isn't the real miracle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who could be such an ogre as not to love this beautiful, old Christmas holiday favorite? Though I do have a little disclaimer, which I'll get to later. I haven't seen any of the remakes, nor do I wish to. This old classic is perfect as is, whether or not the hairstyles and so forth are outdated.The movie tells the story of a divorced, cynical, no nonsense Macy's Department Store executive named Doris Walker, who hires a new Santa Claus for the store. This new employee, who calls himself Kris Kringle, demonstrates some rather unusual qualities, leading Doris's little girl, Susan (whom she has raised to reject all belief in fantasy), to wonder whether there might be something to his insistence that he is in fact the real Santa. When Kris is threatened with institutionalization for insanity, Doris's friend, Fred Gailey, a lawyer, is hired to defend his claims, with a highly entertaining court case following.The film has a wonderful cast. The late Natalie Wood is charming in her childhood role as the bright, precocious, and skeptical little Susan, Maureen O'Hara as her independently minded mother, and John Payne as the likable, good natured Fred, who befriends and defends Kris.If there were a Santa Claus, I'd want it to be this genuinely jolly fellow, Kris Kringle, portrayed to perfection by Edmund Gwenn. He is so absolutely magnificent that all other movie and TV Santa figures pale by comparison. Kris has the true spirit, the believable whiskers (kept outside the covers or tucked in at night?), and apparently (or so one gathers) speaks the native languages of all the children seeking his toys...as demonstrated when Kris responds at Macy's to a little Dutch girl in her own language.There is a message here against the commercialism of the season, which of course is infinitely worse these days. Quite a point is made of the old arch rivalry between Macy's and Gimbel's. Also, perhaps Doris is a wee bit severe in expecting a totally adult attitude from her little girl, but in truth Susan has already been forced to deal with the harsh reality of her parents' divorce.However, while this is traditional Christmas viewing for many families and a wonderful, heartwarming story, that's exactly what it is...a story, a fantasy. The real miracle of Christmas for both adults and children is not Kris Kringle (or Santa Claus) but the Christ child, whose miraculous birth this holiday celebrates, and this intelligent young Susan, whose age seems closer to 10 than 6, is definitely old enough to be aware of the fact. Of course if I still had small children, I would be quite pleased to have them watch this lovely, sugary tale as opposed to most of the garbage in the modern cinematic world. Let's just not forget, while wrapped up in this cute fantasy, what the true Christmas miracle is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Miracle on 34th Street" is a heart-warming tale of the spirit of the season-Christmas and other holidays too.Edmund Gwenn deserved his best supporting actor Oscar for his role of Kris Kringle, who had to go to court to justify and prove his very existence.Maureen O'Hara and the late John Payne shine as a couple brought together during this Holiday fanfare. O'Hara's daughter, played by an adorable Natalie Wood, is terrific as the little girl caught up in this holiday madness.The idea of cooperation of Macys and another department store to guide customers is one of the true holiday spirit.A wonderful film depicting American holiday tradition. It only lost the best picture of the year award as the memorable "Gentleman's Agreement" invoked an aura of much needed toleration following the Holocaust period among the socially conscious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Christmas movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I like It's a Wonderful Life, too. But this is THE Christmas classic I watch over and over again. When you're young, it's a great movie for realizing that Santa does exist even in the adult world. When you doubt Christmas, it's great to go back to. But when you're older, it's what compels you again and again.One of the amazingly undertoned things about this movie is the fact that it doesn't really make it clear whether Kris is Santa or not, it just adds up all the lack of clear facts and lets it all rest on what you want to believe. Even after the movie is over, any way you look at it your thoughts on the film itself reflect what your personal beliefs are. It comes to a clear conclusion, but one that is always affected by the viewership, which, while dangerous, usually ends up more heartwarming than not.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top Five Christmas movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was 10 in 1947. I was struck by the story then, as I am now. It is no wonder that this film is played every Christmas since its inception whether in the theater or as now on television. I believe there was a "remake" of it in color, I can't remember. It would be very hard to top this original. The film captures its time and social graces to a tea. To have your daughter spend the afternoon with a strange man to watch the Macy's day parade would be unheard of today. To trust "anybody" with your children today, whether it be priest, or scoutmaster. would be foolhardy. Back then, some 60 years ago, there was no problem....Great movie...Enjoy to see what we are missing in this "MODERN" age...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Miracle of Thirty-Fourth Street is a heart warming tale that extols the virtue of unleashing the inner child in each one of us. This fabulous story teaches us to follow our heart, use our imagination, and believe in the impossible. While commonly associated with Christmas (for obvious reasons) it is a joy to watch any time of year (it is especially wonderful when you need your faith in humanity renewed!) As relevant today as the day it was filmed young and old will delight in watching this film and unlike many of today's so called family films this is one that the whole family can actually watch together. I know of VHS versions in black-and-white (perfect for the film purist) or in a color version for those looking for a bit of an update. A Miracle on Thirty-Fourth Street is a true classic in ever sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much to say on this one but just see it. The Academy Award received by Edmund Gwenn was very well deserved. It seems it should have been for Best Actor not Best Supporting Actor since he is the entire picture. A number of supporting actors carry the story very well also. You will recognize several uncredited actors who appeared in later pictures. I'm sure the success of this picture caused producers to update the story with remakes. Although this story has been remade several times, not one is even close to this original in quality or emotional sensitivity. If the celebration of Christmas means something to you, see this film. Watching it each Christmas should be a habit. It is a "10" for sure.</fullReview>

It has a good plot and a good acting."Miracle on 34th Street" tells the story of an old man(Edmund Gwenn)who believes himself to be Santa Clause. My favorite scene is when Susan Walker(Natalie Wood)is talking to Santa Clause at Macy's. I also like the scene at the end of the film at the Christmas party when Santa Clause gives Mrs.Walker(Maureen O'Hara)the directions to the house.I really love this movie and I suggest everyone should see it not just at Christmas time but also during the year. I give this movie 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sentimental favorite of mine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful Christmas film starring Maureen O'Hara, John Payne and Edmund Gwenn. A young Natalie Wood in the role of Susan Walker who has doubts about the existence of Santa Claus. Her mother played by O'Hara has no time in fairytales and believes her daughter should know the truth, that there is no such thing as Santa. Well the fun begins when Gwenn (Kris Kringle) appears at the store where Doris Walker works??of course he's employed to be the new Santa Claus. Kris Kringle believes he is Santa and the story unfolds to examine and make you ask?..'could he really be Father Christmas'???Finally, Kris Kringle is put on trial to see if he is mentally competent and to disprove the customary belief in Santa Claus. This is one of my favourite films during the Christmas season, it truly portrays the spirit and warmth Christmas brings. Originally filmed in Black &amp; White, they have since retouched it with colour (and I think it is great). The cast is wonderful, sincere and not overly sentimental. Well, just a touch of sentimentality, but for good reason??a family orientated film that all will enjoy. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th street is ultimately about getting children and adults alike to remember what the Christmas season is all about: magic!!! The feeling of Christmas is supposed to be one of giving, and believing and that's what this film does! The entire movie is about a man named Gwenn who believes that he is the real Santa Clause. After reporting that the Santa Clause that is in the Macy's Christmas parade is a drunk, Gwenn becomes the new Santa Clause. However, no one actually believed that he thought that he really was what he was hired to pretend. Doris Walker, who is a head employee at Macy's, went through a very tough divorce a few years previous, where her `prince charming' ended up not being all that she thought he would be. This trauma has left Doris not believing in things such as Santa Clause or the Easter Bunny because they are not all that you believe them to be. She has also instilled this same mentality into her young daughter. However, after spending much time with Gwenn (or Santa) the young girl begins to consider what this man is telling her in regards to him being the real Santa Clause. After the young girls starts to ask her mother many questions about this man, Doris kindly asks the old man, who appears to be insane, to please stop lying to her daughter, because she already knows that there is not Santa Clause. Well, Gwenn believing wholeheartedly that he is Mr. Clause assures Doris that he is not lying and that what he says to the girl is the truth! After Doris realizes that this man is crazy, she talks to management at the store and requests that they Fire Gwenn. Management refuses because Gwenn is the best Santa Clause that Macy's has ever hired, and they don't want to lose any business. After a series of events. Gwenn is taken to trial to try to prove his insanity. Throughout the Trial Doris and her little girl come to the realization that this man really is what he proclaims to be. Their Christmas spirits are rekindled, and they walk away believers. This movie was most definitely one of the most classic Christmas stories of all time. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating, for its wonderful plot and bringing a great Christmas feeling to all of its viewers. I recommend this movie to anyone, of any age, year after year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Miracle on 34th St. A Miracle on 34th st. is truly a classic movie, and classic movies have good old fashioned values. And that is something that this day and age are greatly lacking. The character of Kris Kringle was very well portrayed. No matter what he was faced with he kept his cool. When he was having the physiological evaluation he was not bothered by any of the disrespectful questions that were asked of him. The other characters were very well portrayed as well, for example the little girl. At the beginning she did not believe in such things as Santa Claus or the Easter bunny. But towards the end she was a believer, just as her mother was. As would be expected in a movie like this. Even the judge who was trying Kris Cringle in order to prove whether or not he was who he said he was, in the end he too became a believer. A Miracle on 34th st. has something for everyone. It is heart warming. This movie teaches time and time again the values of the Christmas season, and teaches that those values should be carried on year round and year after year. this movie gets a rating of ten.</fullReview>

It is a great movie for all ages.Edmund Gwenn and Natalie Wood make an awesome duo. Natalie Wood plays Susan Walker, a young child that has never believed in Santa Claus, in fact she does not even pretend when playing. Edmund Gwenn plays Kris Kringle, Santa Claus. Throughout the movie, Kris tries to convince Susan that he is really Santa Claus and that she should believe, while also teaching her how to be a kid. The connection shown between these characters is remarkable.This movie is fantastic for all ages. Younger children will enjoy Santa, and of course the entire thought of Christmas. The older crowd will enjoy knowing that a person is never to old to believe in Santa. This movie would be a fantastic family night movie.Overall this movie is worth seeing at least once. It truly brings the spirit of Christmas to you heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even celebrate Christmas, but the year's end wouldn't be the same without viewing this miracle of movie-making. Edmund Gwenn proves to be the stalwart Santa of all time (and later, the quintessential entomologist in "Them"). Who wouldn't want a grandfather like him (or cousin Cecil Kellaway!). John Payne (early TV's "Restless Gun") has always been a favorite actor of mine, perhaps because, to me, he wasn't "over-used" by the studios. In fact, I've never noticed who did the casting for "Miracle", but the next time I view.....hats off! Can't believe this gem is not in the top 250; maybe with a few more believers voting, it will be!.....9+/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is he Santa Claus? Edmund Gwen plays his excellent roll as Kris Kringle, he just radiate belief in mankind in an excellent way. He combines in his roll 2 impossible things together; passion &amp; Rational logic in a way witch will be hard to surpass. Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) the divorced mother of Susan Walker (Natalie Wood) who raises her daughter based upon her own personal experiences in life (She's my responsible, I must bring her up as I see fit). Doris obviously had great belief in dreams in her early life which tumbled down after her divorce and she didn't want Susan to be hurt in any such way, as for result she teaches Susan the practical way (ferry tale's are silly) completely ignoring her childhood rights. Fred Gaily (John Payne) a lawyer who lives in the same building as Doris &amp; Susan Walker has an eye on Doris and he also likes her daughter Susan, while watching the Thanksgiving parade with Susan he meets Doris.Prior while Doris Walker is organizing the Thanksgiving Day Parade for her employer Macy she meets Kris Kringle who noticed at his inspections of the Christmas happening that the Santa Claus in the parade is completely drunk and brings her to the attention of that. Not being able to find a substitute at such short notice she asks Kris Kringle; could you be Santa Claus, had you had any experience? This way he becomes an unusual employee of Macy's and so later meets Doris daughter Susan and the lawyer Fred Gaily, together with Fred he finds it his task to change Doris and Susan's view on life.The movie shows perfectly that small details in human behavior, good or bad, can have great effect on live also that being honest and success can go together. Very touching movie with flawless acting and a very good story.One strange thing when in Macy's store a Dutch girl meets Kris Kringle they sing a Dutch Sinterklaas song, Sinterklaas and Santa Claus are 2 different persons(Sinterklaas is celebrated at 5 December and Santa Claus?well you now) and they are, just like Macy's and Gimble's, competitors to each other. Truly deserves the 3 Oscar's it won, go see it and see it again (and again?)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Christmas Movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally written : Nov. 2002: There are several holiday classics but The Miracle on 34th. Street is the mother-of-all Christmas movies. I saw this back in the 50's in the theater as a young kid and I've watched it several times since. When it became available on tape in the 80's, it became a Christmas Eve tradition for my wife &amp; kids to watch this movie on Christmas Eve. That tradition continues to this day and after scores of viewings, I still get chills at the ending. The casting is flawless and creates the chemistry that makes this movie so special. Edmund Gwenn really IS Santa Claus. Maureen O'Hara plays Doris Walker, the overly practical mother of Susan Walker played by Natalie Wood. John Payne, a young lawyer is the love interest of Doris, and his mission is to prove in a court of law that Santa really does exist and that Kris Kringle (Gwenn) is the one and only Jolly One. As predictable as the outcome is, this movie is like the Wizard Of Oz... No matter how many times you watch it, it will still captivate you.. One of the Top 100 films of all time. Added: Nov. 2006: I picked up the new 2006 colorized version (a separate one from the one done in the 80's) on DVD and I am finally convinced that colorizing isn't Satan. They did a tremendous job on the colorizing Mirecle on 34th St. and now my kids watch it with the same enthusiasm as me. Between this new colorized version, and they colorizing of seasons 1 &amp; 2 of the TV Show Bewitched, I believe colorizing has come of age and I take back every thing bad I've said over the years.

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was 13 years old and it instantly became one of my favorite films and is still so 20 years later. On the surface the film seems somewhat unbelievable. The story of a man who thinks he is Kris Kringle (aka Santa Claus)somehow convinces major department stores that they should put the interest of the consumer above their own interests and then attempts to prove in court he is the one and only Santa Claus is somewhat unbelievable. However, the great cast, the well written story and the time this film was released, just after WWII, makes the story seem almost plausible. I really enjoy the final scene in the film in which Fred Gailey, the attorney who defended Kris Kringle, is commenting to Doris Walker on the believability of Santa Claus when he notices something in the corner that makes him reconsider the statement he is making. This scene is so important because it shows the hypocrisy that man can have. Here we have man who has encouraged others to believe in Santa Claus and even defended a man who claims to be Santa Clause even though he may not believe in Santa Claus himself and now he is forced to reconsider his beliefs.I have seen the 73 and 94 remake of this film and while I did enjoy the 73 version &amp; hated the 94 version neither are better than the original. There is a 1956 version of the film called MEET KRIS KRINGLE that is never aired and not available for purchase that I would like to see. I saw a clip of that film and the actor that portrays Kris Kringle seems far less believable than Edmund Gwenn. The actress the portrays Susan seems a little older and no where near as charming as Natalie Wood. However I would still like to see the version if for no other reason I can then say I've seen all 3 remakes of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, a courtroom drama. Of course, Miracle on 34th Street is a great children's movie and a great Christmas movie (and a Thanksgiving movie; I watch it every year on Turkey Day, since it starts with the Macy's parade). And it's a great showcase, not just for Edmund Gwenn in perhaps the best "supporting" performance in the history of the Oscars but also great character actors from the '40s like Gene Lockhart, William Frawley, Porter Hall, and Jerome Cowan, plus bit parts early in the careers of Thelma Ritter and Jack Albertson. And, of course, the precocious Natalie Wood. But what I really enjoy about this movie is the thoroughly believable way that John Payne wins his court case, using plenty of publicity and political pressure on the DA and the judge; a good expose on how lawsuits are really decided! Don't rent it, buy it. You'll never get tired of it; I watch it year round.</fullReview>

"Miracle" is still the top Christmas movie of all time. Photography, music, acting--all are superb. The only holiday movie that comes close is the Alastair Sim "Christmas Carol," and that's not so much a holiday movie as a vehicle for the great Sim. Edmund Gwenn's marvelous Oscar-winning performance as Kris Kringle in "Miracle" is only the tip of the iceberg, what with Natalie Wood, William Frawley, Gene Lockhart, Thelma Ritter, Porter Hall, and so many other wonderful acting turns to choose from--not to mention the charming leading performances from Maureen O'Hara and John Payne.

		<shortDescription>Do you believe in Santa Claus? This holiday film classic will lift your hope of thought.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1947's classic holiday film "Miracle on 34th Street" may seem to some a kid film that's fairy tale, yet the film at the same time shows hope, joy, and happiness for all to enjoy. Even watching as an adult most can watch and remember back to their childhood days growing up when they really wondered was Santa Claus real or make believe? The film is well done with a wonderful story that at times seems a drag and the plot points seem a little off with the insanity trial, still the themes of hope and belief make the film a timeless classic to watch at the holidays. Starting at Thanksgiving with the Macy's day parade with an older gentleman with twinkled eyes, a fat belly, and snow white beard is hired as the department store's Santa(Edmund Gwenn). From the start this mysterious guy claims his name is Kris Kringle. Slowly but surely he feels the air with holiday spirit that all feel except his boss Doris(Maureen O' Hara) who's a tough and very direct and cold mother who's taught little adorable daughter Susan(Natalie Wood) not to believe in Santa only reality and real life things matter. Then the unthinkable happens Santa is on trial for insanity a plot that you can overlook in the end the magical feel and the proof that hope occurs for a little girl is what captures the viewers attention. The film may seem a little slow, yet it's a holiday classic because it takes us all back to the time when we really wondered was Santa real or not and this film shows the happy kid magic we all felt with wonder and joy at Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Natalie Wood Is Adorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By and large, child actors of the 1940s were a nauseating bunch, so how wonderful that we have Natalie Wood's performance in "Miracle on 34th Street" as a document of just how adorable a child actor could be. Natalie joins hands with Edmund Gwenn (who just IS Santa Claus) and runs easily away with this holiday favorite. On the downside, Maureen O'Hara gives a performance that wouldn't be out of place in a high school play, though John Payne shows off his manly cleft chin to fine effect, but neither of them matter, because this movie belongs to Santa and his little helper.It's a surprisingly unsentimental and even cynical movie for its time. Despite its happy ending and magical elements, it really does a good job of capturing the dead materialism of Christmas and a culture that has become too sophisticated for its own good---and this was in 1947! Movies like this are timeless for a reason--they were relevant then, and they're still relevant now.Aside from "A Christmas Story" probably my favorite Christmas movie.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll be a miracle if you can't see the ending coming from a mile away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miracle on 34th Street" is a cinematic staple of the Christmas season. It's played on TV and on countless VCRs and DVD players around the country come December, and nearly everyone's seen it. It's a bona fide classic.That being said, "Miracle" leaves something to be desired.The film's plot, which you are probably familiar with, centers on the "conversion" of a little girl, Susan Walker (Natalie Wood), who has been brought up to be resolutely practical by her mother, Doris (Maureen O'Hara). Santa (Edmund Gwenn), or Kris Kringle as he calls himself, enters into he film by playing Santa in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. He does a good enough job to be hired as a Santa for Macy's, where hilarity ensues (who knew?) as Kringle runs into various and sundry non-believers. The film climaxes with Kringle on trial for insanity, and Susan's belief in Santa at stake. I'll give you two guesses as to how it turns out (Hint: Christmas classic).In this movie, Maureen O'Hara has all the acting range of a wooden plank. Every line she utters as Mrs. Walker is stiffly delivered with a level of poise and restraint that borders on the comical. This may stem from the true cause of Walker's desire to "protect" her daughter from fantasy -- she is obviously a single mother, and it is alluded to that a bitter divorce has somewhat disillusioned her. O'Hara's restrained performance may be a purposeful attempt to portray a character that is consumed with bitterness but strives to keep a cool façade, although that seems a stretch. Natalie Wood does a much better job as Susan, and manages to convincingly portray the different stages of belief her character goes through.The movie obviously wants us to side with Kringle (indeed it is very hard not to), but it's interesting to consider the movie as if the naysayers are right, and "Kris Kringle" is really just a delusional old man. Viewed in that context, Kringle's behavior and advice come off more as the distressing delusions of a certifiable lunatic, rather than the heartwarming actions of a kindly old man trying to save Christmas.Taken for what it is meant to be -- formulaic holiday escapism -- "Miracle" does a satisfactory job. The acting is adequate, and the story appropriately nostalgic, upbeat and cute, but it lacks any real depth or subtlety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Miracle on 34th Street is a good representation of what the American mentality is of the spirit of Christmas. A mix of romance and comedy, which takes the viewer through an internal quest answering a great myth; Is Santa Claus real? Starring Maureen O'Hara, who plays Doris Walker a woman who is very self-dependant and extremely realistic. Her character is well balanced by her beyond adorable daughter Susan, (Natalie Wood), who with the help of Santa, (Edmund Gwenn) and Fred Gailey, (John Payne), win over Miss Walker's heart. Kris Kringle is miraculously in the right place at the right time to replace the drunken Santa hired by Miss Walker for her parade. This event leads him to a permanent career as a Santa for a Macy's department store. A comical sequence of mental tests are done on Mr. Kringle in order to prove his insanity for believing his identity to be the Santa Claus. Yet his sweet character always shines through to enable justice to be the winner. As a Hollywood film should Miracle on 34th Street leaves its audience ooing and awing as the final and most important test of Santa's identity is passed. When little Susan's Christmas wish, a home for her and her family, was found by Mr. Gailey by complete fate, or should it have been expected for it was Santa's doing, or was it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether it's Christmastime or not, 1947's "Miracle on 34th Street" is the best in positive family entertainment. The entire cast is excellent (couldn't be better) and Edmund Gwenn is pure magic as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus: The scene with Santa and the little Dutch girl (who doesn't speak English) is so touching and sweet and sincere. Edmund Gwenn is everything we can possibly wish Santa to be. This movie has become our family tradition to watch on Thanksgiving morning to kick off the Christmas season; however, we watch it at any time during the year to cheer up a dreary day or to cool off during a scorching-hot summer. It always puts us in a good mood. John Payne's line in the movie, "Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to," has become one of our favorite inspirational catchphrases. This film is the best Hollywood has to offer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A nice old man with whiskers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems bizarre today, but when Miracle on 34th Street was made in 1947 the studio opted to release it in May, on the basis that more people went to the cinema in Spring than at Yuletide. And, having just got round to reviewing it now, I too find myself in the bizarre situation of watching a Christmas movie at what is almost the furthest point from Christmas in either direction. It doesn't feel as odd as you might think. After all Miracle on 34th Street is for most of its runtime devoid of twinkling Christmas trees and drifting snow, so it doesn't actually come across as that Christmassy. It does however rather prominently feature a rotund old man with a white beard.The old man in question is Edmund Gwenn, a seasoned character actor here giving what is probably his definitive performance. It's quite a physical role, and he gets stuck into it with gusto. There's a scene where Gwenn stands next to a rather tall Macy's employee, and you can see he's quite a short man, but with his exuberant presence he still dominates the scene.This is a simple yet effective little bit of storytelling, with some well-written vignettes that can appeal to kids without patronising adults. George Seaton (who adapted the screenplay from a story by Valentine Davies) is also a capable director with a laid back, unfussy style. One of his tricks is using the depth of a set to keep everything in shot, such as Maureen O'Hara talking to John Payne in the apartment with Natalie Wood visible in the next room, and the parade through the window beyond that. It means he can keep all the elements in play at once without having to resort to messy cuts or camera moves.Miracle on 34th Street is basically one of those tales about the true spirit of Christmas and believing in the magic of it all. Today, it's rather amusing to see that the rage over the commercialisation of Christmas is old enough to be a tradition in itself. You see, purveyors of the "true spirit of Christmas" always seem to miss the point of what that really is. Early on in the movie Gwenn berates a costumed would-be Kringle for drinking on duty, but when I was a kid, a slightly tipsy Santa was pretty much part of the deal. Nevertheless, Miracle on 34th Street is a nice movie, and can be enjoyed in or out of the Christmas season as the tale of a sweet old gent doing good deeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good OHara performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character played by Maureen O'Hara probably needs explanation for modern viewers. Late 1940s audiences knew that the social and economic situation of a divorced working woman with a child was much more precarious than it is now. Divorce was still somewhat shocking - this is brought out neatly in the movie when her would-be lover does a double take when he learns from her daughter about the divorce - he probably had assumed she was a war widow. Divorced moms were still rare in the middle classes. Society universally agreed that women should stay home to raise their children. Economically, women in management positions were still very rare, couldn't expect promotion, and were last hired, first fired. I think O'Hara's performance brings out these qualities in a way that the audience of the 1940s would have understood easily. The character's stiffness, fear of losing control, and anxiety about her job make a great deal of sense. It would have been nice to see a few scenes showing her loosening up, perhaps at dinner with her boyfriend; no doubt those got left on the cutting room floor.I really like the scene where Santa talks to the little Dutch orphan. First, this scene also must have resonated with the audience; in 1947 the western European countries had only started to recover from World War II, and probably many Americans were familiar with the idea of adopting a war orphan, just as many sent CARE packages. Second, by making Santa fluent in Dutch, the writer cleverly left the viewer thinking that hey, he might really be Santa Claus (isn't Santa Claus fluent in all languages)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really hard to surprise me when the subject is Christmas cinema. No matter how much I used to love Christmas, for some reason I never sympathized much with Christmas movies. Perhaps I looked for the wrong ones? Could have been that. These days I only try to discover those which "might" be worth and avoid the suspicious ones...Now here is a Christmas movie that deserves some of my sympathy, although it still has some of the characteristics faults found in Christmas movies: room for improvement in details and certain silly and unnecessary sequences. But for a Christmas movie this is positively one of the best bets.Edmund Gwenn is a joy to watch as Kris Kringle, a sympathetic delusional or a harmless delusional who acts as if he believes he is the real Santa Claus. Porter Hall is fun to watch because of his acting as Mr. Sawyer, the loony "psychiatrist". Maureen O'Hara is great. Natalie Wood charms with her acting but she deserved a bigger role.Apparently this film had a number of remakes, of which I got to see the 1994 version. My thoughts? It was lame, silly and ridicurous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful Holiday classic. I usually watch it on Thankgiving Day, or the day after Thanksgiving. The acting performances by Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, and a young Natalie Wood are excellent. Watch for supporting roles by actors William Frawley, Gene Lockhart, Thelma Ritter, and Jack Albertson. The B&amp;W version is a treasured part of my video collection, although I have enjoyed the colorized version, too. The 1973 TV remake with Jane Alexander, David Hartmann, &amp; Sebastian Cabot was good, but not as good as the original. The 1994 remake with Sir Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth Perkins &amp; Dylan McDermott was good also, but I still enjoy the original the best. I noticed in IMDb archives that there was a 1959 live TV version, but I don't recall seeing it, although I could have (I was 4 then). IMDb states: "This version... was broadcast live and in color on NBC the day after Thanksgiving in 1959...". This could have been the first time I saw it on Thanksgiving weekend, and could be the reason I watch it during this holiday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th Street is, in my opinion, that rarity of rarities, a truly perfect film. Without a doubt my favorite holiday film and one of my favorite all-around films, the movie is flawless. The spirit, tone, and message are timeless, and indeed seem to ring truer with every viewing. The gorgeous Maureen O'Hara conveys just the right balance of emotions, and we believe her as the cynical and bitter abandoned wife, and revel in her slow but sure acceptance of "lovely intangibles". John Payne is just right as her suitor, and Natalie Wood, well what can one say about Natalie Wood? Beautiful and precocious and yet without a hint of "child actor", she is true and real and absolutely natural. The supporting cast is priceless...Thelma Ritter, Gene Lockhart, William Frawley, Porter Hall, Jerome Cowan....each one unforgettable and perfectly cast. Even the smaller roles are pitch perfect...who can forget Mrs. Schellhammer's tipsy phone conversation? That said, I save the best for last....Edmund Gwenn IS Santa Claus! This has to be the performance bar against which all other portrayals of Santa Claus are measured...although honestly, I'm still not absolutely convinced it IS a performance, since I believe he really is Santa Claus. How can you not be touched when Kris talks and sings with the Dutch girl? Or when he teaches Susan how to be a monkey? I watch this movie every year around Christmas time, and it always makes me laugh out loud as well as bring tears to my eyes several times.PERFECT, FLAWLESS, UNMATCHED....THE BEST</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merry XMAS! It's a great movie that withstands the test of time but somewhat dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miracle on 34th Street will always be a Christmas classic, but it truly hasn't aged well, in my opinion. I found the movie to be a little bit dull with all the office and court room scenes. Most of the film is debating if Santa Claus is real or not. I don't think a lot of modern day children can sit down and watch a film like this. This movie seems more targeted for adults than young children. Even for adults, the way the movie flows is a bit slow pace. It might be great at the time, but clearly it's a harder Christmas film to watch, now then then. I don't understand why it's titled Miracle on 34th Street in the first place when there is hardly a miracle, in the film. A miracle is a surprising and welcome event that is not explicable by natural or scientific laws and is therefore considered to be the work of a divine agency. We don't see any supernatural actions from Macy department store employee Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwynn) here in this film; No, North Pole factory show, no elves making toys, and no flying with his reindeer. It was all grounded in semi realistic terms. Because of that reason, I can't say this movie is truly has a miracle or not. The movie doesn't really made it clear, that Kringle is or isn't Claus. Even if he did, he didn't really prove anything that he is. I like the United Kingdom title better, the Big Heart. Directed by George Seaton and based on the story by Valentine Davies, this movie is market for a Christmas holiday crowd, yet the movie was released in May 1947 for some odd reason. At less, they could had release it near Thanksgiving as the film starts off on that holiday. Gwenn does a great job as the role of Santa Claus, both acting charming and childlike, but he didn't look the part in my opinion. He was bit slimmer than what normally people think of Santa. I'm glad he won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Academy Award. Maureen O'Hara does a great job as Macy Director Doris Walker who Kris is trying to convince he is the real Santa. The movie took a big risk by making Doris, a young divorcée in this. Divorce show on film was so unheard of, at the time. A lot of families didn't like image of seeing this, and complained when this movie came out. Thank God, time has change to the point, that divorcees aren't picture as scarlet letter black mark adulteries anymore. It was a bit a negative stereotype at the time, that if you were divorce, you were a bad parent. I think the producers made her, a divorcée so that they can represent her lack of faith in things and Maureen O'Hara does a great way showing it. Her lack of faith is shaken when she sees Kris conversing in Dutch with an adopted girl who does not know English. This is one of the best scenes in the film. Natalie Wood, child actress at the time, stars as Doris Walker's young daughter, Susan whom Doris has raised not to believe in Santa Claus. When she finds out that he might be the real deal, she had such expression on her face that makes you wonder Gwinn is indeed truly is Santa Claus. She didn't seem like she was acting, at all. According to Natalie Wood's biographer, during the shoot, the young actress was convinced that Gwenn was actually Santa. It wasn't until Wood later, she realized he wasn't Santa. Last actor worth noting is Fred Gailey (John Payne) he fight the courts by showing that Kris Kringle is indeed Santa Claus. He's pretty good, but under looked by critics for his performance. I think Macy have mixed feelings when this movie came out as the movie paint the retail giant as bit greedy. Yet, the movie was giving them so much good ad-product placement for people to come to their stores. A lot of people don't like this movie because of those reasons and the fact that Krigle is telling people to share the wealth in the film. Some people see it, as an example of promoting the virtues of socialism against capitalism, while others think the movie is a bit hypocrite as it promoting capitalism, more than helping Christmas regain its originally intent. Some people think the film is about a metaphor about faith with Santa representing God, asking people to return to pre- modern skeptic society without free thinking. While others, believe that the film is against religion, forcing people to believe in a commercials market symbol such as Santa over Jesus or God. Other sees it as paean to homosexuality because Kringle and Gailey sharing beds. Then there are those who see the bubble scene, and yanking of the bed, as child molestation, because Kringle is trying to prove he is Santa to Susan. I can see where they are mistaken, but I don't think it's like that at all. I do see some faults in the film, besides being dull. I didn't like how the movie cut one of the best scenes in the film. Some DVD versions don't have the scene that ties the loose end in the courtroom scene with the football helmet gift. I think it should be added back to most of the DVDs, if not, as an extra feature. Another fault is the color version. It really doesn't match well so watch the Black &amp; White version. There are four remakes of the movie, as well as a Broadway musical. Don't watch the 1974 version. 1994 version is a little better, but doesn't match up with this original film. Overall: Watch this version, a good movie to watch with the family on a nice Christmas day or any other day. It's just not the most entertaining film ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miracle on 34th Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake starring Lord Sir Richard Attenborough, Mara Wilson and Elizabeth Perkins might be more well known, and fun for kids, but the original is more critically acclaimed, from Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated writer, and director George Seaton (Airport). Basically the actor playing Santa for Macy's Department Store Thanksgiving Day parade is found drunk, so the special events director Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) persuades the bearded man who found him, Kris Kringle (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Edmund Gwenn) to take his place. He proves to be a sensation with the public, and is quickly recruited to work in the Macy's store, even claiming he is the real Santa Claus. What gives the store some good business is that they market the fact that Kris is telling customers where to find certain items, including at better prices, and he is really enlightening everyone spirits, including Doris's own daughter Susan (young West Side Story's Natalie Wood), who she taught to reject any belief and fantasy. The incompetent psychologist Dr. Pierce (James Seay), hired for Kris, originally saying he is harmless (when they thought he might be crazy), makes him erupt in anger, ending up with Kris put into Bellevue, awaiting a trial to prove his sanity. His defender, Doris's friend Fred Gailey (John Payne) isn't just fighting for Kris's release, but unbelievably his sanity, by proving he is the real Santa Claus! It is going to take a miracle for Kris to win, but thankfully they find something that clearly proves his identity, a mountain of letters addressed to "Santa Claus", all given to Kris at Christmas, they win the case! Oh, and Susan gets the present she wanted for Christmas, a new house. Also starring Gene Lockhart as Judge Henry X. Harper, Porter Hall as Granville Sawyer, William Frawley as Charlie Halloran, Jerome Cowan as Dist. Atty. Thomas Mara, Philip Tonge as Julian Shellhammer, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory's Jack Albertson as Post Office Mail Sorter, Harry Antrim as Mr. R.H. Macy and Rear Window's Thelma Ritter as Peter's Mother. It is good that the remake didn't copy everything, including how they win the case, and the present that the daughter wanted, because boy did Wilson want something big! A perfect actor playing Kris, or Santa, and obviously the signature role of his career, he deserved the Oscar for playing one of the most well known characters in the world, a very enjoyable family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture. It was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 9 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, Natalie, there is a Santa Claus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladies and gentleman...Kris Kringle is alive and well and sitting on his magical throne at Macy's Department Store, New York City. I know this because I've watched this perennial holiday classic countless times. It never fails to hook me into Valentine Davies' short story. From his perch, seven stories up, Santa is on the precipice of sanity. Some people consider him a touch crazy. Who else would list his "next of kin" (on his employment application) as eight reindeer from The North Pole? Is he nuts? No. Well, maybe a little: "like some of those men in Washington." Natalie Wood, a tiny power plant of a child, doesn't think so. She is mesmerized by the charming old man with a snowy white beard. But she's not totally convinced. Yet. Her mother, you see, has hammered away any thoughts of make believe. No fairy Tales. No giants--except in the Macy's Parade. And fantasy resides in a place better left unvisited. A child (I think) needs a little world of their own, a place where parents are banished, and where a fantasy world is cracked open like a colorful Easter egg. I enjoy John Payne's kid-friendly, but ambitious lawyer. He butts heads with Maureen O'Hara, Wood's overprotective mom, on several occasions. Natalie Wood's performance is nothing short of brilliant. Timeless. And so is this wonderful movie. If you think I've short changed the plot and some of the plethora of memorable moments in the film--forgive me. You will find them on the DVD, nestled in your Christmas stocking. Kris told me so.</fullReview>

In today's world, this movie in needed now more than ever. Watch the movie to understand and feel the true meaning of Christmas. In today's world, it's so easy not to believe in anything.

		<shortDescription>Are Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood atheists?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious today, but belief in God was taken so much for granted in 1947 that no one seems to have worried that Mrs. Walker, the sensible woman who won't let her daughter believe anything untrue, would come across as an atheist (evil! wicked! unnatural!). But it's a logical extension of her war against myths, fairy tales, and the like. Surely, at the time, if little Susie had said, in real life, that she didn't believe in them, someone would have said, "But you believe in God, don't you? Even though you can't see Him?" If that had happened in the movie, and she had answered no, the reaction would have been Devil child! bad seed!The movie makers must have been conscious of this because of one telling mistake. In NY courts, when witnesses are sworn in, they raise their right hand and are told to put their left hand on the Bible and swear by Almighty God. Yet, in the movie, Santa Claus is asked only to raise his right hand and promise to tell the truth. No Bible. No mention of God. No one else is even sworn in at all. The filmmakers must have realised that any mention of another imaginary being whom most adults insist (at least to their children) is true would blow the show. Another interesting moment--the DA says, when the case is over, that he will have to hurry and buy his son the football helmet which we have earlier heard the child request from Santa. But if Santa Claus is the real deal, why isn't he himself bringing the kid a helmet?On the whole, the movie is, if you can swallow its implicitly religious premise and its declaration against sense and rationality (not the best way to go, but most people seem to prefer it), very deft and gentle and charming. One moment, though, I found very unpleasant. When Susie asks how Santa can exist if he doesn't bring children what they want, she is told that some children might want things that are not good for them. I couldn't help thinking, what about the children whose Christmas wish is that their father be cured of cancer? or that the bank not foreclose on their house? That's what happens when you set out to make a case against reason--you end up reasoning in favour of things that are not very nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just barely another Christmas story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christmas is a grand affair filled with many things: joy, happiness, and gifts. Though it is nothing more than another day if it is not celebrated. I myself don't celebrate Christmas, but many others do. Of those people were George Seaton (Director) and his idea from the story by Valentine Davies `Miracle on 34th Street.' A flick that not only was tiresome to watch, but also was just another movie to push Christmas to the mainstream further than it already was.Made in 1947, and released oddly during the summer this flick is barely a different Christmas story. It has to do with Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) trying to persuade a single mother Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) to believe in him. Looking at the perspective of one `in tune' with Christmas this flick has the good touchy feely message. Aside from that it is nothing but a recruit to influence the public into the belief that there is a `spirit of Christmas.'For it's time the acting in the movie was the usual. If it were compared to any other time period after it was very stale, and too contrived. Don't get me wrong they was maybe a few good acting spots, however there was no real emotion from the actor interpreting the character. I would say this flick is just another Hollywood movie using their `top stars' for the next big extravaganza.Amid the movie I viewed; color was added to give it more appeal. It was better than some jobs in the past. Though it was a little harder to identify the original lighting and camera use. This is not a special movie looking at the flicking process. Now, I still view this movie as a tool to make Christmas stay in mainstream. Ideas they used were dull and boring. Maybe the director wanted a quick buck by making this flick, I don't know. I personally would not recommend this flick to anyone other than Christians, Consumers, or naive people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing like a good old Americanized Christmas movie to get you in that money-spending mood for the holidays. Having already falling victim to holiday commercialism, you can't help but feel good when watching this film. Focusing on the traditional aspects we Americans view Christmas to be, Miracle On 34th Street (1947) is a much needed heart warmer the whole family can enjoy and is indeed one of the most original Christmas movies ever made.The story starts out with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade gearing up to impress a New York crowd for yet another year. After discovering the original talent hired to portray Santa blind drunk, Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) reports this blasphemy to the parade's director, Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara). She fires the drunk and convinces Kris to be Santa for the parade. Being a hit with the audience, Kris finds himself shaking hands with Mr. Macy himself and manages to become the full time Santa Claus for the Department Store tycoon, while teaching Doris and her fantasy-deprived daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) a thing or two about imagination and faith.Gwenn does a superb job of playing the part of the robust Samaritan. He compliments the screen well with his character's hearty laughter, warm persona, and overall love for his fellow man. Gwenn plays a very authentic Santa; convincing enough for even the audience to believe he really could be the real deal. Also, what helped make Kris Kringle even more believable to the audience was the fact that he wasn't an embellished fictional character that rides on a sleigh and climbs down people's chimneys. Instead, the film portrayed him as having a somewhat normal lifestyle. He lives in a retirement home, goes to work, gets in trouble with the law, etc. As for the other characters of the film, the acting from O'Hara and Wood helped make the movie great, but was a little bit short of anything other than honorable mention.It was a treat to see John Payne in this piece. His character is a persistent young lawyer, Fred Gailey, who lives across the hall from the Walker's apartment and is chosen to defend Kris in his legal woes. It was funny to watch Payne try to woo Mrs. Walker into sexual submission with his sly schemes and less-than-romantic antics. His character seemed to be an honest, loving guy, and a very sly and sneaky little devil. You can't blame the guy for hitting on Doris she is quite the little vixen. His onscreen presence was like a breath of fresh air, much needed and much appreciated.The film's climax is a culmination of disputes between Kris and society that leaves him and Gailey in the courtroom to provide concrete evidence that proves his sanity and that he really is the one and only Santa J. Claus.For anyone who loves a good Christmas movie, this should definitely be at the top of your list. It's a simple and entertaining film guaranteed to please anyone with a remote interest in the commercialized and materialistic season we've made Christmas to be. Happy Holidays!This movie deserves a B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a much better title for this movie than `Miracle On 34th Street'. How about, `Propaganda for Increased Christmas Sales'? Now that's a title that describes what this movie's motives are. This movie is just that. Nothing more than propaganda to brainwash the masses into this ever so commercialized holiday known as Christmas. A film used to the advantage of big business to sell more merchandise to the greater population of the U.S. It's not just a fun little movie about the `Christmas Spirit'; it hides a much deeper meaning about the reality of Christmas in America. This movie focuses on a little girl and her tangle with the beliefs around Santa Claus/Christmas. The girl, played by a very young Natalie Wood, is confused about her beliefs about Christmas. She was never lied to like most American children about the reality of Santa Claus, and doesn't believe that such fantasies exist. However, when she meets a jolly old fellow who claims to be Kris Kringle (a.k.a. Santa), her realist philosophy is questioned. The majority of the movie has this delusional old man trying to convince everyone that he is Santa Claus, to minimal success. Was Christmas ever about Santa Claus? No, of course not. Christmas started out as the birth of Jesus Christ, the figurehead of the Christian religion. Now Christmas is all about Santa Claus, eggnog, and of course, getting presents. (Notice how I didn't include giving?) The people of America have lost sight of the true meaning of Christmas. Christmas is strictly a Christian holiday, a time to celebrate beliefs. It's now grown into this monster of commercialism and materialism.  Everyone should realize that this movie embodies everything that's wrong with the `Christmas season'. People should realize through this movie and obvious reality that the attitudes surrounding Christmas should not exist. Why should people who don't believe in Santa Claus and Christmas be persecuted? Much like the little girl in this movie. She couldn't be left alone at all; some overbearing adult had to make her believe. And that's what's wrong with our society. Hopefully I'm not the only one to realize this. If you're a big Christmas fan, check out this movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Well acted and a fun little story. For the rest of us, don't waste your time filling your head with such nonsense. Objectively though, it's a pretty good little movie.Overall Grade for `Miracle on 34th Street': B- (I'm trying to be as objective as possible here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite a Christmas cracker...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From around the same time as two other classic Hollywood Christmas movies I can think of, "The Bishop's Wife" and the king of them all "It's A Wonderful Life", the original "Miracle On 34th Street" differs from both in that in the viewer's mind the existence of its other-world visitor (Santa Claus as opposed to angels Dudley &amp; Clarence) is placed in doubt and never properly answered by the conclusion. However like the other movies it's a film about faith and its retreat in the modern world in the face of commercialisation and post-modern scepticism about the so-called miraculous.It is still a lovely "feel-good" film but does seem to show its age now with somewhat stiff acting and dated scenario. It maybe also just needed the boost of really big-name lead actors to take it to another level, although the players on show do acquit themselves reasonably well. Of course the movie turns completely on the role of the Kris Kringle / Santa (or as he is termed throughout the movie Santy) Claus character and here Edmund Gwenn gives a beautifully natural performance, really embodying everything you would want from an idealised Father Christmas. He carries the film completely, interacting easily with both adults and children. Maureen O'Hara and John Payne are okay as the brought-together neighbours although both are lacking somewhat in the charismatic stakes. I also found some of the other support playing a little too cartoonish (they all mug and clown too much) and therefore at odds with Gwenn's more straight-forward playing. Nice also to see a very young Natalie Wood in a prominent child-part which she accomplishes very capably.The central premise of putting Santa on trial for his life (metaphorically of course!) and how it's resolved is ingeniously worked and the happy ending ties up all the loose ends of love and faith. So no trick photography or wonderful effects or even banks of cascading Christmas music in the background and it was almost pleasant to see Hollywood utilising the big brand names of Macy's, Gimbel's etc without it setting me off on a product-placement whinge.In conclusion, a pleasant seasonal offering, but not the very best of its kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Santa Clause spins a web of corruption and legal trickery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miracle on 34th street" is a rather typical Christmas film, with all of the themes (some might say clichés) that encompasses. However, I am willing to bet that it was not as formulaic at the time of its release (1947) - it a testament to this film's credit that it has been so often imitated. It is, naturally, one of the definitive Christmas films, along with such classics as "It's A Wonderful Life" and "A Christmas Story". But like most Christmas pageants, it is ultimately little more than a cute and entertaining diversion with a moral.In this tale, Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) is a newly discovered talent for portraying Santa Claus in an annual Christmas parade, when he replaces their original Santa, who was, oddly enough, completely drunk on the morning of the parade. Kris also manages to become the Santa at the apparently famous toy chain-store, Macy's, and starts a revolution by continuously referring loving parents to other toy stores for certain items, generating customer loyalty and increasing profits (which, of course, is the true meaning of Christmas spirit). Meanwhile, Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter, Susan (Natalie Wood) learn a valuable lesson about imagination and faith.Edmund Gwenn does an excellent job portraying Chris, in all his jolly, plump goodness. Although his character veers little from the traditional Santa Claus personality, it is effective here - the viewer really gets the impression that one could ask Kris for advice in almost any situation and get a decent answer. One scene in particular stands out where a caring mother brings her adopted Dutch refugee to see Santa, despite her assumption that Santa wouldn't be able to communicate. Naturally, Kris begins conversing fluently in Dutch and the unnamed girl's face is subtitle enough. Although the personality is traditional, the details certainly aren't - for example, Kris doesn't live in the North Pole - he lives in a retirement home. He goes to work, he pays the bills, and he lives a rather normal life (he also sleeps with his beard outside of his covers - it makes it grow), except, of course, on Christmas Eve. I won't reveal whether or not Kris actually is Santa Claus, but that's not important anyway - the movie is more about retaining childhood and faith than encyclopedic fact.Unfortunately, the other characters in the movie are all decidedly bland and predictable. Naturally, the single mother has to fall in love, and the little girl learn all about imagination and trust. They are all rather one-dimensional and uninteresting; Chris's attorney, Fred Gailey (John Payne) is more or less the same character as all men in their thirties as portrayed in the 1940's and 50's - as decent and handsome as, for example, Mr. Cleaver of "Leave it to Beaver" fame. The same applies to most other characters with their own set of clichés, give or take the necessary conflict for a story arc.The film culminates in a surprisingly corrupt court room scene judging the sanity of Kris Kringle, where cheap lawyer trickery, corporate threats and theatrical antics win the day for the spirit of Christmas. However, the final master stroke for the defense is actually a rather clever (if implausible) solution."Miracle on 34th Street" is a simplistic, entertaining way to spend one and a half hours. Despite its limited depth and wooden characters, the film is still very enjoyable and energetic. Thus, I rate it as a C.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An awful little girl (Natalie Would) doesn't believe in Santa Claus because her more awful mother (Maureen O'Hairy) is a frigid gnome.Along comes a crazy old coot (Edmund Gwin) who thinks he's Santa Claus. This old nut-ball makes the little girl "believe".... oh, joy! Santa has saved the little creep from a life of holiday despair! Everything is OK now! Merry Christmas, everybody! God bless us, everyone!...... whatever.Eventually, the old coot has his sanity examined. If this prune juice-drinker doesn't pass the test, he'll end up in the clink. The maniac is so disgusted by this prospect, he intentionally fails the test. Due to this erratic behavior, this insane asylum-escapee gets locked up causing the city's worst lawyer (John Pain) to defend the annoying dribbler.What a pile of rotting holiday fruitcake. For gullible idiots everywhere. Also featuring William Fraudley and Ugene Lockfart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic movie with some cheesy lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miracle on 34th Street" is a classic. Just about everybody has heard of it, whether or not they have seen it. And those same people know that there are two versions of the film, one made in the 40's and the other made in the 90's. Most teenagers or young children have seen the newer version and grow to love it! And why shouldn't they? It's a Christmas movie, it has some great actors/actresses, and it's very entertaining. Well, if those same children were to see the older version they might not think as highly of it. It is a very good movie and it is still very entertaining, but it's entertaining for a different reason.The acting in "Miracle on 34th Street" is not so good. In fact, it's very fake and you can completely tell that the people on screen are just acting. The lines can be very cheesy and the whole movie just has this feeling of corniness, which is why it is so entertaining. The audience isn't laughing because the movie is supposed to make them laugh, they are laughing because the acting and the lines combined are so unreal and once again, cheesy.Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) has to be the funniest character in the whole movie. He's almost always happy and he does this thing where his eyes get really huge and you just can't help but laugh. Gwenn, the actor who plays Kringle, is a rather odd actor. His acting just makes the viewer want to laugh. Gwenn played Kris Kringle very well.The other main characters in the movie: Doris Walker ( Maureen O'Hara), Susan Walker (Natalie Wood), and Fred Gailey (John Payne), were all rather good characters. They add a lot to the movie; in fact, with out them there would be no movie. They aren't very good actors/actresses compared to the ones we have now, but I'm sure back then they were great.The music in "Miracle on 34th Street" was awesome! It was practically all Christmas music (considering it's a Christmas movie) and it had no words. The music really helps the viewer to get into the Christmas mood and it makes the whole feel of the movie more Christmassy and happy. It was really cheerful music and it adds a lot to the movie. If it wasn't there the movie would be cheesy, corny, and somewhat boring."Miracle on 34th Street" is and always will be a classic movie. It's a movie that is treasured by many people and everyone should get a chance to see it for themselves, no matter how cheesy it may be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie after all of these years and I was VERY disappointed in its total lack of logic. (I realize it's just a movie but if you want me to believe that that guy is Santa Claus, you have to make me believe in the movie first.) He says he's Santa Claus but he lives in an old folks' home. If he's Santa Claus, wouldn't he live at the North Pole? Does this not bother anyone else? I thought the ham-handed seriousness of the mother was a bit over-the-top (she's less of a believer than I am, I guess). We get it, you're an atheist and that's how you raised your daughter. The movie really could have done without that. I think you don't need Super Skeptic as the foil for a guy saying he's Santa Claus. Any six people on the street would be fine.</fullReview>
