		<shortDescription>My favorite version of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all of the comments about this version not being the original acknowledged, this one is still my favorite version of the story.Maybe its because I grew up with David Hartman on Good Morning America and in all those sappy commercials....or maybe its because I have always been a fan of Sebastian Cabot.Regardless, the update did a good job of bringing the story into the '70s and, even 30 years later, I find it comforting on the very rare occasion that it is shown during the Christmas season....Sebastian Cabot is fine throughout, and the updated setting, while not outshining the original, at least makes us feel like we could have been there.So, I wouldn't place it in my "top 10" list of movies, or even consider it any kind of competition with the original.But it does have its own, somewhat subdued, charm, and its always a pleasure to see Cabot in one of his later roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Original but Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me begin by saying that nothing exceeds the original black &amp; white 1947 version of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET. It is rare when a movie remake is better than the original. The 1973 version of this film by no means is better than the 47 version, for that matter nor is the 94 version. In my opinion the 94 version is the worst but I'll not comment on that here.I feel that the 74 version does bring some good things to the table. I find the color here better than the Ted Turner coloring of the 47 version. I believe that movies filmed in black &amp; white should stay in black &amp; white. Turner does an injustice to movie making with his colorization process. I also like the selection of the actors for this film. Both Alexander and Hartman give good performances and come off across as ordinary looking and yet are an attractive couple. Davis did seem to overact a bit in the role of the lead child but she is tolerable.When looking at a film I like to be able to identify what era it was made in. Both the 47 and 73 are identifiable by the autos, clothes, toys and parade floats &amp; balloons. While not alive in 47 I was a kid in 73 and it's nice to watch a film and be reminded of images from my own youth.So, while it is true that the 73 version does not do better than the 47 version it does not flop either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw this production in the making and that's why I like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I worked on this made-for-TV-movie as a set dresser back in 1973. It was my first job as a returning Vietnam war era veteran. The art director was a woman named Jan Scott who offered me more work as Set dresser but I chose to attend college on the GI bill as an art major, with the eventual goal of teaching art, though I did continue to work on a few more film projects on occasion.What is very noteworthy about this production was that the majority of the crew had just finished Martin Scorcese's "Mean Streets" and many of the locations used to film Mean Streets, most notably the Green Hotel in Pasedena, were used to film Miracle. In retrospect it's funny to think about how so many who had worked with Scorsese all thought that while he was a fairly good director, he was such a neurotic quirky sort that he probably wouldn't last long in the business and also no one seemed to think much of Mean Streets as a finished product. Most did, however, have a high opinion of De Niro's acting ability.Fielder Cook the director, was an early Hollywood television pioneer having directed episodes of Playhouse 90 and many other early TV productions. He was also quite the colorful character and well-liked by the crew. The two other people who impressed me were actors Roddy McDowell and Sebastion Cabot. Cabot, for his acting ability and McDowell Because after the project was wrapped he personally and quite sincerely thanked every crew member for a job well done.I was so impressed by Cabot's portrayal of Kris Kringle that as a college student, during Christmas vacation I got a job as a Department store Santa at a somewhat upscale large retail establishment in L.A. and played the "role" of Santa Claus much the way Cabot did and put on makeup for every "performance".On one occasion where there was a crowd of people waiting to bring their children up to sit on my lap and be photographed by my attractive young female "elves" I noticed a distinguished looking and portly white-haired older gentleman standing in the back of the crowd watching who I swear to God, MUST have been the Real Santa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas catastrophe...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That old rivalry between Macy's and Gimbel's rages on! Allegedly a Christmas fantasy with comic and romantic trimmings, this TV-made remake of the 1947 holiday perennial turns sour mighty quickly, probing into the psychological ramifications of a department store Santa Claus who believes he is, in fact, Kris Kringle. Sebastian Cabot would appear to be a great choice to replace Edmund Gwenn in the leading role, but director Fielder Cook never allows Cabot a magical moment, keeping the camera at a distance from him--and worse, keeping Kris in a perpetually combative mood. The romance initiated between hard-working single mom Jane Alexander and attorney David Hartman by Alexander's brainy daughter doesn't work, either; young Suzanne Davidson, playing a walking encyclopedia, is full of forced cuteness and unnatural sparkle. When Davidson spies Santa Cabot speaking Spanish to a little girl, she reacts as if she's seen a miracle, dropping her mouth open mechanically. In updating Valentine Davies' original story, I guess having Santa speak any other foreign language but Spanish was considered too outlandish. Yet, that's precisely the problem with this woebegone version: it hasn't an ounce of genuine wonderment or Christmas spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, this version was kind of lost in the shuffle when the 1994 (gasp, another one!) remake made its way to cable TV. So now these days you have your choice of the original 1947 B&amp;W version with Maureen O'Hara or the 1994 remake with cute little Mara Wilson (Mrs. Doubtfire). What about the 1973 version?? Isn't that good enough to show on TV??? I grew up watching the 1973 version on Thanksgiving in the 1970s. The cast was definitely all-star. Sebastian Cabot (Mr. French on "Family Affair") was excellent as Kris Kringle. Jane Alexander was great as Karen Walker, the single mom, and David Hartman (former host of Good Morning America)was so-so of an actor as the attorney. Tom Bosley (Mr. Cunningham on "Happy Days") and David Doyle (Bosley on "Charlie's Angels") were both pretty good. This was kind of like a 1970s updated version of the 1947 movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a wonderful story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I have seen all three versions of this film, and while I understand why older generations and purists stand by the original as the best one, that doesn't mean that people can't still enjoy this version. For a made-for-TV version, it has a wonderful cast, with Sebastian Cabot being the highlight. I thought the way the court case was handled was better here than in the 1994 version, and having grown up with color all of my life (and having been born only 2 years before this version originally came out), I still claim this one as my favorite. That is not to say that the original or 1994 versions aren't good--I think they all have a place for those who enjoy them. I just think that this story--like many others--is a generational one, and everyone is going to have at least a little nostalgia for the one from their generation. My only wish, which so far has gone unfulfilled, is that someone will eventually put this version out on DVD and Blu-Ray so that those of us who enjoy it can watch it again. The 1947 and 1994 versions' fans have access to their movies--why can't we? I think the reviewer who offered the option of a box set including all versions of this movie has a wonderful idea--that way, everyone's happy, and each is different enough from the others that you can watch them all and enjoy them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Streamlined version of the 1947 Classic, but reasonably good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this last night on television for the first time (I did not see it when it came out in 1973). It sticks to the basics of the story: a jolly, fat old man named Kris Kringle (now Sebastian Cabot) is hired by Karen Walker (now Jane Alexander) to replace a drunken Santa Clause at the Thanksgiving Day Parade that Macy's throws. Kringle proves such a wonderful Santa that Mr. Macy (David Doyle) hires him for the season. He soon becomes a fixture in the Department Store by his fresh honesty that brings in customers. He also becomes a fixture in the lives of Karen and her daughter Susan (Susan Davidson) and her neighbor Bill Schaffner (David Hartman), encouraging Susan to rid herself of the mother-imposed controls on her imagination and childhood spirit, and encouraging Bill and Karen to get together. The fly in the ointment is the skeptical reaction of Dr. Henry Sawyer (Roddy MacDonald here) who is certain that Kris must be a mental case, as he openly claims he is Santa Clause. Eventually all is led to an insanity hearing before a politically active Judge (here Tom Bosley) with the prosecution led by the District Attorney (James Gregory here). The results are the same as in the original film.Familiarity supposedly breeds contempt, but here it was accepted that the audience knew the story (most audiences are aware of all the best stories connected to Christmas that have been made into films). The results is the film is still good, even if some of the edge and drive of the 1947 version are lost. For example, a definite highpoint of the original was William Frawley's funny speech of warning to Judge Gene Lockhart to be extremely careful about handling the insanity hearing. Frawley looked and spoke like the old time political pro he is supposed to be, and delivers the speech with a chirping little smile that the audience appreciates and cheers on. That speech has been dropped here, and while Jason Wingreen (best recalled as "Harry" the bartender on ALL IN THE FAMILY and ARCHIE BUNKER'S PLACE) is fine he has no really good replacement speech. Certain characters seem wasted. Karen's assistant is played by Jim Backus, but he is never given any really memorable bit of business his comic and acting abilities deserve. The hearing is a closed one, and it lacks the noise and publicity the original film gave (which added to the pressures on Lockhart and the D.A. in that film, Jerome Cowan). Roland Winters is in this film as Mr. Gimble, and has one good scene besting his rival for publicity. But the character also ended up in the 1947 version testifying (as does Mr. Macy) at the hearing.The biggest change (and a flawed one) is Dr. Sawyer. In the original it was Porter Hall, who really had no right to call himself a doctor, as he was not a real therapist (he just fell into the job at Macy's). He is a spiteful, despicable little worm, who eventually finds that his own actions get out of hand and ruin him. Here MacDowell is shading the character a bit. He actually is a psychiatrist, and he does believe that Cabot is off the wall, but he is also angry at Cabot's contempt for him and humiliating him in public. Something could have been rewritten to allow him to come around to seeing Cabot was right (if rewriting was part of the plans of the production). Still for all these changes or deletions, as I said the film holds up well, and the cast gives it their all. So as far as remakes go it is a good one, and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't hold a whisker to the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earnest but hardly spirited TV update of the 1947 classic with Jane Alexander, David Hartman and Sebastian Cabot reprising the Maureen O'Hara, John Payne and Edmund Gwenn (Oscar winner) roles, and failing to warm the cockles of our old-fashioned hearts the way the original did. The '47 version had real bite amidst the holiday hokum; this one plays it safe and only nips. I say, you better have big, big ideas if you're gonna challenge a classic. Holiday sentimentalism ain't the kind of drawing power it used to be.For starters, this 1974 effort makes a fatal mistake in trying to recapture the whimsy of its predecessor, which was a product of its times. Admirable maybe, but now it comes off stilted and dated. And then there are the performances...Alexander and Hartman fail to register the same kind of romantic chemistry as O'Hara and Payne, the delightfully subtle games played by our original pair are just too pat here. The characters have less friction and are softer around the edges, making them more obvious and less interesting.Hefty Sebastian Cabot has all the makings of a great Santa Claus, but compared with the twinkle-eyed magic of Edmund Gwenn, well, you find yourself having those nagging doubts all over again. I mean, Gwenn really WAS Kris Kringle; Cabot comes off like a Gimbel's store-front imitation.Lastly, Suzanne Davidson doesn't hold a candle to darling Natalie Wood. The feisty Wood showed a hard-edged maturity and intelligence far beyond her age. Davidson captures none of the precocious cynicism necessary to pull of this difficult role.In all, a game try, but still a lump of coal...with the 1994 remake hardly an improvement. If these two versions are all that's offered come Christmas time, may I suggest adding a little extra "nog" to your egg nog before settling in?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as The 1947 Movie But Much Better Then The 1994 Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay this 1973 made for TV remake isn't as good as the old 1947 black and white original Miracle on 34th Street but it is still good and I actually enjoyed watching it! It was first shown on TV in 1973 when I as a little girl but I had never seen it until this year and so far I have watched it about 2 or 3 times and while the original cast is better I thought that Sebastian Cabot who some may remember as the butler Mr. French in the show Family Affair was good as Kris Kringle and was probably the best actor in the movie along with Jane Alexander! Suzanne Davidson the child actor who played Susan was no where near as great as Natalie Wood but she wasn't bad and David Hartman was good but his acting was a little over the top at times especially in the courtroom scene about the post office and the letters for Santa. All in all not as good as the original but I liked it and any child of the 70's should find this movie amusing and their kids might like it too and it's much better then that awful 1994 theatrical remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version is by far the best of Miracle on 34th Street! I like the original, but there was far too much 'acting', where in this version it was real. My children have asked many times why it is not shown any more, and where we could buy the DVD or download it if that fails. They would love for my grandchildren to see this version. One of my daughters could have been the little girl in this movie. She firmly believed in Santa Claus until she was 12, not the one at the mall or in the parades, but the real one that brought the presents that were under the tree on Christmas morning. We need to bring this version back to TV to bring magic back to Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad remake but not a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will underscore what has been said here on this 1974 remake of the 1947 Classic. The 1947 was such an original classic with wonderful performances by all the leads and supporting. Here Sebastian Cabot is probably the best choice to play the Santa but just cant compare to Edmund Gwenn's twinkle in the eyes..First the Miracle song in the Main title appears so "hokey" today but it does set the tone for the rest of the movie. The film in general does a credible job in updating the story for the 1970's but it has an impossible task to overcome as the world has changed and we have grown even more cynical of the Santa Claus story. I recommend it for curiosity only and I suppose there is a reason why this version hasn't really survived in the collective memory of repeated television broadcasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the original 1947 film and I just despised this totally needless made-for-TV rehash. Sort of fitting to have Sebastian Cabot as Kris Kringle (but he can't match the delight of Edmund Gwenn), and I always like an appearance by Roddy McDowall (trying his best here to little avail as the psychiatrist)... but Jane Alexander and TV personality David Hartman were just TERRIBLE as the bland leads. Same holds true for the boring young actress who plays the crucial role of little Susan (that being the rather plain Suzanne Davidson). These three dead weights can't hold a candle to the original's Maureen O'Hara, John Payne and Natalie Wood. Elements of the original classic are just covered routinely out of obligation, and this is one boring and non-festive experience which doesn't even feel like Christmas much of the time. 0 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirricle is my favorite Christmas movie, the 1974 version i think is my least favorite but i have only seen it once a very long time ago. I just wish there was a set I could buy with all the versions on it, because sometimes I wish I could watch them all back to back. Just a thought corporate America PUT OUT A BOXED SET!!!!!!!! All of the versions have their strong suits. The original is the most widely recognized and beautifully written and I believe most everyones favorite, but I have never even seen the fifties TV version, and I would like that opportunity. The 74 version has some nostalgia for the people who saw it when they were little, and the most recent version is easier for small children to identify with. It would even be nice if they could have a version of the Broadway play but I doubt there are any copies of it running around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Versions of "Miracle On 34th Street" &amp; This One's Caught In The Middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen and liked all 3 versions of this movie (and let's pray no one else remakes it again)but this version I've only seen twice. I saw it in the early 90s one night in December on late night TV and then last night the MY-TV Network played the new DVD version. I could tell it was the DVD because it had those squares that interfere with the picture for a moment.It was better than I remember it but I do agree with some here that it's not the best version. That always will be the first one,with the 1994 one being fairly close to that version. This version however is really pretty good. It only suffers from 1970s sensibilities,fashion and although I hate to say it,former "Good Morning America" host David Hartman. He does well enough for a TV-movie and he did seem more into his role in the second half of the movie. Especially the very famous mailmen in the courtroom scene. The actress playing Susan's mother is nice and demonstrates the modern woman of that day admirably but it seems rushed in how she and Hartman fall in love and get together. I wont fault the girl who played Susan at all,a kid is a kid and maybe she's not Natalie Wood but I still think she did a good job. Sebastian Cabot was the perfect choice for Kris. Loved his song too and glad there was only one song in the movie. He brought just the right energy to the role. The film is filled with A-List (and B list) TV actors of the day and they all play their roles great and all were funny too. So,overall I can't find a tremendous amount of fault with the movie,I liked it too much to rate it less than a 9 out of ten. I'd say ten but the other two films truly outshine it. Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year! (END)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No miracles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except for his interaction with the staff psychologist, Sebastian Cabot seemed an affable enough Santa Claus, but the writers removed any hint of magic from his portrayal of Kris Kringle. Speaking Spanish wasn't nearly as surprising as speaking Dutch, and the possibly divinely-inspired intervention by the post office was changed into a ruse by Bill, his lawyer (David Hartman). Given Kringle's condescension towards Dr Sawyer (Roddy McDowall), I almost didn't blame Sawyer for taunting the old man.The little girl was cute, but not a great actress. Jane Alexander must have had a no touching clause in her contract because Karen's romance with Bill was hard to discern. At the end when he proposed, she sort of nodded while they were standing at least three feet apart - which made for a clumsy ending.Of the supporting cast, Jim Backus was almost invisible, McDowell was fun to watch as always, the actor playing Alfred seemed more like Quasimodo at first, David Doyle played Mr Macy like Scrooge, and Tom Bosley was fairly humorous as the harried judge. The DA and the old pol were very minor characters in this version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the Thomas Mitchell version as OK as we'll, while Richard Attenborough's left a bitter taste in my mouth. What stood out was that it's set up blended so well into the 70's era. I confess, I always thought of David Hartman as a newsman, but here I realize he wasn't a bad actor at all. Cabot's Santa? Loved him! Convincingly kind and gentle, and showed brilliant Santa magic. In some ways it does feel like you'd get lost following this if you didn't already know the story, because you don't get a lot to tell you just what the characters as set up are all about, and you don't get hardly any exposition of Karen Walker as an unbeliever, but familiarity saves it. As well, I feel like i wouldn't like it as much if not for wanting some reprieve from the forced resolution I got out of the Attenborough version. The Post Office miracle doesn't feel as brilliant, but still different enough to feel fresh, a nd believable enough to appreciate as a miracle. I won't put as much diligence into making this a Christmas season must-see, but I'll definitely get to a point where it feels like another go is in order. Not a bad version at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its own special, gritty charm!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1973 version of Miracle on 34th Street was not the first remake, as one was done for television around 1959 or so. Remakes are not necessarily a good idea, and this might be the case here.However, this version cannot compare to the 1947 original because it is a sort of different animal.Think of a Christmas special with some of the grittiness one finds in such a movie as The French Connection. Yes, this was shot in New York in the early 1970s, complete with the battered urban landscape to go with it. Unlike the 1994 version, there is no cheery cinematography; instead, we have a bleak urban landscape. And the bleakness is most appropriate, since the 1947 original has a noir side to it as well.I prefer to take this version on its own terms, because my memories of 1973 are so vivid. I found it a fascinating, rewarding time. Hence, like one of the other reviewers, I am going to be prejudiced. And believe me, one could do worse when it comes to Christmas specials.One note: I saw toward the opening sequences a 1974 AMC Matador coupe. It makes me wonder if this was actually shot on a tight time schedule, since the coupe would have been new in the fall of 1973. Definitely a fascinating touch!</fullReview>

Then it disappeared. It was difficult to track this down; even the existence of this version. Neither Blockbuster nor Netflix stocks this version.David Hartman became the ABC morning show host soon after. Or was he already in that capacity when this was made? Jane Alexander gave a fine portrayal as the "sensible" mother. Sebastian Cabot was simply made for the role. I thought Burl Ives would have made a good choice too.I thought that overall, the performances in this TV version far more understated while the older movie version is too explicit, leaving nothing to imagination. The dialogue seemed too contrived.I wish I can find the TV version somewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this when it first came on TV 35 years ago Dec.14,1973. I liked this one better than the 1947 and 1994 versions. Although,the 1947 and 1994 ones are on DVD and get the most advertised. This 1973 made for TV one is the one I grew up with as an 11 yr. old kid in the 70's.When at Christmas,kids wanted things like bicycles,roller skates, sleds,footballs,GI Joes,Barbie dolls,and the board games at that time. And before there were Ipods,there was the view master.This one stars Sebastian Cabot(Mr.French of Family Affair and Winston Essex of the Ghost Story series)as a man claiming to be Santa Claus. But Macy's store workers Karen Walker(Jane Alexander)and Dr.Sawyer(Roddy McDowall)have a hard time believing that but Karen's daughter Susan(Suzanne Walker(whatever came of her?)believes him. David Hartman(The Bold Ones:The New Doctors and Lucas Tanner)(the icon of 70's TV) plays Bill Schaffaer the lawyer who helps Kris Kringle prove who he is.This movie also stars Jim Backus(I Married Joan and Thurston Howell III of Gilligan's Island)as Horace Shellhammer. I liked it when Susan called him "Horace Belljammer". Conrad Janis(Mork and Mindy),Tom Bosley(Mr.C of Happy Days),and David Doyle(Bosley of Charlie's Angels)This movie should also set the record straight of a rumor that was going around of Tom Bosley and David Doyle being the same person. There is a scene were you see both actors together at an angle. So that rumor is false.I got this movie taped and watch it every Christmas because it reminds me of the Christmases I grew up with in the 70's.In my opinion,the best version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been many years since I saw either of the most familiar versions of this movie in their entirety. I did see a few minutes of the Edmund Gwenn version while rewinding a tape on Thanksgiving, and a clip from that movie in a TV special, but that's as close as I've come to remembering how good that movie was.There's not much point in comparing this movie to the others for that reason. I'm sure Edmund Gwenn's was better. But I saw this version because so many actors whose names I know appeared in it. Tom Bosley, David Doyle, Jim Backus, James Gregory, and Conrad Janis, to name a few. I enjoyed seeing these people and thought they all did a good job.Sebastian Cabot is familiar to me from the original "Family Affair", but I would never have known him. Giles French was such a curmudgeon, though over the years he probably came to love children. I just don't have a clear memory of that. And yet he just seemed so natural as the Macy's Santa Claus. Could Edmund Gwenn have done any better? Probably. And yet without comparing the two, I can say Sebastian Cabot WAS Kris Kringle. Such a loving, caring man, everything Christmas is supposed to be about. A man who truly cares about children. Yes, he could get angry. But for all the right reasons.The scenes involving the judge and the efforts to have Kris Kringle put away were really well-written. One would never know it was a kids' movie.Suzanne Davidson was so cute. I won't say she did a consistently good job, but she had some really good scenes.I can't remember his name now, but the other Santa Claus in the movie, the young store employee who was taught his craft by Kris, was really likable. Perhaps he could have been worthy of the job of Macy's Santa after some experience.I am aware David Hartman was an actor before "Good Morning America". And yet he came across like the "Good Morning America" co-host deciding to try acting. Still, he had some really good scenes, mostly in the courtroom.I genuinely despised Roddy McDowall's character. I can't even really say whether he did a good job, but the psychiatrist who wants Kris Kringle declared insane just didn't do anything for me, and I wonder if the character could have been written better.It was a real feel-good movie. I'm glad I saw this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If there really was a Santa. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . This version of Miracle on 34th Street would be available on VHS and DVD.This is definitely my most favorite version of the classic tale, and I preferred it even over the classic '47 version with Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood. Being a baby boomer, there's just something right in the world about seeing Mr. French (Sabastian Cabot) as Santa and all the classic 70's actors doing their very best to waylay him in his holiday duties. To top it off, the three other leads, David Hartman especially, brought a special life and energy to the movie that I found lacking in even the original.If and when the makers ever release this on tape or DVD, I'll be one of the first in line for a copy!</fullReview>
