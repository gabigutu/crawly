		<shortDescription>In the Good Cold Summertime...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny that a movie which has 'Summertime" in its title spends most of its duration in the Winter. No matter, this is a charming and quaint musical from MGM. Judy and Van are anonymous pen pals, who also happen to work together, each of them not knowing the other is their mystery 'friend'.It's a little disconcerting watching Judy Garland, as lively as ever, in her second to last MGM musical from the studio's classic period. It's unfortunate she was dropped a couple years later, because even in this minor film, she is wonderful, using her talents to better the story with her cinematic personality and melodic singing. She had a gift for comedy and a talent for drama as well.Van Johnson, in one of his few memorable musical film roles, is good as Judy's counterpart. His role seems more like a character Gene Kelly would have played, a bit of a 'smart Alec'. I think if Kelly were cast instead, there would have been more of a balance in this film, because as it is, much of the singing in this film comes from Judy...she really is the only singer in the whole cast. The songs, themselves, are period pieces which are pleasant enough. Aside from the title tune, there is the "Dreamland" number, which is nice, Judy's rousing "I Don't Care", and her amusing song with the Barbershop Quartet. The other actors in the cast are also good. Buster Keaton has a funny, but modest role as a shop worker, along with Spring Byington and S.Z. "Cuddles" Sakall, as the shop owner.Overall, a pleasant film. Not quite what I would think of as a musical, as the songs are modest filler, not showstoppers. This is not on par with "On the Town" or "The Pirate", but it is enjoyable enough. Good costumes, charming sets, and lovely Technicolor contribute to the look of an antique hand-colored postcard. In that sense, it's something of a curio; amusing, but not quite a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy Garland and Van Johnson are delightful together in this comedic romp!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've got to admit, Judy Garland never looked prettier or acted funnier than she did in this movie. The plot line is simple yet complicated: Boy and girl write to each other. They fall in love. They meet, not knowing that the other is really their pen pal. They hate each other. Boy figures it out. Boy falls for girl. Girl falls for boy. You can only guess the ending. They made a re-make with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, now known as "You've Got Mail." It was one of my favorites and when I found out that Judy Garland was in the second movie based on the story, I had to have it! I'm so glad that I bought it. I love this movie. The songs "I Don't Care" and "Barbershop Chord" are ADORABLE! I suggest that anyone who likes Judy Garland or a good old fashioned movie. Definitely one of her best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given how Judy Garland scored so well in another period piece, Meet Me In St. Louis, it was a natural that she be cast in In The Good Old Summertime even if she was a replacement for June Allyson. It's called serendipity. The film is a musical adaption of MGM's The Shop Around The Corner in which James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan played the anonymous correspondents who love what each other write, but can't stand each other in person. It doesn't help that the two of them are co-workers in a department store.Van Johnson takes the Stewart part in In The Good Old Summertime and early 20th century Budapest is transferred to early 20th century Chicago. Johnson and Garland work in a music store with Spring Byington, Clinton Sundberg, and Buster Keaton and that's owned by S.Z. Sakall. Sakall is far more lovable as he always is than Frank Morgan in the same part in The Shop Around The Corner. A bit thick, but lovable. He does think he has talent on the violin, the same way Jack Benny did on his radio program. He plays it as well as Benny did and even playing it on a Stradivarius doesn't help.Except for one new song, Merry Christmas, the rest of the score is interpolated period favorites like Meet Me Tonight In Dreamland, I Never Knew, I Don't Care and of course the title song. Judy is really in her element doing these numbers. In fact two of the early century's great musical performers, Blanche Ring who introduced In The Good Old Summertime, and Eva Tanguay whose specialty song was I Don't Care, were still alive to see Judy do both of their numbers for the current audience. I've often wondered what they must have thought.Buster Keaton is strangely subdued in this film. He only gets one real comic moment doing a pratfall on a dance floor and breaking a violin in the process. I'm betting some of his material wound up on the cutting room floor.At the very end of the film, little Liza Minnelli all of three at the time made her screen debut. If you like period pieces as I do and the music of the era as I do or if you liked The Shop Around The Corner or the most current adaption of the piece, You've Got Mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, than you will appreciate and enjoy In The Good Old Summertime.If you do like it, that's a very good sign.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a charming, little, easy to watch movie this was.Nothing great, nothing heavy or new but simply just great easy entertainment with great performances from Judy Garland, Van Johnson and Buster Keaton in a small but fun role and apparently also Liza Minnelli in an even smaller, and her first role.The story is simple but charming and effective. It's an early version (but not the earliest) of "You've Got Mail". It's not really a musical, just merely a movie that just happen to have some songs in it. The songs are nothing spectacular like you would expect when you hear the word 'musical'. So, if you don't like musical movies this movie might still be very well worth your time as well.Don't let the year it was made in scare you of. This is a movie that doesn't ever get outdated, mainly thanks to its fun and easy to watch, kind of atmosphere.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conventional, But Beautifully Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story of two co-workers who loathe each other--and then perversely fall in love when they correspond anonymously through a lonelyhearts club--has been filmed three times, first in the 1930s as THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER with stars James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan and most recently in the 1990s as YOU'VE GOT MAIL with stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. This 1940s musical version, which sets the story in an early 1900s Chicago music shop, stars Judy Garland and Van Johnson.Although the score is not in the least memorable, Garland is in fine voice, and although they lack any real chemistry she and Van Johnson play well together. More appealing is a romantic subplot concerning shop owner S.Z. Sakall and his long time ladyfriend Spring Byington, who are extremely charming in their roles and quite a bit of fun to watch. Fans of Buster Keaton will also enjoy seeing him in a small cameo role, and film buffs will be delighted to see Garland's daughter Liza Minnelli make her film debut in the movie's closing moments.Although there is a great deal to enjoy here, the material is highly conventional, and the project would have benefited from a more gifted directorial vision. A quality product with remarkable stars--don't expect too much and you'll enjoy it quite a bit.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly not the greatest of Judy Garland, but it's Judy Garland still.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't go into plot details, as it's been done by so many other reviewers before me. Instead, I'll just share my observations as a fan of classic musicals, and specifically of Judy Garland.Personally, I think it was during 43-46 period when Judy looked and sounded the best. And incidentally, it was also the period when the classic MGM studio system was at the apex of its efficiency in churning out one great musical after another before its demise later in that decade.In Good Old Summertime, one can't help but realize, with much regret, that the greatest period of the good old musical films and of Judy Garland was beginning to wane. And it is noticeable from quality of music scores and from changes in her appearance also.Of course, it's still a very enjoyable movie, especially if you watched one of the other movies based on the same story. And Judy still looks amiable and sounds great even when she had to sing in such self-deprecating manner as in 'I Don't Care', which feels very different from other instances of similar comic approach of her previous films like 'When I Look at You' in Presenting Lily Mars, or 'Couple of Swells' from Easter Parade, for example.Even though the movie is categorized as a musical, it's certainly not Harvey Girls where you can enjoy such trademark MGM scenes, like that big, complex sequence as 'Atchison Topika and the Santa Fe'.Back then, the Freed Unit with so many talented actors and actresses were so efficient that they didn't need too many camera cuts or even extensive rehearsals to create a such captivating 20 min long sequence.In Good Old Summertime, Judy Garland is almost the only person who sings, and there is no 'sequence' to talk of, as most of the numbers are done by her singing solo, except for the Barbershop Quartet and 'I Don't Care' numbers.In general, songs are less memorable than those from her other movies. There's a Christmas song which Judy sings beautifully as usual, though it just isn't on par with 'Have Yourself a Merry Christmas' from Meet Me in St. Louis.Judy still looks attractive, but not more so than in her earlier movies. Her personal troubles in real life begin to take their toll on her appearances by the time she appeared in this movie. Van Johnson is amiable, but he's certainly not her ideal partner in a musical film, as he can't really sing or dance like Mickey Rooney or Gene Kelly.All in all, it's a still very enjoyable movie, but if you are a Judy Garland fan like me, you might want to try her other films first, preferably one from the 43-46 period, if you haven't seen them all already.And when you have already seen most of them, and when you are sure to understand why people keep praising Judy Garland and her movies from her better days even today, then with a preparation of your mind for experiencing some regrets and pangs which might result from seeing her lesser self in a lesser kind of a musical, you are ready to enjoy this movie as a devote Judy Garland's fan.It's something similar to what it requires to enjoy her late year recordings like the famous Carnegie Hall album. It pains to notice how she lost her range and her once impeccable vibrato became one that sounds artificial and forced.But at least, it's Judy Garland and I believe that would suffice to enjoy it for most her ardent fans. As to what seems deficient, they can supplement it by their memories of what she has been in her prime time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Version of the Story Idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This pleasant version of the romance-by-correspondence story is worth seeing for the good cast and for the musical additions. This kind of light story depends heavily on the leads, and they do well here. "The Shop Around the Corner" is still the best version, due in large part to Jimmy Stewart and the rest of a fine cast. The 1990's remake was watchable because of the two sympathetic lead performers, but otherwise its script and direction weighed it down with too much extraneous material. Setting aside comparisons, "In the Good Old Summertime" in itself is enjoyable and is generally well-crafted.This adaptation makes good use of Judy Garland's talents, and she in turn delivers a fine performance. Van Johnson is agreeable, if sometimes a bit bland, as the leading man. The rest of the cast is good as well, and although Buster Keaton does not get a lot to do, it's still great to see him in the cast. The story in itself is fairly thin, but it has a light, good-natured atmosphere and some lively material. The settings are believable, and they go along well with the story. There's easily enough to make "In the Good Old Summertime" worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful musical remake of "The Shop Around the Corner"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First came "The Shop Around the Corner" with James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. Then "In the Good Old Summertime" with Judy Garland and Van Johnson, a musical remake. Then "She Loves Me", the Broadway musical with Barbara Cook and Daniel Massey based on the earlier version. Then "You've Got Mail" with Tom Hanks, which by no means was an original story idea but an update of all three previous versions.MGM must have been in an inspired mood when they made this one, with Judy and Van at their best, both playing off each other with great charm and humor. Judy even gets to warble a few wonderful songs ("I Don't Care", "Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland", "Play That Barbershop Chord") aside from showing her gift for romantic comedy. The delightful supporting players are Spring Byington, S.Z. Sakall, Buster Keaton and Clinton Sundberg.Garland is a music store clerk corresponding with her unseen pen pal (Van Johnson) who also happens to be her boss. The happy ending features Judy's daughter, Liza, taking her first stroll before the cameras at 2 or so.One of those rare remakes that actually improves upon the original and manages to be just as charming with the addition of music. One of Judy's best--a complete delight. Too bad she and Van Johnson weren't teamed more often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pleasant atmosphere and songs fill out this cozy situational period piece. Garland seems at ease and Johnson pulls it off -- they play co-workers who despise each other at work, but are secretly in love as correspondents through the mail. Similar to "Meet Me in St. Louis", without its excellence in story and character, but with much of the same studio-concocted charm. Keaton does a few falls, making the best of his last MGM film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant adaptation of a previous play and film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is assuredly one of the best adaptation/sequels to a major movie ever designed. The original Raphaelson/Lubitsch version, SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, was wonderful, but the idea to change it into a musical (a vehicle for Garland and Johnson), the changes made to do so and the casting are extraordinary. One musical number with Garland and a quartette is dated, but is immediately followed by another with her solo that is a trademark performance (and knowledgeable viewers will marvel, here and in the scene where Garland enters the house to tell her 'aunt' of the disasterious occurence at the restaurant, at how much Garland looks like her daughter, Lisa Minnelli, will look in later years - and Minnelli, 18-months-old, appears here in her screen debut in the final scene as Garland's daughter!). One can count on one hand the number of times that a successful adaptation has been made of a previously successful film, and this one goes to the top of my list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great cast but there wasn't the chemistry or magic of the movie it's based on, The Shop Around The Corner. And somehow, though each of the stars had shone brightly in other movies, they somehow seem uncomfortable in this one and are not seen at their best. It's hard remaking a great film and while they stole some of the lines directly from the first movie, they chose to diverge from the original in ways that watered down the story's effect. Somehow you don't care as much about any of these characters as much as you cared about all of the characters in the original - short of Vadas (whose character is not represented in this film as some others from the original are). Suffers, too, from its being made into a musical - too much the typical Judy Garland film where music doesn't always have a reason to be in a scene...it's just done to play to Judy's talents - not always a good move for a movie's integrity. Here, the plot gets lost in the stereotypical scenes where Judy is supposed to show off her talents. Judy Garland fans will enjoy this film, however, because here she seems truly happy and is at the peak of her singing talents. Perhaps if I weren't such a big fan of the original, I'd have liked this more. But, sorry, I found it a bit boring in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for Judy but the original is superior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quaint would really be the best way to describe this. Mild but colorful reworking of The Shop Around the Corner trades that films exquisite pathos for a sunny tone and loses something in translation but is miles ahead of the travesty that is You've Got Mail. The musical score is full of charming songs from the period socked across by the great Judy although she seems terribly jittery here. Of all her films this is the one where her resemblance to Liza Minnelli is the strongest so it seems fitting that Liza plays her daughter in a bit at the end. As for the rest of the cast, Spring Byington and Cuddles Sakall are cute and well matched in a much more gentle version of the shop keeper and his wife than the original film, but Buster Keaton is almost totally wasted in a small part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary Remake, But Enjoyable on Its Own Terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This affable film is a musical remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 classic "The Shop Around the Corner." Though actually it's not so much a musical as it is a movie with some songs added, nearly all of them performed by Judy Garland, who happens to be the best reason for seeing this movie at all.Lubitsch's film is, of course, perfect in every way and needed no remaking, but if someone had to remake it, they could have done a worse job than this. Garland is delightful in the role originated by Margaret Sullavan, and Van Johnson makes a surprisingly strong stand-in for James Stewart (and even sounds remarkably like him at times). Instead of a curio shop, the action takes place in a music store, which provides more opportunities for spontaneous singing. This film is nowhere near as dark as the original, and one of the best parts of the Lubitsch version, the subplot involving the store's owner, is pretty much written right out of this version.The title doesn't make a lick of sense, since nearly the entire film is set during Christmas. I guess "In the Good Old Wintertime" didn't have the same ring to it.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazslo's Valentine Now Put Back into 1890s America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1940 Ernst Lubitsch had done a film called THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, based on the play PERFUMERIE by Miklos Lazslo. The comedy about two fellow employees in a store who fight all the time, and don't realize that the pen-pal they have grown to love is the same person opposite them became a film classic, and would be the first of many versions. The second version was this 1949 film, which would also be the first musical version (the second was the Broadway musical by Kander and Ebb SHE LOVES ME). Instead of Jimmy Stewart, Margaret Sullivan, Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, and Joseph Schildkraut, this film would have Van Johnson, Judy Garland, S. Z. Sakall, Clinton Sundberg, and Buster Keaton. But there are differences between the two films in setting and plot. Mr. Matuschek is driven into a depression (misdirected at his favorite, Kralek) due to awareness that his wife is having an affair with an employee. Here Sakall plays Mr. Obenkugen, who owns a music store (not a leather goods shop), and who is not married. He is in love with his secretary Nellie (Spring Byington), and plans to marry her. Joseph Schildkraut was the villain in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER as Ferencz Vadas. Buster Keaton is not villainous, but just clumsy. He does fill in as a technical rival to Johnson for Garland, but this is never fully developed in the plot (one wonders if scenes were shot that were cut involving Buster "dating" Judy). Judy also notes that there is another young lady in Johnson's life - Louise Parkson, a gifted violinist (Marcia Van Dyke). No such character is in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.But the basic situations of the former film's plot, and their resolutions, are the same. The flavor of the "gay '90s" is found throughout the film, in the choice of the music used (not only the title song, but such tunes as "I Don't Care!") and in the atmosphere of mid-western America with its barbershop quartets and singing waiters, and it's pretensions to culture (the business with Sakall's prized Stradavarius violin). There is only one final, charming addition at the conclusion that is not in the first film - Margaret Sullivan's daughter did not make a special appearance at the conclusion as her child by Stewart. But Liza Minelli did make her first appearance here as Garland's child by Johnson. It was the only film the mother and daughter ever made together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful musical that's actually better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1940, Ernst Lubitsch directed the excellent film The Shop Around the Corner. Lubitsch is rightfully famous for his wonderful films, but somehow In the Good Old Summertime exceeds the original. This is rather surprising for me to admit, as I generally am not a big fan of musicals. However, the music never dominates the film, the supporting cast is GREAT (Cuddles Sakall, Spring Byington and Buster Keaton) and the mood of the picture is not as depressing and dark as Lubitsch's.The plot is this: Van Johnson has a pen pal with whom he carries on long and philosophical discussions--and eventually, the letters result in him falling head over heels for this mystery woman. Judy Garland stumbles into the music store where Johnson works and is hired by the owner (Sakall). Almost immediately, Garland and Johnson can't stand each other even though unknown to them, they are each other's pen pal! It may sound a little far-fetched, but it somehow manages to work.PS--this was recently made into the less stellar You've Got Mail. I wasn't as enamored with this re-make, as having BOTH characters emotionally and sexually involved with others during their correspondence seemed a little sleazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In order to really appreciate this movie, you must see the first version of this movie which would later be remade as You've Got Mail.

		<shortDescription>Chicago on the Danube</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Judy Garland's next-to-last film at MGM, and in fact, one of her last films; though she lived another 20 years, she made only about 5 more movies, concentrating more on concerts and TV.Unlike many of Judy's earlier MGM pictures, this was not an Arthur Freed production. Joe Pasternak was the producer, and he had a different sensibility. His films were more sentimental as a rule, and often featured classical music. I guess that's why a part was written in for Marcia Van Dyke, a young and beautiful classical violinist who was getting attention at the time (including a Life magazine cover). She's lovely, and an excellent musician. She also seems to have had her entire part overdubbed in post-production (listen carefully and you'll notice it). Whether she herself re-did her own dialogue or another actress was brought in, I don't know.Van Johnson plays the part of the head clerk that was originally played by James Stewart in The Shop Around The Corner (1940). In the earlier film, the character is called "Kralik." In this version (set in turn of the century Chicago, rather than modern Budapest), the character is called "Larkin" - which is almost an anagram of Kralik.Much of the more dramatic or downbeat aspects of the earlier film (a suicide attempt by the shop owner) have been sanitized for this musical. While the relationship of the two clerks (who work together and can't stand each other, not realizing they're also anonymous pen-pals) is basically unchanged, in this version, the relationship of the head clerk and the boss is less compelling because much of the heavier aspects have been lightened or removed.Overall it's a very enjoyable movie, perhaps lightened up a bit too much, plot-wise. In this version, the major concern is that Van Johnson lent his violinist neighbor his boss's Stradivarius, and the boss might find out.The cast, though, is excellent; the leads are perfect and Judy sings some old classics from the time period the film is set. She's a wonderful actress, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Pen pals fall in love on paper and (unwittingly) battle each other at work, with music! Drive-in Rating: Pull over and watch! Absolutely enjoyable and mostly faithful to the original of 1940, now located in Chicago and with the added perk of Judy Garland in song (and dance). For the modern viewer, this may be an easier transition to the original plot than the black and white original, "The Shop Around the Corner." Also recommend considering which star is a bigger draw for you (Judy or Jimmy Stewart). If you've enjoyed "Meet Me in St. Louis," odds are you'll enjoy this, though Meet Me? is far more acclaimed. This version gives you the added benefit of silent movie great Buster Keaton (yes, he talks) and dashing all-American leading man Van Johnson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful musical rendition of 1940's "The Shop Around the Corner," with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.Van Johnson and Judy Garland are delightful here as two employees of Oberkugen's Musical Store, owned by the usually funny S.Z. Sakall. While Sakall is wonderful here, he had far better roles in other 1940 films, better in the sense that he was more comical in his fracturing of the English language.While constantly feuding, Andy and the Garland character don't realize that they love each other-they have been writing each other as pen pals unknowingly for some time.Spring Byington plays Sakall's bookkeeper-secretary, and for over 20 years they've yet to marry.This joyous film allows Garland to show her usual musical talent, and all the cast brings joy in such a caring way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musical remake of "The Shop Around the Corner" is pleasing enough but is no match for the Ernst Lubitch masterpiece starring James Stewart and Maragret Sullavan. Garland is spunky as a woman who dreams of being swept off her feet by her pen pal. Johnson, in the role played by Stewart in the original, does OK as Garland's co-worker in a music shop. Sakall, billed with nickname "Cuddles," is definitely cuddly as the owner of the shop. Keaton's comedic talents are wasted. The subplot involving the Stradivarius and aspiring violinist Van Dyke, which was not in the original, wears thin. The musical numbers are nothing to write home about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the remake of The Little Shop Around the Corner, but you get Van Johnson as a rather nervous romantic, and Judy Garland, breathless as ever, singing some wonderful music. That's a treat.The only spoiler here is, if you have seen You've Got Mail, you already know the ending. But that's the fun of remakes. In any event, the first two are the best. The shop changes, and music is a great studio-driven touch--everyone can sing along.Get all three movies, and you can run them the whole of a major family holiday, if you can get away from football. The first two films are good for all ages, but You've Got Mail is better for the speakeasy crowd when the kinder are in bed. That's too bad, since, except for the iteration of Dad's marriage history, the who's doin' it to whom doesn't really add much, but detracts from the integrity of the two protagonists.Anyway, I sure would like to know which brand of lipstick Mrs. Minelli uses. BTW, that's little Liza in the last scene--the last time she was happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasantly-timed romantic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(May be an implicit spoiler.) A few weeks ago, I caught YOU'VE GOT MAIL on television, and it immediately captured my attention despite the fact that I would never rent such a notorious "chick flick." I considered that movie an inspired piece of romantic comedy, that is until tonight, when I caught this older film, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, on TV as well. The romantic interplay again kept me watching, and kept me wondering if Meg Ryan was really Judy Garland in an earlier life. As it turns out, I was correct in a sense, as both movies were adaptations of an even earlier film. As for what I liked about the film, I appreciated how the male lead in this film, unlike Tom Hanks' character, did not unnecessarily extend the "charade" into a foot-dragging exercise. The sweetness of this timing, as well as the "other woman" subplot more than made up for the somewhat dated musical setting of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judy All the Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The public relations poster for her 1961 Carnegie Hall concert listed her as "The World's Greatest Entertainer."That was quite a claim, but not original--Jolson had already used it years before. Still, Garland walked onto the Carnegie stage at about 8:50 p.m. on April 23 and lived up to her advance p/r. I had the privilege of being present that evening and admit it can rightfully be called one of the all-time great pop concerts.In this early film, "In the Good Old Summertime," Judy shows she's not only a fine singer but also a marvelous comedienne and dramatic actress. On top of her meddle, her work seems effortless, charming and disarming. She's paired here beautifully with Van Johnson and the rest of the cast, mesmerizing the viewer with her naturalism and phenomenal appeal. Her vocal quality is devoid of the more belting style she would later employ, still she demonstrates she can slam the big notes out when they're called for (as in "I Don't Care"). Her rendition of the ballads, "Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland" and "Merry Christmas" are lyrical and smooth, making touching statements. While the script itself turns out to be a bit less that remarkable, it's still a nice adaptation of previously filmed source material. "In the Good Old Summertime" goes down as a great showcase for Judy--one which promises to increase in both appreciation and value as time goes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most interesting character In the Good Old Summertime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say I loved the movie. I've always enjoyed Judy Garland, and I appreciate her comic acting ability as well as her outstanding singing. However, the character I find most interesting is the elderly German store keeper, Mr Oberkugen, who is portrayed as a kindly if somewhat bumbling father figure. In that the movie was made in 1949, 4 years after the end of WWII, I was wondering how it came to be that Germans were transformed from villains to rather benign characters? I dont mean this as criticism but as a question in the sociology of movie making?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun little musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much of a fan of musicals, but In the Good Old Summertime made a rare big screen appearance this evening at Oakland's Paramount Theatre, America's most beautiful art deco movie palace. As it turns out, the film is quite enjoyable: the script is well written and the cast is engaging. The only drawbacks are the less than memorable songs, including one of the worst Christmas ditties you'll ever hear, and the somewhat inappropriate title: most of the story takes place during the winter months! Castwise, Van Johnson and Judy Garland make a marvelous screen couple and Judy does her best with the meagre tunes. The film also benefits from a surprisingly large role for Buster Keaton, who even gets to show off his still unsurpassed physical comedy skills in a few all too brief scenes. This is a typically glossy MGM production and will surely please all fans of the lead actors. If you get a chance to see it in a cinema, note that the print utilized by the Paramount appears to have been newly struck and looks gorgeous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly Subdued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical is adapted from a romantic farce, Shop Around the Corner (1940). Two co- workers in a gift shop snipe at one another, not realizing that they have a romance going via the mail as pen pals.Disappointing entry from that Stradivarius of musical movie-making, MGM. The colors are lush, the costuming plush, but the movie never gels. In my view, there're too many dramatics that tend to crowd out the stranded musical numbers. A number of the latter are familiar favorites, e.g. Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland, et al. Nonetheless, except for Garland's bubbly I Don't Care!, the numbers are oddly subdued in their mounting. Then too, Garland appears rather dour and possibly miscast, lacking her usual infectious spark. My guess is her often troubled personal life may have intruded. Anyway, Johnson is blandly handsome and pleasant, but without lending oomph to the proceedings. Thankfully, the often too cute Cuddles Szakall is more restrained than usual as the grouchy shop owner. Put them together, along with a thoroughly pedestrian screenplay, and the results add up to second-rate MGM. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Music Shop Around the Corner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME (A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Silver Anniversary Picture, 1949), directed by Robert Z. Leonard, is not exactly a beach movie, nor a movie taking place entirely in the good old summertime, but one of the many nostalgic musicals with old-time music commonly produced during the time. Following the formula turn-of-the century pattern made popular by 20th Century-Fox with those starring Alice Faye, Betty Grable or June Haver, this MGM Technicolor release consists of its own studio contract players of Judy Garland and Van Johnson for the first and only time together. The plot, taken from the screenplay by Samson Raphaelson, was, in turn, a remake of MGM's earlier comedy-drama adaptation titled THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (1940) featuring Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart in the Garland and Johnson roles, switching its locale and time frame from contemporary Budapest, Hungary, to turn-of-the century Chicago, Illinois.As the camera captures the modern view of Chicago, it soon shifts back to in old Chicago of the early 1900s with the narration and introduction by Andrew Delby Larkin (Van Johnson). Larkin, a single man living in a boarding house, works as head salesman at $15 a week for Oberkogen Music Company with violin playing Otto Oberkogen (S.Z. Sakall, in a role originated by Frank Morgan in 1940) in charge. Also under his employ are Nellie Burke (Spring Byington), cashier, accountant, secretary and Mr. Oberkogen's love interest for twenty years; Hickey (Buster Keaton), Oberkogen's bumbling nephew; and Rudy Hansen (Clinton Sundberg) the sales clerk. Although very good friends with Louise Parks (Marcia Van Dyke), Andrew really has no steady girlfriend. He does, however, communicate with a female pen-pal he writes to on a regular basis, a girl he has yet to meet. As he comes onto the post office steps to get one of those letters, Andrew bumps into a passerby named Veronica Fisher (Judy Garland). Their introduction followed by a series of unforeseen mishaps finds Andrew giving this young lady his business card where he could be reached to help pay for any damages to her wardrobe. Later in the day, Veronica enters the music store where he works. Rather than coming for the money, she asks Andrew for a job. As he tries to discourage her, she proves herself capable to Mr. Oberkogen after selling a harp to a customer. As a new member of the team, Veronica is well liked by all except Andrew, each unaware the "dear friend" letters they write every evening happens to be to each other.In between the Veronica/Andrew bickering, old-time songs featured include: "In the Good Old Summertime," "Meet Me Tonight in Dream Land," "Put Your Arms Around Me Honey, Hold Me Tight," "Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie," "Play the Barber Shop Chord," "I Don't Care," Violin Concerto; "Merry Christmas" and "In the Good Old Summertime" (reprise/finale). The film's best moments, contributed to Judy Garland's oft singing, are highlighted by her energetic solo effort of "I Don't Care." Though "Merry Christmas" is another good Christmas song Garland introduced to the screen, it's not as famous as her earlier treatment to "Have Yourself a Very Merry Christmas" from MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944).Overall, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME actually belongs to Van Johnson. Introducing himself through off-screen narration for its opening segment, it's somewhat odd that Garland, its full-fledge star, didn't do a similar introduction to herself prior to their hilarious first meeting reminiscent to those great silent film comedy days of Buster Keaton, the one possibly responsible for this great gag material. As in the days of old, Keaton's pratfalls and bumbling character is further evidence how he's still being capable of getting audience attention and laughs all to himself, whether he'd be his humble self or doing his traditional hapless "Buster" character. Aside from the benefit of such likable co-stars as S.Z. Sakall and Spring Byington, there's also Lillian Bronson as Veronica's Aunt Addie; and in smaller roles, Charles Smith ("Dizzy" from Paramount's "Henry Aldrich" film series (1941-1944) as one of the members of the singing quartet; and little Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland's daughter, briefly captured before the film's conclusion.Using the same basic premise of THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, with added songs and straightforward comedy, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, formerly on video cassette, currently on DVD, is good enough entertainment to enjoy not only during the Christmas season whenever shown on Turner Classic Movies, but anytime of the year.

		<fullReview>Musical remake of the classic The Shop Around the Corner. The story, about two bickering co-workers (Van Johnson, Judy Garland) who fall in love through anonymous letters to one another, is transplanted to turn of the century America. It also has a much lighter tone, more suited for a musical I suppose but also loses some of what made the original such a great film. Nice cast full of likable actors. The songs are okay. It's enjoyable enough but there just seems to be something missing. Maybe if I had seen this one before the 1940 film I would have preferred this. Doubtful, but maybe. Liza Minnelli makes her screen debut at age 3 in the final shot of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cuddles almost steals this entertaining little Christmasy musical comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another of the many 'minor' musicals of the '40s and '50s with a nostalgic theme: this time scripted as being in turn of the century Chicago. Unlike many, there's no pretense of remembering a specific notable composer or performer. Unlike many, neither of the lead characters is scripted as being a professional musical performer, composer or director. Rather, they work in a sizable music store, selling instruments and sheet music. Inimical 'Cuddles' Sakall, as the elderly owner(Otto Oberkugen) is his usual irascible self, with thick Hungarian -derived accent. Notable motherly stage, film and TV character actor Spring Byrington plays Nellie, Otto's perennial secretary, girlfriend and sometimes alter ego. Clinton Sundberg and Buster Keaton play rather anonymous salesmen. Sundberg was typecast playing minor characters. I remember him as the bartender in "Easter Parade", and the extraordinarily formal butler in "The Girl Next Door". Buster wasn't originally planned to be in the film, as he was employed by MGM as a gag deviser and occasional director of gags. However, none of the other appropriate actors could do a convincing pratfall that apparently destroys Otto's cherished Stradivarius violin. Thus, he was included so that he could do this scene. Also, apparently he devised and directed the hilarious slapstick initial encounter of Van Johnson's and Judy's characters. Judy was used to doing slapstick while in her family vaudeville acts, refreshed in "The Pirate" the year before. But, Van was a light comedian, along with a passable singer, dancer and dramatic actor. Like Jimmy Stewart, he was tall and thin, with boyish good looks, and popular with audiences. Thus, he was a rather good replacement for Stewart, who costarred in "The Shop around the Corner", upon which this musical version is based. He had also costarred with June Allyson in a musical. June was slated to costar in this film, until a pregnancy induced a last minute substitution with Judy. Thus, the musical numbers weren't really selected with Judy in mind.Marcia Van Dyke, as Judy's apparent rival for Van's matrimonial ambitions, was an actual professional violinist and occasional actress. If I were Van's character(Mr. Larkin), I'd probably have chosen her character(Louise) over the temperamental manic/depressive Veronica(Judy). She appears to be from a wealthy family, whereas Veronica appears to be a struggling music-knowledgeable shopgirl, insecure in her worth as a romantic partner, hence resorting to corresponding with an unseen male pen pal, not even giving out her name!Although the setting for most of the film clearly is in winter, close to Christmas, the title does make sense in that the title song is sung near the beginning and again at the end, when the setting clearly is in the warm season. Judy does sing one Christmasy song: "Merry Christmas". Unfortunately, her character is upset then, resulting in a very somber rendition. While the melody is undistinguished, the lyrics are quite good. In addition to the title song, the well known period songs by brothers Harry or Albert von Tilzer: "Put Your Arms Around Me", and "Wait 'Till the Sun Shines, Nellie" are featured: the latter sung by a somewhat comical barbershop quartet, who also accompany Judy in "Play that Barbershop Chord". Judy previously sang the period lullaby-like waltz "Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland". Judy's biggest production number is to the exuberant period "I Don't Care", as part of the festivities relating to the party put on by Otto and Nellie to announce their long-anticipated engagement. Actually, all these 'period' songs were composed in the first decade of the 20th century, rather than in the '90s. Unfortunately, Mr. Larkin(Van) is characterized as having no singing talent, hence he doesn't sing nor dance. There is no real dance production. The drama reaches a peak in the last portion, when Otto insists on playing his Stradivarius violin at his engagement party. Poor Nellie doesn't want to be embarrassed by his less than stellar talent, hence pleads with Larkin to find an excuse why his violin can't be there. Larkin decides to exchange violins with Louise's, hence giving Louise a better chance to win in the contest that same evening. Larkin shuffles back and forth between the engagement party and violin competition. Keaton accidentally smashes Louise's violin trying to give it to Otto, believing it to be the Stradivarius. Otto, Nellie and Veronica(Judy) rush over to the violin competition to retrieve Otto's Stradivarius, but are mesmerized by Louise's performance. Veronica sees an apparent romantic relationship between Larkin and Louise, and is fearful. Initially, Otto fires Larkin, but then makes him store manager, and gives Louise the Stradivarius. Veronica decides to quit the store so she won't have to see Larkin anymore, and concentrate on trying to land her anonymous pen pal. Larkin says he has met her pen pal and gives a very unfavorable description, upsetting Veronica, before revealing that it is him. Veronica now is pleased.The love/hate relationship between Larkin and Veronica, with an alternative beau as the apparent favorite though most of the film, was a very common screenplay plot in musicals of this era. This may be disturbing to some viewers, but no doubt somewhat reflects the history of a minority of actual marriages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technicolor Remake Of Shop Is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the color version of Shop Around The Corner black &amp; white which featured Jimmy Stewart. The differences are a mature Judy Garland, a decent performance from Van Johnson, and more. The film is well directed including some direction by stone face Buster Keaton.Actually this is one of Van Johnson's better screen performances. This might be thanks to Keaton who was at that time teaching Lucille Ball comedy too. Johnson is actually pretty good here. So is Judy Garland as she shines in her musical numbers. I only wish more newer numbers were written for this picture as some of the older ones while well done seem worn by the late 1940's.Still, it is so rare and so exciting to see Judy in prime time color. The story does get a little confused though as even though her and Van Johnson are in love by letter, the sparks between them never really seem to hit the screen in a physical way that well.Van Johnson would continue his association with Keaton &amp; Lucy including getting into television as early as 1957 because of Lucy while the other, Van Heflin, turned down being Elliot Ness on the Untouchables. Johnson ran up quite a string of television credits before retiring. Seeing the work of Johnson in this film shows he did take some advice from Keaton as this is his best comedy performance on film. Good thing his wife wasn't on the set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In the Good Old Summertime" is a remake of the 1940 film "The Shop Around the Corner": this time, with music and with Van Johnson in the James Stewart role and Judy Garland in the Margaret Sullavan role. In the shop where both work, the owner (Frank Morgan in the original) is Cuddles Sakall, as irritating as ever, and there is a tiny role for the great Buster Keaton.Any musical featuring Garland is always worth watching, and although this is minor compared to some of her other works, and does not have any great powerhouse musical numbers, she is in excellent voice and looks great. Van Johnson is a personable leading man (although a fellow singer would have been better) and the story crackles along in a way that does not disgrace itself or the Lubitsch original.</fullReview>

MGM product with decidedly less gloss and panache than usual. The leads do all right, supporting cast (including S.Z.

Liza Minnelli makes her screen debut here...as the dark-eyed, ruby-lipped toddler in the final scene.

If you recall, Meg and Tom are exchanging e-mails in a chat room, have no idea of whom each one is and why go on when that good picture speaks for itself? So now in "ITGOS" we have Van Johnson and Judy Garland owning P.O.Boxes and they're writing romatic stuff to each other and going ga-ga over the contents of each missive yet "hating" each other as they work together in a music store owned by S.Z. Sakall .... Otto Oberkugen, whom, when annoyed, grabs his Stradivarius fiddle and creates music worse than when Jack Benny killed the notes of "Love in Bloom." Now all this may sound sophomoric, silly and a waste of time but alas..you're wrong because "ITGOS" is a REALLY CUTE FLICK..highly entertaining, lilting, charming and well worth the time spent watching. Oh by the way, in the very last scene, who shows up. You'll never guess. Ready? Three year old Liza Minelli. That's Liza with a "Z."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided attempt to remake The Shop Around The Corner - still, a Garland stand-out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In The Good Old Summertime" is a musical remake of "The Shop Around The Corner" (also available from Warner and the preferred version of this movie). In place of the obviously poignant and tender chemistry that James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan brought to the original we are given shrill ineptitude, a la the usually brilliant Judy Garland and mean spirited inclinations via the embittered Van Johnson. Really, I can't see how anyone would believe Garland and Johnson could be in love, much less have a child, by the final fade out. (Film trivia: the child in the last shot of this film is Liza Minnelli.) The remake, while short on the sprite gaiety of the original, nevertheless has its moments. Garland ? although wrong for the part, is nevertheless in good voice and her songs sparkle with a vintage and professionalism that only a great artist like she could make of them in an otherwise uninspired production. In the supporting cast we have one of the cinema's great joys to watch ? S.Z. Sakall, as the portly, easily flustered Mr. Oberkugen ? proprietor of the music shop where both Johnson and Garland work and spar. Buster Keaton is wasted in his role.THE TRANSFER: Warner gives us a very clean looking DVD. Colors are somewhat dated and in spots faded, but overall the Technicolor is rich and vibrant. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Black levels are solid. Contrast levels tend to be just a bit too low for a picture that doesn't quite deliver as much visual punch as it should. There are no digital anomalies. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.BOTTOM LINE: This is another film that die hard Garland fans will snatch up quickly. But one wonders why Warner chose "In The Good Old Summertime" over say, "Summer Stock" or any of the Mickey Rooney/Garland vehicles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first thought was how refreshing it is to see Judy Garland playing a feisty girl with witty lines. Usually her characters are more about the look in those huge emotional eyes - but she actually has lines.I was completely struck dumb, though, when one scene was right out of You've Got Mail, Nora Ephron's follow-up to Sleepless in Seattle. Obviously, this came first, so Nora must have lifted a page from this book - much as she based Sleepless on An Affair to Remember.All in all - I prefer this version to YGM. It's much more common for the male lead in old movies to have a laugh at the expense of the female lead and it works much better in the period. But maybe that's not fair to Nora...casting played a big part in why I didn't love YGM. Tom Hanks just doesn't do jerk well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the TCM library as this would explain him extolling the 'virtues' of this "charming" film during his introduction when I saw this on cable TV. Seeing as any old film on IMDb receives 'classic' status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers, I thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film.This is not your father's 'Shop Around the Corner'. For all my quibbles with 'You've Got Mail', it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable. For those who have seen the original, the flaws will only be all the more obvious.From one of the lamest Meet Cute sequences I can recall seeing (a sad slapstick attempt at 'humor'), this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step. This 'musical' only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term. There are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there's Judy singing "I Don't Care" while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure. The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here. Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of musical films, but here she seems horribly miscast. The role was originally to have been filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavan's old part. Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate Jimmy Stewart type. The leads never achieve the chemistry of Stewart/Sullavan or even that of Hanks/Ryan.This is a film that knows (some of) the notes, but not the music. It doesn't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for Van Johnson's character to complicate things unnecessarily. The remake's substitution for the original's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin. It is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of Three's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flux capacitor. It's really just an excuse for a Keaton pratfall. Even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled. After seeing both films, you'll understand why they called it 'the Lubitsch Touch' and NOT the 'Robert Z. Leonard Touch'.Avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of Judy Garland's earlier films unless you're an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly in the wintertime, and not so good, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Van Johnson and Judy Garland play feuding co-workers who have unwittingly been carrying on a romance through the Postal Service. Johnson steals bits from well-known writers to include in his letters, which seems appropriate since so much of the dialogue was lifted word-for-word from The Shop Around the Corner, the earlier film from which this was remade.They did make a few changes from the original: they shot it in Technicolor and set the story in a music shop so that Garland would have an excuse to sing. (Fair warning: while this movie is often billed as a musical, the songs are few and far between compared to what you would normally expect for that category.) The lavish color, musical numbers, and even the addition of a baby in one scene (and young Liza Minelli in another) do not make up for the charm that was taken out compared to the original.How does this remake fail? Johnson is a bit too caddish and not as likable as Shop's James Stewart. Likewise, Judy Garland match the performance of Margaret Sullavan, who struck a perfect balance between a brash defender of the man with whom she has been corresponding and a sensitive, vulnerable woman seeking romantic love. As a pair, Johnson and Garland lack the chemistry of Stewart and Sullavan, and director Robert Z. Leonard cannot supply the scenes with the naturalism or charm that Ernst Lubitsch provided.Had I not seen The Shop Around the Corner (and in fact I re-viewed it just prior to watching In the Good Old Summertime), Summertime's shortcomings might have been less noticeable, but I cannot ignore the huge difference between the the two films and have rated and reviewed this film accordingly. If you have a choice, I would urge that you take a pass on Summertime and watch the original instead. If you are one of those people who just can't stand watching black &amp; white movies (and oh, what you are missing if you are!), opt for the later remake, You've Got Mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. They kept the color, tossed out the songs, and brought back much of the charm and chemistry that made the original a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the formula, not the execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As has been noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as "You've Got Mail", with Tom Hanks and Meg"Trout Pout" Ryan. Of the several versions, this is my least favorite. The problem i think is that the studio coasted on the Stars charisma, which doesn't quite cut it here.The chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts, pleasant but bland. And when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell, all hunched up and everything. I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot about. I would have made a bee line for that cute violin player. And Van wasn't great either. I've always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here.If you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900's then you might like this movie. But there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection.</fullReview>
