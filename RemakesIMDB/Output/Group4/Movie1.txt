		<shortDescription>Not a bad little effort from the 60's actually.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Thousand Maniacs! is set in the small southern town of Pleasant Valley which has a population of 2000, two cars are lured there via a fake detour. First up is a car with two couples, John (Jerome Eden) &amp; his wife Bea Miller (Shelby Livingston) along with David (Michael Korb) &amp; his wife Beverly Wells (Yvonne Gilbert, whom director Lewis married in 1975...) closely followed by a car with a young woman named Terry Adams (Connie Mason) &amp; a hitchhiking teacher she picked up Tom White (William Kerwin). They are all greeted by the townsfolk &amp; Mayor Buckman (Jeffrey Allen) insists all six stay for the towns 100 centennial celebrations as guests of honour although what they are celebrating exactly the locals seem reluctant to admit. The six strangers quickly discover that the townspeople are taking a bloody revenge for past atrocities committed against them...Photographed, written &amp; directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis who has become known as the 'Godfather of Gore' this was the second in his so-called Blood Trilogy following Blood Feast (1963) &amp; followed by Color Me Blood Red (1965) &amp; is a neat enough little exploitation gore film that has a reasonable story behind it. The script moves along at a nice enough pace, it's populated by over-the-top character's &amp; gore although I think the twist ending goes on for too long &amp; could have been edited down to be a bit punchier &amp; dramatic. The basic story here is pretty good, it show's a bit of imagination especially during the set-piece gore scenes &amp; I especially liked the barrel with nails hammered inside which is then rolled down a hill with someone inside, ouch! This is a surprisingly good effort on what was probably intended to be no more than a quick cheap gore film to capitalise on the huge success of Lewis' seminal Blood Feast which is widely regarded as the very first gore film ever made. I liked it.Director Lewis has a decent imagination &amp; is good at getting the most out of what must have been tiny budgets (apparently he did the voice over on the trailers for his films because he didn't want to pay anyone) but he really can't direct at all, his films look dull &amp; are very poorly staged. Here for instance look at the reactions of the victims as they appear to be in mortal danger, none of them put up any sort of fight or struggle &amp; almost seem willing to let their tormentors kill them, he just can't direct actor's &amp; Two Thousand Maniacs! is a good case in point. There's some good gore here although tame by todays standards, someone has her thumb cut off &amp; then her arm chopped off with an axe, someone is drawn &amp; quarter having had his arms &amp; legs tied to four separate horse, someone is rolled down a hill in a barrel full of nails which ends in very bloody results at the bottom &amp; someone is squished with a huge boulder. The special effects aren't too bad either although the blood looks a bit bright. The IMDb lists 'Severed Tongue' as a Plot Keyword but there is no tongue severing in Two Thousand Maniacs! &amp; probably refers to his earlier film Blood Feast which does.With a supposed budget of about $65,000 only Two Thousand Maniacs! didn't turn out too bad but it's hardly any work of art &amp; the sound is absolutely terrible. It's sometimes hard to understand what character's are saying as their voices 'echo' on location, there are constant pops &amp; crackles in the soundtrack &amp; the sound effect of those cars at the start sound nothing like cars at all, I have to admit I thought the opening theme was annoyingly catchy. The acting is truly terrible, I'm sorry but there's no other word to describe it.Two Thousand Maniacs! is a neat enough exploitative gore film from the 60's with a slightly better story than you would perhaps expect, if that sounds like a film you might like then by all means check it out, if it doesn't then don't. Remade as 2001 Maniacs (2005) which I haven't had the 'pleasure' of seeing yet...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Two Thousand Maniacs" is a wonderful Brigadoon-esque film about two groups of Yankees who become guests of honors for the southern town of Pleasant Valley's centennial. What these "guests" don't realize, though, is that they are going to be murdered in bizarre (and I mean, BIZARRE) fashions because of a war lost by the south 100 years ago.The festivities include a woman being dismembered and barbecued, a man being quartered with four horses, and the infamous "barrel roll" sequence where a man is pushed down a hill in a barrel that has nails driven into its sides.The movie altogether has a wacky, feel-good charm (despite its gruesome nature) that keeps you smiling, and you'll surely be singing its theme song after the movie's over! I sure as hell was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually not completely inept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2000 Maniacs" is actually not completely inept. Sure, its not a masterpiece, but compared to its predecessor "Blood Feast", its "Citizen Kane". First off, its obvious H.G. Lewis had improved as a director. The pacing is still rather slow but it moves much quicker than any of his other films. Also, this was the first time his trademark dark humor came into play. Possibly realizing how unintentionally hilarious his previous film was, he added loads of humor of the gallows variety. The premise is actually quite creepy and clever and the twist ending will be a riot to those who get the reference. The gore, while unrealistic and obviously fake, actually becomes disturbing at moments. Plus, there are some brief instances where Lewis comes close to suspense (particularly Tom and Terry's escape).However to be expected, "2000 Maniacs" features a lot of the bad movie goodies we've come to expect from Lewis. While they aren't nearly as bad as they were in "Blood Feast", both William Kerwin and Connie Mason are still pretty wooden. There are plot holes galore (namely where does the town get all those modern appliances so quickly). The supporting cast is all over-the-top. This is a very politically incorrect film, and while some may take offense to the worst stereotypes of the south imaginable, others will find it amusing. And while "Blood Feast" had one memorable psycho, "2000 Maniacs" has three (the Mayor, Lester, Rufus).There is one thing that prevents "2000 Maniacs" from being an absolute classic however. Namely, H.G. Lewis seems rather restrained from showing us the gore. Not to sound like a sadist or anything, but after the bucket loads of over-the-top bloodshed in his previous film, the graphic murders only take up a small amount of screen time. Lewis' reputation comes from being the "Godfather of Gore", so those interested in this aspect are advised to check out "Blood Feast" or "The Gore Gore Girls" instead. Still, for all its technical shortcomings, "2000 Maniacs" is a surprisingly clever drive-in flick. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1963, Herschell Gordon Lewis and David Friedman released the first "gore" film ever made into theatres: BLOOD FEAST. The movies shocking violence and gore effects attracted people from all over, and the movie was a huge success. Needless to say, Lewis and Friedman were both anxious to make the next movie, but in order to keep the audiences attention and interest, they wanted to make the next one a better movie, and of course, make it "gorier." They succeeded.Two Thousand Maniacs begins with a group of so called "Yankees" who, while driving across the state, end up in a small hick town with only two thousand citizens. The hillbilly and somewhat hyper citizens of this small town congratulate the Yankees, saying that they have been chosen as the special guests of a big event that is taking place in the town. The Yankees get set up in free hotel rooms, and are promised free meals. Little do they know, they are in a town which consists of Two Thousand Maniacs who are blood thirst and have plans to kill them all just for the fun of it.Unlike "Blood Feast," the violence factor in Two Thousand Maniacs takes a little while to kick in. However, when the gore does hit, it is quite a bit heavier then the violence in the previous film. There is no way that anyone could say that this film is "Extremely Gory" when comparing it to movies that have come out since, but it is without a doubt the most shocking and graphic film of it's time. Now only that, but the brilliant screenplay that was written by Herschell Gordon Lewis has many creative and well-thought death scenes in it.This movie doesn't try to take itself quite as serious as "Blood Feast" did, which makes it more enjoyable to watch. The beautiful Connie Mason returns now obviously playing a different character, and her acting skills seem to have improved. Another "Blood Feast" star who came back to star in the second gore film is the very talented William Kerwin aka Thomas Wood. Fans of "Blood Feast" should enjoy seeing the two of them on screen once again.Another person, whose skills seem to have improved from Blood Feast to Two Thousand Maniacs, is Herschell Gordon Lewis himself. I am a big fan of Blood Feast, but when watching it, there are obvious flaws in the direction. But with this film, HGL proved that he was indeed a great filmmaker, and that obvious talent traveled into his future films as well. While Two Thousand Maniacs wasn't as successful as Blood Feast, it still brought in enough money for HGL to direct many more afterwards.This is Herschell Gordon Lewis' favorite film out of all of his OLD movies, and mine as well, all though it is my personal opinion that his film BLOOD FEAST 2: ALL YOU CAN EAT, which he made in the early 2000s, was better then any of his older films.Recommended to any and all horror fans. Get the junk food and the popcorn out, sit back, and enjoy this great cult classic. You're in for a treat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious and bloodthirsty - a great cult film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Thousand Maniacs is not a film that is on every horror fan's list of best films - but it should be, as when it comes to ingenuity and influence, this film certainly isn't lacking! Two Thousand Maniacs is my first taste of 'the godfather of gore', Herschell Gordon Lewis, and I already want to see more! Given his title, you would expect this film to be gory - and while the gore is rather tame by today's standards, considering that it was released in 1964 - three years before violence was brought to cinema with Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde - it's amazing that Lewis was able to get away with scenes that see a man pulled apart by horses, a woman crushed by a rock and other such highlights. And it's not only the gore that makes this film noteworthy - the plot takes influence from films such as 'Bad Day at Black Rock', in that it follows a small town with a secret - only this time that plot has got itself a horror makeover! We watch as two cars full of people are detoured towards a town hidden deep in the American South. They are told that they are to be the guests of honour in a town celebration. However, they quickly find out that being a guest isn't always honourable...One of the main reasons I loved this film is because it's absolutely hilarious! Lewis sets the film up with a jokey tone from the beginning and keeps it going throughout. It's things such as the scene after the one that sees a woman have her finger cut off that makes this film so great. We cut to a sequence involving the screaming woman, along with the perpetrator, and the town's major - laughing their heads off! The film is also quite frightening. Insanity has been seen in cinema more times than anyone could count, but Lewis delivers it differently; it's not the fact that these two thousand people are mental that's scary - it's the fact that there's so many of them! The American Deep South is a popular destination for films of this ilk - and Lewis does a great job of making sure that we know where the action is taking place. Redneck flags fly, country music plays and the accents are great; and all of this seems to fit the action brilliantly. On the whole, this might not be the best produced horror film ever made; but it's an important one, and a film that anyone who enjoys bizarre cult classics should definitely seek out! Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>H.G. Lewis' masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was in 1963 when director Herschell Gordon Lewis and producer David F. Friedman decided to leave the production of nudist films and opted for making horror movies. In those years, independent cinema was on the rise and the two filmmakers took advantage of being out of the studio system to push the envelope further and give their audiences more in terms of violence and sexuality. With the release of "Blood Feast", Lewis and Friedman introduced graphic gore to American horror and inaugurated the "splatter" sub-genre, beginning a new style of horror that would become a staple of the drive-in theater market. While honestly "Blood Feast" wasn't really a well done film, it was only the beginning for Lewis, as 1964's "Two Thousand Maniacs!", Lewis' next venture in the horror genre, proved that there was real talent in the savvy businessman.In "Two Thousand Maniacs!", Tom White (William Kerwin) and Terry Adams (Connie Mason) are traveling through the American south heading to Atlanta when suddenly they are lured into the small town of Pleasant Ville by the citizens, who want them to be the guests of honor in the celebration of the centennial of an important event in the history of their town. In Pleasant Ville, they find another two young couples who were also lured by the villagers, the Millers (Jerome Eden and Shelby Livingston) and the Wells (Michael Korb and Yvonne Gilbert). Together, the six guests are invited to participate in the town's festivities without any information about what exactly is the town celebrating, however, they find themselves seduced by the charm of the southern townspeople. But they don't know that as guests of honor, they'll become the victims of a town made up of two thousand maniacs.As usual, the film's plot was conceived by H.G. Lewis, but this time he was also responsible of the screenplay, making "Two Thousand Maniacs!" probably a more personal job. As a writer, Lewis has certainly improved after his previous movie, as not only "Two Thousand Maniacs!" has a truly interesting and fascinating concept at its core, the whole development of the story is actually remarkable, with Lewis genuinely playing with suspense in a honest attempt to deliver something more than scenes of violence. Once again, Lewis adds a good healthy dose of his trademark style of black humor to the plot, which works perfectly when contrasted with the demented nature of the characters, and successfully plays with the typical southern stereotypes and the idea of the clash between urban society and rural society. Of course, everything is done in that campy over-the-top tone that makes the story extremely funny despite its macabre themes.It seems that filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis not only improved his skills as a writer this time, as his work as a director is also considerably superior to what he did in "Blood Feast" too. While the movie is still done on a extremely low-budget and doesn't really have the most realistic effects in the world, Lewis manages to make everything work nicely by keeping the film moving at a fast pace as he balances comedy and horror with great skill. Using a raw style of cinematography due to budgetary reasons actually helps the film, as it gives it a gritty look that adds to the film's "southern charm". One thing that really stands out in the film is the way Lewis handled his actors this time, as while it is obvious that few of them are professionals, Lewis gets good performances out of them by keeping a lighthearted tone through the film and never taking the movie too seriously.As written above, the cast delivers good performances considering their apparent lack of experience, as while obviously playing caricatures and stereotypes, they all seem to have good fun with it and that ultimately makes the movie look better. Lewis' regular collaborators William Kerwin and Connie Mason appear as the film's main characters, and both make good a job in their role. Kerwin always was the most talented of Lewis' troupe, and once again his talent gets shown. After her awful performance in "Blood Feast", it was good to see Mason improving her acting a bit in the film, giving a performance that if not good it's at least better than her last one. As the main "villians" we find Jeffrey Allen playing the mayor and Ben Moore and Gary Bakeman as his trusted henchmen; the three making the best of their comedic roles as the leaders of a town full of sociopath rednecks.As a result of being made with an extremely low budget, "Two Thousand Maniacs!" has a lot of problems in terms of visual look and special effects. What I mean is that the movie looks certainly cheap and unrealistic as the production values weren't exactly high. However, those apparent "flaws" can be easily ignored as Lewsis manages to used them for the film's benefit, as the grittiness of the film adds lot of charm to the movie, fitting nicely in the campy tone Lewis uses in the movie. While "Two Thousand Maniacs!" is not exactly a scary movie in the typical way (it's more black comedy), there is a certain touch of malice that helps to make some scenes really suspenseful, that together with the grittiness of the cinematography makes the movie feel almost like a direct predecessor of 70s classics like "The Texas Chain saw Massacre" and "The Wicker Man".Maybe due to Lewis reputation as maker of low-budget films, "Two Thousand Maniacs!" doesn't get the respect it really deserves, as this is truly an excellent movie that mixes horror and comedy in a perfect way. Like "Blood Feast", this movie would create the bloody path that future horror filmmakers would follow in terms of gory imagery. While often considered more a businessman than a filmmaker, "Two Thousand Maniacs!" proves that there was real talent in the hands of director H.G. Lewis, the Godfather of Gore! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Early Splatterfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Thousand Maniacs! is the second installment in the sleazy classic "Blood Trilogy" by Herschell Gordon Lewis. It is a superb film and very important to the gore genre. This early splatter fest features enough carnage(and very realistic-looking blood for its time) to compete with any of today's modern gross-outs.The premise is simple enough. Travelers are lured to a small southern town full of blood-thirsty Confederates seeking revenge on Yankees upon the centennial of the end of the Civil War. Fooled into thinking that they are the guests of honor at the town's centennial celebration, the travelers soon find themselves in the middle of barbaric blood rituals with seemingly no means of escape.While the acting is a little sub-par and exaggerated at times, it does not detract from the film but, rather, adds to the sleaze factor. The action slows down a little toward the end, however, the ultimate conclusion is unique and quite chilling. Overall, Two Thousand Maniacs! is a very worthy watch and a great addition to any gore hound's collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie while in the Army. It was part of a blood triple header at a drive-in while stationed in Virginia. Blood Feast, 2000 Maniacs and another movie I forgot the name were on the bill. I can still remember the ways the characters were killed and all the themes from a State Fair that were used. But my favorite was when they cut the girls thumb off and then they fixed it by chopping her arm off. Then later that night by the campfire while they cooked the arm. They sang "I'm rolling my sweet baby's arm." How can you not like this movie it is almost like a must before seeing Kill Bill part 2. Just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HG Lewis' best film. A classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TWO THOUSAND MANIACS is HG Lewis' best film, or most complete film. Unlike so many of Lewis' films, TTM actually has characters, you either care for or dislike. There's some suspense. There's actually a beginning, a middle and an end to it. The story's concept is brilliant and inspired, even if its execution is a tad lacking. And the violence is actually disturbing and important to the story. There are the usual HG Lewis touches in TTM, like bad acting and static film-making but the whole product is so well made that, in the end, the typically HG Lewis weaknesses don't harm the film.There is one big mistake in the story: the town looks modern and the people of Pleasant Valley act like modern folks and are dressed in 1960s clothes. The town should have looked like a town from around 1860s, and the people should have looked and acted like folks from that period. It would have been even more fantastic and creepy. But they probably didn't have the money to recreate such an elaborate setting so I understand why everything looks like the 1960s in Pleasant Valley. The plus side of this mistake: the juxtaposition of 1960s sunny retro quaintness with extreme gory violence actually adds a lot to the film's unique quality.I love TWO THOUSAND MANIACS. It's a cool flick and it's a classic horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second part of the blood trilogy that began with Blood Feast.This one is considerably more professional than the first. But it still as its short comings. Acting is variable. And the plot is weak and does not make a lot of sense. The gore scenes (which is probably the reason why you are watching) are great. And even quite brutal, although the film is too camp to take too seriously. The music is also great and very fitting.It does suffer from two annoying things however. The annoying little boy for one. But I do think they knew how annoying he was, because at the end even the villagers don't want him back. The other thing is how long the film takes to end. Its got more endings than Spielberg film.Still its pretty good and worth it if you like gore films...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decided to watch this film, but I really was not very sure if I was going to enjoy this flick with unknown actors, but as I started to view this film I became very interested. A young couple gets themselves involved with a town where strange things start to happen to people. The town's folks remember the Civil War days when their town was destroyed by the Yankee's up North and it seems this town celebrates this event by having Yankee guests participate in some games of chance for both men and women. These games of chance will greatly surprise you and you just will not believe just what is going on until it actually happens. There is one scene when a man gets into a barrel and rolls down a hill which becomes very tragic. This is a rather short film, but great to view on Halloween night, or anytime you find it showing on TCM. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bloodshed with a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director and writer, Herschell Gordon Lewis, has mentioned this film as his favorite and you can see why. It is by far the best acted of all his movies and undoubtedly the one with the most production value. Six Yankees are lured into a small Southern town for a Centennial celebration where the townsfolk proceed to kill them one by one as revenge for the town's destruction during the Civil War. The death scenes include a man being pulled apart by four horses and a sexy blonde having her arm chopped off and then barbecued. The effect of the arm being hacked off is a bit weak but the other killings look much better. There's even a bit of suspense as one of the few remaining Yankees plans his escape with the help of a good Samaritan played by Connie Mason. The cast is good with the exception of one or two of the smaller roles. The biggest stand out is Jeffrey Allen as the Mayor with a very colorful performance. A fun watch for people who like their bloodshed with an actual story behind it. Good Stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morbid, Maniacal and Absolutely Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis gave birth to the gore film with his 1963 milestone "Blood Feast" (1963). While "Blood Feast" was influential beyond comparison, it is also a totally camp and deliberately silly flick. Lewis' second gore film, "Two Thousand Maniacs!" of 1964, is about equally gory, and a lot better, as is also successful in creating a certain atmosphere of creepiness and has an absolutely awesome sense of black humor. A bunch of people from the north get stuck in a Deep Southern hicks-ville named 'Pleasant Valley', where they are to be 'guests of honor' of a centennial celebration. What they don't know is that the 2000 redneck inhabitants of Pleasantville are maniacal killers who plan to brutally murder their guests of honor in retribution for a Civil War massacre by Union troops. The cast members include the ravishing playmate Connie Mason, and William Kerwin, who also played the investigating cop in "Blood Feast". The people who play the murderous rednecks may not be great actors, but they fit very well in their funny and macabre roles. "Two Thousand Maniacs" is a highly influential film, not only as one of the first gore/splatter films, but also as one of the earliest Hillbilly-Horror/Hicksploitation films ever, and an early example for the 'village with a secret' theme in Horror films. The film is highly entertaining, very morbid and macabre, and darkly hilarious from start to finish. The gore is very bloody (and often very funny), and most of the murders are committed with help of grotesque killing-devices. H.G. Lewis is reported to like this film best among his own, and one can see why: "Two Thousand Maniacs" is an awesome little flick that no lover of the Horror genre can afford to miss! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I was stunned by the predictability of the plot and the low production values, the cheesy acting and the grinding ominous organ music that lets up, but Two Thousand Maniacs! somehow managed to hold my attention right until the credits. Maybe I watched it for the same base reason that one watches "Cops" or "The Worst Carnages -- Of The Universe!!!", or maybe director Herschell Gordon Lewis has a knack for keeping the attention up juuuuuust enough, but this movie ain't all bad. Most of it is, though: the acting is at best hammy, or clearly nonexistent. The dames have wrinkles and fat arses. The oldest one is of course murdered first because she's a slag -- just to make sure this movie doesn't even earn a Brownie point for political progressiveness. The Southron stereotypes are difficult to bear even for the most biased of Yanks. And yet: this movie never bored me.This is the movie that "Manos -- Hands Of Fate" was trying to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis' "Two Thousand Maniacs" is a classic horror/snuff film, the best bad movie in the psychotronic-style... it must be seen to be believed.In-bred Southerners lure unsuspecting Yankees into town for a festival of violence and torture. The film is a perfect mixture of sex and depravity, senseless gore and small-town stupidity. The best sequence features a charming Southern man who lures a blond away from her husband and- after a casual make-out session- proceeds to cut off her thumb with a paring knife. She's bloody, outraged, and still conscious, but his friends have the perfect solution for her: chop off her entire arm with an axe. And watch the bright red blood flow.If you're not vomiting yet than this is the movie for you. The best performance is surely Linda Cochran as Betsy, a sultry Southern temptress with a wonderful pair of shoulders and sadistic sense of humor. A great film to riff on with friends or to give yourself a genuine creep-out.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a High Point in Lewis' Gore Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six northerners (a young woman, a school teacher and two married couples) are detoured into the small southern town of Pleasant Valley, population 2000. The date is April 1965, the centennial of the American Civil War's conclusion and a violent incident in the town's past. What do these "maniacs" have planned for their celebration? Sadly, I saw the remake of "2000 Maniacs" (appropriately called "2001 Maniacs") before I saw the original, so I cannot avoid comparing the two in my mind. The old film has a classic non-Hollywood feel the newer one lacks, the newer film adds lots more sex and a fair amount of gore (and a racial aspect). Both are flawed films, not completely selling what I think they were capable of. While the newer film makes the character of Harper Alexander too hackneyed, the old film has two other characters that seem just too backwoods.Both feature the "yankee cat" scene and the draw-and-quartering. The old one, surprisingly, features far fewer deaths -- which happens to be one of its weak points. The film is slow to build up, provides a few great kills, and is then too long in slowing down. Herschell Gordon Lewis can be credited for one thing, though -- he was quite capable of inventing new and terrifying ways to kill on film. Barrel roll, anyone?Another reviewer praised this film as far exceeding "Blood Feast". He is wrong. The direction might be better, and it is certainly true that the returning actors (William Kerwin and Connie Mason) have greatly improved their acting skills. Especially Mason. But sometimes cheese wins, and this is one of those cases. If "Maniacs" was trying to be a real film, it failed. It seemed like they tried hard but did not achieve what was possible. "Blood Feast", on the other hand, comes off as being less serious and as long as the audience understands this it is more enjoyable. I will freely admit I love bad movies, but I can appreciate good ones, too, and "Maniacs" did not meet my standards.Lewis fans will want to see this, because it is one of his classics. Again, not on the level of "Blood Feast", "The Wizard of Gore" or "Gore Gore Girls", so see those first. But if there was ever a film that deserved a decent remake, it was "2000 Maniacs". Unfortunately, it did not get one (see separate review for more on this). So we are left to try and enjoy the original. I did.As of September 2011, you can have this film in your collection on Blu-Ray, thanks to Image Entertainment. Besides the new technology, there are commentaries from Lewis and producer David Friedman, as well as plenty of special goodies. I would strongly urge anyone to pick it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh the South's gonna rise again.What a great movie! Excellent music, sounded like the Kingston Trio, maybe it was. This is a delightful tale of a town in Georgia that was destroyed by some blue bellied devils during the War Between the States and how they get their vengeance. Six innocent Yankees are detoured into this friendly town, where they are welcomed by the mayor as guests of honour for the Centennial. They have no idea what will follow.The movie is low budget, so don't expect realistic looking blood or decapitated body parts. But they sure are creative with the killing scenes, all with a smile on the face, banjos a-playin', and excellent singing of great classics like Dixie and Old Joe Clark. This movie is no blockbuster, nor is the plot all that inventive, but it is good fun for the whole family, well, maybe not the younguns. I gave it an 8 out of 10. Without the music, it probably would have been a 6. And I will be singing that theme song for days I am sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad I didn't turn off HG Lewis films completely after 'Blood Feast', because although it may be better and more historically important than '2000 Maniacs', this is for sure the better film.This is the story of Pleasant Valley, a town in the south that we never really do find out the truth about, but what we do find out, is that Pleasant Valley sure don't like 'yankees', as there are gruesome murders to prove that.There is a storyline, which is very nice to see, and although the acting is still pretty terrible, the characters are extremely entertaining. The music is also a campy and cool touch.These days, the film works more as a campy cult classic than an effective horror movie, so if you're looking for a scare, '2000 Maniacs' probably isn't the movie you're looking for.But if you're a fan of cult movies, or just curious to see where the modern gore movie came from, skip 'Blood Feast' and go straight to '2000 Maniacs'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second of Herschal Gordon Lewis' "blood trilogy", this one was filmed in the town of St. Cloud, Florida that was later razed to make way for Disneyworld.Local rednecks are looking to avenge the massacre local townsfolk during the Civil War by luring yankee tourists to their town 100 years later and murdering them. Three couples are lured there by some false detour signs and most of them meet nefarious ends.The first gore scene has a woman getting axed on a table (with a large confederate flag hanging overhead) by some of the rednecks after getting her thumb cut off. Not bad. Part of her remains are later roasted over an open fires as the local townsfolk are sitting around singing campfire songs. Hilarious. At the same campfire, her drunken boyfriend has his limbs tied up to four horses and is pulled apart, limb by limb. You don't really get to see it, though. Only his leg (with meat hanging off the end) being dragged away by a horse. The bloody torso isn't shown.The next couple meets as gruesome end as the first one. The woman is lured to a platform beneath a large boulder, then she is tied down kicking and screaming (she doesn't look like she's really resisting) and is crushed by the boulder when a lever releases it. Just like in a carnival show. Her husband is dragged up a hill and stuck in a yellow barrel that has nails nailed inside of it, and is rolled downhill inside the barrel. He's looks like a real mess by the time he reaches the bottom. Not bad.Of course the third couple (Connie Mason and Bill Kerwin from BLOOD FEAST) catch on real fast and make their escape out of town in their red 1964 Mercury convertible with a truckload of rednecks not far behind. As they make it to the main road, they leave the rednecks behind and make their way to nearest town where the local sheriff there doesn't believe them. As they sit in the car and reflect on what's happened, they almost don't believe it themselves.My second favorite after BLOOD FEAST, this too uses a beautifully remastered print taken from the original negative. The Something Weird DVD also has additional unused footage which doesn't add anything to the film but is interesting to look at, anyway. In the secondary audio commentary that's included as an extra, Lewis says he had triple the budget to use due the success of BLOOD FEAST and they made almost as much money back on this one as they did on the earlier film.Excellent camp film that must have terrified audiences the first time they saw it. Check it out!7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Florida Gore: The Gore The Merrier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is it, gang. Herschell Gordon Lewis's greatest accomplishment (so far). After the massive success of a little gore-soaked experiment called Blood Feast, H. G. Lewis and Dave Friedman decided to make a new gore-epic, with some real money, and maybe even some ideas for a decent storyline, this time. A real gore epic. They originally wanted to call this movie Ten Thousand Maniacs, but with a cast of no more than 40 or 50, that would just be insulting the viewers intelligence. And so, Two Thousand Maniacs was born. This time around, the name of the game is Civil War vengeance, cleverly disguised as Southern hospitality.Unsuspecting yankees, just passing through "the South", get tricked into stopping by the little town of Pleasant Valley (what state was that, again?). So, now, 2,000... or, let's just say a whole bunch of eager hicks have surrounded the yankee's cars, making it crystal clear that this week, and this week only, their purpose in life is to shower these people with Southern hospitality... or at least a whole bunch of food and alcohol, and Betsy, if she's around. Why all the fuss over a bunch of lost yankees? Well, hell, son, it's the Centennial!! That's right, it's been 100 years since The Civil War ended, and it's high time we all put our differences aside, and make peace with our brothers and sisters from the north, and let some of them in on our shin-dig... Yeah!! That's what we'll tell 'em. They'll sure 'nough never expect to be mutilated in extremely painful, yet, kinda creative, and often humorous ways. We got all sorts of ideas. Such as..."The four horses" "The barrel roll" "Ol' teeterin' rock" "The axe throwin' contest" (if there's time) We got us some good un's. Dogged if we don't!!! And what about that other little sub-plot that never got explored? You know, when everybody was cheering over that guy being dead, and then Rufus busts out with "You know what happens to anybody that backs out. Let's hear us some music". What was that all about? One of the first, if not the first ever feel-good B-Horror cult classic in American history. Definitely the first one to offer gruesome killings that offer gore, so, of course you gotta take it seriously as a Horror movie, but surprisingly, the cheesy humor, questionable acting, often-ridiculous dialog, and all-around ineptness doesn't over-shadow the Horror element at all, not at all... alright, maybe a little, but I love this movie, and I passionately recommend it to anyone who will listen. Two Thousand Maniacs is by far the best piece of B-cinema you're gonna find out of the 60's. I won't lie to ya, there ain't as much gore as there was in Blood Feast, but we're talking about a much, much more fulfilling experience. Guaranteed to keep your attention, and to put you in a good mood. The highlight, for me (besides the barrel roll), is good ol' Jeffery Allen, the guy that plays Mayor Buckman. That big, loud, entertaining hick makes the movie all the more likable. Obviously, Herschell didn't really put a huge amount of thought into this one, then again, maybe he did. I mean, compared to some other Lewis fiasco's I've come across, over the years. For a real wake-up call, as to the difference between a regular B-movie, and an unwatchable B-movie, check out another one of Herschell's flicks, How To Make A Doll, but you gotta go through Dr. Gore to get to it, so, good luck with that. For anyone who might find Two Thousand Maniacs as awesome as I do, I would recommend ignoring the fact that a remake of this movie exists. Seeking out Moonshine Mountain would be in your best interests. That is, unless you require gore. In that case, can't help ya, because Two Thousand Maniacs is truly one of a kind. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I keep it putrid like an HG Lewis film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>that is a line I heard in a song. I have heard of HG Lewis, but finally got around to seeing one of his movies Let me tell you, this movie is wayyy before my time, so many people of this generation may not appreciate this movie. I for one thought it was awesome.It is about a town that appears every 100 years. This town, Pleasant valley, was wiped out by Yankees during the civil war. So when this town reappears, their goal is to find Yankees to invite to their town so they can have their revenge with them.They manage to get 6 tourists passing by to enter their town, by putting up detours. They tell the tourists that the town is celebrating its centennial, and they must be guests of honor. the tourists have no idea what is going on, but they are provided with free accommodations such as hotels, and food, that they stay. They enjoy a nice barbecue. After the first night though, a few of the tourists go missing, and others start questioning where they are and what this celebration is actually really about. The townspeople jerk them around with answers like "they are on a walk", "the celebration is a surprise" One of the tourists discovers the awful truth, that they are there to be killed, and him and a woman try to escape. The other 4 are not so lucky, and they are all killed in creative ways. The townspeople make a game out of it, and tell the tourists (one by one, they separate them for different games), that they can play. But then they just use them for their amusement in a game of killing.This movie was made in 1965. HG Lewis is often referred to as the Godfather of Gore. This film did indeed have blood and gore, and I imagine it was a lot for 1965.I am a big fan of horror in the 80s , but have been watching older ones as of recently. The 70's decade offers a lot of great ones also, and now I can add one to the 1960s list of great horror.I have heard of other HG Lewis films, i think Blood Feast being the most notorious. I held off on buying his Blood Trilogy set, because i wanted to see if I liked his style first, and I thoroughly enjoyed 2000 Maniacs, so I am definitely getting the set now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demented hillbilly fun! Possibly HGL's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Two Thousand Maniacs!' may not get name-dropped as much as the infamous 'Blood Feast', but it is arguably the better and more entertaining movie, and quite possibly Herschell Gordon Lewis' best effort. HGL's budget seems to be a tad bigger this time around, though the acting is just as poor. In fact the two leads (Thomas Wood and Connie Mason) are both from 'Blood Feast', so that explains a lot. The plot in this one concerns a small town in the South that is celebrating its centenary by luring unsuspecting "yankees", and basically torturing them to death. HGL doesn't spare us the gore, but the murders are done with such good humour that the movie ends up with an odd feel somewhere between 'The Beverly Hillbillies' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. This is a very silly movie obviously, but also very entertaining fun for those with a strong sense of the absurd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's bad, but also very watchable and clever--what a combination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director/cinematographer Hershell Gordon Lewis is considered by bad movie fans to be one of the few "autors" in film history to have equaled or at least come close to equaling the abysmal work of Ed Wood, Jr.. While it's debatable which was worse or if another small-time film maker (such as Ray Dennis Steckler or Al Adamson) was the worst, no one in the know would argue that Lewis was a brilliant film maker! However, even the most inept can occasionally get lucky and TWO THOUSAND MANIACS is Lewis' moment in the sun. Unlike previous films such as BLOOD FEAST (which were all amazingly bad), there was enough good about TWO THOUSAND MANIACS that I actually recommend you watch it--particularly because it proves substantial budgets or consistently good acting aren't necessary to make a decent film! The film begins with two very stereotypical hillbilly idiots tricking two cars full of Yankees off the highway and into their town. There the locals declare that these outsiders are their guests of honor for a centennial celebration and they are convinced to stay. Now the audience knows this is a very bad idea, but the six folks don't yet suspect that these hicks mean to do them great bodily harm. Of course, that might also be because they didn't see the folks running around town with nooses in preparation for their arrival! One by one the Yanks are brutally killed and the ways they did it were pretty clever and the gore was amazingly realistic for 1964. It's amazing to think that with a budget of $46.28 that they were able to achieve these effects, as the blood actually looked like blood and the killing was quite shocking for the mid-1960s.Two of the six are reasonably bright and guess what is in store, so the last part of the film consists of showing their efforts to leave this deathtrap. Oddly, despite the budget, the acting of these two was pretty good (particularly William Kerwin) and the last 15 minutes of the film turned out to be by far the best. There were several wonderful twists and turns that showed Lewis could actually write a clever script and despite the stupid hillbilly acting earlier in the film, the film was surprisingly good. I won't ruin it, but it sure was nice to see that things only improved as the film progressed. Plus, every time I thought that the movie SHOULD have ended sooner, the additional portions kept building on an excellent "Twilight Zone" style script.By the way, the film offended many when it debuted--though it also became a cult favorite. The gore and offensive portrayal of Southerners as crazy morons must have made many at the drive-ins have heart attacks! I sure wish I could have been there to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good set-pieces, but the rest is amateur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2000 MANIACS! is the second of exploitation director Herschell Gordon Lewis' notorious 'blood' trilogy that began with the world's first gore film, BLOOD FEAST. This follows similar ground, using a lightweight story as an excuse for a string of shoddy but bloody gore sequences that still have the power to shock and disturb even to this day. The gore scenes are played out humorously, with a grinning bunch of loons taking great delight in dispatching their victims. There's a suspenseful scene where a girl has a boulder dropped on her; a genuinely ingenious bit where a guy is rolled down a hill in a barrel lined with vicious nails, an unpleasant murder where a girl has a arm hacked off (it's later barbecued) and a shoddy bit where a guy is quartered between four horses. The bright red blood splashes liberally about the scene in this excessive display of sadism.Otherwise, the movie is drab and dull. The amateurish cast give a range of performances. The two leads (slightly wooden William Kerwin and extremely pretty Connie Mason) are good, the rest aren't. The nadir is the redneck laughing boy whose overacting knows no bounds. The direction is pedestrian and the lengthy dialogue sequences are dull to watch. There's a good, suspenseful chase towards the end, but then the films goes on another TWENTY MINUTES to bolster the running time and these are even more excruciating than the epilogue scenes in RETURN OF THE KING: a real chore to sit through. In the end, it's obvious this film was written around four vicious, inventive death sequences but that isn't enough to make a good movie. 2000 MANIACS! is a bore for the most part. Great soundtrack, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Sneering Joviality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could have been a story from The Twilight Zone. A small Southern town comes alive each hundred years to get even for the Civil War. Unfortunately, the subtext for "Two Thousand Maniacs" is in-your-face hateful. Back in 1964 the premise probably was considered amusing. Now, however, it seems dated and is in very poor taste.There's a lot of sneering joviality in this film. The stupid, bloodthirsty townsfolk are bullies who get a lot of enjoyment out of inflicting pain. There are no heroes here, only villains. And the script plotting is weak. Just when you think the movie is ending, it's not. It revs back up with a slight "twist" and keeps going. This happens several times.Aside from a substandard theme and plot, the film's direction is poor. Among the worst scenes are those wherein cast extras stand around in the background watching; they look wooden and manipulated, the result of an unimaginative Director who doesn't seem to know how to set up a scene.The town is called "Pleasant Valley"; a more apt name would be "Amateur-ville", due to the acting. Actors recite their lines about as effectively as high school thespians. Prod values are cheap looking. And the sound is terrible. There's a subtle and unwanted echo on interior sets that makes some of the dialogue muffled and hard to understand. Color cinematography is adequate; images are clear and appropriately lit.A carnival-like tone drains suspense from a story that could have been interestingly thematic and eerie, if the script had been written, and the production directed, by Twilight Zone writer and host Rod Serling. Instead, what we get with "Two Thousand Maniacs" is a hateful plot, lacking suspense and mystery, in a film largely devoid of cinematic professionalism. Marketing the film in the Horror genre refocus the production to a friendlier niche audience, which explains its cult status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement on Blood Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his successful début, Blood Feast (1963), which introduced cinema audiences to splatter horror, Herschell Gordon Lewis made his redneck horror movie, Two Thousand Manics!. Just a few years later, horror movies set in America's Deep South were all the rage, and are still a popular location for some gruesome slicing and dicing (Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil (2010) made fun of the racial stereotyping), so perhaps we have this film to thank for the likes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Deliverance (1972). And Lewis goes all out, with Dixie flags aplenty and thick-accented inbred simpletons in dungarees, in what is a noticeable improvement on his ropey début.Celebrating their centennial, the town of Pleasant Valley welcome six Yankee visitors who unwittingly drive into their celebrations. The town's mayor, Buckman (Jeffrey Allen - who went on to star in a few of Lewis's films), promises them some of that famous Southern hospitality, but with his two retarded henchman, plans to butcher them all to gain vengeance for a massacre committed a hundred years previously in the midst of the American Civil War. Terry Adams (Connie Mason), who has picked up hitch-hiker Tom (William Kerwin) on his way to a 'teacher's conference', notice their fellow Yankees disappearing under strange circumstances and attempt to flee the increasingly bizarre town.Everything about this film looks more professional than Blood Feast, with a more patient approach taken with the moments of gore, and less atrocious editing and camera-work. Don't get me wrong though, the Lewis tropes are there - mannequin limbs, dodgy sound editing, paint-red gore, but it just seems that little bit better. It's still a dreadful film, with Feast's block-headed cheeseball William Kerwin - who actually had a pretty successful acting career - returning for more ham-fisted dialogue delivery, and elongated moments of tedium, but it's still quite fun. The gore is certainly better handled, with everything from dismemberment-by- horse and being pushed down a hill in a barrel full of nails being use to satisfy the blood lust. Which makes it all the more strange that Lewis seemed to retreat back into complete ineptitude after this, with his next film, Color Me Blood Red (1965) being the worst of his 'Blood Trilogy', and the long line of nudie cuties and Z-grade horror films that followed. Still, it's a must-see for horror fans.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of splatter master Herschell Gordon Lewis's more accomplished films, and certainly one of his most popular, "Two Thousand Maniacs!" is agreeable entertainment; in fact, it's so spirited, with such upbeat performances by the sadistic maniacs, that it's just about impossible to resist. It's not as utterly silly as the cheesiness that is "Blood Feast", and actually has something of a story, inspired by the musical "Brigadoon". Six Yankee travellers are deliberately detoured towards a little town named Pleasant Valley where the locals eagerly greet them upon arrival. They're celebrating a centennial, and the Yankees will make for perfect victims - I mean, "guests of honour". Only one of them, a schoolteacher named Tom White (William Kerwin) has brains enough to question the matter. Some of those who loved "Blood Feast" might actually not love "Two Thousand Maniacs!" quite as much, basically as it's not wall to wall gore like its predecessor, is more padded out, and depends on characterization just as much as it does unpleasantness. Still, it's got a couple of grisly highlights that will have you smiling - one person is chopped up, another is quartered, one is sent down a hill inside a barrel that's had nails hammered into it, and another is positioned underneath an enormous rock that's poised to fall if a target is struck. Things get off to one hell of a fantastic start with one of the catchiest down home ditties to be found in Hixploitation horror, composed by HGL himself. Trust me, once the tune is over, you may find yourself wanting to hear it again! Location shooting in St. Cloud, Florida, adds flavour, and the cast easily gives this thing 100%. Kerwin, one of the clueless detectives from "Blood Feast", is typically solid, while his real life wife Connie Mason looks delectable. The true standouts are the blustery Jeffrey Allen, who's a riot as the mayor, and Ben Moore and Gary Bakeman as amiable rednecks Lester and Rufe. Enjoyable from beginning to end, this movie ends on an interesting and atmospheric note. This was the second movie in HGLs' "Blood Trilogy", which began with "Blood Feast" and ended with "Colour Me Blood Red". The remake "2001 Maniacs" came along 41 years later. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Splatter King creates a cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was produced by Gordon Herschell Lewis, the "Splatter King" of Hollywood who made a lot of the grind house exploitation films of that period when the Hayes Code was disintegrating.The plot is that six Northerners are detoured into a town that was wiped out during the Civil War, but somehow the ghosts of the victims are able to manifest themselves in contemporary clothing for the purpose of killing six northerners in gruesome ways. They in fact only kill four, but somehow, that's good enough.I'm guessing the kills are supposed to be impressive for the time, but are tame by today's standards. The victims are as dumb as people in these movies always are.So I give this movie a few props for being the first movie to come up with the "Deranged rural folk kill stupid urban folk" meme. Not sure if that's something to be proud of, given how quickly the genre degenerated into illogic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This follow up to the seminal Blood Feast seems to be regarded by many as the best film that H. G. Lewis ever directed. Personally I can't agree with this view seeing as I just can't see past Blood Feast, a film of much more excessive gore, belly laughs and sheer trash value. That said, Two Thousand Maniacs! ain't bad. It's a more expansive film, although anyone familiar with Lewis's output will know that this is a very relative statement because despite having a more elaborate set-up this is still an ultra-cheap drive-in movie. What keeps it interesting though is the combination of inventive murder set-pieces, demented humour and an overall deranged feel. Its Southern town of Pleasantville gives the movie a sense of place which adds nice detail as well. Not only that but there is also the highly infectious title song 'The South's Gonna Rise Again!' by The Pleasant Valley Boys. Yeeeeha!Like all of Lewis's other gore films this one has a curious mixed tone. It combines broad comedy with pretty mean-spirited violence, usually in the same scene. It's a bizarre thing to see and it gives Lewis's movies an edgy sensibility that remains compelling no matter how unrealistic the gore might actually be. His films are all comedies as much as horror films, maybe even more so. There's never really any suspense in the build up to the acts of violence. They're just presented in front of us in a way that must've shocked early 60's audiences due to their draw-dropping audacity. This one could maybe have done with a little more carnage for it to have been entirely satisfying but there sure is enough here for trash movie enthusiasts to lap up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drive In Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the way to enforce narrative is through distraction. When Lewis directed "Blood Feast," he invented gore as a genre by showing audiences what had always been implied previously. He returned to the genre the next year, intent on bringing audiences more of what they couldn't believe. His script reads like a demented Twilight Zone: 3 couples arrive in a small Southern town to be greeted by the populace and told they are "guests of honor" at the "centennial" of an event that is never elaborated. One by one the guests are killed by their hosts in disgusting and imaginative ways. In some weird way, it touches upon current issues, such as racial tensions in the South and communities that wish the War had not been lost. In his DVD commentary, Lewis observes that the small Florida town he shot this in was thrilled to decorate the town in Confederate flags and participate in the fantasy, even to the point of fake-killing yankees. He says they didn't know how gross the film would be, but they must have seen some of the makeup. There is one scene in which everything stops after the quartering of one of the victims, and one gets the sense it may have been sinking in on the "actors" what they were involved with. Then the Pleasant Valley Boys begin a rousing chorus of "Dixie" on their banjos, and everyone enthusiastically joins in. And how they are killed! Jason Vorhees never in his most imaginative moment never dreamt of such torments. These moments of clever, creative, bizarre, gruesome horrors are punctuation for long periods of seemingly ad-libbed dialogue inside of square frames with no noticeable cinematic qualities. It's a standard not everyone can appreciate, today most people encounter Lewis in a recorded format, and fast-forwarding through the "slow parts" will lessen the impact of the gore-artistry. The distraction element is important for the full experience, but few today have the attention-span to enjoy being lulled into complacency. And besides, most modern fans can't find a date to make out with on the sofa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start, well, the southern accents are bad, plain and simple, in fact, the best portrayed southern accent was by Tom White (William Kerwin), whom was, in the film, simulating the twang in attempt to phone out of Plesantville. Additionally, Lester MacDonald (Ben Moore) and Rufus Tate (Gary Bakeman) gave horrible portrayals. Rufus being in a pressed clean shirt, an obviously new hat and perfectly white teeth, not to mention a ghastly attempt at a southern drawl. Coupled with Lester, whose character made a more valiant attempt at being the country bumpkin, wearing overalls and covered in dirt. However, Moore's overacting was enough to make your teeth itch. In addition, the audio is bad, the dialogue sounds as if the players are shouting in a small quonset hut (although, the sound track is awesome and fitting). That being said, believe it or not, I enjoyed the movie. The hokiness seemed to fit and some of the scenes of gore were great. Guy cuts woman's thumb while showing her his knife's sharpness. To resolve the matter, he cuts off her thumb. Things obviously out of hand (no pun intended), brings the bleeding, crying woman to the town mayor where they cut off her arm, in spite of her thumb (pun intended), priceless and silly, in a backwoods, Deliverance kind of way. In one scene, the troupe of maniacs separate husband and wife David Wells (Michael Korb) and Beverly Wells (Yvonne Gilbert). After some pressuring, you see David being lead up a hill where there is a yellow barrel with the confederate flag affixed to the surface. The barrel is on its side and without top or bottom. They tell David that is it a tradition to have a Yankee crawl through the barrel before it is rolled (you can see where this is going). Naturally he resists, however, they coerce/bully him to travel through, and as you can guess, once inside the barrel, they hold him there. Although, before the barrel is pushed down the gently sloping mound, the mayor produces a hammer and some wicked looking long nails which he then pounds into the barrel. Needless to say, David didn't make it through the ordeal. This was sinister indeed, I found myself proclaiming the proverbial "No Way". Another gruesome demise was when John Miller (Jerome Eden) was Quartered (pulled apart by four horses). Speaking of this, which I found a little misplaced. After the quartering, the group that was once elated, became sullen, after an uncomfortable silence, Lester said something along the lines of "You know what happens to those that don't follow through" this didn't fit, no harm though, the scene was quickly recovered. The movie continues in an expected way with the Hero and Heroine narrowly escaping after the usual cat and mouse. Beverly Wells, is smashed by a boulder that is propped up and rigged to drop in the fashion you may see with a carnival dunk tank. There is an epic twist though, that I enjoyed very much and it is here that I will stop, I feel that in this case, to give it away, would make it a little less enjoyable. I will state that the remake with Robert Englund is very good, adhering to the original interpretation and incorporates more humor (without ruining the feel). The remake also had a superior set, where the original utilized a more modern town that didn't fit. In addition, 2001 Maniacs expounded on the ending's twist, in a way that I thought improved the film. We can't discount though, the plain creepiness of some of the characters in the original, I got the feeling that these people, really were homicidal inbred yolkels. Happy Horrors</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished my second viewing of Lewis' Two Thousand Maniacs last night and I have to say that it was just as fun as it was the first time. Keep in mind that I don't give this movie a 9/10 based on a normal scale, it gets a 9 for the so bad it's good quality. I love this film and am happy to have it as a part of my collection.Let's be quite honest here, the acting, direction, editing and just about everything else are very poorly done, but it doesn't take away from the experience, in fact, I'd say it adds to it. The gore is awesome considering this is a earlier gore film and I love the creative deaths. It's a celebration from hell! If you are a fan of cheesy gore movies, give this one a shot. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy HG Lewis fun with a catchy song and lots of the red stuff to boot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The infamous "Two Thousand Maniacs!" still has the ability to shock viewers some 40 odd years after it first appeared on the silver screen. Quite what it would have been like to view this back in '64 is anybody's guess! Despite its high cheese content, the film's subject matter remains chilling. What's more frightening than one maniac? Quite simply, two thousand of the blood crazed psychopaths! In Herschell Gordon Lewis' film, we see innocent travellers killed in a variety of unpleasant ways, all of which brings much glee to the totally bonkers population of Pleasant Valley. Lewis doesn't spare any of the red stuff as the cast are dispatched in a number of grisly ways, including a bizarre barrel ride for one unlucky gentleman and amputations for one of the girls.The delectable Connie Mason plays Terry Adams and the late William Kerwin plays the male lead, Tom White. The town's population are convincingly deranged, especially Jeffrey Allen as the mayor and rednecks Ben Moore and Gary Bakeman as Lester and Rufus.6 out of 10. Worth a viewing but not HG's best movie. They don't make 'em like this anymore! It must be said, the soundtrack is a corker!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two Thousand Maniacs, Hershell Gordon Lewis's demented take on the legend of Brigadoon, doesn't quite do justice to the ingeniuity of its concept, but still qualifies as an enjoyable slice of low budget cult horror (and one of Lewis's most watchable films) thanks to spirited performances from an enthusiastic cast (ie., they can't act, but they give it all they've got), a bucket or two of gore, and, believe it or not, even some memorably toe-tappin' songs from bluegrass musicians The Pleasant Valley Boys!The film sees a group of travellers tricked into taking a detour that leads them to the Southern town of Pleasant Valley, where they are invited to take part in the town's Centennial celebrations by the impossibly cheery Mayor Buckman (Jeffrey Allen). Once settled into their hotel rooms, which have been laid on for free by the townsfolk, each visitor is lured away to take part in a special celebratory event that ultimately leads to their gory demise.Suspecting that something is amiss, pretty Terry Adams (June 1963 Playboy Playmate, Connie Mason) and her hitch-hiker companion Tom White (William Kerwin) make a bid for freedom, closely followed by the citizens of Pleasant Valley, who are actually civil war ghosts seeking revenge for their massacre by Yankee soldiers one hundred years earlier.Not only does Lewis deliver his trademark splatter and tongue-in-cheek campy humour, but he also manages to conjure up quite a bit of atmosphere and even some tension, proving that he is capable of more than just grossing out his audience. Those looking to be grossed out, however, should not be disappointed with the film, which features an arm removed by axe, a man being pulled apart by horses, another man pushed inside a barrel pierced by nails and rolled down a hill, and a woman squished by a huge boulder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Thousand Maniacs! was another effective Herschell Gordon Lewis horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having finally watched a Herschell Gordon Lewis horror movie last year on YouTube (The Wizard of Gore), when I found out that Two Thousand Maniacs! was now there as well (actually, The Wizard of Gore now seems removed), I quickly clicked the first of nine parts that were uploaded. It was fascinating listening to The Pleasant Vally Boys playing their bluegrass music throughout even after all the gory things that happened though there was silence after one of those deaths were depicted that provided some chills. The gore is mostly well done if not as shocking to me since I grew up watching the Friday the 13th movies on HBO as a teen. The stars are Connie Mason, Thomas Wood (a.k.a William Kerwin who would eventually marry Mason), Jeffrey Allen (who was born in my birthtown of Chicago, Ill.), Shelby Livingston, Ben Moore, Jerome Eden, Gary Bakeman, Mark Douglas, Linda Cochran, Yvonne Gilbert (who would eventually marry director Lewis before divorcing him), Michael Korb, Vincent Santo, Andy Wilson, and Candi Conder. Mason and Wood were in Lewis' previous film, Blood Feast. All the Southern accents sounded exaggerated though Cochran as Betsy was a turn-on for me especially since her top allowed her bare shoulders and some cleavage! The other women, Gilbert (Beverly), Livingston (Bea), and Mason (Terry), not to mention Conder's cameo as a switchboard operator were also classic beauties. As for the men, well, their performances were all over the place especially those between Allen as Mayor Buckman, Moore as Lester, and Bakeman as Rufus though no one was as irritating as the kid Santo who plays Billy with the most atrocious Southern accent and is way too loud to boot! Having known about the Bridgadoon reference, I wasn't surprised by the twist. So overall, this was quite an effective thriller from the legendary H. G. Lewis.</fullReview>

My brother and I saw the movie together at the neighborhood theater, and the movie has left its indelible mark on us both. This is a horror movie in the true sense of the word. It is gory and graphic. I give it a 7 rating primarily because of its lasting impact. True horror. For many years I recalled the name of the movie as 10,000 Maniacs, and had trouble finding it in movie review books, probably due in large part to the band of the same name. I recently read that the band was (mistakenly) named after the movie, as the movie had a significant impact on some of the band members as well. A must-see for true gore fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G.Lewis and David Friedman continued their partnership that had produced the infamous "Blood Feast" with this romp. The plot is that a southern town is celebrating a centennial and to make the festivities complete, they trick six northerners into coming into town so they can kill them in some rather bizarre ways. Whoever thought up the deaths in this movie obviously was rather creative. You've got a BBQ with a woman's arm and a barrel roll with spikes in the barrel to name two. The movie definitely goes into the southern stereotypes, but doesn't seem to be taking them too seriously at any rate. The gore is kind of cheesy (then again, this was made in the 60's).

In this beautifully colored and soundtracked schlock masterpiece, we see Yankees brutalized by "backwoods hayseed" denizens of Pleasant Valley. Hersch demonstrates his typical disregard for nit-pickers as continuity and accuracy take a back seat to his warped and entertaining penchant for violence. Once again, the most entertaining characters, the ones fans end up rooting for, are the maniacs. The victims, for the most part, have little personality and we don't mind their being dispatched with lots of pretty blood. If not for this movie, shot in St. Cloud, FL before Disney World was a neighbor, there would be no Texas massacres. Any southern sickos of cinema that may have emerged wouldn't have been so laughably warped, sho nuff.

		<fullReview>Gore auteur Hershell Gordon Lewis' "Brigadoon"-like "2000 Maniacs" is quite a lot of fun. The tale involves 6 Yankee tourists lured into the town of Pleasant Valley, which sort of resembles Andy Griffith's Mayberry. They are hailed as guests of honor for the town's centennial celebration, but are never told exactly what their roles are to be in the proceedings. It's the best kind of sadism, the sort where you can actually picture Lewis sitting around, asking himself "Okay, what's the grossest thing I can think up THIS time? Rolled down a hill in a barrel with nails pounded into it? A carnival-style "dunking game" that involves a boulder instead of the usual pool of water? Sure!!" The film is at its most successful when it actually causes you to wince, not even so much during the murder scenes, but through the scenes in which the townsfolk have to cajole and coerce their victims into taking part in the festivities. Besides the campy drive-in value of this trash, there is also the rather enjoyable bluegrass music provided throughout the film by three minstrels known here as "The Pleasant Valley Boys."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It never fails to amaze me what some people have filmed as entertainment. This film, for example, tells the story of a town that magically reappears 100 years after being destroyed by Union soldiers to wreak its vengeance on Yankee tourists. Herschell Gordon Lewis uses his same lack of directorial style, bad actors, and hideous dialogue to incorporate into this cheesy, sleazy, yet highly enjoyable gore film, his second in his gore trilogy. The Southern characterizations alone are so stereotyped and, if I were a Southerner, so offensive that they make the viewer wince more than the bright red that dapples the screen over the various killings such as a woman being made into a barbecue, a man being nailed as a barrel rolls down a hill, another man is quartered, and finally a woman is squashed by a gigantic boulder. The southern "maniacs" have missing teeth, no idea of standard English, always wear overalls and red scarfs about their necks, and lastly have no humanity at all in them....nor does the Yankee cast as not one of them can act either. This film, with its major problems not withstanding, is entertaining solely for its shock element of yesteryear which is now its comedy factor of today. One last note, some people consider this Lewis's masterpiece, but it is decidedly a notch below Blood Feast.....both of which are a notch below most Ed Wood films.</fullReview>

H.G. Lewis was the pre cursor of splatter cinema,that would inspire untold generations of horror/exploitation directors to move ahead in this field. Lewis,and his partner in crime, Dave Friedman,crafted 'Blood Feast',',2,000 Maniacs',and others like it for drive in's across the Southern United States back in the 1960's to entertain &amp; gross out audiences. 'Maniacs' concerns two couples that find themselves rail roaded into a Southern back water town that is celebrating a centurary of sorts. What the two couples don't know that the celebration is the 100th birthday of the Civil War. What follows is a nearly non stop blood orgy of graphic dismemberment,and sadism that even by today's standards, is very graphic. The acting is easily grade Z,and most of the special effects are laughable. If you want to scratch a truly perverted itch for a dose of early splatter cinema,then '2,000 Maniacs',or for that matter, any H.G. Lewis film should do the trick for you. Unrated,but contains enough blood,guts &amp; gore to have earned it an 'X' rating (had there been a rating system at the time),but did earn an 'Adults Only' legend on the posters.</fullReview>

A group of Northerners are tricked into spending a few days in the good old Southern town of Pleasant Valley. It just so happens that the good folks of this town (the afore-mentioned Two Thousand Maniacs in the title)are celebrating their "Centennial" (which incidentally was the original title of this film)and the Northerners are guests of honor. One by one they are slaughtered in some of the most wildly creative manors possible (one woman has her entire arm hacked off and barbecued, a man is "quartered", and another man placed in a barrel lined with nails and rolled down a hill). Two Thousand Maniacs is a strange, gory, and wildly fun cult classic.</fullReview>

But this film. This one is a true classic. This is easily one of the best horror films I've ever seen. The gore isn't as abundant as some of HGL's other films, but a couple of the gore shots are more shocking, most notably the "barrell roll" sequence.Its also a very fun film. It never for one moment takes itself seriously.As far as some of the other qualities of the film, most of the acting is passable, with a few very good performances, and one or two really bad ones. The direction is top notch, and the editing is surprisingly good for a film of this sort.See this movie! You will not be disappointed.Also, the director's commentary track on the Special Edition DVD from Somethingweird.com is also especially insightful.

		<fullReview>I love H.G Lewis films! I consider him the true "Godfather Of Gore" and one of the biggest assets to horror film-dom of all-time - and 2000 MANIACS is one of his crowing achievements. Short synopsis: Every 100 years a Southern ghost town comes back to life to commemorate the slaughter of the town at the hands of the Yankees. Unsuspecting Northerners are lured to the town so the Southern folk can have their revenge... If you are familiar with Mr. Lewis's work then you know what comes next, gore, gore, and more gore. Always done in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, and always over-the-top, especially considering the standards of the time. All the Lewis gore films (BLOOD FEAST, GRUESOME TWOSOME, WIZARD OF GORE, COLOR ME BLOOD RED, THE GORE GORE GIRLS) are exercises in excessive blood and silly, campy humor. Not many films can pull off this combination, especially as well as Lewis can. The gore vs. camp ratio is typically just right in his films, making for fun, Saturday night beer-drinking fare. A little hard to swallow if you don't like the red stuff, if you're a little more daring give a look at 2000 MANIACS and the aforementioned films of H.G. Lewis - GORE GORE GIRLS being the goriest and therefore one of my favorites of his films. I hear 2001 MANIACS is coming out soon, and so far the buzz is pretty good.... Highly recommended 9/10 for redneck hillbilly murderous fun!!!</fullReview>

This little gem from the sixties, loosely based on Brigadoon, and filmed in St. Cloud Florida, is a fine example of Guerilla low budget film making at its finest. Some have complained its a little mean spirited, but I don't think the film takes its self seriously enough to truly come across that way.

When I dared to look it was to see the woman getting her thumb cut off or the man in the barrel - sights indelibly burned into my brain! I've seen scenes from the movie over the years while watching commentaries on old "B" movies, and they are incredibly funky. But they still bring back that feeling of terror.To this day, I avoid all horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Halloween, &amp; where is "2000 Maniacs" playing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky. The first time I saw "2000 Maniacs", it was the summer of 1970, I was dating a cute blonde, and we double-dated to the El Rancho Drive-In ($1.99 per carload!) in my Sports Satellite, all tricked out to look like a Roadrunner. First up was "Color Me Blood Red!", about an artist's search for the perfect shade of crimson. Second was "Bloodfeast"(perfect right before the intermission clips of dancing snacks), and "2000 Maniacs" was the finale. All three flicks were cheaply made, poorly acted, and pretty fakey, but we laughed like hell, and had a great time. I saw the same triple bill 5 years later, but a theatre seat was not as much fun as my ride's bucket seats. "2000 Maniacs" is the only one I've seen in 25+ years. I still laugh like hell, and only wish that Bandit and The Dukes Of Hazzard would have showed up to help these nice Suthrun folks celebrate their centennial. Yee-Haw!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I would ever be as lucky again after I found a copy of Herschell Gordon Lewis' Blood Feast on DVD. Well, I was wrong. Two Thousand Maniacs, Lewis' second gore flick, and my second H.G. Lewis experience, was just as good if not better. The movie begins with a very catchy tune (written and sung by Lewis himself) that had me singing it to myself for days afterward. The plot is actually a lot better than one might expext. The citizens of the southern town of Pleasant Valley are holding their centennial celebration, and they are looking for a few "guests of honor". They find them in three couples of northern Yanks who are lured to their town by way of a bogus detour sign. Things are obviously not what they seem in the little town, but what? I don't want to give away any more of the story without ruining it, but almost half an hour goes by and then WHAM! You've got a gore flick on your hands. The gore scenes are more subdued than in Blood Feast, and there are fewer of them, yet there is a certain feeling of unease in the movie that keeps you watching. These people are maniacs! Sure it's plain silly at times, the acting atrocious, the gore minimal by today's standards, but remember, this is 1964. Audiences no doubt were shocked when this film was first released. The ending plays a lot like a Twilight Zone episode, which is a marked improvement over the ending of Blood Feast. If you are a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis and haven't had the chance to see this one yet, by all means go get it! Even if you have no idea who Lewis is, or what his movies are all about, check this one out. You'll no doubt find the low budget look of the film amusing, and may even gain a some respect for little weird gems like this one. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have a movie which could be really aweful. I don't generally like movies about the south, nor do I generally like movies that have inane plots, but both of those things fade away in the face of this films bizarre sense of humor and imagination. the murder scenes are funny and hideous, which go hand in hand. Much better than Blood Feast, though that movie was just as inventive in it's gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gordon Lewis was the inventor of the gore genre;given the enormous success these bloody movies have enjoyed from 1980 onwards (or 1975,if you count "the Texas chain saw massacre"),he must looked upon,so to speak,as a pioneer."2000 maniacs" is an offbeat,entertaining and even funny movie:the "horrible" scenes are kept to the minimum-hardly 10 % of the whole film-,and the director focuses on what happens BETWEEN them.The villains who capture the innocent tourists are good guys,strumming their guitars and playing country traditional tunes with gusto,just wanting to have fun to commemorate their centennial;but their guests of honors-they never talk of prisoners-will not find their games and their barbecues that much funny.Besides,all the people who have seen Minelli's "Brigadoon" will relish with the analogies between the two works:it's almost a remake!Shoestring budget,but Lewis delivers the good.The title inspired Natalie Merchant's former group "10,000 maniacs" ,whose music,a very pleasant folk-rock,has nothing to do with this spooky atmosphere.SPOILER SPOILER: Only the school teacher and his squeeze will escape.And they say education is pointless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brigadoon meets Blood Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2000 Maniacs is about five times better than Blood Feast(both directed by H.G. Lewis), but what movie isn't. It seems as if the director and producer conspired, after the modest success of the ultra-low budgeted Blood Feast, to make a gory, twisted version of Brigadoon. Armed with a bigger budget than Blood Feast and filmed in a small town, using the congenial locals as extras, the film is surprisingly sadistic and gruesome for its age. Sure, the effects are laughable and the acting...well, for a film of this type, passable..., but there is, strangely enough, a sick charm to this film that is undeniable. I can't help but laugh when the locals have a dandy old time at a nighttime picnic barbecue, with the body parts of a victim as the main course. The barrel scene is also a hoot, especially with the locals in the background having such a hootenanny time despite the bloody and violent event that is about to unfold. I believe films of this type have no purpose other than to arouse the senses of the viewer, to shock, titillate, and provoke. There is no message--no phony baloney message--other than to sicken, or humor, you. Well, this film does both, and that's all i have got to say about that.</fullReview>

There's a goofy charm to this movie. Unlike Ed Wood, who apparently made lousy films with aspirations to do better, HGL seems to have been snickering and yukking it up throughout this ridiculously fun film.As the other reviewers have noted, the death scenes are very clever. Ever see a guy get rolled down a hill in a barrel with nails driven through it. OW!Also commendable are the great songs by the Pleasant Valley Boys throughout.

		<shortDescription>A little flawed, but acceptable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2000 Maniacs" is a good, if little sloppy film.**SPOILERS**Traveling through Southern Florida, Tom White, (Thomas Wood) and Terry Adams, (Connie Mason) and their friends John, (Jerome Eden) and Bea Miller, (Shelby Livingston) and David, (Michael Korb) and Betty Wells, (Yvonne Gilbert) end up taking a detour and wind up in the small town of Pleasant Valley. Meeting up with Mayor Buckman, (Jeffrey Allen) he offers to let them stay in town as it's the Centennial of their inception. Thinking it would be fun, they decide to stay for the games and festivities. When the townspeople insist on taking them out to the games one at a time, they start to get worried that something is wrong. Eventually discovering the grisly truth about the town and it's residents, the remaining members of the expedition band together to survive their encounter.The Good News: This here wasn't all that bad. The film is mostly positive for it's really bloody and gory kill scenes, which this provides plenty of. There's fingers lopped off with knives, being crushed under falling rocks, dissection with axes, drowned in quicksand and the film's most infamous scene, where one is trapped inside a barrel with nails hammered into the side and is then rolled down a steep embankment. This is not only highly creative but also quite bloody and handled perfectly. That is also the film's other really good point, as there's an infectious spirit to this one which makes it all the more fun to sit through. It's a manic work that comes across as really fun. It's always moving somewhere and has a mood and feel that make it constantly watchable. This one never really dips low and rises and always stays on, keeping this one from becoming boring at all. That it's also filled with some of the most fun games and such ever seen is a big factor. These are all quite demented and twisted, yet the way that they're portrayed as everyday occurrences makes them seem even more so. That most of the film is taken up with the twisted games is perfect, keeping it where it should be and on the action they generate. When it really tries to, this one can be a lot of fun.The Bad News: There isn't a whole lot with this one that doesn't work. The film's biggest gripe is the fact that there's way too much townspeople interaction that don't work right. This one takes far too long of celebrating and killing before it's discovered what's going on, and that doesn't really make any sense. As the guests are taken off one-by-one, it shouldn't take nearly as much time to discover this trickery as they do. It doesn't bode well for the audience when they're that far ahead of the characters in a story and are sitting around waiting for them to catch up to what was a fairly simple mystery to solve. Another rather negative factor is that there's way too many technical errors based around the gore. This here never looks anywhere near realistic, is the wrong color to begin with and is so atrocious that there's almost no way that it can be shocking with how it looks. It's way too comical to provoke anything other than laughter. These flaws prevent the film from rising above.The Final Verdict: While not really offering much beyond it's gore, this one instead is a little easier to watch for it's sense of fun. Fans of similar kinds of films would really enjoy this one, and gore-hounds will also find a lot to like, while those who aren't so high on technically-incompetent films will be put off with this one.Today's Rating-R: Graphic Violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, but its no Blood Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Herschell Gordon Lewis films. I think he's an original, talented film maker whose work is unjustly derided. This follow up to Blood Feast has his familiar wooden acting, cheapo gore and wildly varying tone, just not quite as full on as Blood Feast. Thomas Wood and Connie Mason are both endearingly plank like, and the rest of the cast are either hammy and frankly strange, especially the little kid Billy, or similarly bland. There's some good humour, and particularly good songs, but its not quite as funny as it should be. The gore is also not quite as satisfying as other Lewis work, with the first two kills a bit mediocre by his standards, although the second two are awesome. I could have done with a good deal more slaying, as thats what these movies are made for. I enjoyed it on the whole, a couple of great scenes, but it really could have done with actors of Mal Arnold or Ray Sager calibre to elevate the proceedings. It's worth a watch, like any of Herschell Gordon Lewis's sublime work, but it's a little weak compared to Blood Feast, which does more, in a shorter run time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another viewing for this original after being disappointed with the recent remake and it is so clear that this has so much more going for it. We don't get the slow intro, we don't get the bright eyed college kids, we don't get a campy Robert England (oops-controversial!) or a crowd of villagers who seem intend on posing for the cameras. In this no budget outing the opening and luring of the Yankees is much more believable, the villagers actually seem real and they don't have to be exaggerated to be made to look a little crazy, just by nodding and grinning at the kills makes them look a bit crazy. It moves along well and I think the kills are more gruesome than in the remake. They are certainly not done for laughs and even today seem to retain a certain edginess, particularly with the accompanying signs of satisfied southerners. The ending(s) is a problem and who can say why this stumble so. It may simply be that the ending is dragged out to make up running time but it does slightly detract from an otherwise bright and tight early example of gore cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1964, "Two Thousand Maniacs" was director Herschell Gordon Lewis's followup to his successful "Blood Feast" the year before. As with its predecessor, the film was rich with gore and crackpot humor. Like "Blood Feast," it was also shot in Florida, though a little further north, near Orlando.The concept was inspired by "Brigadoon," which Lewis's partner, Dave Friedman, had just seen on the New York stage. Lerner &amp; Loewe's romantic musical was hardly a horror tale, but Friedman was intrigued by it's story of an enchanted Scottish village that reappears every hundred years. He wondered aloud to Lewis whether they couldn't do a similar story set in the deep south, only with a more sinister edge.Friedman was a southerner, born in Alabama. Lewis was born in Pittsburgh, but his stint as a literature professor at Mississippi State University had imbued him with a love for southern Gothic. The two master showmen shared a mutual appreciation for what Joe Don Baker's character in Martin Scorcese's remake of "Cape Fear" referred to as the South's "fine tradition of savoring fear."Just as "The Blair Witch Project" played to our primal fear of being lost in the woods, "Two Thousand Maniacs" exploited the urbanite's nightmare of being trapped in a town full of murderous hicks. The gimmick here is that the rednecks are all ghosts. In fact, the entire town is a ghost!It seems that the town of Pleasant Valley was wiped out by Union forces during the Civil War, and in order to avenge the atrocity, the town reappears every hundred years--on the anniversary of the massacre--to exact ghoulish retribution on unsuspecting "yankees," whom they find by waylaying motorists with northern plates.Former Playboy playmate Connie Mason ("Blood Feast") turns up again as Lewis's female lead, but her driving skills are even less improved than her acting ability: at one point she accidentally drove the film's borrowed convertible into a brick wall. Not one to waste time or money, Lewis simply shot the rest of the day's scenes from the undamaged side of the car.As proudly stated in the end titles, the film was shot entirely "in the picturesque and beautiful city of St. Cloud, Florida," which is next door to Kissimmee. In the audio commentary on the DVD, producer Dave Friedman mistakenly asserts that the locations are "all gone," having been subsumed by post-Disney development. In fact, most all of the original locations are still there. Unlike Kissimmee, sleepy little St. Cloud was largely bypassed by the Disney-driven growth, and visitors today will be surprised to find the town changed very little from the time when Lewis was shooting his masterpiece.A centerpiece of the film is the Hunter Arms Lodge, which still exists in downtown St. Cloud and looks exactly as it did in "Maniacs," though it's been painted a different color. It's now an upscale bed and breakfast, and is frequently used for weddings and the occasional film shoot.One of the grisliest scenes in "Maniacs" occurs when Shelby Livington's character has her arm hacked off in front a large stone fireplace. The scene was shot in the lobby of the Hunter Arms, and that fireplace is still there to this day. When the hotel was renovated a few years ago, the fireplace was left untouched. Visitors to St. Cloud today can peer through the front door of the Hunter Arms and see that infamous stone fireplace, looking just as it did in "Two Thousand Maniacs."A few years ago there was talk in Hollywood of doing a big-budget remake of "Two Thousand Maniacs," starring Kris Kristofferson, of all people. So far, nothing's happened.</fullReview>

The remake should replace a cat with pigs. The ending should have the all the maniacs dead by the National Guard and the military which I think this is a better ending for a remake.

		<shortDescription>Brigadoon for the drive-in set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having scored an unexpected success in 1963 with Blood Feast, their initial collaboration, producer David F. Friedman and director Herschell Gordon Lewis, joined forces once again to make a similarly gory follow-up; this time however, instead of rehashing their earlier success, they decided to hitch their vividly bloody technicolour scenes to a decent story rather than to the plot-free string of gory set-pieces that made up Blood Feast. Lewis hit on a twisted variation on the plot of Brigadoon after listening to Friedman describe his trip to New York to see the famous play on Broadway. Instead of setting the movie in the Scottish highlands, however, Lewis decided to transfer it to America's deep south. The result is a movie whose influence has spread far wider than its fame.The story of 2000 Maniacs takes place in the sleepy little town of Pleasant Valley, 110 miles from Georgia (actually St. Cloud in Florida, which was razed to make way for Disneyworld), and opens with a pair of local hayseeds tricking a couple of carloads of 'Yankees' into visiting their town by setting up a couple of fake detour signs. Once in the town, the reluctant visitors are greeted by confederate flag-waving locals, and find themselves to be the guests of honour for the town's centennial celebrations. Things quickly take a sinister turn as the guests begin to disappear one by one.The film starts with a catchy and amusing banjo song entitled "The South Will Rise Again" and scenes of a group of children lynching a cat who has a sign reading 'Damn Yankees' tied to its tail, thus quickly setting the tone for the movie to follow. It takes some time for the first blood to be spilled, as Lewis introduces us to both the victims-in-waiting and the town's planning committee. The characterisation isn't exactly deep here ? this is, after all, a Lewis movie ? but it does at least add some meat to the bones that are about to be severed. The townsfolk are played strictly for laughs ? the aforementioned hayseeds, the buffoonish mayor Buckman, the overweight Lothario and the outwardly sweet femme-fatale ? but the victims are much more like everyday characters, as Lewis seeks to exploit the audience's fear of being in their position. The story, it has to be said, is quite a good one, and could just as easily have been played straight (perhaps as a Twilight Zone type story).When the violence in this movie begins, it is almost, unexpected. Inviting the frisky blonde Yankee to 'touch his blade', the ageing southern lothario swiftly cuts off her thumb. In the very next scene she is in the office of the mayor, surrounded by a group of grinning locals who hold her down so that one of their number can sever her arm. Lewis' camera (he filmed as well as directed), lingers lovingly on the bloody stump of the woman's arm as one of the locals dabs delicately at it with his finger. Late that night, at the barbecue, the woman's arm cooks on a spit as "Rollin' in my Sweet Baby's Arms" plays on the soundtrack. That's about as subtle as you'll get from Lewis, but most people wouldn't want it any other way.Soon the other members of the beleaguered band of travellers are meeting their gory fate (the barrel-rolling death is a particularly inventive one) until only our bland hero (Lewis regular William Kerwin acting as Tom Wood) and his girlfriend (Connie Mason, an incredibly bad actress) remain.2000 Maniacs is a movie that is far, far better than it ought to be: made by a couple of exploitation movie-makers with a cast largely made up of amateur actors (the acting is poor at times, but not bad enough to spoil the movie), and a small ($65,000) budget, it nevertheless has an exuberance about it that is infectious. Some of the scenes ? especially the early ones in which the whole town lines the streets to welcome the unsuspecting 'guests' ? work extremely well, and Lewis's camera-work is wonderfully crisp and colourful at times. Friedman and Lewis would go on to make Color Me Blood Red, the third in their 'gore' trilogy, in 1965, but this terrific little movie is by far the better of the three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two Thousand Maniacs is as demented as a film could possibly be. It is psychologically depressing, and possibly destructive and influential to certain mindset viewers. I was truly horrified by certain scenes that were not artistically creative, but a simple disgrace of indiscriminate bloody mangling of a beautiful woman. I wonder if this movie could have influenced the likes of Ted Bundy, Jeffery Dalmer, etc. It concerns me that Director-Writer Herschell Gordon Lewis could and would have created such an offensive film. I have to wonder what goes through a man's mind to have actually written and directed such a hideously thought processed movie that only a serial killer could relish and appreciate. I love horror movies that scare me, have gore, etc. But Two Thousand Maniacs is another genre altogether. I would not relate this as a horror movie, but as the title suggests, it should be deemed a forum for killers and maniacs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of "yankees" from "up north" are driving on the highway when they are purposely diverted by detour signs into a small "backwoods" Southern town where a joyful local gathering invites them in with welcome cheers to be their very special, "selected" guests for a Centenniel celebration commemorating past history not revealed. Two different cars, one carrying two married couples, another with pretty Connie Mason(..as Terry Adams)and her hitchhiking passenger, William Kerwin(..referred to as Thomas Wood in the film's credits;portraying Tom White), whose car broke down as he was on his way to a teacher's convention, are removed from their vehicles pretty much against their will, set up in a hotel with food free, not knowing that they are actually to be the entertainment for their celebration festivities, victims of gruesome games arranged as a "blood revenge" for a dark period in Civil War history. This Southern town, Pleasant Valley, was actually slaughtered by Union soldiers and the vengeful spirits of those killed participate in the celebration of destroying yanks. While the other northerners are unable to see what horrors lie ahead, Tom is suspicious almost immediately and coerces a confused Terry into planning an escape..it won't be easy with hick crazies all over the place.Considered by his beloved fans as director Herschell Gordon Lewis' masterpiece, TWO THOUSAND MANIACS!, his second film, is much better than BLOOD FEAST, in that the black comedy works to a greater extent, and he's operating completely tongue-in-cheek. While the camera work is still suspect, there are some overhead set ups early on which are effective, and the film doesn't drag as much as in BLOOD FEAST, where scenes would often linger tediously. The non-actors in the film are not as dreadful as in HGL's previous flick, and the cast portraying the "rednecks" really get into their roles, particularly when the victims are about to be executed. Jeffrey Allen, as the blustery mayor, is memorable as the overseer of his town, really relishing along with the folks over executing the yanks one at a time, mocking each victim as they are about to die. The gory set-pieces are certainly shocking such as one poor soul whose limbs are pulled apart from his torso by four different horses going in opposite directions, a woman's finger(..taken off by a knife)and arm(..chopped off by an ax)being removed, another victim bound as contestants attempt to drop a boulder on top of her by hitting a target with a softball, and one victim is rolled down a hill in a barrel with nails hammered inside. The twisted imagination for coming up with such grisly set pieces, HGL deserves credit for setting a standard others would soon surpass as demand for such movies increased with talented make-up artists and production values emerging. Still, the film features crude photography and bad sound(..sometimes, the dialogue is a bit drowned out by bluegrass music)..and I wouldn't say the acting is of superb quality, far from it. But, there's an irresistible energy and a method to the madness, with some terrific bluegrass numbers to entertain as well. In order to appreciate a sick gore comedy such as this, you must gloss over HGL's inadequacies as a filmmaker, still learning his trade, but the man has a knack for repulsive murder sequences. As a gorehound, I admire his contributions to the artistry of graphic violence, even if I find his cinematic prowess lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Pleasant Valley. Population: ...MANIACAL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm still a long way from being an expert on the matter, this definitely is the best Hershell Gordon Lewis film I've seen thus far! I really enjoyed the light-headed gore and splatter of "Blood Feast" and "The Gruesome Twosome" but their total lack of plot and continuity eventually made it impossible to consider them worthy horror movies. But, like other reviewers already stated, "Two Thousand Maniacs" actually has a real story to tell and, moreover, it even is a pretty good one! On their way to different tourist destinations in the South, six young people are re-routed to the peculiar little town of Pleasant Valley where they're given a warm reception as honoree guests to a centennial. One of the six, a schoolteacher, is rather suspicious and righteously so, because the town is celebrating the Civil War mass massacre of 1865 and they're planning to gruesomely kill their Yankee-guests! Unlike most other H.G. Lewis' films, "Two Thousand Maniacs" doesn't feature unnecessary padding sequences and strictly focuses itself on the absurd subject matter. The townsfolk's utterly gore killing methods are both blackly humorous and very ingenious and they unquestionably belong to the greatest horror moments I've ever beheld. To name just one: a man is forced to step in a barrel with nails hammered through it, and then he rolled down the hill! Seeing is believing!! The acting performances are surprisingly tolerable, probably because most cast members can deliberately go over the top with their atrocious Southern accents. Especially the kid Billy near the end of the film is a real joy to observe. Personally, I also like to believe that "Two Thousand Maniacs" was a rather influential film since many later (especially 80's) horror movies revolve on entire little redneck towns that hide strange secrets ("The Fog", "Dead &amp; Buried" and maybe even "The Wicker Man"). The completely demented "Rebel Yell" banjo song is fantastic (and very catchy) and H.G. Lewis even thought up an ambitious, The-Twilight-Zone-like climax. Bravo, Mr. Godfather of Gore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HGL's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people of Pleasant Valley, a southern town are planning a civil war centennial. The lure 6 Yankees there, but the townsfolk's idea of fun is a tad different than usual. This is without a doubt Herschell Gorndon Lewis's best film. It's his most accomplished, funnest, and most highly watchable. Amazingly enough the acting isn't that bad either. I can't recommend this film into for horror fans. With the upcoming remake in store to hit us any day now. Check out the original.My Grade: B DVD Extras: Commentary by Herschell Goron Lewis and David Friedman; 16 and a half minutes of outtakes; galley of Exploitation art; and Theatrical Trailer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Lewis' entry in his trilogy of blood features one of his best known films (besides BLOOD FEAST) 2,000 Maniacs. Every hundred years or so a town appears out of the thin air to terrorize out of towners. Lewis brings out buckets of red paint and animal entrails for this flick. Like most of his films, the acting is bad, the budget is low and the film is padded, but the fun factor is high.Highly recommended for campy horror film fans.B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**PLOT SPOILERS ALL THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW** Early gore film. It's about this town in Georgia called Pleasant Valley that was destroyed by the Yankees during the Civil War in 1864. It magically reappears a hundred years later and six Northerners are purposely detoured there to be killed off.The second gore film by the immortal Hershell Gordon Lewis. This followed "Blood Feast" which was an (inexplicable) hit. Like the first this has a stupid story, lousy acting (although Connie Mason did improve from the first one) and terrible direction. This was made just to show some likable people being killed off in bloody ways. One woman is gorily dismembered; another woman is crushed by a boulder; a man is drawn and quartered and another guy is rolled down a hill in a barrel studded with nails! The gore is, by todays standards, pretty poor and there's buckets of blood used in each killing. Also the womens murders are protracted and pretty sick--Lewis seems to take a sick kind of delight in showing them. Aside from all the murders this is surprisingly dull. The pathetic acting and script don't help at all. I'm just giving this a 2 only because it's slightly better than "Blood Feast".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sado-porn, should probably be banned (and please see your therapist on the way out)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here at IMDb, there appears to be an interesting difference between the "splatter" film cult and those who admit they watch pornography. Since the 'splatter' film is really a kind of sadistic/violence pornography, I went, on a hunch, after reading through reviews of this film, to the reviews for a known cult porno, "Deep Throat." I thought I would find the same sort of remarks (with obvious necessary variation), but was surprised to discover that those who praise "Deep Throat" seem determined to discuss the merits of its story, an issue that doesn't concern most who praise "2,000 Maniacs." What is both interesting and upsetting about many of the positive reviews of this film is that the writers admit that what brings them to it are what, they also admit, are the "perverse" or "sick" elements - they want to see the mutilation, the blood, the pain of the victim, this gives them enjoyment.This was the first of only about a half-dozen films I've walked out of my entire life. I left after the first major episode of sadism, where a hick thug laughingly cuts off the thumb of a girl with whom he's on a picnic, for no discernible reason whatsoever except that he finds it amusing. It was clear that the audience was not invited to identify with the victim who was merely an object of use for the thug. And I have no idea, to this day, why anyone would identify with the thug. Nor do I understand the only other psychological explanation for watching this scene without any identification at all, that is, as a clinical observation of how good or how poor the special effects are.I like action films, so I recognize the cathartic, even therapeutic, use of violence in cinema. But just cutting off a woman's thumb just for the enjoyment of her pain, or to see how much it might bleed, is beyond any reasonable understanding.This film remains a strong argument for suppression of sado-porn, or at least burying it under an "X" or NC-17 rating. It is confusing why Woo's "The Killer" was originally given an "X" - yet I was able to walk in to see this Lewis film, at the time of a brief re-release, when it was obvious I was only 14. It has left an indelibly bad impression on me all these years, and I will always damn the name of Hershel Gordon Lewis for it. Some have tried to defend this film as "so bad it's funny," but sado-porn is just cruel and can never be funny. My psychic pain is not a subject for your profit or enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Thousand Maniacs! (1964) *** (out of 4) One of the ultimate Drive-In classics. A bunch of Northerners travel South and are invited to a weekend party but what they don't know is that the games include the South rising up and killing them. Sure, this Herschell Gordon Lewis film isn't "well made" by traditional stands but it sure is a hell of a lot of fun. The "death scenes" are full of imagination and the stereotypes in the South are funny as well. This is certainly the crowning film in Gordon's filmography. How in the hell the main song didn't win Best Song at the Oscars is a mystery to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lewis' best (which ain't sayin' much)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am prepared to concede one point here - if H. G. Lewis ever made a good film, this would be it. Having said THAT... the rest of this old comment stands...I was paging through the comments on this film, for god knows what reason, and was thoroughly appalled. I can't believe what I'm reading. Nowhere does anyone seem to grasp what is immediately obvious to any person of intelligence or taste - that Herschel G. Lewis is an incompetent hack who never directed anything even close to a good film in any genre. He is one of the most immoral filmmakers ever to set foot behind a camera. His "plots", if they can be called such, remind me of a Christmas tree. With a Christmas tree, one chops down and kills a fine, beautiful piece of nature's wonder and drags it into one's house for the sole purpose of hanging tacky, tasteless garbage on it for a brief time. And so it is with Lewis. His movies are nothing more than poorly crafted frameworks that exist to justify the depiction of various mutilations and murders that have no point and explain or illuminate nothing about the characters involved. They represent an immoral exploitation of various graphic forms of human suffering without point or purpose. There is no tension in a Lewis movie because he is congenitally incapable as a director of creating a character than a viewer would care about. They are just meat to be butchered. I have never been frightened by this or any other Lewis movie for just this reason. Yet there are people who praise this kind of immoral nonsense to the skies, because they think it representative of some kind of counterculture trash aesthetic. The only way I can explain Lewis's following is to remind myself that he is an acknowledged master of salesmanship, the apparent inventor of "direct marketing". Now, "direct marketing" is better known to people as "junk mail", and Lewis's involvement in selling junk is apparent in his films. They represent the height of mass marketing to the gullible - he wraps up garbage, not in a pretty new package, but in an ugly, immoral one, and sells it as "art". The only moral to the saga of Lewis is a reiteration of Barnum's dictum about what kind of person gets born every minute. Stay away from "Two Thousand Maniacs" and every other of Lewis's insults to the human soul as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What`s all the praise about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What`s all the praise about?Beats me...I bought this film a while ago on the basis of a trailer.The trailer,I thought,had a sick and nice feeling to it,so I was expecting a bloody freak-fest.Boy was I disappointed!!I will not give you a runthrough of what is going on in this failure of a film,except that the acting is bad,the jokes are lame(perverse jokes can be fulfilling if they are done in a clever way,these are not though,just plain stupid!!),and the most disappointing thing is the shameful low amount of gore,and the few scenes where you actually see it,well,it just keeps you saying to yourself;BOOOOORING!!!Leaves no impact whatsoever,I am sorry to say.You don`t go and purchase a Lewis-film for the brilliant storyline,or to watch the interesting character development taking place,you want to see gore!!End of story.Should really have learned my lesson after watching the oh so infamous "Blood Feast",which was also a huge pile of crap.So if you own a copy,please burn it!A must do!!!!!</fullReview>
