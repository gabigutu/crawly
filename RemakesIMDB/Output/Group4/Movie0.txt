		<shortDescription>"Over the top" is just scratching the surface...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those already familiar with the original will know what they've gotten themselves into as our main characters follow a bogus Detour sign?just after narrowly avoiding Justin and Professor Mambo, character favorites from CABIN FEVER who are trying to hitch a ride?and arrive in the town of Pleasant Valley, whose residents are hard at work preparing for their weekend "Guts and Glory Jubilee." Soon the Confederate knife fodder arrive with Yankee good looks and are declared "guests of honor" by the one-eyed Mayor Buckman, played pitch-perfect by everybody's favorite sadist, Robert (Freddy Krueger) Englund. But what else can you expect when there's a population of, you guessed it, 2001?maniacs, that is! What follows, surprisingly given our times and political climate, is refreshingly vulgar, completely un-PC and, much like the original, an expected excuse for extremely sadistic humor and gore. Where the first film now seems boring and slow, the new version is upbeat and well-paced. Happily and sadly, the first and only fully clothed female victim to get tied up and quartered by horses is the film's only waste of T in a movie overflowing with T&amp;A. Many viewers may be offended by the black humor and straight-up racist jokes that pepper the film's dialogue, but those of you can rest assured that everyone gets their due by the end. It'll be interesting to see how the red states will react to such a searing and scabrous document of the South. Englund seems to imbue Mayor Buckman with a well-judged imitation of President Bush, and even the lives of his two sons in the film appear to closely ape those of the Bush daughters.Longtime Lewis fans will be ecstatic that much, if not all, of his score from the original has been transferred to the new film by way of musical narrators Johnny Legend and his strumming sidekick Scott Spiegel. Somewhat in the vein of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, these musical country bumpkins pop up from time to time, like Sullivan's version of a Greek Chorus, hinting at the dangers to soon befall our ethnically and morally diverse blue state victims. "The South will rise again!" The supporting cast is stocked with many fine new actors and veterans of the genre. Fans will enjoy the cool seething evil of Giuseppe Andrews (Fever's Deputy Winston) as he kills Yankee belles with kindness, and Lin Shaye (fast on her way to becoming a middle-aged scream queen after her role in the haunting DEAD END), who stars as Granny Boone, the murderous matriarch of Pleasant Valley. One day, this fine actress will hopefully be cast in a role that capitalizes on her real-life beauty and sassy charm; in the meantime, she here has a ball pushing the envelope, as when she sucks the red gore off a spear protruding from the gullet of a hapless victim! Newcomer Jay Gillespie evokes a REAL GENIUS or TOP GUN-era Val Kilmer with stern good looks and a thrill for the action around him. The rest of the MANIACS cast seem to be having fun with the bloody lowbrow horror and are in on the joke, all ready to "take one for the team" and die in a less-than-flattering manner. As each member is dispatched, you can tell they were having a great time taking it to the next level. This is a movie where "over the top" is just scratching the surface. Just ask Peaches, the Southern belle who wears a "retainer" that would make the shark in JAWS envious when she "services" a good ol' boy! (He doesn't last long.) By the third reel, characters are walking around town all alone for no good reason, so we know they aren't going to end up much better than their missing brethren. Then Sullivan and crew punch up the action a bit with a scene that doesn't necessarily match the vibe of everything we've seen thus far, but has a maggot-worthy moment that makes up for the switch in tone. If you're looking to get scared, this is not exactly the right film, but if you're familiar with Lewis and his brand of goremongering, you'll squirm, screech and then writhe with laughter. 2001 MANIACS has all the elements of a good time yet still raises a dialogue among viewers that not many have had the balls to address in horror, or film-making in general, since the '70s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun remake...perfect for fans of blood, guts, and boobs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Sullivan's remake of TWO THOUSAND MANIACS, to me, was nothing but fun from start to finish. From the first kill to the last, this film rocked. Like EVIL DEAD 2, this is more of a comedy/horror, which Sullivan himself describes as "Splatstick"...sure it's over-the-top, but it's supposed to be, and that is what makes it so much fun. Robert Englund and Lin Shaye are a blast as "Mayor Buckman" and "Granny Boone", but I must say there were some excellent casting choices for everyone involved...the group of gorgeous girls who play both hapless victims and charming? Southern Belles...Giuseppe Andrews, who lends his unique style to the film...Dylan Edrington who plays the perfect smart-ass...and the actors portraying incidental characters like "Hucklebilly" and "Lester" really help add to the film's humor and creepiness.While some are complaining about the few off color jokes the film offers, and these might get some people's panties in a bunch, this is not a racist picture. Personally, I found the jokes to be pretty funny (Malcom, a black character, is told to "wait just a cotton picking' minute" at one point in the film). Others are criticizing the acting...I thought the acting was fine. Not Shakespearian by any means, but remember, this isn't GHANDI and it won't be nominated for an Academy Award (and exactly how many of your favorite films have been?)Bottom line is enjoy this for what it is, a throwback to good old-fashioned blood n guts, T &amp; A horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "2001 Manacs" last night at a midnight screening at the Fantasia Festival and I really enjoyed it ... so did the 300-400 other people in the theater with me. Tim Sullivan and Christa Campbell introduced the movie and held a Q&amp;A session after (I had to leave, it was 2am) but I'm sure they were pleased with the audience response. It was great to see Robert Englund again, he always does a great psycho. The movie was funny and gory ... sure the plot wasn't Oscar caliber, but anyone looking for that is going to the wrong movie. If you want to see a good horror movie, the real 'guts &amp; glory' kind, this is the movie for you. I feel confident in recommending this movie and plan on picking up the DVD (especially since the version that was screened hasn't gone to the ratings board yet, so the DVD will probably be the only place to see this exact version).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's always room for one more ... MANIAC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The almighty Hershell Gordon-Lewis already promised us through a very catchy song that the South was going to rise again... and it did! Slightly more than forty years after the Godfather of Gore's terrific splatter-classic, energetic director Tim Sullivan gathered quite an impressive cast and updated Lewis' screenplay with new gory sickness and nowadays sleaze 'n swearing! I'm usually not this enthusiastic when it comes to remakes of classic horror films, but "2001 Maniacs" simply is a fun &amp; unpretentious little movie that clearly intended to please horror fans first, rather than to hit big at the box office. The original story is preserved, as a whole bunch of young party animals on their way to the Southern beaches are detoured the peculiar little town of Pleasant Valley where they're given a warm reception as honoree guests to a local jubilee. The townsfolk, with one-eyed mayor Buckman in charge, all soon turn out to be deranged killers that are still very rancorous about the Southern Civil War casualties and, one by one, the Yankee tourists are butchered in very imaginative ways. Some of the killings are strangely similar to the ones in Lewis' original, some of them are completely new...but they ALL are utterly grotesque and exhilaratingly gross! Whenever there isn't any gore on display, we're treated to absurd dialogues, morbid jokes and ? oh yeah ? loads of naked flesh supplied by the most ravishing babes of nowadays horror flicks. Of course, purely talking cinema, this isn't much of good film because it totally lacks tension and it's tasteless, offensive and completely ridiculous. Personally I couldn't care less about this because A) you pretty much know what to expect here and B) it's a splendid throwback to the rancid 60's and 70's; the times when horror cinema didn't necessarily had to justify its exploitative tendencies. Robert Englund clearly hasn't had this much fun portraying a mad character than since the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" and Lin Shaye once again proves she's a sadly underrated but great actress that delivers no matter how silly her lines are. The younger cast members perform adequately and Sullivan's directing is fairly surefooted as well. Although the additional maniac in the title never really gets introduced, I suppose it relates to the little silent girl who dissects rats for fun. "2001 Maniacs" is one of the most entertaining horror films of the past couple of years and I recommend it highly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 Maniacs Delivers The Goods!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go through the long list of films in horror that could use a major overhaul, the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis are the last films that tend to come to mind. Today, Hollywood's exploitation consists of a PG-13 rating and Jennifer Aniston and they want films with a wider fanbase established. It just doesn't seem likely that's there's ever going to be a bunch of suits sitting around a conference table, pitching ideas and coming to the conclusion that Two Thousand Maniacs must be remade.Thank God for Tim Sullivan.It's so damn refreshing to know somebody out there is hearing the fans. Sullivan's 2001 Maniacs is set to prove to the mental midgets making cookie cutter horror for my little sister that horror fans really do want original, adult horror.Three college screw-ups head out on Spring break in search of a bit of fun and relaxation when they hit a detour that lands them smack dab in the middle of a sleepy little southern town by the name of Pleasant Valley. The town is a' jumpin' as the townsfolk prepare for their Guts &amp; Glory Celebration! They're greeted by the boisterous Mayor Buckman(Robert Englund) and asked to stick around as the Guts &amp; Glory Celebration's guests of honor! The three decide to stay in town when a few girls they met at a gas station show up. The two carloads of college kids aren't the only guests though as a motorcycle roars into town with Malcolm (Mushond Lee) and Leah (Bianca Smith) aboard. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that a black guy and Asian girl are the unwelcome guests! Pleasant Valley is a quiet little town full of smiles and hot freaky babes but there's only one problem?one by one the guests are disappearing and being dispatched in horrifying ways including being drawn and quartered and drinking acid from a hose! If that wasn't bad enough we get a long steel pike up the ass! As guests start dropping off like flies we're left with brave Alexander Lee (Jay Gillespie) and his gal, Joey (Marla Malcolm). A final confrontation ensues between the two, Mayor Buckman, Granny Boone (Lin Shaye) and the townsfolk! Will they escape Pleasant Valley? Will they become the main course?! Will poor Cory (Matthew Carey) finally get some from the kissing cousins? The town of Pleasant Valley will not rest until the slaughter of two thousand and one of the townsfolk are avenged on the Northerners! Watch the movie! Do yourself a favor, buy some beer, grab some chili cheese corn chips, give little Suzy and Sarah a few bucks to go see Stay Alive, put the dog out and send the wife to the store because this is one of those movies only a horror fan can truly appreciate! We get blood, boobs, gore, comedy, guys chasing sheep, kids killing cats and super hottie cousins "boning" each other! The comedy is actually funny?the gore is actually?well?gory! The T&amp;A is top notch(its Christa Campbell guys!) and the acting was excellent.Not only do we get a damn good horror film but we get a DVD that actually puts most "Special Editions" to shame! This release is packed with extras! I would like to point out to readers though that no matter how hard a DVD company tries to convince you?subtitles and closed captions are not bonus features.I'd like to point out a few facts as well?for starters; Eli Roth is back to reprise his role from Cabin Fever as wonky drifter Justin (Eli Roth) and his good buddy Dr. Mambo (the dog) is back as well! Eagle eyed viewers may also spot Tim Sullivan hammering on a coffin and Scott Spiegel (Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2, The Dead Next Door) as one of the hillbilly banjo singers that constantly wander about the movie! I'm also officially going on record as having said that I consider Lin Shaye to be a hottie. There, I said it! So, for those of you looking for a damn good film, run, don't walk, to your nearest Best Buy and purchase 2001 Maniacs. Don't hesitate! Remember to keep your eyes peeled on Sullivan's upcoming horror flick, Driftwood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty pleasure of the highest order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2001 Maniacs" is a thoroughly enjoyable film.**SPOILERS**Driving through Florida on their trip for Spring Break, Nelson Elliot, (Dylan Edrington) Anderson Lee, (Jay Gillespie) Cory Jones, (Matthew Carey) Ricky, (Brian Gross) Kat, (Gina Marie Heekin) Joey, (Marla Malcolm) Leah, (Bianca Smith) and Malcolm, (Mushond Lee) take a detour and wind up in Pleasant Valley. Mayor Buckman, (Robert Englund) welcomes them all accordingly and lets them stay as guests for the celebration. As they start to dwindle in numbers, they suspect that the townspeople are committing evil deeds against them. Desperate to get out alive, they realize their true intentions and are forced to make a deadly decision.The Good News: This was a really surprising film. There was a no-boundaries, anything goes type of feel to it that makes it so entertaining. The film was overloaded with massive amounts of exploitative goodies. The twisted, off color and politically incorrect sense of humor often times made for tons of laughs. The beginning wanders around the time and the comments made about the backwards nature of it were pretty good, and the ironic moments that come later on where great as well. Everybody was a target here as well, and it made several great remarks about the differences between the two parties there. The kill scenes were also creative and make for some fantastic kill scenes. We get a drawn-and-quartered victim where both arms and legs are yanked out, acid burning a whole in the chest and neck, a huge bell being dropped and being crushed in a huge vice to the point where the eyes pop out, among other fantastic and very gore-soaked kills. The very fun pace adds to it as well, making it seem like it's going along at a very fast pace with no let-up. The fight at the end is a nice little addition, giving it a fiery, action-packed conclusion that really is a pumped up affair. The fact that Robert Englund had an obvious blast with the part went a long way to this one as well. A great over-the-top and yet credible and entertaining role went a long ways here, and seeing him always makes it seem special. It even scores well with a nice twist at the end that is very hard to see coming and the result is a great move. Tie all these together with a copious and generous display of nudity and it's a very well-rounded film.The Bad News: There's only one main problem here, and that was the ending. The last half of the film was all about padding. We get way too much wandering around for nothing other than boosting the clock time and it got a tad tedious. There's really no reason why it has the characters wandering around the village for as long as they do, as it's obvious what has already happened and it makes no sense why, but that's the only part that really didn't seem all that great. Otherwise, this was a really great film.The Final Verdict: One of the most fun movies around, this is basically a free-for-all that is most centered on what can be done to entertain. It's a simple film that is mostly recommended for gore-hounds or anyone else looking to be entertained for an hour and a half.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, animal killings and themes of bestiality</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries to fit the tried and true horror mold but falls flat on it's face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I tried 2001 Maniacs because the horror master Robert Englund was the star and plastered all over the cover. I should have known that with the exception of playing the infamous Freddy Kreuger Englund's other attempts at horror have fell flat (The Phantom of The Opera, Python, Dance Macabre and so on.) I will say however that I have NO doubt that 2001 Maniacs will thrive as a cult classic and somehow it will most certainly find an audience with horror fans who love complete camp, and utter stupidity and over the top ridiculously humorous death scenes. The film was made with not horror in made but silly stupid blood splattering, breast baring type of slasher flick. And it just doesn't work for this one.Robert Englund does a decent job as Mayor Buckman, the ghost Mayor a small town wiped out during the civil war. Now he leads his town folk back to the living to get vengeance on anyone who happens into their town. Englund is appropriately deranged although he doesn't directly do much if any of the killing. He is definitely a figure head and used as such but he is one of the better campier characters. Jay Gillespie plays the lead college student who gets him and his friends stuck in this town of horror. He is appropriately handsome and typical for the part and does a decent job being the hero of the story. Gina Marie Heekin, Brian Gross, Mushond Lee, and Bianca Smith I think are all the actors that play the other doomed college students looking for a good time but get picked off one by one due to the usual stupidity like promiscuous sex, following the wrong person to the wrong place and so on. I will give kudos to Lin Shaye, a veteran actress who plays Granny Boone, the horrendously disturbed matriarch of this town who likes to fry up some of her killings and eat them. I saw Shaye recently in the spectacular horror film Dead End and she really does a great job in this film. Wendy Kremer, Ryan Fleming, and Giuseppe Andrews all play main role Maniacs in the film and their characters are great...hilarious, campy, and completely deranged.So with a cast that is decent and characters that are funny, campy and horrific what is so wrong with this movie?? Story, script, setting, BORING!! It wasn't believable for a second and I know horror films don't have to be but at the same there should be some sort of sense to it. There was absolutely NO reason that these 6 kids would stay in this completely out of the way, no power, no modern appliances little village when they were on their way to Daytona. On top of that there was ZERO suspense, and the death scenes which in a slasher/horror flick should be original, gory, even maybe a little realistic were so stupid they did nothing but cause eye rolls. It is really a shame considering the originality of the cast and killers and what they had was potential for a real series here. Director and co-writer Tim Sullivan slapped together something that felt more like a teenagers class film project and none of it worked. You didn't care about any of them and it was just boring. The nudity, which in horror films is always blatant and overused, was so forced that it was annoying...and I mean hey it's nudity but still it just all BORED ME. I would only suffice to say that this film is only for the true campy horror fan who will probably love the way it was done. If you're just the average movie goer you're gonna think this is stupid and a waste of time and probably give it far less than what I gave it credit for. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of typically sex-crazed obnoxious northerners take a wrong turn on their way to Daytona Beach and wind up(thanks to some detour sign)in Pleasant Valley where they are greeted rather warmly(albeit a bit sinister)by the southern town folk. Then they all begin being slaughtered by these people as they get revenge for having perished during the Civil War. Robert Englund is indeed a hoot as the head of this southern clan as they butcher and maim these kids(one dies from acid, another gets pulled apart by horses). If one wonders how to take this film seriously at all should've taken a look at the cover of the box which features a crazed Englund donning a confederate themed eye patch. The film is one long gory comedy as we either are turned off at the excessive violence or giggle at the silliness of it. It's certainly geared for those who are willing to let go and just watch not taking anything really that serious. It has written all over it.."This is only a movie." A film like this will have a built-in fan base for it delivers on the gore and hokey humor(specifically covering every hick joke known to man except the fart gags). If you are easily offended or can not bend a little in the implausibility of it all..stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am a huge horror film fan who has a special soft spot for slasher films. Nothing can beat the early works of Argento, Carpenter or Hooper in my opinion, especially the horror films, by and large, over the past 10 years. Recently, we've had a few decent throwbacks to the genre which have revitalized my interest in these cheap, schlock filled movies.When you see the cover of this film, you immediately see a familiar face, Robert Englund of A Nightmare On Elm Street fame. Seeing him dressed up as a Civil War era character, donning a huge Confederate battle flag as an eye patch, I simply had to see this, hoping for crazed, over the top goodness.Let me start off with the good points of 2001 Maniacs, bc though there aren't many, they do really deliver. The violence in this film will satisfy any gore hound. I thought they did a spectacular job on the violence, making it bloody, but not sickening...over the top, but not way over the top...shockingly brutal, but not disgusting. The fates that the victims of the towns folk meet are all ultra violent, but presented with a collective wink of the eye from everyone involved. And of course, Englund steals the show as a crazed Southern mayor who goes as pleasingly far over the top without hamming it up too much. And also, I won't say who, but one of the group who I thought would be the main character was one of the first ones to bite the dust! I thought this aspect was awesome, as to me it was mildly surprising, but it was probably accidental as a product of bad editing. And of course, blink if you miss him, Kane Hodder (aka Jason of Friday the 13th Parts 7-10) pokes up literally for half a second just for the hell of it. Cheap a trick as it is, I just love it when movies throw us horror film buffs a bone by giving us 'a no one else in the room will understand why the hell we are pointing at the TV and yelling some random actor's name that they've never heard of while spilling our beer on the floor' moment that reminds us that we are who we are. Sadly, Hodder just grimaces for the camera in a quick shot, and does not get to go all Jason on anyone this time around, but hey, I enjoyed it.However, the rest of the movie is kind of hard to sit through. I am talking of course, about the acting. Oh man, was this a misfire! Now, I know that slashers are not known for their Oscar caliber acting...in fact, some of the best ones have some of the kids acting so bad, it makes the movie good. Now, there are some out there that actually have good, believable acting that 20 somethings would actually act like. The worst slashers, in my opinion, are the ones that have actors who act painfully bad, but are trying their best to be serious. This film starts off with line after line, of horrendously bad dialogue delivered by impossibly unbelievable actors you won't give a damn about when they meet their demise. I mean seriously, how hard is it to find someone who can act like a normal human being? The acting in this film ruins any type of feelings you would ever have for someone in this situation. I hated Cabin Fever (which Eli Roth, who I think is incredibly overrated, is a producer of this film, and has a cameo early on), but at least that film had some somewhat believable acting.Speaking of Roth, his fingerprints are all over this film. You can see a lot of parallels between Cabin Fever and 2001 Maniacs if you have a sharp eye (especially a few of the actors who are in both movies). Both films have a situation that could have been...should have been great, but fail miserably to millions of plot holes, a razor thin plot and acting that would make Ed Wood frown at. Since this movie never makes you care about anyone, or establishes any sort of hero, you are left with whoever is left at the end, in an ending that makes little sense, nor is fully explained (though, the final minute was a welcome change of pace).One thing I didn't get was, if these people were supposed to be what was explained at the end, why in the hell did Englund duck from a flying axe, and cower at the threat of impalement? Why would I even care to ask such a question after watching a cheap horror film? Exactly my point...the reason I did ask this, and many more questions after watching this movie was because the story never brought any type of mystique to the townsfolk...we merely see that they are all crazy, most of whom do a horrible job of projecting it. You never really get entranced into the situation which means this movie will never scare you. A movie like this should be dripping with atmosphere (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre)...not do nothing but deliver cheap jokes about Southerners and then show the occasional scene of carnage.If you want to see some good gore scenes and have an ability to filter out painfully bad acting and a razor thin plot, then give 2001 Maniacs a try. It is definitely not the worst film you will ever see, but if you are a horror buff, whom I presume this film was made for, you will be severely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was funny and the death scenes were just freaking awesome! I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Good stuff right here. The people of Pleasant Valley were just cruel and very unusual. You were either on the killers side or the victims, whichever way you go the movie is still great. The ending was funny and gory. 2001 Maniacs was definitely a good rebel south horror movie. 2001 Maniacs follows it's original, Two Thousand Maniacs, very well. Stayed very true. The Twilight Zone twist was pretty good, so look out for that. The acting was mediocre, but overall the movie was great. 2001 Maniacs is a fun movie, you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black horror comedy with all its priorities in the right place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tongue in cheek horror comedy with its priorities in the right place. This sequel to Herschell Gordon Lewis's rather tepid Southern "classic" dishes up gallons of gallows humor, splendiferous gore, non-PC lashings of nudity and handsome images courtesy of Steve Adcock. Tim Sullivan, the very capable director, delivers all the elements in excessive servings and laces the proceedings with a welcome surplus of sexuality that makes the film feel more European than American (since Americans lost interest in cinematic sexual intercourse a few decades ago). Every woman is a sex machine and every dude wants to hop on. Special mention must go to the hot Southern belle "kissing cousins" who are given every opportunity to kiss, caress and fondle each other for our delectation. The plot is simplicity itself and runs out of steam fifteen minutes out from home time, but the point here is recreating the Lewis vibe by updating the Godfather of Gore's oeuvre with modern razzle dazzle and meaty dismemberments. Robert Englund as Mayor Buckman has great fun with his role as Master of Ceremonies. Worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's at least what this movie should have done...I was looking forward to seeing this movie, and after reading many reviews here on IMDb, i thought that this would be a given hit in my eyes. How wrong i was!!! I think the idea is fair enough. It's actually good. I'm a screenwriter myself and this is a great story to a horror movie. At least if you know how to make a horror movie! And i must say that this isn't much of a movie. The acting and direction blows. It seems like his movie was made just because they wanted to make a movie. Quick and ruthless. Putting Mr. Robert Englund in a movie like this??? Maybe? he doesn't have that many job-offers, but please!! And what about the cameos of Kane Hodder and Eli Roth? Why does Roth play the same character he did in his own movie CABIN FEVER? I understand that this is an internal joke between the two directors, but it fails big time. He doesn't fit in the story at all!!! (by the way i love CABIN FEVER and HOSTEL)Why does all these kids arrive in the city at the same time? Embarising!!!Some of the scenes look like the start of a porn-flick. Lesbian blonde's trying to act. Please again!! But they did make me laugh. Because of the lousy acting of course...Even the gore-scenes were bad! My advice is to stay away! Far far away!!!</fullReview>

Yep, that's probably the number of people WORLDWIDE who thought this was OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This.... This movie.... This movie was the worst flick i have ever seen! The acting was terrible. The plot was not so dumb it was funny, it was so dumb that it made you cry out in agony just because of the sheer stupidity. Man, i would rather watch "House of the Dead" Than this movie. And that movie was bad! The only positive thing about this movie, is the boobs. But there is to few of them.. Its just so idiotic. stupid. annoying! I don't understand how somebody can make a movie as bad as this. and i can not understand why people give this movie 10 stars.. They must be drunk! very drunk! You say "oh he's a genius" etc. but this is a work of idiots. There is absolutely nothing positive to say about this movie. Bad effects, bad sound, bad acting, bad dialouge, bad plot, bad twists and the worst ending i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really sick of this type of horror film---slick and glossy and trying so hard to be cute and witty.This is just another waste of time in a horror fan's quest to find the good horror films.These people ripped off HG Lewis and still managed to make a lame movie.A group of college kids head to Daytona on spring break and get detoured through a small southern town and are the guests to the town BBQ.You can pretty much figure out the rest from there.Lots of rubber heads spewing watery looking blood and body parts here and there.The usual standard crap film stuff.A silly almost nonexistent plot and sub-par acting and no suspense at all makes this film lame as a wet noodle.Even the few bare breasts thrown in couldn't save this movie.Robert Englund does a decent enough job with the silly lines he was given but all the other folks in this film were pretty rotten actors.The writing was awful as well---just a bunch of catchphrases and lines meant to sound cool strung together in one scene after another.I really hate horror movie directors that keep churning out these kinds of cutesy witless horror movies full of dim-bulb teens just standing around waiting to get killed in some supposedly new horrible way.I've seen enough dead teens to last a lifetime.It's time for horror film directors to move on down the road to something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even bad movies get remade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just not with good results. This is a remake of the Gordon Herschell Lewis splatter film, 2000 Maniacs. And it's not an improvement.The 1964 version had some plausibility. This one the characters should have run screaming almost immediately, but I guess it's because we've had so many "Killer Rural People" movies since 1964, the Cliché hadn't been worn out yet.So the kills and the sex are more graphic, so that's something. Also, they outright say the ghosts are cannibals, something they only hinted at in the other movie.There's also a point where one of the victims is crushed just like the gal in the 1964 version. Except in this one, she supposed to be Chinese and the make a racist joke about eating her remains. Except the girl didn't even look remotely Asian. She was just some loser from a reality show trying to be an actress and failing. I mean, if you are going to insert a racist joke in your movie, at least get the casting right. (Or you could just avoid the racist joke, because it just wasn't funny. Neither were repeated bestiality jokes.) Okay, then we get to Robert Englund. Got to feel sorry for Robert, Freddie Krueger ruined his life. People forgot he could act. Here he's making a maudlin effort with bad material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is What The Monkees Meant By A "Pleasant Valley Sunday"...NOT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let this be a warning to you right off the bat, dear reader and horror fan: if you have the kind of 'political correctness' meter that sounds the alarm at fart jokes, you will want to stay VERY FAR AWAY from the likes of 2001 MANIACS. If you're a hardier horror buff who likes your flicks to follow the "Triple-B" Rule, (Babes, Boobs and Blood), then YEEEE-HAAAW, Bubba! Y'all jest struck GOLD! There's more swingin' jugs and spurtin' jugulars here than you'd find everywhere else, plus the 'bestest 'finger-lickin' good' barbecue this side of a Texas Chainsaw Family Reunion!If you know your horror history, you know that 2001 MANIACS is the lovingly-rendered redo of the gore-tastic Herschell Gordon Lewis' signature grue-fest 2000 MANIACS, here given the full-tilt millennium 'makeover.'The good-humored ghouls of Pleasant Valley, GA. (population: well - look at the title, genius!) are 'DIED-in-the-wool' Southerners who don't take too kindly to stray Yankees who trespass on their turf. It probably doesn't help that over 200 years ago, every inhabitant was slaughtered by Sherman's army as he and his men raped, razed and rip- snorted their way through to HOTLanta. So their vengeful, zombiefied ghosts return each year for a little payback. A fake detour sign misdirects unwitting travelers to Pleasant Valley, where every day is the celebration of the "Guts And Glory Jubilee", and the lost tourists are always the 'guests of honor' at the Jubilee barbecue...where they also do double-duty as THE MAIN COURSE!!! But in-between those two plot points, seduction and slaughter of every imaginable kind abounds.This time, eight friends who are classmates from the same college are on their way to Daytona Beach for Spring Break...and all the babes, booze and beer they can handle! Thanks to a wayward short cut that gets them lost, and that rigged "detour" sign that points them right into the heart of Pleasant Valley, there's one element they can add to that list - BLOOD - as in their own!!!Once the kids hit town, it would take a moron not to figure out that there is something unpleasantly weird about these grinning, welcoming, backwoods "hell-billys" (led by a gleefully demented Robert "Freddy Krueger" Englund.) But then for college students, none of these guys (or girls) are particularly the brightest light-bulbs in the pack. What they are, are the soon-to-be 'entrées'...er, I mean 'guests of honor' welcomed to the Valley by the overly friendly Mayor Buckman (Englund), who are at first as charmed as they are freaked at this little backwater burg, where they seem to take dedication to the whole "Civil-War era reenactment" thing a little too seriously. Of course, they learn all too late...it's NOT an act.Director Tim Sullivan, scripting here with co-writer Chris Kobin, knows that 'Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun' - and that includes the audience. Those movie watchers who would be profoundly outraged and insulted by 2001 MANIACS probably wouldn't (and shouldn't) be renting or going out to see this anyway. For the rest of us...well, we know what we want and what we like to see in our horror films, and thankfully, Tim provides it in abundance! Not content to merely rehash the Lewis original, he surprises with hysterical references to other movies, while keeping the action going and the blood flowing! (Think of a couple of scenes here as DELIVERANCE by way of AIRPLANE!, and you get the tone of it!)The death scenes, if not completely original in some ways, are still delivered with gruesome effectiveness, and there is a nice "Tales From The Crypt"-style ending to wrap it neatly with a pretty, dripping-red bow.Oh, and BTW, did I mention that this is unofficially a 'musical'? That's right, gore-hounds! A couple of ZZ Top-types, (just with banjos and 'sharp-dressed men' for the 1700's) deliver some spicy song commentary on the action! But thankfully, the ditties are inserted in a way that is terrific and not tiresome. All in all, for an evening of blood and boobs, you might think you can do better than 2001 MANIACS, but that's debatable. I know you can do worse! And I have - trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read that some people find this movie insulting to the South. This movie is insulting to anyone unfortunate enough to have stumbled across it on cable TV. I mean, some people might consider it "camp," but it is more crap. Let me set it up for you, there are a bunch of sex-starved college kids that stumble on to this town in the deep South. This town has a bunch of old-school Southern types that dress in elaborate clothes and talk with outrageous accents. Well, these Southerners secretly want to kill each one of these college kids in the most violent possible ways. They ram spears up rectums, they draw and quarter, and these are some of the more tame methods of execution. Mind you, none of this is scary, the whole plot is driven by how gruesome they can murder these college kids. There are Confederate flags everywhere and we are supposed to believe that this is the type of behavior you can expect from people that live in the South. I just grow tired of idiots that rationalize this crap and pretend that it is just mindless entertainment that is not supposed to be taken seriously. This crap was derived from a warped mind and is intended for other people who have warped minds. If you are in a house and see that the person that lives there actually has a copy of this, well, I would be looking for an exit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Englund's Over The Top Performance Is Worth The Rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three college students decide to travel to Florida for some fun at Spring Break. After seeing a detour sign, they take the dirt road in hoping to get to their destination a little quicker. Soon they discover a little town called Pleasant Valley. Five more people show up right after them and decide to stay the night for some celebration.2001 Maniacs sounds promising for the old school B-horror movie fans. A bunch of young college kids, go to this town and the residents decide to kill them and eat them. Crazy isn't it? Well, what should have been and what could have been is missing in 2001 maniacs. Call it a sequel or a remake of the 1964 film Two Thousand Maniacs, 2001 maniacs suffers from trying to be over the top but failing to do so. The deaths are good to watch and with a little bit more blood, then the fun time that is suppose to be had by this film could have been achieved. You're suppose to laugh with this movie and in some cases you do, but in others you are wondering why am I watching this?What could have, what should have, is exactly what 2001 maniacs is. With a premise such as this film has, you would expect over the top gory funny and unique deaths. You do get these qualities in the deaths, but they are not anything that one would expect. When you are about to see a women lose all their limbs from horses running in opposite directions, you get excited a little bit, if you're into that sort of thing, but in Maniacs it losses it touch.The goal of this film is to be a throw back to the old cheesy bad horror movies, and it achieves this goal. The dialogue is cheesy, the deaths are gory (although you'd expect more), there's nudity from young hot chicks, and of course the villains are crazy as hell, so crazy that you may even root for them in their evil goals. Some things you may question in the film, such as why would such a young and hot woman, known as Kat, be attracted to a southern hillbilly with awkward teeth, or even why the one character arms wrestles another to see who will give or receive in some homosexual sex. This film definitely pokes fun at the south, having some characters chase after animals with that twinkle of love in their eye.Maniacs has a good build up but the delivery is kind of weak. The ending horrible and tries to take the film in a whole other direction. If there were a different ending then this film would have been graded a bit higher. I can see a future for Tim Sullivan in the horror genre, if he had some better material.So how can I give this flick a recommendation, well it lies in the over the top performance from Robert Englund, who is the highlight of Maniacs. His role is so juicy and fun to watch that every time he isn't on screen you feel bored by the flick. I recommend this flick for fans of Englund and fans of the genre. If you're into some cheesy dialogue and violence just for the sake of violence, then 2001 Maniacs is right up your alley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 maniacs is essentially a grind house movie if you look at it. The story is the third most important part of the film, after gore and sex. That being said, i do not really mind that since i am a fan of gore myself.The plot in the movie is not anything new, a bunch of teenagers gets into trouble with the supernatural. You have seen that several times if your a fan of horror. What makes this movie better than average is the fact that it's self avare of it. It doesn't try to be the shining or something like that, instead we get pure grind house fun. The camera is even outdated for the time, a pretty classic grind house team (since they were made on a shoestring budget).Robert Englund is great as the main villain (As always), the main cast of teens are bad and the acting overall from them is stale and uninspiring. What makes this movie fun to watch is the interaction of the teens (Bad acting) with the townspeople (mostly good acting). The plot moves along with a decent speed so you are never bored with it, and the climax is pretty good.Another thing that really make it feel like a grind house aside from the gore and the sex are the fact that it is not scared of taking the low road. It's rare to have such strong language in horror movies that are mainstream produced as this one has. "Boy, Negro, Chinaman (Sorry, Chinawoman) and such. Its a movie that doesn't care at all and is just out to entertain you.Is it better than 2000 maniacs? No, it is. not Is it a bad movie? Yes it is, but it's also a pretty decent one. Once again, that is if you see this movie as a grind house movie, which it really isn't, but there are strong influence by the grind house cinema in it. The best part of this movie is the kills, that isn't anything strange since that's true 90% of the time when there is a body count. But there is also a pretty fun dark humor in this film that doesn't go unnoticed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The South well and truly rises again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'2001 Maniacs.' You could sort of leave the review there. If the title alone doesn't tell you everything you'll need to know about the film then nothing will. It's a film like 'Snakes on the Plane' where you should know whether you'll like it or not before you even sit down. Basically, it's a pretty ludicrous premise ? a handful of those annoyingly good-looking American teens end up in the wrong town at the wrong town where ? guess what ? they come a cropper up against 2001 complete nut-jobs.The stars, i.e. those we're supposed to root for, are pretty run-of-the-mill. They're basically there to be dismembered in as many gruesome ways possible. The real stars are the people we hope we never have to meet (and yet still enjoy seeing on screen). The town is filled by Americans from the 'North versus South' era of U.S. history and they're not too pleased with the way the war turned out. Therefore, now led by the ever excellent (and possibly insane) Robert Englund and Lin Shaye, they're looking to reap revenge on those stuck-up 'Northerners.' It's effectively a slasher film, only the town is basically one great home to slashers. You don't watch this sort of film for its character development or deep and meaningful story arcs. You watch it because it's daft and silly (and pretty damn gory ? it does have some pretty inventive death scenes). If you're into your gore-fests then you'll probably enjoy it simply on Englund and Shaye's performances alone.Just put your brain on hold and appreciate it for being a very low-brow and completely twisted piece of entertainment. But, whatever you do, don't go near the sequel. This is one film that's best left on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demented cannibal comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 MANIACS is a cheesy B-movie remake of a cult H. G. Wells gore film of the 1960s entitled 2000 MANIACS. This is a low budget production, packed to the brim with rubbery gore effects and a hammy turn from A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET star Robert Englund, and yet despite (or maybe because of) all this it turns out to be a surprisingly enjoyable little movie.I think the film works because the tone is just right. There's a ton of black comedy here, some of it blacker than black (like when the black guy turns up in the southern town asking where black guys hang around, and the locals point him to the nearest lynching tree). The story is relatively fast-paced, and you can be sure that there will be a grisly murder just around the next corner.The acting is less impressive, and some of the characters are just a little TOO over the top (yes, even in a film like this) but yet it somehow hangs together. It's clear that Englund is having a ball as the demented town mayor and there are cameos from Peter Stormare and Eli Roth as the story progresses. None of it is scary or disturbing, but it is funny in places and it's certainly miles better than the amateurish original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody can imitate the fiendish charm that comes with everything cult director Herschell Gordon Lewis touches, but this movie seems more than willing to give it a try anyway. It's all there: the cartoonish gore, the delightfully sinister story, the gratuitous nudity, the ridiculously hammy acting, it's pretty much the best exploitation movie 2005 can hand you. It may lack that ugly, grainy 60s film stock, but trust me it still looks low-budget enough. The pace is pretty good and the build-up is nicely written, though it is kinda weird that the first kill to me is the best/funniest. All of them are good, but the coolest one they came up with is already used fifteen minutes in. Speaking of weird, the supposed Southern belles that still live in the 1800s all look like Playboy models, which is distracting in more ways than one. One even had fake nails for God's sake, doesn't make too much sense. And what's with that Chinese character? Most horror movies at least get Asian actors so they're close enough, here they just use a Caucasian actress and say she's Chinese about five times a minute. Heck, they'll believe it eventually. None of this bothers me too much though. "2001 Maniacs" is a lot of gory fun, but obviously it's still no "Two Thousand Maniacs".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Goofball Gore-Fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My latest bargain-bin pickup, "2001 Maniacs," turned out to be a goofy, gore- soaked good time that was well worth the $3.99 I paid. A 21st Century update of Herschell Gordon Lewis' 1960s classic "2000 Maniacs" (which remains unseen by me, though now I want to check it out after seeing this homage), the film delivered exactly what I expected to see: loads of scantily clad women, lots of juvenile humor, and blood &amp; guts galore. If those three components are all you need to enjoy a B-movie, then you can pick "2001 Maniacs" up with confidence.The story of "2001 Maniacs" is basic "fish out of water" horror-film 101: A group of horny-n-stupid college students on their way to Daytona Beach for Spring Break are pulled off the main road by a suspicious "Detour" sign and wind up in the picturesque small Southern town of Pleasant Valley, deep in the heart of nowhere. Pleasant Valley is a lovely little burg where time apparently stopped before things like indoor plumbing and electricity were invented. The locals are absolutely giddy to welcome the newcomers to their happy little town and invite them all to stay for the annual Jubilee and Barbecue, which is about to begin. Our troop of idiot twenty-somethings are entranced by the attractive surroundings at first, but eventually begin to pick up on the fact that Something Is Not Right Here. Of course, by the time they come to this realization it's already too late to pack up and get the hell outta Dodge, as it is revealed that the "friendly" locals are actually the angry spirits of an entire town that was massacred by Union troops at the end of the Civil War. Once a year on the anniversary date of the massacre, the ghouls return to the Earthly plane to sucker as many modern-day victims as they can get their hands/claws on to even the score for the wrongs committed against them. They've been doing this for a long time, so the citizens of Pleasant Valley have a large number of creative gross-out methods (victims are drawn &amp; quartered, force fed acid, and crushed beneath massive weights, to name just a few) for doing away with the young interlopers before the majority of them wind up on platters at the Jubilee-ending "Barbecue!" Robert "Freddy Krueger" Englund is obviously having a ball in his role as the Mayor of Pleasant Valley, proudly sporting a Rebel Flag eyepatch and camping it up for all he's worth. Aside from Englund and B-Movie legend Lin Shaye as the ghoulish "Granny," the rest of the cast was unknown to me, but they're a good looking bunch and they perform their roles (which are pretty much limited to ogling members of the opposite sex and then dying in various horrible ways) satisfactorily. This flick isn't a "thinking man's horror film" by any means, so while gorehounds will have a blast with this one, those of you who expect more from your horror than a constant barrage of T&amp;A and cannibalistic blood-n-guts will want to move on to something else. I myself thought it was a hoot and I'd gladly watch "the South rise again" anytime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the original Two Thousand Maniacs, you won't miss anything. I saw it way back when, and thought it was good. But, the sequel, 2001 Maniacs buried it so deep it may never rise again. They are similar, but still unrelated works.The general plot is the same for both films. A small town of Pleasant Valley is holding a celebration, and looking for some Yanks to attend as the guests of honor. And, like the original, its set in 'modern day' America. But that is about as far as the similarities go. The cast is more faithful to modern people, young and old, and have much more fun with things.This film has all the things missing from the original film, such as nudity, racism, gore, violence, and so on. And, they also throw in some twists as well. Even the music is more enjoyable this time around, which is a blessing I think. But, if you are easily offended, no matter where you sit, this film will likely have you upset, even if you do laugh at some of it.All in all, I've seen this more than two dozen times, and still laugh at it. No matter which side you favor, they poke fun at all of them, and leave you with a final cut that will bleed whenever you see something in real life that reminds you of this film. My pick has to be the local Sheriff who hears the report, toward the end of the film. Living in the South, I wonder who they picked to be the model for his role, as it is 100% accurate, right down to the issue of the horror magazine he's reading. That may be the scariest thing about this whole film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Lewis, the "Godfather Of Gore", provides the inspiration here for this remake/re-imagining of his minor cult classic, 2000 Maniacs. If you are familiar with his work then you should love this, it's kind of just like a movie perfectly marrying his sensibilities with a decent budget and cast.Robert Englund plays the main bad guy, a good ole Southerner helping his townsfolk enjoy their "jubilee celebrations" with the help of some home cookin' from Lin Shaye and willing victims in the shape of sidetracked (aren't they always?) teens.There's plenty of nudity and crazy gore and it's all very tongue in cheek. Some of the sex scenes have amusing punchlines and most of the gore is ridiculously over the top, well executed but never anything to take too seriously.Add some fun song lyrics, running gags about bestiality and a brisk pace in between the disappearance of each character (yeah, it's one of those movies where people disappear one by one without raising too much suspicion) and you have a fun movie for fans of horror that doesn't care how you look down upon it as long as you are looking.NB: This review was first placed here under my RockySchlockyRobot ID since lost in the mists of time.</fullReview>

This release is packed with extras! I would like to point out to readers though that no matter how hard a DVD company tries to convince you?subtitles and closed captions are not bonus features.I'd like to point out a few facts as well?for starters; Eli Roth is back to reprise his role from Cabin Fever as wonky drifter Justin (Eli Roth) and his good buddy Dr. Mambo (the dog) is back as well! Eagle eyed viewers may also spot Tim Sullivan hammering on a coffin and Scott Spiegel (Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2, The Dead Next Door) as one of the hillbilly banjo singers that constantly wander about the movie! So, for those of you looking for a damn good film, run, don't walk, to your nearest Best Buy and purchase 2001 Maniacs. Don't hesitate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's spring break and all the kids head off to Daytona, but are mislead down a detour that ends them up in a hillbilly heaven...or hell as they soon learn. The people all have southern hospitality and the kids think its a Cival War reenactment, but soon find out they are cannibals ghosts of the dead soldiers and families from centuries before.I liked this film, although its a remake of Hershel Gordon Lewis' 64 classic it really isn't a carbon copy. It is completely original on ideas and methods of killing. Lewis did his movie in a time when it was rare to see blood and guts, but in 2005 when this one was made it was just another horror flick. It did have lots of blood and gore and also something that is missing from many horror movies...sex and nudity. I loved that aspect of it, it was loaded with sexuality, even homosexuality and I think sex is great in horrors.The kids playing these parts were your average jerks that you actually wanted to see die, it was a slasher lovers fantasy to see them taken out one by one.The direction was OK, and the music was fun and appropriate, the hillbilly ways seemed authentic and I must say its a nice film. Very 80's feeling.Great actors like Robert Englund and my favorite actress of all time Lin Shaye. Eli Roth was one of the producers and he played the same guy he had played in his movie Cabin Fever. Other great actors Gioseppe Andrews, Peter Stormare, Brian Gross, Ryan Flemming, Travis Tritt and a small part for Kane Hodder...great casting.I should give this movie a higher rating but this made my 4th time watching it and it seems to lose charm the more I see it, its got blood and gore and t&amp;a and comedy and great acting and great kills...4/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really bugs me when a movie like this comes out that is obviously not trying to be "scary" or use state-of-the-art effects and someone HAS to comment on how bad it was with remarks like "This movie was not scary at all" or "the effects were so cheap and fake". That's exactly what this movie was going for, it's a horror movie, it's supposed to be horrible! The plot, I will admit was clichéd, preppy city kids headed to the beach get caught up with a bunch of Confederate cannibal hicks. Heard that or a variation of it before. But the movie has tons of gore and some good nudity thrown in to keep things interesting as well. It slows down a bit towards the end but it was still able to keep my attention. Did I mention that it is REALLY gory? I think the only reason this movie managed to avoid being "unrated" (which sometimes means nothing nowadays) was because the gore was so ridiculous and over the top. Watch Cabin Fever, Waxwork 2, or Slither, you'll see what I'm talking about. Quartering, impalement, acid-drinking, pressurized eye-popping, blood spurting and such. Come on. When's the last time you saw someone get drawn and quartered in a horror film? The make-up effects department gets really creative on this one. Watch this alone or with someone who "gets" it. Watch it with someone who enjoys movies like the re-make of "The Hills Have Eyes" or "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and more than likely you will hear one of the comments mentioned above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three college guys decide to drive to Daytona Beach for Spring Break. On the way they stop for some gas and run into two hot girls with a gay guy. They invite the girls to join them in Florida. During the night drive, the driver has to take a detour. In the morning they end up in a town called Pleasant Valley and receive a warm welcome from the mayor and the entire town which is about to celebrate its jubilee. The girls and the guy also end up there and so does a black biker and his Asian girlfriend.The guys are enticed to stay by beautiful girls who seem to be always in the mood. But the excessive friendliness doesn't seem right and sure enough, the kids start disappearing.This is an entertaining horror movie with plenty of gore, attractive girls, and nudity. The acting is at times weak and the voice recording is rather poor. The violence and gore are quite original and the effects well done. The story really overdoes the hillbilly stereotype but overall the movie is a lot of fun nevertheless.In addition this movie has one of the best endings of any horror movie. There is an explanation about the townsfolk and also a twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: It's spring break and everyone is headed for Florida. Anderson and his friends just got a ultimatum from their professor though. They have to redo their term paper on the civil war, or they will be expelled. And they have to turn them in by the end of spring break. However, party first, school later and they head for Florida. But they get lost on the way and end up in Pleasant Valley, population 2001. And they are just about to have their "Guts and G(l)ory Jubilee". Along with a few other outsiders they take up the mayors offer to stay, but soon something seems to be very, very wrong.Comments: I caught this late on a movie channel, and almost directly wished I hadn't. But that happens when you confuse Matthew Carey with Matthew Perry and expect a harmless comedy. My mistake. This is certainly not the type of comedy that Matthew Perry usually end up in. This is the kind of movie where Robert Englund plays the mayor (and the TV guide had left his name out, gee thanks.). So this is a slasher movie, still not sure if comedy applies, even if the guides says so.Sure, not exactly what I expected but it is sometimes at those times you find those rare gems. This is certainly not one of those times. This is for teenage boys, and most probably also written by teenage boys. Blood, gore are literally brutally mixed with lingerie, nudity, breasts and girls kissing. And basically that is all there is. Just a lot of it. No real jokes, no suspense. Just blood and sex. Yuk. So if you have grown up above the mental age of thirteen, leave it alone. By the way, leave it alone anyway.I can't believe they got Peter Stormare to do a small part in this. Fortunately for my faith in him he only appears a few minutes at the beginning and hopefully didn't know what the rest was about. If you hadn't figured it out already, I didn't like it at all. In fact this is one of very few movie I can't see any time or place it would work. It is one of the few I recommend people to stay absolutely clear of (incidentally, and no offence to him, it is not the first which stars Englund). Don't watch it. There are a lot of things that's better to do with your time. Like bringing it out with the garbage?2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the? fun of watching a very campy movie known as "2001 Maniacs," which I guess was a remake of the '64 movie "Ten Thousand Maniacs." It's really about a group of college kids that travel to a small southern town for spring break only to find out that everybody that inhabits this town are psychopathic cannibals. I don't know where to begin with this review.First off, there were a lot of bloody effects and it was pretty gory. I enjoyed this, and some of the strategies used to 'off' the characters were pretty gruesome. The main problem that I had with this movie was that the horror and gore aspect of the film is overshadowed by the slapstick comedy, the crude redneck humor the terrible puns. Most people would find some of the puns funny but I found them campy and unnecessary and it was so over the top.What I found a little displeasing was how they viewed Southerners: there is a retarded kid that likes to kill cats, a young man who wants to have sex with a sheep, inbred sisters, a dumbfounded black man and everybody seems talks in stereotypical southern lingo. I am from the south so I am a little iffy on that but I can overlook it.This movie wants to be a horror comedy but it failed as a horror movie and I can only consider it as a comedy. Sure there is gore, some scares and a lot of deaths and cannibalism but I found myself laughing over ridiculous actions. The movie, of course for sex appeal, it littered with gorgeous girls who serve no purpose but as eye candy. I have not seen the original one, I might have to so that I can compare them? but I could still watch this movie again and find it appealing as a dark comedy, but I cannot say that this is everything a horror is. If you like "Dead Alive," "The Frighteners" or even "Shaun of the Dead" then you might like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of tourists stumble upon a small town called Pleasant Valley filled with cheerful good natured town folk that seems to be stuck back in the civil war days. Led by the cheerful Mayor Buckman (ROBERT ENGLUND) they invite the guests to stay with them for a few days, at first they are not to sure about this place or it's residents, however as the days go on, the warmth &amp; kind hospitality of the town &amp; it's many citizens win them over, that &amp; the fact that a lot of the girls &amp; guys in the town are hot (We'll that's mostly the main reason) however the good looks of some of the townsfolk &amp; the kind hospitality soon proves to be nothing more than a cover-up as they are soon revealed to be ghosts of those slaughtered in the war, who take revenge on the tourists in bloody fashion, hacking &amp; hewing them to pieces in a variety of gross bloody ways in order to serve them up as BBQ meat for the celebration! Will the remaining survivors escape alive or will the south rise again with the remaining few joining their friends as human BBQ? Remake of the original H.G. LEWIS classic splatter flick 2000 MANIACS is a fun, funny, wild &amp; gruesome ride that should wet the appetite of any gore hound &amp; those looking to take their horror movies none to seriously. The good acting, directing &amp; special effects, not to mention the humorous take on the whole subject matter make this a very entertaining entry to the horror genre with a good looking cast &amp; many sexy moments (&amp; just as many gory ones) I've never seen the original film though I'm assuming this treads along the same ground as it did. Highly recommended! The in jokes on the Pioneer lifestyles &amp; small town sweaty folk is always funny too.

		<shortDescription>Dumb mixed up stereotypical hogwash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I can appreciate a healthy horror of the Civil War-obsessed racist inbred Deep South like anyone else, but like any stereotype, the fear says about as much about the culture it's applied to as to the culture that applied it--if not more. In this case, the stereotypes went way beyond far and ended up making a perverse and absurd portrait of the filmmakers as people who have absolutely no clue as to what they're film-making except that they've seen Gone with the Wind and Deliverance. They can't even keep their own stereotypes right, resulting in a completely confusing amalgam of Southern gentile, inbred hillbilly, and racist hack in ways that show absolutely no actual knowledge on how those stereotypes came to be (not to mention a complete lack of knowledge as to the role of class in the pre-Civil War South, meaning the relationships between the townsfolk are completely unbelievable as well).So the basic deal is that a bunch of Yanks heading to Florida for Spring Break get side-tracked into a small town of Pleasant Valley, a seemingly innocuous re-enactment village that invites them to join in the festivities. But actually they are being led into a ghost town where the vengeful corpses of Civil War past want to kill as many Yanks as townspeople were massacred in the Civil War, that is, 2001 of them. However, instead of getting right to it or really making short work of it, the movie must absolutely be feature length, and so it stretches out the horror, usually with more than just the usual amount of sex. Thus we get the trifecta of awful horror movie approaches: characters driven entirely by their reproductive organs; bad Southern accents; and the old Fantastic Tales cliché of "Something bad happened! Oh wait, that can't be, those people are actually dead!" With DVD making it easier than ever to distribute pretty much any movie in existence and fanboys like Tarantino and Eli Roth (the latter who co-produced this monstrosity) bringing grindhouse back into its niche, remakes of Herschell Gordon Lewis movies are becoming popular, especially recently. I can't speak to how this movie compares to the original, but I do know that HGL made up for poor production design and bad acting by usually stunning and always inventive arrays of lo-fi gore effects. This movie, however, is pretty "been there, done that", and really only resides for the sole purpose of saying "Hey! Hey! Hey guys! Southerners, right! Crazy, right! Hillbillies, y'know! Crazy!" This comes complete with an entirely arbitrary take-off of the infamous Battling Banjos scene and a terrible industrial update of the "The South Will Rise Again!" song.It's obvious that the filmmakers cared little for actually doing much but making a funny, campy horror movie with a lot of boobs and blood. Unfortunately, 2001 Maniacs had nothing to add to any of those topics except a confusion between a stereotypical hillbilly and a stereotypical redneck--and everything in between. The gore was unoriginal, the sex ranged from ludicrous to obnoxious via the path of gratuitous, and the humor basically boiled down to a single joke: Southerners are weird. That's really ironic when the repeated theme in this movie is "respect" for the dead, for the memorializing of the Civil War, and for the contrast of cultures between the North and South. This movie doesn't really have respect for anything, it just wants to have slack-jawed yokels chasing sheep named Jezebel while horny college kids get off on lesbian incest.At least Robert Englund is fun to watch. He plays the best gleefully demoniacal serial killer ever. It's in the face.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

If you like bad horror movies like me then yes, you'll probably see this. If not, then you should pretty much avoid at all costs. This ridiclious plot involves a few cars happening upon some small town in the middle of nowhere that wants to kill them. Eventually that happens. The acting and plot, as usual in these movies, are really horrible. The production and everything else is OK. I would not pay to see this movie - its free on fearnet right now. Each character is so highly annoying, I said to myself at the beginning of this "film": "Self, I hope every single one of these people gets killed." And lo and behold myself was correct!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>22 of 23 people found the following review helpful: 2001 Maniacs - A Great Remake!, February 20, 2006 By Steve67 "Steve500067" (Dallas, Texas United States) - See all my reviews The film starts out like any other , basically a group of friends and fellow peers take a wrong detour and end up in strange southern town,where all the towns people are dressed as if they where stuck in a time-warp of the 1800s. Of course the travelers decide to stay the night with promises a grand celebration to be held shortly after. Sadly the group is unaware that they'll be the main course of the feast. It does'NT take long before members of group are separated and picked off one at a time by the townies, each ruling in a horrific, gore-tactic death; speaking of which , one of my favorite deaths probably have to be one of the first ones involving horses and the tearing of limbs. When the movie isn't focusing on the youngly's getting themselves killed, we're treated to an abundance of boobs and campy humor to keep the pace going. The original was slow paced and boring at times but that not the case here. When it all comes down to it, Maniacs kept its promise and delivers the goods, which should be enough to please us horror fans. Overall the promise of T&amp;A and loads of gore were delivered. Added with the campy humor,Maniacs ends up as a fun and entertaining no-brainier,gore filled ride that horror fans should not miss. I say check it out!Starring: Robert Englund, Lin Shaye, Giuseppe Andrews, Jay Gillespie. Director: Tim Sullivan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic relief: "2001 Maniacs"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain memories that define your childhood. One of those key moments for me happened as I was leafing through a stack of comic books at a local store. Quite out of the blue, I unearthed a glossy EC Comics reprint entitled "Tales From The Crypt" - the cover of which sold me alone; with its lurid bursts of colour, vintage typeset and eerie frontispiece. There was a wonderful nostalgia to it somehow - of some innocence lost. Needless to say these tales didn't disappoint, written as they were with real care, gallows humour and, (best of all) rich ladles of gore. Which brings me to the subject of "2001 Maniacs". A film that echoes this same sentiment - with its fairground approach to blood and mayhem. The film was directed by Tim Sullivan and involves various industry names of old and new - one of which, Eli Roth, even has a brief cameo at the beginning of the feature. Such obvious mugging aside, the film is quick to get down to business. The usual group of frisky college kids are just one lecture away from hitting the road and the inevitable beach party that awaits. Clearly time is of the essence here, as the lecture is bought to a premature close - a projector reel of Civil War images sabotaged, (the significance of which wisely ignored at this stage) and replaced with photos of high-octane partying. Savvy "Scream" teens these are not. Indeed the cast of males and females that share the screen time here are clearly of the "Gap" generation - fresh faces, toned bods and an urge to procreate so strong its as though "Halloween" never happened. As if to point this very fact out to us, the kids encounter a girl early on who shows all the behavioural signs we've come to expect from the genre. Sure enough, it isn't very long before sultry smiles and knowing looks give way to the inevitable. From a very early stage then, such hackneyed scenarios ensure empathy for the teen players is kept to a minimum. The emphasis on "flesh" though, is high on Sullivan's agenda, (as it also seems to be in producer Eli Roth's work) and once firmly ticked (no doubt so as to put smiles on the crucial "frat boy" demographic) he then sets about the task of dispatching his crew of pretty faces. The sex and gore quota here largely takes place in "Pleasant Valley" - a truly bizarre locale stumbled upon by the group after they, (rather predictably) get lost. It's here that we meet those "2001" of the film's title and here that the film really springs to life. (albeit for a short time) Assumed by the kids to be a military recreation, (of like...some war or something) the place oozes deep south hospitality - complete with giggling twins, Tom Sawyeresque juveniles, a banjo playing duo (who provide a lot of the film's humour - strumming inane blue grass ditties throughout) and Robert Englund's good ol'Mayor Buckman, replete with a confederate flag eyepatch to match his crackerjack looks. Time and place are all wonderfully recreated here - a sign of the film's impressive production values. In keeping with this, the on screen slaughter is as rich as the banquet laid on for the newcomers. The opening kill sees a young girl torn four ways by a pack of horses. Its an act so wildly over the top, amongst all the whacky stereotypes and kitsch acting, that we cannot possibly find it shocking. It's all just a little too over the top to be taken seriously and as a result of this, the film succeeds for a short time as a serviceable horror comedy. Generic blending of this kind makes it tempting to compare with the "Evil Dead" series, of which Scott Spiegel (here a producer) was involved, but sadly the film cannot find further material to fuel its last act. In what must be one of the most anti-climatic endings to a horror film, (no setpiece for England's character here - he merely has his eyepatch removed...scary stuff!)the two survivors leap onto a motorbike - leaving the "2001" to mull over the possibilities of a sequel. There is a slight twist to the proceedings, but nothing that redeems the events that have gone on before. Essentially, "2001 Maniacs" runs out of steam at its finale, not knowing whether to play up its comic elements or to try for something less hokey. In the end, it fails at both, which is a crying shame because there are moments in this film that remind you how much fun watching horror films really can be.</fullReview>

A boring lecture -so boring the students are snoring- on the Civil War in case the audience would not be aware of how horrible that war was (was/is there a war which isn't ?I'd like to know);a party where the students are on the menu,nothing new under the sun;and lots and lots of sex,much more sex than in the Lewis version;one should note that the "heroes" are younger: in 1964,the victims ,if my memory serves me well,were already working,one of them was a schoolteacher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The South kind of rises again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the HG Lewis "Blood" trilogy, my heart leaped for joy when it saw this title. It didn't hurt that Robert Englund was starring in it and that it looked to have more gore than the original. I thought this would be an updated sequel that would be purposely campy but still deliver on the gore (much like Blood Feast 2). I was rather disappointed. The gore was pretty good, but it didn't have the same sense of humor that "2000 Maniacs" did. It also seemed to be more of a remake than an homage to the original.The plot is pretty much the same as 2000, but throw in an interracial couple, a bi-sexual guy, and college kids. These folks are lured into an antiquated southern town for a festival, which has very dark undertones (I think anyone can figure this out pretty easily). Englund plays the mayor/civic leader/pater familias/ whatever of the back water southern community. Anyone who has seen the original should already know who will get the chop and when. There is a small twist at the end (in addition to the same twist as was in 2000 Maniacs), but it's pretty predictable.I didn't think this was a bad movie. Some of the gore was pretty good, and there was decent acting (Englund is always a stable horror actor). However, I think that what really let me down is that I expected the same tongue-in-cheek humor that the original had. I don't think that HG Lewis had anything to do with the production and it shows. Not to say that it's bad, it's just doesn't deliver on the fun aspect as much as one would have expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found myself trying to work out the order of death very early on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Herschell Gordon Lewis is no great film but it is a chirpy, cheeky, slightly warped view of the south, peppered with nasty incidents, which the inhabitants seem to find rather amusing and we don't know whether to laugh or cry. Here in this perfectly well made remake we are told at every moment when to laugh. The 'nasty' incidents are much updated with special effects and gore but they occur within this 'it's only a movie' sunny time and space. The original was helped enormously by the fact that the 'visitors' just stumbled from one happening to another. As soon, in this one, as the college kids get to realize all is not well and to fight back, we have a much more ordinary slasher movie. And is it me or can we not wait for this cast of youngsters to get it? I found myself trying to work out the order of death very early on. Not a good sign. At no point is one swept up in the action and I assume this is because there is always some suit reminding the filmmakers that it must all be kept at fantasy level. Shame because it's a great idea and it must have been tempting to think that by spending a little more money (or any money) would mean a better product that that of 1964. Not so, in my book.</fullReview>

The story revolves around some college dudes driven by their lust for some poon tang. They eventually end up in the quaint lil' Southern town of pleasant valley, where they are greeted with open arms by the town. Well the black dude not some much, because in this town everything is 100% authentic to the Civil war era. Anyway the mayor (played with humor and wit by Robert Englund) insists they stick around for their annual jubilee festival. The college dudes get acquainted with the odd inhabitants of the town, then everyone "does it"and then the gore starts. Yeah, the good old in habitants of Pleasant valley are quite unhappy that all dem Yanks that killed em back in the civil war, so every year the lure some unsuspecting yanks in to town kill 'em and eat 'em. Yeah it's not an earth shatteringly original plot, but the movie makes up for this with its gore and charm. There are a lot of dumb non-P.C. jokes in the movie, but its still somehow funny. Like the gay guy dying from a spike up his bum.Or black dude getting killed in the cotton press(get it cotton=slavery. Seriously go see this film buy it or rent it it's a pretty cool and unique film.There's some cool gore and some dude gets his penis bit off and if that's not great, then what is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right, first off I've never seen the original so I wont be comparing the 2 films, and secondly I not too good with the history of directors, producers and the like so you wont be reading how much I liked their previous. This is just my own opinion on the film. Just like any ordinary film goer.This film rocks! I haven't laughed so much at a film in a while. Its your typical slasher, you know whats gonna happen horror with the odd bit of dark humour splashed around.The plot, in a nutshell, follows 2 groups of mates and a couple on spring break heading for the beach but, wouldn't you know it, take a De-tour and head up in a wacky little town called Pleseant Valley just in time, phew, for the annual Guts'n'Glory Jubilee, where they are crowned guests of honour by Freddie Kruger! Well, not him really, but the one and only Robert Englund.From the scene at the garage before they get to PV where there is an hilarious reference to Deliverance, I knew it was going to be a good film, and it was.The film then begins to take shape and each character in turn is killed in some nut cringing shape or form. Splashstick at its best.Its Deliverance meets Cabin Fever meets Body Melt and any other gory teen movie out there that I cant remember at the moment.If you not gonna be laughing at nearly every scene then your gonna love all the hot women that at some point get their tits out! Wahey! Watch it now, but if your reading this, you probably already have, so watch it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wheather or not Herschell Gordon Lewis' 2000 MANIACS(1964) needed a sequel or not...here it is. Director and co-writer Tim Sullivan infuses tongue-in-cheek humor with gore and splatters. This film is crammed full of the sort of scenes you would expect in a very low-budget B-movie. Photography says different and there is actually a real good performance from Robert Englund.On the way to spring break in Daytona Beach, a group of college kids end up taking a detour leading to a small town in Georgia, Pleasant Valley. The mayor(Englund)insists that the young people stay and take in the their annual barbecue and reenactment of the Civil War. Southern hospitality becomes unpleasant when the horny students one by one find themselves the main entrée.Strong horror violence and gruesomely graphic images alternate with sexual implications for rated R fare. At least getting to the gore is imaginative. Also in the cast: Giuseppe Andrews, Gina Marie Heekin, Crista Campbell, Marla Malcolm, Matthew Carey and Lin Shaye. You'll squirm and then roll with laughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed 2001 Maniacs greatly for several reasons. It has great acting with such people as Robert Englund and Lin Shaye, its plot and story-line were extremely interesting all the way to the end, the movie was very realistic and gave you a "that could happen to me" feeling, and it was filled with completely insane and creepy people; in short, the formula for a perfect Slasher film. The movie did lack any real humor, but that simply added to its creepy air. The special effects were fairly decent, for a Slasher film, especially the ending, and the make-up and costume for the characters was wonderful, most of all Mayor Buckman's Confederate flag eye-patch. The movie is very suggestive, but it actually shows very little, however the language is rather bad, but if you can get past that the movie is pretty good. In my opinion this movie was great and a wonderful Slasher film. It may not be one you put on a "Top Ten" list or one you plan to buy, but it is well worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before this review gets started I would just like to say...It is very late and I suck at spelling...so there are probably many errors...just ignore them, thanks.Horror as a genre has been very clichéd in the past couple of years. It all started when film makers decided to remake Asian horror. Now this was good for a while but with this became the same thing over and over again. Then with the success of the terrific "SAW", Filmmakers thought all we wanted to see was lots of blood and possibly self mutilation in the same type of dirty setting. At least thats what has happens in the big theaters. Now the realm of small low-budget horror films that get limited or no theatrical play seems to have more variety these days. This is only proved more so by "2001 Maniacs". Yes it is pretty much a remake of the 1960's classic "2000 Maniacs" yet the movie has so much originality, so many entertaining bits, and so many redeeming qualities that it could stand on its own. The movie starts off as sort of a 1980's teen movie such as "Porkys" yet quickly turns into a more Texas chainsaw style thing while still keeping a sense of humor. This allows the movie to mix hilarious satire with purposefully horrid racial stereotypes to create one of the greatest horror movies of the year if not ever. Robert "Freddy Kruger" England gives off a great performance as another memorable character...of course with England that is like saying water is wet. His great characterization is only heightened by first-time directer Tim Sullivens great direction. Newcomer Jay Gillseppi plays a great lead character as he trys to outwit the maniacs in the second half(or so) of the movie. The cinematography is also worth noting. It is a very well shot film. The scenery also is great considering it is actual civil war territory. Basicaly the film is great and entertaining on all bases. For the gore-hounds...Oh boy is there gore aplenty. Organs plop on the floor, heads are cut off, people are speared, and even crushed. The movie truly is an instant cult classic and will be talked about for many years to come. To make a long story short...I enjoyed this movie to its fullest, I enjoyed every bloody moment, every dirty joke, every bad stereotype, every excellent camera shot, and every time I felt the movie was giving the middle finger to stuck up film critics and audiences who think that violence in cinema is a bad thing. So to Mr. Sulliven, the cast and crew...job well done...and to all a good night...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cool Horror/comedy. Best Robert Englund horror film since the Nightmare films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very well done b-movie horror/comedy about a group of Northern tourists getting "detoured" into a small Georgia town where they are proclaimed the guests of honor. Then one by one they are dragged off to their very imaginative but effectively gory deaths. Very cool sequel/remake of the 1960's horror/cult classic 2000 Maniacs who's director i have to say should be thanked profusely as i don't think horror would have the gore scenes that it's had in the past 40 yrs if not for H G Lewis classics like 2000 maniacs,Blood Feast, &amp; The Wizard Of Gore. Robert Englund is just awesome in the Mayor Buckman role. After starring in a bunch of bad horror films in between doing the Nightmare on Elm Street films here is a horror role worthy of his great acting ability. Also Lin Shaye was great as Grandma Boone &amp; Gisueppe Andrews was hilarious as Harper Alexander. My favorite death scenes were the gay guy getting skewered from the rectum to the mouth with a metal rod &amp; the girl Ms Pussy getting drawn &amp; quartered by the horse as harper tells her "Frankly,ms Pussy. I don't give a damn!" Awesome! Gory enough to make goremeisters happy &amp; funny enough that even my Mom who hates those kinds of films really liked this.

		<fullReview>This is one of the most fun and entertaining horror movies I have seen in a long time. There are scenes that literally made me laugh out loud, and scenes that made me go "eww". It wasn't particularly scary but there was a decided amount of camp, as well as a post scream self-awareness that made the movie fun. It seemed to really be made for the horror movie fans, and did not want to play to the lowest common denominator. Robert Englund was fantastic, and as always played his part perfectly on key. I actually sat through this without look at my watch once, without getting up at all and when it was over I was glad I had sat through it. A very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 great moments! Man, this film is entertaining!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other day a friend of mine was describing what a horror film should be like. I remember her talking specifically about the idea of dread and how the best horror films go beyond hot chicks and severed heads to focus more on subtle, underlying themes like those involving inevitable doom, symbolic loss, etc. For example, she likes to see a movie where we follow some maniac in a ski mask as he stalks Gail, the soccer mom, around town for thirty minutes. The difference in opinion between my friend and me lies in the simple fact that, unless Gail has a great ass and double D's that would knock you out cold, I find it to be a total snooze fest! I bring up this difference in "taste" because 2001 Maniacs, like Hostel and Cabin Fever, will separate the horror fans quicker than a chop from Vorhees' machete. Shoot girl! That was my boob!2001 Maniacs is about a group of hot chicks who, after following a detour sign, wind up in a small, secluded, colonial town known as Pleasant Valley. Mayor Buckman, the fearless leader of this quaint and completely screwed up establishment is none other than horror veteran Mr. Robert Englund. You would probably recognize him from Urban Legends as the college professor who lectures on American Crime... Um yeah... So, back to the hot chicks. After agreeing to stay in town for the festivities, they quickly booze up, get naked and lose a few limbs. Well, some of them. OK, most of them. Maybe even all of them, but not before they show us their breasts!! Awesome!! Take it easy pervert!What seriously rocks about 2001 Maniacs is the balls to the wall approach that Director Tim Sullivan takes with the material, which was also produced by Hostel director Eli Roth and Evil Dead 2 writer Scott Spiegel, among a few others. Tim, being a huge horror fan himself, clearly understands the genre and it comes across with every beautiful, blonde vixen, quirky character moment and dinner platter that overflows with spicy, severed heads. Now don't be a bonehead and think that I'm saying every horror film needs these elements to succeed. There is room for both types of horror films, people. I enjoy my David Cronenberg horror as much as I enjoy my Raw Nerve (the new production company behind 2001 Maniacs) horror.One thing that I truly love about the horror genre are those "wink-wink" moments, like a Chainsaw Massacre tribute shot or maybe an Evil Dead poster in the background. In the case of 2001 Maniacs, it was a cameo from producer Eli Roth reprising his role of Grim with Dr. Mambo from Cabin Fever. He asks some kids to give him a ride up north so he can go camping but, just as he steps back to grab his bag, one of the kids yells, "Face!" and they peel out. I realize that some of you may not get that reference but that's the point. It's rewarding to those who do and even more rewarding that it remains unexplained to those who don't. I bring this point up because Tim Sullivan realizes what type of film he is making and has loads of fun with it. He hides nothing and that's very refreshing.Besides the funny script and overall lightheartedness, the charismatic cast and superb special effects were the other two elements that really impressed me. The cast is lead by Robert Englund (enough said), Lin Shaye, who really goes the distance in this one, Giuseppe Andrews, who is always very, very interesting to watch and, finally, Jay Gillespie (did Val Kilmer have a child?) who surprisingly holds his own opposite Englund. The whole cast is awesome. I mentioned the insanely cool death sequences right? Before shooting, Tim took the time to plan out each death sequence in great detail and that comes across in the film. The demise of each character is completely memorable and gives you and your buddy something to talk about while you're in the public stalls taking a dump together.Overall, 2001 Maniacs is definitely not for everyone. If you are like Cameron Frye and have the ability to create diamonds in your ass, you'll want to pass. On the other hand, if you think Cameron's a big, wet pussy, you would most definitely have fun with this one. It's pure entertainment and I loved every minute of it. I would have rated the film higher if people weren't screwing sheep in it. That turns you on doesn't it you sheep screwer? Stop touching yourself and go rent the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i have to state that this movie will not be for everyone and the rating of 9 i gave it is from a horror fans point of view.I think its pretty obvious that 2001 maniacs would'nt stand up against the greats in film history however as silly/fun horror its better than any i have seen latley.They just don't make them like this anymore its a proper classic horror which borrows heavily from the original but still retains some originality.The gore and special FX are really good and the humour is very good and made me genuinely laugh a couple of times. Robert Englund was fantastic as always and you'll recognise a few other B-movie veterens in there as well giving really good performances.Eli Roth has a quite funny Cameo and the southern bell's where highly sexed inbread and hilarious.There's nothing new here but it was well made and kept me watching i was never bored and i think thats pretty importent in a movie.If you haven't seen the original its got a pretty good twist at the end which i wont reveal and if the action isn't happening the comedy kicks in which makes it flow very nicely.Horror fans will love this movie and its without a doubt worth sitting with a bowl of popcorn with your girlfriend/boyfriend and renting it personally i'll be buying the DVD but i am a bit of a horror maniac and will watch it again and again (much to the dismay of my girlfriend)Enjoy!</fullReview>

You are not going to get some deep dark tale here but more a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Guys and girls end up in a funky redneck town after taking a detour only to find that the inhabitants aren't as friendly as they appear. One by one they are brutally murdered. The actors all in all are pretty good. I have to admit the only reason i got this was for some gore filled moments to chuckle at and the movie didn't disappoint.

Of course the gore effects are going to be better and the acting but I mainly rented this for the gore and was pleasantly surprised that the acting was so good coming from such relative unknown. Unknown except for Robert Englund who plays the mayor of this town of maniacs. He really steals the show, well him and the character of Hucklebilly I thought they were both the real stars of this film. Yes, there's a lot of T&amp;A, lots of sex in various combinations(Girl/Girl ,Boy/Girl,Boy/Boy and of course Boy/Sheep) but that just adds to the charm of this movie. If your a gorehound like me and you want a fun movie to pop in then rent or buy 2001 Maniacs!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 Reasons Not to Watch This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably could list 2001 reasons not to watch this movie but that would be exhausting.This is the second Eli Roth directed movie I've seen with the first being Cabin Fever. To this point I'm not impressed. The only thing 2001 Maniacs had going for it was Robert Englund and even he didn't do much to eliminate the B rating of this film.A group of young people get stuck in a little hick town and are killed one by one in horrific fashion. Even with that, the movie was more of a horror comedy (or comedy horror, not sure which is first). Much of the movie takes place in the day time which always has less of a horror feel to it. Furthermore, the way some of the unwilling hosts were killed was so absurd it had to be for laughs. I was working the night shift, I needed to stay awake, this was on. That's all I can say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corny first half, and scary last ? almost redeems...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 10/3/2008 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Tim Sullivan): Corny first half, and scary last ? almost redeems this tasteless, disgusting remake of a low-budget older movie. The story is about a bunch of happy-go-lucky kids on their way to spring break fun-in-the-sun, but get side-tracked when they take a short cut that ends up in a town called Pleasantville. The 2001 goofy inhabitants are stuck in the civil war days and greet the outsiders to their guts&amp;glory annual festival. The problem is that they plan on having the visitors(and I really mean having them) for their barbecue. By 2005, this story is of course a familiar one, unsuspecting young kids dying one by one(but their usually not fed upon). We know what's going to happen but the story starts off very slowly as we're treated to titillation, bad songs, and unfunny silliness. The leader of the group in Pleasantville is none other than Robert Englund(aka. Freddy Krueger), so we know he's up to no good. One by one the kids are disgustingly gotten rid of, similar to the old Friday the 13th movies where it seems like the movie makers are trying to outdo themselves with each killing. In my opinion, this is not film-making but schlock-making, which doesn't make for a very appealing movie. There is some redemption near the end where the suspense reaches a level that horror movies should eventually come to, but it's too late for this so-so horror spoof. I would instead recommend the original "Night of the Living Dead" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" if your looking for gore that has a level of intelligence to them also. If you just can't get enough cannibalism in your movie-making diet than I guess this one might whet your appetite, but otherwise stay away from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 Maniacs--horror films at their best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i am actually always reluctant to watch a horror me because of just that: it's a horror movie. but i was destined to watch Giuseppe Andrews with his cute southern accent and perfect role of "seducer" to the Yankee women crossing the town's path. starting off as a typical horror film does- a group of wild college boys traveling south to Daytona Beach, Florida for a great time over spring break- 2001 maniacs turned out to be less predictable and cliché as most. the southern cannibals of pleasant valley welcomed their guests of honor and treated them as such until one by one they begin to disappear, each in an ingenious way. each character from pleasant valley had specific contributions to the feast, meaning each had a job of killing their guests of honor. harper Alexander's job, Giuseppe Andrew's character, was to seduce a woman from the visitors, since he was considered the looker of the bunch (and that he was), but it was the odd characters of Hucklebilly and Rufus, or as i came to call him, "sheep lover", that brought humor to their characters and to the movie in sick and twisted ways. they are truly maniacs, but you can't help but have them as favorites from the movie. the visitors are stuck in a hellish and unreal predicament, of course thinking, "these people are freaking insane." and that they are. i am usually one to yell out what i believe will happen next during a movie, and i am usually right if i do say so myself, but with the twist and turns of the citizens of pleasant valley's method of death among their "guests of honor", i was always surprised from scene to scene, even though i was usually watching them with my hands over my ears and arm covering a portion of my sight. kudos to Tim Sullivan, the director of 2001 maniacs in his successful plight to create one of the best horror movies i've seen since house of 1000 corpses.~L.L.

		<fullReview>In 1964, there was a movie called Two Thousand Maniacs. In the 40+ years since then, I guess they found another resident of Pleasant Valley. This updated version is extremely bloody. Robert Englund takes over the role as the town's mayor. This movie is an homage to the original, as well as a tribute to the slasher films of the 1980's. I won't ruin the ending for you, but it's quite unexpected. KIND OF A SPOILER WARNING!! If you're looking for beautiful, semi-nude maniacal cannibals, red-neck hillbilly butchers and more southern stereotypes than a marathon of Hee Haw episodes, this is the movie for you. I was amazed to read that they are working on the sequel to this one. Enjoy this one, but be prepared to be sick to your stomach.Jay</fullReview>

Some of the sex scenes have amusing punchlines and most of the gore is ridiculously over the top.Add some fun song lyrics, running gags about bestiality and a brisk pace in between the disappearance of each character (yeah, it's one of those movies where people disappear one by one without raising too much suspicion) and you have a fun movie for fans of horror that doesn't take itself too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made Sleaze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm certain that if Tim Sullivan were to put his mind to it he could make a really good movie. He certainly has the technical finesse. All he needs to do is concentrate on character development, and plot. I suppose those items aren't that important in a yawn of a movie such as this since it's the thrill of seeing people brutalized in over the top ways that motivates most people to watch such sleaze. Nonetheless, even a good horror/slasher film needs suspense and ... horror. This is neither. The actors certainly are adept at playing the naive victims and cartoonish monsters. The comic touches are nice if somewhat clichéd. I guess I miss the point of most remakes and updates of films whether they be popular or cult. Having not seen the original, though very aware of its notoriety, this seems like an exercise in futility on top of simply being trash. Though I suppose if the source is trashy to begin with that would logically be the end result. Just predictable scenes of what would once be of a stomach turning quality, that's now just disgusting and boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On their way to Spring Break, college kids take a detour through an old Southern town. The people of Pleasant Valley insist the kids stay for their annual barbecue celebration... but instead of getting a taste of the old South, the old South gets a taste of them! This movie has had a lot of positive reviews buzzing around from horror fans so I decided to rent this one out last week and give it a go. After watching it, I really wanted to know why it was so "good" and I think the most logically disappointing reason for it is the fame of Robert Englund. If this guy had not become Freddy Krueger all those years ago, this movie would not be considered to be as great as its been told.The story is fairly non-existent and relies on its on and off one-liner laughs and intentionally explicit and sometimes unrealistic gore. Whilst the movie starts off something closely resembling an American Pie movie, the laughs are still there to keep you going to the point of when they meet the "maniacs" at Pleasant Valley.The actors in the movie aren't too bad, even though most of the characters are as 2-dimensional as they come, they manage to hold their own... for the most part. Most of the "maniacs" are boringly written and use some of the worst stereotypical accents that I've heard. Even though that may have been intentional, it doesn't stop the characters coming across as being dull and boring. If it weren't for Robert Englund, the cast would have failed in constructing this movie. Everything would have crumbled.The effects and gore are laughably stupendous. There are some wickedly thought up deaths for the movie but they only manage to withdraw a grin from my face and nothing more. The "what the..?" factor is extremely high in this movie as they seem to enjoy cramming in as much oddly placed situations as they can just to keep you weirded out.Uh, yeah. It could've been great but in the end, it's just a bit of fun that brushes off your shoulder like dust. Am I weird or does this movie remind you of "Dead &amp; Breakfast"?</fullReview>

If only every horror film was able to realize its obvious clichés and play them up to the hilt like this one does. the supporting cast does well to, though really the majority of them are just eye candy. the only true star of this show is the unbeatable Robert Englund. Oh, and the death scenes are pretty cool to. In particle the 'Bedroom' death. This has got to be without a doubt the most bloody, violent film ever to make it past the censors.</fullReview>

The victims t'ain't interesting at all. Three scrubbed-faced white boys, their only difference being their names and two nasty (in a good way) white chicks/sluts who are all on the Gut's and Glory Jubilee menu. They all have little to do but have the required sex in a montage. And of course do what is expected of them. And that is to die. Two notable exceptions in the victim department are Brian Gross as uber- bisexual, Slicky Ricky and hot hungry Mushond Lee playing Malcolm in tight black bikinis. These men created interesting characters and their acting talent ranked high above all the other victims.Now, the bad guys and girls, now they were the heaving motor of the film. And we all know Mr. Englund is good at everything he does and he was the carburetor that done did it for me. So I'll move along to the strange characters that populated Pleasant Valley. These characterizations are responsible for making this film stand head and shoulders above others horror/comedies released in past years.The Boys: Lester, the goat loving hick, is caught twice pulling up his pants, exposing his assets, as he tries to get his 'Jizzabell' in the mood. (this is how the goat's name was spelled in the script) He's got a nice twang. Bright and hunky Lester who is too eager to accept his duty of messing around with bi-boy Ricky prior to killing him did the strong silent type well. They looked hot together. (the script had a better scene written for them but good taste prevailed) These are Englund's sons.Then there is Ryan Fleming's performance as Hucklebilly. Nicely done. The young teen looks perfect as an inbred and his voice -- just hauntingly high pitched. All three actors deserve praise.The Girls: Hmm, child. Not a bad one among 'em. And T &amp; A on every frame. Stand outs are Peaches done by Miss Wendy Kremer. Wicked and sexy. She got the devil in them eyes of hers. Glendora and Hester acting out the playboy bunny bisexual fantasy. And then there's the milk maid. Finger licking good, honey. Not much was expected of the ladies. Be sexy, be naked and giggle when asked.All in all, this is one of the best horror comedies in history. A pleasant merger of sex, horror, comedy and a holler heap full of southern decadence.Congratulations, Tim Sullivan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure to be a classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta say - I expected this to be pretty good - but it was way above my expectations!!! The acting was superb and the story line was great. The pace was perfect - it gets right down to business.I don't need to repeat the story line that everyone else posted... But I can say that this will go down as an all time classic. Englund is amazing as usual - he gives off such an evil aura even when he is being nice. There are a ton of laughs, blood, boobs, and its great to see a movie that's not all CGI but real deal special effects. Very few movies lately have kept my interest such as this.Go buy this ASAP. You will not be disappointed I promise you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ Tim Sullivan's 2001 Maniacs was a long time coming. I remember reading about this movie in what seemed like the year 2001 (which would have made the title that much more appropriate). Now it's 2006 and I've finally seen it. Was it worth the wait? I can say that it was. This was a FUN movie. It's not re-inventing horror, it's not treading new ground, and it's not taking itself seriously. It's gore, laughs, nudity, and more gore. I've not seen the original, 2000 Maniacs, and to be honest I'm not a big fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis. So I obviously can't compare it to the original and I didn't really know what kind of film this would be. The storyline here involves some college students on Spring Break who take a wrong turn and end up in the quiet little Southern town of Pleasant Valley. Not knowing the town is full of flesh-eating ghouls, they look to take advantage of that rumored Southern hospitality. Robert Englund stars as Mayor Buckman, the town patriarch. He's delightfully over-the-top in usual Englund fashion. Lin Shaye, who keeps getting cooler, is Englund's counterpart and is just as outlandish. What's odd about this production is that all of the actors are quite good, and many of the younger people have no other credits to their names. It's hard to pick standouts. Even the people with one or two lines were quite memorable. I did love Giuseppe Andrew's character though. "Frankly, Miss Pussy, I don't give a damn." Watch for cameos from Peter Stormare, Travis Tritt, Scott Spiegel, Kane Hodder, Eli Roth (as Justin from Cabin Fever with Dr. Mambo as well), and Tim Sullivan himself. I look forward to Sullivan's next outing. Remember, "The South is gonna rise again."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is another pointless remake that follows in the footsteps of "House on Haunted Hill", "Thirteen Ghosts" and "House of Wax". It is sad to consider that the horror market has gone so dry that film backers now throw money at the remake genre. Everything that made the original so memorable is missing from this film. If this was made as a tribute to H.G. Lewis it missed by a mile. The original was so unforgettable because it was not forced. Yes, there was bad acting, bad effects, and bad acting in that film but there was also the Lewis SLEAZE factor. Who can forget the trademark grinning/leering during the most horrendous moments? Tits and upgraded special effects aside, this movie is a pale comparison. The humor in the Lewis film was not forced. That is just the opposite in this film. The ever present nudge and wink and comical remark adds to what is wrong here and the remake genre in general. It looks like we will have to continue to look to Europe and Japan for truly original horror films. I'm sure there are independent filmmakers who can't get their original screenplays produced because all the backing goes to dreck like this. Johnny Legend should be ashamed for appearing in this turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 Maniacs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 Maniacs is a remake of 2000 Maniacs from the 1960's. It is about Northern People that are lured into a peaceful, celebrating town down South named PLeasant Valley. The town isn't so "pleasant" when the ghosts start having a blood feast with the Northerners. Blood, sex, tits, and gore follow to show true SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY. I have had 2001 Maniacs in my DVD player since the date of release. This is a very good film that I suggest to EVERYONE! Me being from the South, I got a big kick out of it! If I like it, EVERYONE that is a TRUE horror fan will enjoy it also. GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW!!!!!!! YEE HAW THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN!! Props to the best film of 2006, TIM SULLIVAN is the man!H.G. LEWIS also put out 2000 Maniacs which gave us 2001 Maniacs, he is great too! Thanks for keeping the SOUTH entertained then and now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Gory Horror Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched 2001 Maniacs the other night for the first time. I have to say this was such a fun movie to watch! This film was funny and very gory. The film has a great cast including Robert Englund, Lin Shaye, Christa Campbell, Wendy Kremer and many more. I would say this was Robert Englund's best role in a film besides Freddy.A group of college kids on their way to Spring Break take a detour. They come upon the small southern town of Pleasant Valley. The people of the town and Mayor Buckman(Robert Englund) insist that the kids stay for their annual festival. The kids decide to stay and check it out and that's where the madness begins! Tim Sullivan did a great job sticking to the story of the original H.G. Lewis classic Two Thousand Maniacs. This is one of the best horror films of the past few years. It has some great gory death scenes too! I would recommend it highly to any horror fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect too little from a movie about a whole town of cannibals and I wasn't disappointed. this movie has Cult film written all over it. Funny Goofy and totally demented. No one seems like they were having a bad time during the filming. Robert Englund and Lin Shaye stand out as the leaders of a mysteriously little town where city folk are wrangled in by a detour sign and become the guests of honor for the town BBQ.Loaded with Hillybilly jokes and covered in blood, 2001 Maniacs is a joyous little remake that never takes any of the sick nasty things it touches on too seriously therefore letting the audience snicker and wince all within moments. So obviously its good for repeat viewing.I liked film mostly because they all knew it wasn't Hamlet they were performing and even a true horror fan will adore Eli Roth reprising his Cabin Fever role for a cameo. Sorry to break it to Roth but I liked this film better than Fever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-makes vs. Sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK Where to start with this one? When are these directors going to learn that if you want to earn some money by "piggybacking" off of a previously proved successful film such as Herschell Gordon Lewis' "Two Thousand Maniacs" that's fine but don't insult the fans by using only a handful of the original character names yet creating an entirely different movie! This movie definitely does not skimp in the gore department, it has some very good acting, and Robert England cast in the lead to boot makes for a potentially good film but true fans of the original film, which let's face it is what the majority of the audience who will attend a film with such a title will consist of, will be sorely disappointed at the blatant disregard for the original storyline! Instead of being promoted as a re-make, films like this should be promoted as sequels,that is if the director is so void of original ideas that he or she feels that they must rip-off someone else's original idea instead of coming up with one of their own. The "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Black Christmas" remakes are also guilty of this offense...this is why these remakes flop. I have yet to see a "remake" that truly does justice to the original product outside of 80's remakes like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" or "The Blob"...save yourselves the embarrassment and degradation and the snubbing of the fans and just call it a sequel instead of trying to create your own franchise. The other aspect of this film that I did not care for was the director's inexplicable need to add certain elements to the story in a tacky, crude and downright politically incorrect attempt to 'modernize' the story. I personally do not find it humorous to hear tacky "Watermellon" jokes applied to African Americans and I found the addition of the gay character and his subsequent death to be in EXTREMELY poor taste!</fullReview>

You can tell he loved working on the movie and it shows through his acting! The attractive young cast of new comers were at the top of there game, I see big things for them. Jay Gillespie especially gave a wonderful performance. Now onto the juicy bits, the film is filled with great gore and special effects! I wont spoil the kills but there something involving ropes and horses which must be seen to believe, a nice large bell that falls down with some juicy results and many more things. Also the T&amp;A factor is very good, lots of hot naked ladies.What more could you want from this film? Great plot, stylish directing (Ritter you rock)! great score, great acting, fx, sound designed. The film has it all, buy it don't rent it! 10 out of 10 one of the best times I've had with a horror film in years!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that Herschell Gordon Lewis' "Blood Trilogy"(Blood Feast, 2000 Maniacs &amp; Color Me Blood Red) are to me, the holy trinity of gore movies. There have been many great splatter movies since, but the style of those originals make them true genre classics.I don't like remakes. I don't think CG effects improve anything that was done perfectly the first time. "2001 Maniacs" is NO REMAKE!!"2001 Maniacs" picks up in the present day &amp; breathes life (or death) into familiar characters that once haunted a Southern town in a DIFFERENT classic movie!This film had all the qualities I look for each time I see a new horror film &amp; walk away disappointed. And to see a copy of Forrest Ackerman's "Famous Monsters Of Filmland" grace the cover of a movie screen, truly brought a tear to my eye!"2001 Maniacs" to me, is every bit as classic &amp; great as "2000 Maniacs". I absolutely loved this movie. Thank you Tim Sullivan for making this movie &amp; for proving to me that my vision of horror is true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the best horror movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few years ago, the horror film seemed to die out. There were only bad "Saturday-Night-Shockers", like "Dark Water" and "The Grudge". But new film makers like Eli Roth (...) are now going to save it. 2001 maniacs is a bloody, gory and (especially) funny movie... Everything you don't find in the most of the new horror movies, it's right in here. Gore, Sarcasm, a (almost) good story, good actors (esp. "Robert Englund") and a bit of tension. It's simply obvious, that this director loves his genre and that he has lots of fun in creating gory and sarcastic scenes. The topic "the American civil war" and the traditions of the south, are used to create this great splatter movie, probably the best of 2005 (behind "TDR").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Southern Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bet Herschell Gordon Lewis, having just completed work on his second gore epic Two Thousand Maniacs, never once imagined that in roughly forty years his brainchild would be re-filmed and remade again. Instead of "the South will rise again, " it should be Herschell Gordon Lewis will rise again. Anyway, this film, like the original, has the happy town of Pleasant Valley as its setting: a town that magically reappears every 100 years on the anniversary of its destruction by Union soldiers during the Civil War only to have its hillbilly celebration of maiming, garroting, shivving, castrating, squeezing, quartering, barbecuing, decapitating, and so on of Yankee motorists in the nearby vicinity. Just like in the original, though much more bloodier and believable, nothing here is really frightening. Every gory scene is more like a punchline to a distasteful joke. Also, just like in the original, the South comes off looking like some barbaric civilization that is ages behind the more industrial North. The Southern stereotypes fly in this one though seem not to have the edge in the original film. What this film does have that the original does not are way better actors, lots and lots and lots of sexy women in lots and lots and lots of sexual situations, generous doses of humour(almost all of which were INTENDED), and a tongue firmly planted in cheek mood. Robert Englund plays Mayor Buckman to the hilt, even wearing an eye patch with the Confederate flag on it no less. Englund shows me here, as he has in other non-Freddy roles, that he is a versatile actor with a wide range. His Buckman has charm, grace, and dementia. Lin Shaye does an equally credible job playing Granny Boone(not to my knowledge in original). Everyone else is more than adequate working with this stuff. Johnny Legend and Scott Spiegel had me rolling as two wandering minstrels singing atrocious blue grass tunes with the most inane lyrics. And let's not forget the girls. The film has a bevy of beauties with a free and easy approach to being in front of the camera. Standouts(knockouts might be more appropriate) include Gina Marie Heeken, Bianca Smith, Wendy Kremer, and sultry Christa Campbell as the milk maid. Director Tim Sullivan knows exactly what he wants and goes right for it in this film. No high art here, just an appreciative group of filmmakers remaking a film I too would never have dreamt of being remade. The odd thing is that this film is far more watchable then the original. It has so much more going for it than the original - which does have some charms - don't get me wrong. Sullivan knows his audience and goes with the proverbial flow. He doesn't stray away from the shocking nor the easy, distasteful laugh(like when the black Yankee is presented as "dark" meat as just one example).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie because I am a pretty big fan of the genre, but this doesn't really make it all the way. It is like some kind of "the House of a 1000 corps" or "Devils Rejects" light version, trying to use Englunds Kreugerish cool style. Some scenes were pretty disgusting and the ending was OK. If I still had been 14yo I probably would have liked it a lot more, due to some splatter and nudity. But as it is, I have aged a bit and this flick have a long way to go to reach the level of evil/madness/hardcore-freaks of Captain Spauldings and Dr. Satans friends. If this movie had been directed by Rob Zombie it could possibly had a chance.So if you still haven't seen the House of a 1000 corps or Devils rejects, do yourself a favor and see those instead (unless you are 14yo and would give your right arm to see some tits, then you might like to see this one too) Chineees, Japaneeees, dirty kneeees look at theeeeese.........</fullReview>

They are welcomed by the local Mayor Buckman (Robert Englund) as guests of honor together with Joey, Kat, Ricky and the Afro-American biker Malcolm (Mushond Lee) and his Chinese girlfriend Leah (Bianca Smith) and invited to stay for their Guts and Glory Jubilee with free lodging, meals and booze at Granny Boone's hotel, and dancing, games and a mouth-watering barbecue in the climax of the jubilee. The group accepts the invitation but sooner they find who will supply the meat for the feast."2001 Maniacs" is a movie with great potential of cult, having black humor, gorgeous actresses and an excellent twist in the end. I really liked this gore film a lot, and I laugh with the witty, funny and great lines, and many of them are quoted in IMDb. Robert England is amazing in the role of the revengeful southern mayor, giving a perfect touch of humor to his sadistic and friendly character. In the end, "those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "2001 Maníacos" ("2001 Maniacs")</fullReview>

I was at least expecting buckets of gore but what I got was as much as your average teen slasher flick, except horribly fake special effects. If it didn't feature Robert Englund and some other notable actors, I would've thought it was filmed in a week by some college kids for fun. I'll sit through a terrible movie if there's some promising gore but it was a waste of time. I ended up fast-forwarding through the last 45 minutes. It's hardly funny even when it was supposed to be.

		<fullReview>I am huge Hershall Gordan Lewis fan, always have been. Going from Blood Feast to his newest Blood Feast 2 I have seen just about all of his films. So when I heard that a remake of 2000 Maniacs was on its way I was a bit skeptical. As well I should be since most remakes of classic horror films are horrible and not worth the time because you just get angry watching them. This movie on the other hand rather entertained me and definitely has re-watch value to it.The storyline is roughly the same except we have several college boys, 3 other people that I am guessing are on vacation (wasn't paying close enough attention) and a biker and his girl. So obviously the deathtoll is a little higher in this movie. Robert England does a great job at playing the Mayor of Pleasant Valley and there are a few other actors that did a farely decent job as well. I will admit, when I first put this movie in my DVD player and the first 15 minutes of the movie passed I became really worried that I had waisted my money. At first it seems like a typical teeny bopper slasher film with a bunch of sex crazed idiots who you give a rats arse about. But when that first gore scene comes in I found myself saying "Holy S***!". I was caught I must admit. I was a little bit upset with the choice of music in the movie. It was kind of like they mixed some modern crap music in with the folk music of the original. They did what sounds like a bad remix of The Souths Going To Rise Again but I just ignored it really. One more thing I wish they had added in also was just one more remake of the scene with the guy in the barrel that they push down hill with all the nails in it. But oh well.Anyway, if you are a HG Lewis fan and are really skeptical of seeing this movie I hope you won't be disappointed. It really does become rather enjoyable and once when the victims go to Pleasant Valley it is a really fun ride. 9/10 stars</fullReview>

This movie isn't meant to be taken serious or to be a horror movie as some people have it listed but as a way to have fun with some violence.

		<fullReview>This is the funniest horror movie I have ever watched. It starts off as a light comedy, but becomes darker humor while the movie goes on, as more and more is revealed! For once, a bargain bin movie in my collection has a real plot line, with tangible suspense ! The acting is mostly good, the "southerns" creating a believable ( and sometimes funny ) setting. The mayor of the town ( featured on the box cover ) plays a wide range of emotions, from happy, to shocked, to frustrated. Though the jokes are mostly corny one liners, the settings and situations can make it funnier, or darker, depending on the mood.The horror part was done nicely also. I have seen most of he kills done in other movies before, BUT the way they are done does not shout out "bad cliché", instead they tend to add to the dark mood, and cast the "southerns" in a more villain role as time passes. At the end I was thinking to myself, "Wow this was a decent comedy, and great horror film" !I found a box art error on my DVD case ... on the back, the mayor's eye patch is on the wrong side</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 Maniacs the remake isn't a movie. It is a post-movie. It is as developed as an 88 minute Capitol One commercial, and the only thing it sells is the theoretical algorithm of what defines a good time to a certain consumer demographic.The overall structure, plot, pacing, dialog, and format of 2001 Maniacs could have been inputed by a machine based on the specific formulas of similar movies (Bordello of Blood, Dusk Till Dawn). 2001 Maniacs then reflects the camp aspect of slasher/gore movies, yet some integral part is missing. It isn't that 2001 Maniacs has no heart or soul, it simply wasn't programmed to have heart or soul in the first place. 2001 Maniacs follows the sad trend of most genre (and mainstream) films these days, of trying to imitate the nature of a narrative film. The structure is then reinforced through nothing but shear will of the audience, who has consumed the same tired formula so many times before they now can essentially beg for the same old bone on command.Yet 2001 Maniacs is more than just this: it is not simply a bad movie that is neither funny or scary. It is nothing. It is a black hole, so mediocre it produces no emotions in its watcher. Or rather it produces in the watcher the vacant gaze of catatonic enjoyment one simulates when watching a commercial, this movie imitation's closest relative.A scary thing indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no denying that cult director H. G. Lewis was a huge influence on the horror genre with his gratuitous gore-fests of the 60s, but there is also no avoiding the fact that, for the most part, his films were shoddily produced, poorly acted efforts that relied on their graphic violence and T&amp;A to draw in the crowds?definitely something of an acquired taste.This remake of Lewis' best film, 2000 Maniacs, isn't exactly a work of art either, but, in the spirit of the original, it is enjoyably daft, extremely bloody, and features plenty of attractive women in various states of undress.Sticking fairly close to the premise of Lewis' movie, 2001 Maniacs sees a group of fun loving students who, whilst travelling South for spring break, stumble upon the town of Pleasant Valley, where they are invited by the mayor to be guests of honour at the annual celebrations. Unfortunately, the people of Pleasant Valley are actually revenge hungry ghosts who were slaughtered by the Yankees during the American Civil War, and who plan to kill the new arrivals and serve them up at their Jubilee Bar-B-Q.The film's cast is headed by old Freddy himself, genre great Robert Englund, who has a marvellous time hamming it up as one-eyed Yankee-hating Mayor Buckman, leader of the spooky townsfolk, and he is ably supported by the always reliable Lin Shaye, as Granny Boone, whose job it is to prepare the guests for dinner?by having them killed, gutted and roasted on a spit!Also playing memorable members of the vengeful dead are Cabin Fever's Giuseppe Andrews as psycho Southern gent Harper Alexander, Ryan Fleming as Hucklebilly (a killer hick with a particularly peculiar voice), and Wendy Kremer as the slutty metal-fang wearing bitch Peaches.As far as the victims are concerned, it's the stunning Gina Marie Heekin and the gorgeous Marla Malcolm that impressed me the most. Ugly they ain't!Of course, the other 'stars' of the film?the gore effects by the K.N.B. EFX Group?are also something special to behold: there is a juicy 'quartering' (dismemberment via four horses), several decapitations, an emasculation, a nasty impalement (up the butt and out the mouth), and several crushings (one of which is quite literally eye-popping!).Just like Herschell G. Lewis' 2000 Maniacs, director Tim Sullivan's 2001 Maniacs is a shamelessly silly, wickedly un-PC, unabashedly gory, tongue-in-cheek trash horror flick, made for an audience at ease with on-screen blood 'n' guts and au fait with the splatter genre. In short: it's fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A motley assortment of college kids on a cross country road trip take an ill-advised detour and find themselves in the quaint Southern hamlet of Pleasant Valley. They run afoul of the crazed cannibal local yokels who are celebrating their annual barbecue festival. Director/co-writer Tim Sullivan does a real bang-up job with this wickedly sick and twisted blackly humorous remake of the Herschell Gordon Lewis schlock splatter classic: Sullivan relates the story at a nonstop zippy pace, ably creates an amusing tongue-in-cheek tone (the witty "Deliverance" dueling banjos parody is quite funny), and pours on the gruesome gore with infectiously demented glee (grisly highlights include a hapless lass being quartered by horses, a guy drinking acid, a girl getting crushed by a huge bell, one poor dude having his privates eaten by a hick chick with sharp steel teeth, and a nasty double decapitation with barbed wire). Better still, several hot babes take off their clothes and bare their beautiful bodies. Why, we even got plenty of saucy sexual perversion going on that runs the gamut from bestiality to incestuous lesbianism (the latter thanks to a delectable distaff pair of literal "kissin' cousins"). Moreover, the game cast totally go to town on their roles. Robert Englund in particular has a field day as the jolly one-eyed Mayor Buckman. Lin Shayne as the sweetly insane Granny Boone, Giuseppe Andrews as the suavely deranged gentleman Harper Alexander, Scott Spiegel and Johnny Legend as a couple of merry singing minstrels, Wendy Kremer as wildcat hillbilly harlot Peaches, Bill McKinney as an unhinged chef, Travis Tritt as a creepy gas station attendant, Eli Roth as wacky stoner Justin, and Peter Stormare as the stuffy Professor Ackerman all likewise have a grand time with their parts. Steve Adcock's polished cinematography and Jonathan McHugh's spooky, flavorsome score do the trick just nice. A refreshingly gross and tasteless blast of a blithely depraved over-the-top comedic horror romp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a bargain-bin pickup at the movie store next to where I work. I didn't pay very much for it and that's a good thing. This movie simply was not that great.It's difficult to say exactly why I disliked this movie, since it is by and large the type of movie I would usually enjoy. Zany premise, gratuitous boobs and violence, and jokes all the way. Mindless B-Movie fun, right? Well, sort of. Calling the characters "one dimensional" would imply too much depth. Everybody is a walking stereotype and everybody seems equally annoying and brain-dead. I couldn't help but feel that on some level the entire film was just a celebration of American ignorance. The jokes about pig-f**kin and cat-skinning get old half way through and by the end you're just wishing the idiotic teenagers would hurry up and die.There are some memorable scenes in this movie as well as a few WTF comedy moments that keep it from being a total disaster. Bonus points for hot chicks and cameos from several 'Cabin Fever' actors. Perhaps better viewed while on mind altering substances.I'm comfortable giving this a '4', though on a bad day I would probably rate it lower. If you're drunk/high and need to kill some time, you could do worse. Otherwise, probably best to avoid.Tenace's Next Review: 40 Year Old Virgin</fullReview>

The characters were set up for the kill in funny and ingenious fashion. There were plenty of golden globes flashed throughout the movie. There was a whole lot of inbred creatures singing about the glories of the South, and there was lots of blood and gore.Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) was outstanding as the town Mayor. Lin Shaye as Granny was to die for! The ending was brilliant! Director Tim Sullivan did a great job.This movie was so trashy that it was funny and worth watching.</fullReview>

The whole idea of this film was just that, a good idea but with no actual thought past that. Please don't waste your time with this.

No. We hear complaints all the time about stereotyping in movies, but I could not believe the Southern characters in this film...a total wreck. There was actually a character that throughout the movie would chase a goat across the screen and say "she's playing hard to get." And what the heck was up with the chick with the metal teeth? Huh? And the gay angle?

It's enjoyable, but be warned. . . 90% of the actors really have no talent at all. The few veteran actors you'll recognize (Robert Englund, Lin Shaye, Giuseppe Andrews) are really able to hold their parts together, but the younger kids (the college kids, the half-naked women, etc.), I simply do not see rising out of this type of film.Oh well. . . 6/10.

		<fullReview>Three typical college guys, on their way to Florida for spring break, take an unexpected detour into Pleasant Valley, an old southern town headed by the overly hospitable Mayor Buckman (Robert Englund). They find that they're not the only people who took a wrong detour and are joined by more hopeful college partiers, including *gasp* a Negro (Mayor Buckman words,not mine). Turns out the pleasant lil' town is anything but. Of course if you're at all familiar with the original H.G. lewis classic "Two Thousand Maniacs". And people berating the lack of story in this film, definitely have not seen the original. This, like the first one, is just pure deviant gory fun, over the top acting and all. If you only go into this film in that mindset, you'll in all likelihood enjoy the movie. It's not as good as the original, yeah. The redone them song is horrible true. But all in all this flick was fun.Eye Candy: Christa Campbell, Bianca Smith, Marla Malcolm, &amp; Wendy Kremer show their tits; Gina Marie Heekin only shows her ass; while Kodi Kitchen &amp; Cristin Michele provide both T&amp;AMy Grade: B- DVD Extras: Commentary by co-writer/ Director Tim Sullivan and actor Robert Englund; Second commentary by Sullivan, co-writer Chris Kobins, and producer Chris Tuffin; 42 minute "Inside the Asylum" documentary; 37 minutes of additional/ deleted/ extended scenes, outtakes, 7 alternative opening; a 6 and a half minute audition reel; Promo Trailer; and trailers for "Heebie Jeebies", "the Mangler Reborn", "Green River killer, &amp; "Streets of legend"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not gonna lie - I hated this film, but I'm going to try to be as fair and impartial as possible. But, there are a few things that anyone reading this should know: I believe H.G. Lewis to be a GOD of exploit/horror films and the original TWO THOUSAND MANIACS is a personal favorite...I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like 2001 MANIACS...I liked both CABIN FEVER and HOSTEL (contrary to much popular opinion) and although Roth didn't direct 2001 MANIACS, his "thumbprint" is all over it - this is an Eli Roth film...Now, on to the "good" stuff. The basic storyline in 2001 MANIACS stays pretty true to the original: travelers are lured to a small southern town populated with Confedarate "sympathizers" (to say the least) who were murdered during the Civil War - and just so happen to be ghosts. The travelers are treated to some Southern Hospitality and made guests of honor in the years centennial celebration. Things go downhill from there are it turns out that these ghosts aren't too keen on them damn Yankees...OK, so the story is pretty much the same. So you may be thinking "then what's the problem???" - the problem lies in the execution (so to speak). 2001 MANIACS is nothing more than another poorly made "teenie" film made to capitalize off the name of another film. This is not an "homage" to Lewis's film - it's an insult. Other than Robert Englund as the Mayor, and the nasty landlord lady from KINGPIN - absolutely no notable performances in this film. I wasn't looking for TITANIC here - just something I could get in to. The gore/kill-scenes are barely mediocre and far less original than Uncle Hersch's classic. The dialog is full of stupid teenage euphemisms that are supposed to appear "hip" and "up-to-date", but seem forced and just plain stupid. This has been a problem with all of Roth's projects - he tries too hard to force "coolness" into his films and it ends up looking weak. There are some tits-and-ass, but FAR less than you would be lead to believe by other reviewers. I honestly had to fast-forward through the last 20 minutes or so because I was so frustrated and bored with the whole thing.Again, I was really hopeful of this project - so I'm not a "hater" or someone that routinely trashes films - but even if I didn't love the original TWO THOUSAND MANIACS so much - I STILL would have hated this film. I will be fair and say that there is some gore, some nudity, and a few minor (and also oftentimes forced) "laughs"...but it wasn't enough to save this garbage. My opinion - don't bother...but it seems a few actually like this one - so to each their own. A generous 3.5/10 (and that's mainly for the couple quick glimpses of silicone-enhanced goodness...oh, and the ass-spearing...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HG Lewis' gore classic Two Thousand Maniacs isn't the obvious choice for the remake treatment, but surprisingly enough it got one - and it's pretty damn good! Actually, I'd say that this film is more of a sequel than a remake, as it takes in the same basic plot idea as the sixties splatterfest, but other than that the film is mostly new. And besides, the Godfather of Gore did promise us that the South was going to rise again. The film takes in many of Lewis' trademarks; from over the top silly gore, to a great streak of black humour. The Southern swing has been retained too, and we get treated to all manner of weird Redneck traits - best of all being the pair of minstrels that pop up every now and again to sing us a song! As mentioned, the basic plot remains the same and follows a bunch of young kids who end up in the strange town of Pleasant Valley after taking several detours. They arrive just as the town is about to take up it's Jubilee celebrations, and believe it or not; the teenagers become the guests of honour! However, they end up being offered more than just free beer...The fact that the film features the questionable talents of a bunch of young actors will no doubt annoy fans of the original, as it could easily be taken that the film is taking in too many of modern horror's traits. However, I disagree; the young cast do well in their respective roles, and the characters are generally quite easy to like. It's the older cast members that really make the movie stand out, however, and it's obvious that Robert Englund had a good time playing the central role he has in this film. He is joined by prolific actress Lin Shaye, who also does well as his opposite number. Obviously, the most important thing about this film is the gore - and in true HG Lewis fashion, it's amazingly over the top! We've got acid, limb-tearing, eye popping, a nasty little scene involving metal teeth and more! The gore is hard to take seriously...and HG fans will know why that's a good thing. It has to be said that the film is a little messy, but it doesn't matter because it's a constant stream of entertainment. If we're not witnessing a bloody death scene, there's always plenty of naked chicks and Southern 'hospitality' on hand to keep the film fun. Overall, I recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls Just Short of a Modern Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small group of college kids (who else?) go on spring break in Florida. But oh no, they get sidetracked down an abandoned road and end up in Pleasant Valley, the home to 2001 people who just refuse to accept that the North won in the Civil War. And they're not shy about showing it.Let me first make the confession: I never saw the original "2000 Maniacs", so I cannot in any way use that as a base of comparison. I don't know anything about the fabled barrel roll scene. This may or may not be a good thing.Second, let me say this film does a fine job of throwing in many horror icons into bit parts. Aside from Robert Englund and Lin Shaye (who actually have full parts), we have Christa Campbell, Eli Roth (reprising his role from "Cabin Fever"), Kane Hodder, John Landis and probably other people I'm just not recalling at the moment. So, if you're looking for any films involving these people, you're going to have to watch "2001 Maniacs" to be a completist.Those notes aside, let me say I genuinely enjoyed this film. The writing was really funny in a sick sense of humor sort of way. In the early scenes, one character mentioned drinking bathwater while another says a girl is so fine (and she really is) that he would eat the peanuts from her bowel movements. Some of you might say this is the time to turn it off and go home, but for me this is just about when I know I can't take another bathroom break. So, thank you, Mr. Writer.And the deaths. My, those were some good ones. I think the writer and director went out of their way to make the deaths the key to this film's being remembered (and it's horror, so that's a fair goal). I don't really want to give anything away as far as plot goes, but let's say there's a really good use of acid (the burning kind) and an especially nice use for four horses (although I think this scene needed more blood).I was mixed on the humor with regards to the Southerners. I have expressed in many reviews my feeling that horror and comedy must be finely balanced, and I think this is the film's fatal flaw. In an attempt to make the characters more humorous, they ended up being little more than silly caricatures. I especially think the character of Hucklebilly was poorly conceived. Harper Alexander, on the other hand, was dang near perfect. But this really lost me and so much so I want to give this a lower rating (but I won't).I'm also unclear why if these people are holdovers from the Civil War why there are such scantily clad milk maidens and a woman with metal teeth. But this is probably just me taking the film too seriously, and I should just relax and be happy I saw so many scantily clad women at all (there is no shortage of breasts popping out of shirts here).So, in the end, it's a mixed bag leaving me with a mixed reaction. But it's definitely better than average, and worth checking out if you're watching horror movies all the time. You know, because of the hundreds that come out each year, most of them just suck eggs. This, fortunately, was not one of them.</fullReview>

Along the way they are (purposefully) detoured and end up in Pleasant Valley--a town that seems stuck in the Civil War--and they're JUST in time for a celebration. Soon five other airheads show up and the fun begins as the towns folks begin to kill the kids one by one...but why? Then again what can you expect in a town where Robert Englund is the mayor? Besides if you've seen Hershell Gordon Lewis' "2000 Maniacs" you know the answer.I knew I was in trouble with this when I saw Eli Roth listed as a producer. This man makes horror films full of unlikable characters, homophobia and blatant sexism. This film falls right into his sort of movie. The eight outsiders who are attacked and killed are either idiots or over-sexed morons--you WANT them to die! Also when the final four realize something is wrong--what do they do? Why they stay AND separate!!! There's also a bit of homophobia (a gay guy is killed in a really disgusting way), gratuitous female nudity and the expected lesbian scene. There's also a running joke involving bestiality! The acting is actually not too bad considering--Jay Gillespie and Lin Shaye come off best. Also the gore is strong and explicit. But the film has lousy dialogue, annoying characters and Englund overacting so badly you want to hit him. The original "2000 Maniacs" was no masterpiece but it looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to this! I give it a 5--I HAVE seen worse.</fullReview>

(1964). With Hollywood remaking so many classic horror films of late &amp; lavishing huge budgets on them 2001 Maniacs sort of slipped under the radar a bit &amp; as far as I am aware didn't get a theatrical release, certainly not here in the UK or a widespread one anywhere anyway. Two Thousand Maniacs! is a somewhat strange choice of film to remake, apart from Hershell Gordon Lewis fans I doubt it's that well known &amp; despite being one of his better films (that's not saying much) it isn't exactly regarded as any sort of masterpiece. I like the original Two Thousand Maniacs! &amp; I think 2001 Maniacs is a respectful remake, while the original was quite serious in tone this remake is very light hearted &amp; a bit juvenile. There's lots of schoolboy humour &amp; innuendo, jokes about locals having sex with sheep, inbreeding &amp; the way the locals react to a black dude (the black guy ask's 'where do black guy's hang out round here?' only to be told 'from that tree down yonder'). There's copious amounts of sex, breasts &amp; lesbianism as 2001 Maniacs knows it's intended audience &amp; tries to please them. The story is alright but pretty much follows the original including a twist ending which if you have seen the original is left a bit pointless although 2001 Maniacs has a nice added gory ending. The character's are OK (even though compared to the original 2001 Maniacs is populated mostly by good looking young teenagers), the dialogue is amusing &amp; quite punchy at times &amp; the heady mix of sex, nudity &amp; gore worked for me.The original Two Thousand Maniacs! was known for it's gory set-pieces &amp; 2001 Maniacs updates several of them including the rock crushing scene &amp; a cool sequence in which a girl is pulled apart by horses. Disappointingly my favourite kill from the original when someone is put in a barrel lined with nails &amp; rolled down a hill is missing here but it does contain a few gore scenes of it's own. There's a scene in which someone drinks acid &amp; his stomach melts away, there's plenty of severed limbs, decapitated heads &amp; sliced up bodies, there's lots of blood, a bit when a gay man has a spear shoved up his bum which then protrudes from his mouth, a girl gives a guy a blow job with a set of metal pointed razor teeth &amp; a neat double decapitation. The film has an over-the-top feel about it which means you can't really take it seriously, basically the makers know it's audience is going to want good looking young actors, plenty of sex &amp; boobs &amp; lots of blood &amp; gore &amp; do their best to deliver.With a supposed budget of about $3,000,000 according to the IMDb 2001 Maniacs was shot at the end of 2003 but strangely remained unreleased until late 2005 in the US &amp; 2006 pretty much everywhere else. Filmed on location Georgia I would have though something like 2001 Maniacs would have been very commercial. The original Two Thousand Maniacs! featured an irritating yet extremely catchy folk song theme tune which is reworked here without most of the lyrics. Most of the cast are teenagers but Freddy Krueger himself Robert Englund plays the main villain.2001 Maniacs is a fun way to pass 90 odd minutes if all your looking for is lots of nudity, blood, gore &amp; crude humour but I just felt there was something missing, perhaps the fact I didn't like any of the character's &amp; they all looked the same didn't help &amp; a good film always needs a good central character. Followed by the sequel 2001 Maniacs: Beverly Hellbillys (2008).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 Maniacs (2005) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Pretty good remake of the Hershell Gordon Lewis drive-in classic has eight college students driving to Florida but getting off on the wrong road in Georgia. They arrive in a small town where the mayor (Robert Englund) invites them to a local party but the students don't know that they're on the menu. The H.G. Lewis film is one of the best of its type and I really wasn't expecting much from this remake but I can't think of a harder working horror film. The director, screenwriters and producers go all out trying to make a fun horror film full of gore and for the most part they've done their job. Some of the jokes don't work but for the most part they do. We get cousins having sex, perverts and their sheep and some non-PC humor involving a black character. There's also the gore, which is constantly falling on the ground in huge amounts. Add in the nudity, cousin sex and an overall sadistic sense of humor and you've got a fairly good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Hot Planet Names 2001 MANIACS Best Horror Film of 2005</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My selection for this year's Best Horror Film is a dark horse, 2001 MANIACS, a remake of a 1964 horror film that courted controversy. While sticking to the original story, the movie declines to pontificate: messages (racism, jingoism) are diluted within a six-pack libation. Circumventing the original, director Tim Sullivan cues the viscera not as the film's raison d'etre but instead yields to Tex Avery. Sure, there's entrails and decapitations, but Sullivan?who could have leaned on today's technology for clinical realism?opts to tail the Road Runner: 2001 MANIACS is a hybrid of Grand Guignol, ersatz Tennessee Williams and drive-in movie. Unlike the already fossilized movies of last summer, Sullivan forfeits formula and reinvents "splatter." Behind the film's cheerful sadism, and the cynical fade-out, there's a suggestion Pleasant Valley's ghosts will never be exorcised?some of them, in fact, have crossed over to the Six O'clock News.

		<fullReview>This is the most violent thrill-ride ever filmed. Non-stop T &amp; A. The hottest chicks ever seen. Must be seen on the big screen for full effect. The Montreal Fantasia premiere was like a rock concert. I have never seen more people standing during a movie without pissing off those behind them.Lions Gate needs to put this in theaters by Halloween, because 2001 Maniacs will live longer than The Rocky Horror Picture Show in midnight screenings for the next 20 years. It's that good.Only a true internet nerd/geek, sitting in his room in his mother's house, calling in sick to his security guard job at Wallmart would not get this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 Maniacs is hardly a tribute to the original film - it simply pales in comparison.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just returned from the Canadian premiere of 2001 Maniacs at the 2005 Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal. I'll start off by saying that I am a long time fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, and I consider the original Two Thousand Maniacs to be a true American classic. And because I liked the original film so much, I had a hard time watching and enjoying 2001 Maniacs. The new film has none of the fun the original has. The gore effects are O.K., but don't come close to topping the stuff HGL came up with in the original film. 2001 Maniacs is hardly a tribute to the original film - it simply pales in comparison. This feels more like a tribute to Troma Films, rather then a tribute to the great HGL. The filmmakers couldn't even get the theme song right. The rendition of "Rebel Yell"(The South's Gonna Rise Again) was like listening to nails on a caulk board. Tim Sullivan (the director) introduced the film by saying that he wanted to make a valentine to the kinds of films his mother wouldn't let him watch as a child. My guess is that Tim Sullivan never watched these movies even after he decided to make this so-called "valentine." 2001 Maniacs isn't a love letter to the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis, it's a knife in the heart to anyone who ever truly loved and respected the amazing films of Sir Herschell Gordon Lewis - GENIUS!</fullReview>
