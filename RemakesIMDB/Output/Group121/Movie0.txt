		<shortDescription>Early masterpiece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of astronomers hold a meeting where they discuss how to travel to the Moon. The head astronomer proposes that they build something like a huge gun or cannon and fire themselves at the lunar face. After some argument, this is agreed upon, and we see the construction of the cannon and its bullet-like capsule. Once on the moon, the astronomers discover the strange civilization of the Selenites.A Trip to the Moon (aka Le Voyage dans la lune, Voyage to the Moon, and even A Trip to Mars, curiously enough) is usually considered the first token sci-fi film. "Token" is important there, as this surely isn't the first film we could call sci-fi--even Trip to the Moon director/writer/producer/star/production designer/etc. George Méli?s' own The Astronomer's Dream, or The Man on the Moon (Le R?ve d'un astronome, 1898) predates this by four years. But this is the first widely known and accepted sci-fi film, with a significant length, and it has the important distinction of a pithy, well-told story, which Méli?s based on Jules Verne's De la Terre ? la Lune (From the Earth to the Moon), first published in 1865, and parts of H.G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon, first published in 1901. The fact that it was intended as something of a parody is often overlooked, and recontextualizes its sci-fi progenitor status quite a bit, but in a positive way. Like horror, sci-fi frequently walks a fine line between camp and seriousness, so it is appropriate for the token seminal film to have parodic elements.Far more important than A Trip to the Moon's relation to sci-fi, however, is its significance as a film, without genre qualification. Unlike most of the other early film pioneers, Méli?s had a background in show business. He was a skilled magician/illusionist who took over a famed Paris venue, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin. Méli?s embraced the theatricality of film, always searching for ways to make the new medium approximate the ideals (well, or at least the ideals of the fantasy and spectacle side) of the theater. Thus, he made rapid advances in production design, literary content, special effects and further developed an early form of editing, providing a bridge between the early shorts, which were purely mise-en-sc?ne, to a more modern form of montage.A Trip to the Moon's scenes, with their elaborate production design, complete with backdrops painted by Méli?s, are still constructed in a way similar to Thomas Edison's The Barbershop (1894), or the Lumi?re Brothers' Baignade en mer (1895)--that is, with complex, layered, contrapuntal motion playing out before a static camera, which represents the audience's point of view as they watch the action unfold on a "stage". The difference is that whereas Edison and Lumi?re tended to shoot for a feigned naturalism (in some cases--but far fewer than the conventional wisdom has it--actually capturing a "natural" event), Méli?s tries to see how far he can push the fantastical. The result is a film that is as much an example of surrealism as anything else. If you have a taste for those genres--as well as for sci-fi, the absurd, and so on--as I do, and you are acclimated to silent films, you are sure to love A Trip to the Moon.The sets are amazing. The painted backdrops merge seamlessly with the constructed portions and props, creating locations with great "depth", in worlds that seem to surreal exist and have a long history. There are a number of ingenious techniques used to further the illusions, such as the smoke pouring out of the Parisian factories (probably a satirical depiction of some of the negative results of the Industrial Revolution) as the astronomers, who are initially amusingly dressed like wizards/alchemists in long flowing robes and large pointed hats, mount the building to begin their journey. Although some of the special effects and illusions are fairly transparent--such as the descending portions of scenery to enhance the effect of the "Earthrise", most are surprisingly sophisticated. Visually, Méli?s is as impressive as even many modern instantiations of special effects, matte paintings and such. He certainly trumps much low-budget science fiction--even through the 1960s and 1970s--in this department, plus the surrealistic touches give him an edge that I would like to see more in modern films.Just as important, the story is very entertaining. The pacing and narrative construction sustains your interest and manages to make a short that is less than 15-minutes long seem as substantial as a 90-minute feature. Although I've seen versions in the past without it, I now have a version with the intended voice-over narration included (in Kino's "The Movies Begin" box set). This greatly enhances the film, especially as it is frequently but dryly funny.Much has been said, and maybe not just by Freudians, of the sexual subtexts of A Trip to the Moon. For example, the astronomers are assisted by Parisian showgirls, or "manservants", in sexy clothing (they now seem somewhat prescient of the costumed and uniformly choreographed showgirls to come in Hollywood musicals). They build a large gun to shoot themselves to the Moon, and they land with a "spurt" in the Moon's eye. Whether or not any of that was intended (although Freudians, at least, would say it doesn't matter if it was intended), there are more than enough comical and satirical takes on astronomers, space travel/the nature of space, and the "reality" of the Moon and its surprising inhabitants to keep anyone entertained. This is truly one of the earliest masterpieces of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Trip to the Moon" is justly the most popular early film. I've seen thousands of early short movies and have commented on the most interesting cases, but this one is more amusing and imaginative than the rest. It's better than Georges Méli?s's other surviving pictures because it has a more developed story--without the tableau vivant style becoming as boring as it usually does. Wacky humor and trick shots help, but that's in the rest of his oeuvre, too. Influenced by the works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, as well as Adolphe Dennery's adaptation of those pieces, the story is about a gang of astronomers, who, launched from a cannon onto the Moon, encounter explosive aliens (or "Selenites", as Méli?s called them).Méli?s used the stop-motion (or substitution-splice) effect and arising smoke for explosive characters in many of his films--same with superimpositions, animated miniatures and placing a fish tank in front of the camera. Additionally, his set designs were the best of the day. I easily forget it's all done within a cramped studio. He often used moving props, too, but this is one of the few that I've seen where the prop is pulled towards the camera--creating the famous rocket kissing the moon's eye gag. The following shot is a temporal replay of that action from a different perspective. It works here, but Edwin S. Porter would make the mistake of adopting the technique for "Life of an American Fireman", which was reedited later, leading many to believe it was a landmark in narrative editing. The "30 tableaux", as Méli?s called it, is linked by dissolves--a common transition at the time, which Méli?s introduced.Méli?s made it known that his goal was to push cinema towards resembling theatre. The benefit was longer films with more developed stories. Given this, it's ironic that Méli?s was one of the first filmmakers to achieve effects specific to motion pictures (i.e. incapable of being produced in theatre or other artistic media)... i.e. the trick shots.Numerous early shorts are blatant imitations of Méli?s's work, but they usually weren't as funny or creative. Many studios even duped his films and sold them as their own, which led to Méli?s patenting his work in the U.S. and joining the Motion Pictures Patents Company (MPPC). "A Trip to the Moon" represents the height of his career. His work would soon diminish under the hectic schedule of the Nickelodeon age and the monopolization by the MPCC and Pathé, and he would end up burning his own negatives. Watch Jacques Meny's documentary "La Magie Méli?s" (1997) for a good telling of his life and films.(Note: This is one of four films that I've commented on because they're landmarks of early narrative development in film history. The others are "As Seen Through a Telescope", "The Great Train Robbery" and "Rescued by Rover".)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A special movie by the father of special effects!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The face of cinema has been changed drastically, and the expectations from the viewers have also been changed. Nowadays we have a bunch of options before choosing a movie, from realistic dinosaurs to computer generated images and from mind throttling actions to terrifying stunts, we have them all but in this era of technology nobody can ignore the true genius of George Melies, as I had seen 'A Trip to The Moon' I was amazed that what he had done in 1902 with all his limitations. The 14 min of this short movie captivates you and the vision of Jules Verne was precisely conveyed. The editing, photography, and special effects created by Melies are immaculate. And the way he showed the landing of a rocket on the moon was very much humorous as the rocket landed on the eye of personified moon and how the native of moon threatened the astronomers to leave. These types of movies are the edifice of today's fantasy movies .In the end it's the best work by Melies and worth a watch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one of the first films of the science fiction genre, "Le Voyage Dans la Lune" (or "A Trip to the Moon") is revered as the greatest achievement of stage magician and film pioneer Georges Méli?s and one of the most important movies ever done. Written and directed by Méli?s himself, "Le Voyage Dans la Lune" is a wonderful visual fantasy that shows Méli?s' imagination at its wildest form, and how with limited resources and lots of creativity he managed to make a film like nothing the world had ever seen before."A Trip to the Moon" is loosely based on the books "From the Earth to the Moon" by Jules Verne, and "The First Men in the Moon" by H. G. Wells, as it deals with the adventures of a group of astronomers in their first travel to the moon and the wonders and dangers of their Odyssey. After arriving to the Moon in their bullet-shaped spaceship (it was launched by a giant cannon), they discover the Selenites, the people from the Moon; and as their presence is unwelcome, the group of astronomers will have to fight for their survival.With a runtime of barely 14 minutes, "Le Voyage Dans la Lune" is an awe-inspiring ride of fantasy, adventure and magic that more than 100 years after its release, still captures the imagination with its wonderfully crafted visuals and its charming comedy. The plot is very well-written, as the story flows nicely and although of a very simple nature, it's very well-developed and really entertaining showing that Méli?s was a gifted storyteller.However, the most amazing feature of "A Trip to the Moon" is without a doubt its amazing visuals. With a mix of stage tricks, camera tricks, and several types of animation, Méli?s crafts a surreal fantastic vision of the Moon with the care of a painter and great artistic sensibility. It's almost as if a painting came to life. The now iconic image of the Man in the Moon being hit in the eye by the spaceship is only one of the many amazing scenes that the genius of Méli?s crafted with great imagination.Director D.W. Griffith said about Méli?s, "I owe him everything" and Charles Chaplin called him "the alchemist of light" and both men were absolutely right in their remarks. Georges Méli?s' work is a must-see for every film buff and I dare to say, for everyone in general as in its simplicity, it conveys humanity's most powerful trait: Imagination. "Le Voyage Dans la Lune", Méli?s's most famous film, is without a doubt an immortal classic and one of the greatest films ever done. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100 years old, and it still looks great! An achievement in early movie-making!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this short but excellent silent film, when I was little, and it still looks great after a century of age. Despite the very primitve special effects, and the obvious phony description of the moon itself. Heck proably this movie can be made by any eight year-old today, but the overall plot and theme of the movie is well understood. The movie's director Georges M?©li?¨s, knew how to arouse people's imagination's and thought this project would work, and it did!Too bad, he didn't earn a cent on American expenses of the movie, which he wasn't expected. They even feature this movie on the famous HBO series "From the earth to the Moon" complete with an archieve interview of one of the person involved, I forget his name, but all fans of the wonderful film, should catch the last part of that series, they show how in great detail how the film was made and all the troubles they went through.In all, anyone can enjoy this, who knows? maybe people will think the same of our movies, 100 years from now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Melie's "A Trip to the Moon" welcomes a change in film making of the twentieth century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Melies's `A Trip to the Moon' welcomes a change in film making of the twentieth century. Combined with live action as well as models, the movie tells a story about astronauts who take a trip to the moon. The moon, having a human face captures the astronauts after they crash into its eye. They later escape the moon and it's moon-men and make it back to earth safely. Melies wrote, directed and starred in this movie. He used many important techniques in his films to make them successful. Not only did he develop editing skills and superimposed images, he also used double exposure to complete the magic behind his films. Still used today, Melies's special effects, small models, painted backgrounds, weird makeup and costumes were just some of the important things used in the movie `A Trip to the Moon.'For the filmmaker Melies, the use of stop action photography played an important role in `A Trip to the Moon.' He specialized in making objects vanish or change by stopping and restarting his camera. The use of self-painted sets, real people along with animated figures and the placement of real faces on objects helped this 1902 movie draw in his audience and leave them with many astonished looks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of astronomers studies the way to travel to the moon. When they conclude their project, the president selects five other astronomers to travel with him. They embark in a shell and they are shot from a giant cannon to the moon. When they land, they seek shelter in a cave to protect from the snow. They meet the Selenites, the alien inhabitants of the moon, and they are destroyed by the astronomers that find that a strong hit make them explode. However, they arrive in large number and the astronomers are captured by the Selenites. But one astronomer hits their king that explodes and they run to the capsule pursued by the alien. They drop the capsule that falls through the space and reach the ocean. Then they are rescued by a steamer that brings the team safe and sound ashore."Le Voyage Dans la Lune" is the first sci-fi and considered among the greatest films of the cinema history. The story uses impressive animation and special effects for a 1902 silent movie. The plot is a non-sense surrealistic comedy in the present days, but this French film is mandatory to any movie lover or student. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Viagem ?

		<fullReview>This film is an amazing technical feat for any era but especially so when one regards it's utter uniqueness in relation to anything that had been created at the time. The film is an embodiment of cinematic revolution coming only eight years after the Edison shorts, which had been dazzling when first released, it made all other films look ordinary and unimaginative in the face of the abounding creativity that the film demonstrates.The special effects are mind-blowing when taken in the context of the era in which it was released and the tight, structured narrative provides amusement and enjoyment for fans today, over 100 years after the film's release. The child-like creativity of the director enhances the enjoyment of the film and serves to create a world into which the audience is invited with the utmost enthusiasm.A genuine feat of making what would have previously been considered impossible possible, this is a must see for all fans of cinema of all ages, as more than any other film this can lay claim to giving birth to cinema as we know it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful historical treasure, made with care and skill by one of the masters of early motion pictures. It is also entertaining to watch, in addition to its historical value, since it is loaded with creative ideas both in the story and in the way it was made.While many of the techniques that Méli?s used are now considered outdated, almost of them still hold up well as you watch it. It's fascinating to see the ways that he used his amazing imagination to solve some of the technical challenges, in order to produce the effects that he wanted.It's equally fascinating to see the conception of space travel (mostly based on Jules Verne). It may have scientific flaws that are known to later generations, and it is sometimes stylized, but it shows marvelous inventiveness. It's no wonder that this is one of the best-remembered films from cinema's earliest years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical short by one of cinema's special effects pioneers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georges Melies is often credited with being the cinema's father of fantasy, and his 1902 short A Trip to the Moon would seem to support that contention. Full of imaginative uses of editing and photography and inspired by the works of Jules Verne, the film contains one of the most recognizable images in motion picture history: the sleek, steel-riveted rocket ship jutting out from one of the eye sockets of an expressive man in the moon. Most historical accounts of Melies indicate that he was a trained stage magician whose skills were well-adapted to the new medium of the cinema, but he was also the first filmmaker to produce "commercials" (in the sense of advertising films for a variety of companies). A Trip to the Moon is still surprisingly enjoyable and bursts with many of Melies' technical innovations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>utterly charming and strange---and a GIANT step forward for cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a VERY early film and unlike other "films" of the day, this one is very advanced in that it tells a whole story and has incredibly complex sets and special effects for its day. Most movies of the day lasted a minute or two and were really just snippets of film. At fourteen minutes, this is, for its time, a full-length picture! And, even though by today's standards the film is VERY dated and clumsy, it still retains much of its original watchability because of its light spirit and silly script.The story begins in what appears to be a classroom at a university--however, this isn't certain, as the film lacks title cards to tell you what is occurring (something few movies of the day had). However, when the group of scientists are led out to what appears to be a giant bullet, the action heats up and the story gets interesting. The "bullet" is opened and it seems it's a space capsule. The capsule is shoved into an enormous gun and is shot to the moon.At this point, the film is really cute--having an actual man's face in the moon. The face is quite upset, mind you, when the capsule becomes lodged in the eye! Surprisingly, the air on the moon is fine and the men walk about the weird moonscape (full of cool stars and planets you just have to see to appreciate). Later, they discover an underground cave...and moon men! The moon men are hostile, but considering that they explode when you hit them, they aren't too much trouble for our intrepid travelers. They make a hasty escape and fall from the moon back home.The film is so full of wacky special effects and cute over-the-top gimmicks that it is just a lot of fun to watch. Give it a try yourself by going to a film archive at http://www.archive.org/details/LevoyagedanslaluneAlso, if you want to see it on DVD, it's included in a great compilation for avid cinephiles and historians ("The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works"). It features early films by Edison, Lumi?re and others. While the average viewer will probably NOT be very impressed by these early films, I found them fascinating--particularly this film and THE SERPENTINE DANCES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of its time, A Trip to the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Trip to the Moon (Le Voyage dans a la lune) starts off with astronomers who come together as a council of astronomers who sit down and try to figure out a way on making it to the moon. The head astronomer draws a diagram on the methods of making it to the moon. A huge fuss breaks out because some of the astronomers do not agree but eventually a compromise is made and the plan to build the bullet continues. The astronomers come up with a design that resembles a bullet and they discuss shooting it (the bullet) out of a large gun. As the builders are building the bullet the astronomers are observing the bullet design. It seems as if they are questioning some aspect of its design. An assembly of people gathers once the bullet has been loaded into the gun. The astronomers rejoice at the completion of the bullet and load into it one by one. The military was in charge of firing the bullet. The bullet was fired in such a way that it resembles the launch of a modern rocket through space. Somehow the bullet lands on the moon with everyone unharmed. The astronomers get out of the bullet and rejoice as they look at the Earth from the moon. Eventually, they settled down to sleep while in the background you see shooting stars and images of people's faces within the stars. Once it starts snowing they wake up and try to find shelter. As they search for shelter they come up to an alien who one astronomer hits with his umbrella and the alien explodes on impact. More and more aliens come and the humans are overrun. The aliens take the humans back to an area that resembles a court but the astronomers manage to run away while aliens around them are exploding. They get back into the bullet and head down back down to Earth where they land in water. Ships come to the rescue and a ceremony is held where they are regarded as heroes.It's hard to imagine how Melies was able to create such an exciting short film over a hundred years ago. His incorporation of animation and use of imagery within the film still goes on today. He depicts aliens as frightening creatures who are hostile towards humans is something that Hollywood does to this day. In this film Melies designs bullet that resembles a rocket. This bullet's design is similar to the rocket designs that engineers were actually building and launching forty years after this film. Melies was able to successfully associate technology with the body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Georges Melies was a magician by trade and brought his trade to cinema . He is effectively the founder of special effects in cinema and throughout the infancy of early cinema other film makers sought to emulate his style - one of having audiences gasp and sit back in awe at the on screen events . A TRIP TO THE MOON is rightly Melies most famous film . It is simply landmark cinema at its most radical You have to be somewhat forgiving watching it in the 21st century however . If you're used to seeing dinosaurs chasing Sam Neill in a jeep and Elijah Wood battling a giant spider then the effects seen here may seem lacking . Likewise the story which has a run time of 13 minutes but again you need to remember the historical context . Everything in cinema at that time was geared to visuals . If you were interested in stories you'd be better off reading a book Talking of books leads to either a bitter irony or poetic justice where Melies is concerned . Thomas Edison's film technician's had secretly made copies of the film meaning Melies lost out on financial profit in America , so much so he eventually ended up bankrupt . Sad maybe but considering the film rips off both Jules Verne and HG Wells , neither of whom are on record as receiving a penny for their obvious inspiration for the movie perhaps we shouldn't be too liberal with our sympathies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French silent classic. Produced, written, and directed by Georges Méli?s, who took inspiration from Jules Verne's "From the Earth to the Moon" (1865) and H. G. Wells' "First Men in the Moon" (1901). The first science fiction film ever made was very expensive to produce for films of its time, and it was a huge success worldwide.The fully restored 14-minute silent is posted to YouTube. The hand-painted cels have been restored and re-assembled digitally. There are no interstitial titles or dialogue. Everything is communicated via pantomime and music cues. The music recorded with this release is a great asset to the visuals, and is not a conventional silent film score. The joy I experienced while watching this I usually associate with The Wizard of Oz (1939) and such films. The movie is a continuous 14 minutes of sheer visual delight. Note especially the way women are featured.One truly amazing aspect is the actual capsule that travels to the Moon. Just compare the ship featured in "Le voyage dans la lune" with the Service &amp; Command Modules which actually orbited the Moon during the Apollo missions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking back at the very first Sci-Fiction movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Apollo 11, our great grandfathers were quite ignorant back, but I do not blame them. The moon used to be a very mysterious place before the space age. It's amazing to see what we used to believe was fact that we now take for granted. A Trip to the Moon, or Le Voyage dans la Lune (Voyage to the Moon) is not only a trip to the moon, but also a trip back in time. The film is loosely based on two popular sci fiction novels, H.G Wells' First Men in the Moon and Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon. The way that the film allows the traveler's to reach the moon mirrors Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon's bullet ship. The plot is pretty easy to get into, a bunch of men travel to the moon after being shot in a bullet capsule from a giant cannon by beautiful, swimsuit clad women. Now, if only NASA'd had a bunch of beautiful, swimsuit-clad babes for the launch crew of Apollo 11, the U.S. might still have a Moon program today! It's silly, it's weird, it's just happen to be women in swimsuits. George Melies was known for putting beautiful women in his films and not giving them a part except to be wallflowers. There was no point to it, but eye candy. I love that they use to build 2D models for their sets and props -- like the rocket, cannon, town scene -- but just paint them to look 3D. Just shows how strongly film was dominated by theatrical precepts. After blasting off, the men land on the moon, twice. The first time it is shown crashing into the eye of the Man in the Moon; the second time it is shown landing on the Moon's flat terrain. I don't if it's done on purpose, or accidentally. If done on purpose, it was be some lost art concept. It was also try out on Edwin Porter 'Life of an American Fireman'. I believe analyzing it that it's suppose to be Tautology or unnecessary repetition of meaning. The film hints a Munchhausen trilemma, that proposes that any world view reduces ultimately to the choice between unprovable axiomatic assumptions or infinite regress of language, reasoning, logic and metaphor. This is why, the stars turns into multiply logos, or symbols. For example, the men sleeping on the moon and the normal stars turn into human-like symbols. That why it's always reminds of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen just its sense of creativity. Maybe I'm looking too much into it, and it's just a mistake. After all, a scene after they land, they get out, the bullet ship disappears from the screen again. Some people have also claimed that the film was one of the earliest examples of pataphysical film, aim to show the illogicality of logical thinking. It can also mean the hierarchal values of modern French society and hold them up to ridicule in a riot of the carnivalesque. This is seen as an inherent part of the film's plot: the story pokes fun at the scientists and at science in general, in that upon traveling to the Moon, the astronomers find that the face of the Moon is, in fact, the face of a man, and that it is populated by little green men. It's still up in question. After all, it's not like I can ask George Melies about his message or vision anyways. While George Melie's film only runs 14 minutes, projected at 16 frames per second, which was the standard frame rate at the time, the uses of innovative animation and special effects was ground-breaking. There are two versions of the film, one is the black and white while the other is hand-colored. The hand-colored version was discovered in 1993 in almost total decomposition, but it was frame by frame restorated. Watching in color is interesting and my opinion better. It was hand colored by George Melies. This is amazing once you realize that they hand-painted each and every one of the film. Even though they did not paint the entire movie, imagine the time and patience spent on coloring frame by frame with stencils, every detail with care. For a while, some of the film was also missing, such in the case of the ending of this film. The ending sequence was considered lost until 2002, a well preserved complete print was discovered in a barn in France. This is what kept our great grandparents entertained at the theaters. It must have been so wonderful to have minds so innocent to be captivated by these kinds of shows. Modern day audience might be such movie snobs now that this might bores them. I see it as a interesting piece of history. It's not the greatest film, and the plot is silly as hell, but it serve as a inspiration to many of the modern day Sci-Fiction movies we love today. Plus, steam punk was born. Also to note-- it's inspiration books such as that of Hugo Cabret. It was a inspiration for music as well, fueling ideas for Smashing Pumpkins 'tonight tonight' video and bands like Air. Imagine a world 100 years ago when the plane wasn't even there. The world was close to never seen from great height and don't even think about electricity, what was still experimental in that time. Then you can make a fantasy story with some frightening realistic forms going to put in a film. It's just wow. Of course the effects aren't great, but if you look through it, you see so much brilliance. That's how you should view this movie. It is pure poetry in motion</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was amazing that, in 1902, the filmmaker Georges Méli?s had the foresight to add showgirls to his little film. Whether from the Folies Berg?res or Vegas, the showgirl will always be a part of cinema.This is presumable the first SciFi flick, and the animation was a real joy to watch, as was the lack of scientific knowledge.Imagine going to the moon shot out of a cannon; imagine astronauts in tops hats and tails; imagine that to return all you need is to drop the capsule off the moon and it will return to Earth. These are not errors, but part of what makes this film so enjoyable, like the fact that the capsule hits the moon right in the eye like a big pizza pie. That's Amore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the toy finally grew up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early years of motion pictures (from 1895 to 1900 or so) are fairly boring. As a television series from the 1970s called it, it was the period when there was a toy that grew up. While eventually England and America and Germany and Italy and the other countries would start realizing that movies could tell stories, the initial period did two things with movies: record current events (and sometimes tell a story, like a mock filming of the naval battle of Santiago Bay in the Spanish-American War) but far more frequently mistakenly photograph things of temporary interest (military parades, or the dedication of monuments or something like that). Sometimes they would show the funeral of a leader (President McKinley, for instance). But Edison and others would also photograph people dancing, or (in one moment of daring) two actors performing a notorious "kissing" scene from a recent Broadway success (I bet that got some serious attention from church groups). Since all these films were silent, the idea that any scene from a current play was shown seems rather ludicrous, but the actual kiss between the mustachioed man and his girlfriend sold the movie tickets.Then came a whiff of fresh air from France. A former music hall artiste, a magician named George Melies, suddenly realized what a remarkable device the motion picture camera was. He used it to showcase all of his magic act - such as decapitating an assistant and blowing the man's head up with gas so that the head would sputter in anger as it got too large - insisting that it should be reattached (which it was at the end of the film).Slowly Melies went beyond his bag of magic illusions. He decided to dramatize a story - by one of his nation's best known novelists. He filmed his version of "From The Earth To The Moon" by Jules Verne. "Le Voyage Dans La Lune" came out in 1902. Primitive as is it's special effects to our age of computerization a century and five years later, for 1902 Melies was light-years ahead of any competition. Keep in mind that Edwin Porter's "Life Of An American Fireman" and "The Great Train Robbery" did not come out until a year later, and that D.W. Griffith did not really get underway until about 1906/07. And while both stressed telling a straight story, neither had really interesting special effects.This is the first (in chronological order) movie most of us remember. We recall the firing of the "Columbiad" and the capsule with our space travelers approaching the moon, and the most famous shot - the capsule hitting the eye of the man in the moon. It was a clever joke (and one not in Verne's novel - it's Melies own gag), and it has lasted 105 years now - not bad at all!But there was more to Melies' version than that - about twelve minutes of movie. He has a meeting of savants discussing the project (and wearing the costumes of "wizards" when they meet - is this his idea of Verne's Baltimore Gun Club?). They agree on the project specifications, and we see some of them (wearing 19th Century frock coats and top hats) watching the casting of the cannon and the space capsule. Then they board the space capsule, and a bevy of 1902 female space groupies (perhaps a little plump for male tastes today, but quite attractive to male viewers in 1902) load the capsule into the cannon. Melies was a magician, and probably had female assistants on stage - he probably realized that whatever we thought sex sold tickets!Then follows the shooting to the moon, and the capsule's arrival, with the door opening up and spilling out the travelers. Unfortunately (possibly Melies had read Wells' "The First Men In The Moon" (1899) where Moon natives appear), the Selenites don't like the Earthlings and threaten them. But it turns out that if you hit them, they explode and disappear. Still the travelers decides to leave the moon, turn their capsule around and take off (just how is hard to explain). They return to earth and are feted as heroes.I've often wondered if Verne (who died in 1905) ever heard of Melies' film or watched it. In his last years Verne had cataracts in his eyes, so viewing might have been difficult. He also had diabetes (he'd die of it). He may have regretted the jettisoning of so much of his plot, but I would hope that he would have enjoyed the enchanting magical variant that Melies did create. It was the first film classic of lasting importance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The early 1902 French film, Le Voyage dans la lune, is regarded as the first science fiction film; perhaps it could even be considered the first comedy-science fiction film as well.The film explores the possibility of space travel with a comical twist. One comical moment shined when the explorers were loaded into a spaceship shaped like a bullet, and were shot into the "moon's eye," through a giant size cannon.I agree with the user: Snow Leopard's review in the films entertaining and historical value. This type of motion picture is one that could sink in with the viewers of its time frame.The movie's special effects would be considered admirable for it's time, the use of pyro- technics, smoke effects, and frame manipulation, help it to be entertaining.To the modern viewer, this early motion picture could be viewed as eye-candy, and could be enjoyed further by theatre aficionados as well. As for theme and meaning behind the film, it is open to ambiguity. Director George Melies demonstrates creativity and comedy in a film that could still be enjoyed over a century later</fullReview>

The hand painted backdrops are fantastic, the "animated" moon and stars are wonderful and the alien Selesians are imaginative.Allegedly this is the first film to use both animation and special effects, to great effect. But it is not the first sci-fi.It doesn't take itself very seriously and that is a delight. The president looks like a wizard from 'Fantasia', one of the astronomers falls in to a bucket of nitroglycerin and an umbrella grows into a mushroom, but the best is when they fall of the edge of the moon.Recommended for anyone not afraid of the black and white.</fullReview>

The most iconic shot of the film is the image of the cylinder-shaped spaceship landing in the eye of the moon. A lot of people may find the image creepy, and a lot will find it funny, but, no matter what you think of it, it's definitely a hard image to forget."A Trip to the Moon" is a magnificent science fiction satire that changed cinema forever.

		<shortDescription>A Silent-Era, Special Effects Extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(*Note*) - Due to A Trip To The Moon's age, I have cut it a lot of slack with my 6-star rating.Released in 1902 - This novel, hand-tinted, Sci-Fi short (now 113 years old) has got to be one of the most technically innovative films produced up to that time in movie-making history.For its day, this film's special effects are really quite impressive and entertaining. I can easily imagine that this one film must've completely amazed its audiences back when it was initially released.With a rather brief running time of only 15 minutes, A Trip To The Moon's story tells the tale of 6 scientists (who all appear to be somewhat daft) and their quick trip to the moon in a canon-propelled spaceship that's shaped very much like a gigantic bullet.Filmed on a modest budget of 10,000 francs, A Trip To The Moon was shot in France. It's director was Georges Melies whose innovative work in the medium of motion pictures went all the way back to 1896.When A Trip To The Moon was distributed in America it was a phenomenal hit and literally earned millions. But Melies never saw a single penny of these profits since Edison Studios cheated this special-effects pioneer out of his fair share by underhandedly winning the legal rights to be the sole distributor of this film in North America.</fullReview>

From pioneer filmmaker Georges Méli?s and inspired by Jules Verne, it's the story of a group of astronomers who launch themselves to the moon on a rocket. Once there, they encounter hostile alien creatures. The special effects and sets are pretty great when you consider that this was made over a century ago. It's all very quaint and charming today but I'm sure at the time it blew people's minds. Historically it's very significant but I think there's still some entertainment value to be had for today's viewer. It has a short runtime and enough interesting things going on plus a high 'cute' factor that I think most viewers will have fun with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginnings of cinema with Melies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is unusual among other art forms, in that its origins can be firmly established. Consider music, for example: no one can say what the melody to be performed was; likewise no one will ever know what the first noteworthy play to be performed live was. However, because film has existed only in the relatively recent past, and also because at some point all projected motion pictures have left behind their original camera negative, we can fairly definitively create a full appreciation of the history of cinema.Georges Méli?s' A Trip To The Moon cannot, however, claim to be the first ever piece of film to be shot, with that particular honour going to a 1888 feature, Roundhay Garden Scene. At just two seconds long, it's not a classic, and for the next decade film would follow this example, being viewed as something of a novelty. Early films created by entrepreneurs such as the Lumiere brothers and Mitchell &amp; Kenyon simply document everyday goings on, and were no more than a minute long. They were popular because people would pay to see themselves on film, but that was as far at the entertainment went.And this is where Georges Méli?s enters the picture. Méli?s had previously worked as a magician before getting involved with film, and whilst his contemporaries were filming workers leaving factories or dancing on a lawn, Méli?s was pushing the boundaries of what was achievable on celluloid. By the time he produced A Trip To The Moon, he had been creating special effects based on his experience as a magician, for six years. Previously his films had been loose 2-3 minute works with very little story to hold them together, so when he released the epic, 14-minute A Trip To The Moon, the public had never seen anything on this scale.Even to have a full story, rather than just an adaptation of a single scene, was quite a revolutionary idea. In A Trip To The Moon we see a team of astronauts (one of which is played by Méli?s himself) build a rocket and cannon, to fire them up to the moon. They crash into the eye of the moon (in one of the most iconic shots of early cinema) and once on the moon, aliens (Selenites) appear. The astronauts discover they can make these aliens disappear in a puff of smoke if they hit them with force, and proceed to destroy masses of the creatures, including their leader. Outnumbered, the astronauts run back to their rocket and plummet back down to Earth and into the sea. This was based on a Jules Verne story, From The Earth to the Moon (1865), and is conveniently labelled as the very first "science fiction" film. You could fairly say that every subsequent sci-fi film owes a debt to A Trip to the Moon.This was all thrilling stuff to an audience of 1902, who had never really seen anything like it before. Watching it back now, it inevitably looks archaic, with none of the closeups or characterisation we'd eventually come to expect from cinema. Méli?s obviously loved the cross-cutting technique and used it to death here, but ultimately it's apparent that he was just trying to create an entertaining 14 minutes of escapism for audiences to enjoy. He succeeded admirably, and can have had no notion that his film would still be celebrated so long after its production. We have to spare a thought for poor Méli?s at this point, who had created A Trip To The Moon with commercial success in mind, and intended to release the film in America for profit. An unscrupulous Thomas Edison, however, got there first and released the' film himself, depriving Méli?s of any future profits. This contributed to Méli?s' eventual bankruptcy in 1913, when he was forced to become a salesman to earn a living, as depicted in the ode to early cinema that is Martin Scorsese's Hugo (2011).Unlike a lot of later landmarks in the history of cinema, A Trip To The Moon only lasts a few minutes and has a basic storyline, so you can easily watch it on a coffee break or while waiting for the toast to burn. Méli?s went to the trouble of hand-colouring the entire film, and it's even had a recent restoration which finally brings it close to the stage it was well over a century ago. The copyright has now long since expired, so you can easily watch this on YouTube, but I'd encourage anyone to try and watch the hand-coloured version which is infinitely superior. Though it may look primitive A Trip To The Moon is where cinema really got serious, and in 14 minutes you can witness for yourself the birth of an art form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Trip to the Moon is about fifteen minutes long so there is not much in terms of story. However, this is an important film for cinema because it showcased great special effects at the time and possibly the first science fiction film. It showcases wild imagination that even today inspires creativity with its visuals.The story is simple. Astronomers want to go to the Moon and fly a rocket into it (leading with the iconic face of the Moon having a ship lodged in its eye). The story then gets into trippy mushrooms, acrobatic aliens, and parades. It is all very surreal and it is great to see how they handled with little money.Overall, this is an important landmark in cinema that if you love film it has to be seen. It is short also so no worry about spending three plus hours with it.</fullReview>

We cannot, of course, judge this great pioneering work by the standards of today and it is, by definition, impossible to judge it by the standards of its own day. In 1902 the Wright Brothers had yet to make their inaugural manned flight from Kittihawk so who was to say that men would NOT be able to fly to the moon in ordinary clothes nor how long such a trip would take and by extension how much food and drink they would need and how they would evacuate it once digested. If we start worrying about things like this we are in danger of overlooking the imagination at work and the magic it brought forth. A cinematic wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Viewing For Film Novices And Experts Alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le Voyage Dans La Lune (A Trip To The Moon) is an early experimental film produced in 1902 by film pioneer Georges Melies. It is based on two books by Jules Verne and H.G. Wells; each involving human travel to the moon. This is of course many decades before the Apollo missions actually made this fiction a reality. But coming at the end of the Victorian era, well before your grandparents were likely born, this film must have been a spectacle of creativity and imagination unlike anything the world had seen up to that time. Though the lunar world depicted in the film is, of course, vastly different than from what Neil and Buzz experienced, for the first time, people could actually see what a mission to the moon might be like.Prior to the advent of cinema, people would read books if they wanted to take a trip to the realm of fantasy. That realm would only be seen through their imaginations, and it was an image unique to the reader: No two people experienced the same images while reading the same book. Film, however, was something entirely different. The appearance and overall aesthetics of a film are decided by only one person or group of people, and what you see is the vision of those film's makers. While it certainly may be imaginative, it is a product of the director's imagination and not your own. It is for this reason that film and TV have endured much criticism from both traditionalists and contemporaries. I'm sure "A Trip To The Moon" received a lot of such criticism when it was first introduced to audiences at the turn of the century. I'm sure art critics were not happy with the way Melies more or less forced his vision of what the moon was like on people.But that just goes to show you that if a new art form sends audiences and critics into a frenzy, it must have some importance to it. Let's leave it at this: "A Trip To The Moon" changed the world forever. It was arguably the first film to actually tell a story. Experimental films prior to this just showed such everyday events as a train pulling into a station or a woman standing in a Victorian garden. The cinematography was quite revolutionary for the time though it would seem very dated by the time more sophisticated films such as "Birth Of A Nation" and "The Great Train Robbery" were made. It was pretty much the first film to make use of special effects such as the landing on the moon or the exploding moon men. Again, this was all quite dated even by the 1920s, but still, for its time this film was a milestone in experimental art. Nothing would ever be quite the same afterward, and for the first time, film was a true art-form.Some people may dismiss "Le Voyage Dans La Lune" as a mere novelty that turn-of-the-century spectators were interested in only because there was nothing like it before. But such a dismissal is really a missed opportunity to see what film was like when it was in its infancy, and to view it in a different way that only the Victorian era people could have seen. It doesn't matter whether your a casual film buff or a film scholar. This is a film you must see in order to truly understand the art-form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Trip to the Moon" must have been the star of its time. The creativity that went into this film is apparent. What they are able to create with the limited skills of their time is beyond what viewers would expect. It is hard to look back though at this piece of history and been amazed at it. There are so many things in movies now that audiences take for granted that put this movie to shame. The best way to further elaborate on this movies is through revealing its themes, explaining its achievements, and examining its faults.The themes that are expressed in the movie are themes that have been embedded in American culture for many years. The two themes used in this movie are exploration and curiosity. Exploration was first eluded too when the astronomers first landed on the moon in the movie. The astronomers were examining all the new elements on the planet. One of the main objects that they were particularly concerned with were the mushrooms that existed on the moon. The second theme was brought into the film when the astronomers decided originally that they wanted to explore the moon and then when they advanced toward the aliens who attacked and captured them. The themes tie into American themes of expansion of what you have and move to discover new things.The movie had many achievements and many faults as it progressed. An achievement that was critical was making the footage of the launch look as authentic as it did was cropping the film together to look like the space craft was being launched into space. The second achievement that was impressive was the detail that they put into the monsters and the smoke that occurred when the astronomers killed the aliens. Faults that were apparent, but could have been intention was the use of mushrooms as what exist on the moon and the use of aliens. It is hard for people to look back today and not laugh at what humans before us though was on the moon. Another fault that was apparent in the information that people in that time had was that you could fall off the moon surface and eventually land on the earth again.Overall I believe that "A Trip to the Moon" expressed many the main components humans look for. Through examining themes, the movies achievements and the movies fault it helps the audience to understand how many different layers there can be to a film. Although man had not yet reached the moon he was still striving to imagine what it can be like. Although the beliefs can be destroyed by facts about the moon since we have been able to visit multiple times the movie still has entertainment value. This movie was one of the first sci-fi movies and a start of a whole genre. Science Fiction has expanding increasing due to response that was achieve by acting on the curious nature of humans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSWell, I am back to commenting on early silent films again. First Roadhay Garden Scene, then Train Pulling Into A Station, now this. This one is very good. This, I believe, was one of the first film with a real, pure story. I mean, people go to the moon, how simple is that? I must say, though, the first five minutes are very boring, but the last five minutes more than make up for the first five minutes.Here is the very simple plot. A group of astronomers go to the moon in a rocket. They then find some aliens. They are captured by the bug aliens of death. They barely escape. They get into their rocket, with the aliens close behind them. When they go an alien gets onto their rocket. It clings on. The rocket makes a crash landing in an ocean. Luckily, the astronomers are saved by a ship.Overall, this is truly a fantastic silent film. I have a couple questions about this film. For example, why does Train Pulling Into A Station and A Trip To The Moon have the same cover? I always thought Train Pulling Into A Station should have a train on the cover of it. Anyway, you definitely will not regret watching this ten minute film.9/10Recommended Films: Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing For The Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies may be timeless, but much like Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all time has to be watched with its original era in mind, A Trip To The Moon must have that same courtesy. Even with advancements in technology since this first science fiction movie ever, made in 1902, the average person would have great difficulty replicating or exceeding the action of the ten minute motion picture.In this originally French film, a president declares the ability and desire to travel to the moon and subsequently leads an expedition to the planet. The famous still shot of the moon with a rocket in its eye comes from this film. The party arrives at the moon and discovers many amazing and unknown things including a race of unknown beings. As a science fiction film, of course the creatures prove hostile and the group must make an effort to leave the planet. When the action finally dissipates, no beautiful dénouement occurs: the story simply ends with little to no warning. It may seem annoying today, but likely the ten minute prior to this cessation of action more than makes up for the sudden lull in it to the original audience.Considering the state of movie prior to this film emerging, it clearly accomplishes plenty. As the first to hit the science fiction genre, it must make quite an impression so that things like the literal moon's face with a rocket in the eye still stands as a noticeable moment that periodically emerges in popular culture. The plot lines of many recent movies, most notable Mission To Mars, follow the basic crux of this film, and had A Trip To The Moon not made its mark in 1902, who knows what state movies might be in right now. Science fiction might not have reached the mass popularity it has today. Many say that Lawrence of Arabia changes how movies had to be made after its release, and I would argue that the warm-hearted but bold A Trip To The Moon puts science fiction into the 1902 limelight where it get can be appreciated and acceptable to society to believe in such bizarre, unrealistic things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "A Trip to the Moon" (1902)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema today has become substantially commercial and extremely digitized. However, modern day cinema can never compare to the unique and often amusing black and white movies of the early 20th century. "A Trip to the Moon", directed by George M?lées is a perfect example of early cinema at its peak and probably the first film in the sci-fi genre. The short movie tells the story of a group of astronomer's who want to land on the moon. After some debate, it is decided that five astronomer's will venture outside of Earth's atmosphere and explore what is on the Moon. Upon landing there, the astronomer's realize they are not welcome with huge stars giving them spiteful and unwanted glares. Along with that, it begins to snow so the astronomer's must find shelter, in doing so they find a huge crater and dive inside. Once inside the crater, they begin to explore the environment and realize they are not alone. In-fact, a group of alien like creatures already inhabit the Moon, and upon meeting the "invaders" the aliens begin to realize they do not appreciate the astronomer's presence. After an altercation with their leader, the astronomer's flee the Moon and return back to Earth. There, they land in the ocean and are picked-up and brought back to land safely.Although the movie was silent and in black and white, the creativity and thought that went into designing and producing it was exceptional. It shows a very advanced view of technology considering the movie was only made in 1902. Even the thought of going to the Moon and landing there was pretty far fetched. Along with that, the concept of technology and its various usage was fairly obsolete in the period. However, the film showed a creativity that would eventually become reality. Through the usage of space shuttle technology human beings were capable of landing on the Moon, and continue to orbit various parts of the Earth. Along with that, the idea that there are other life forms in the universe is extremely creative and thought provoking for the time period. Overall, even though the film lasts about ten minutes, the concepts and ideas portrayed within it, pave the way for thousands of sci-fi related movies. Today's science fiction movies are obviously very different; however, "A Trip to the Moon" was very advanced for its time period and it created a genre that is very influential in film making today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest fantasy film of it's time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have this film on 16mm and it's a favorite of our family and friends. Thomas Edison was credited for the first film to have a plot; The Great Train Robbery (1903). Little beknownst that this Voyage dans la lune, Le (1902) told a much better story a year earlier. Sure it's crude, but it was made 100 years ago. I'm in USA and this film is French and I don't know the language but it doesn't matter not having dialogue and has absolutely no language barrier. This film is a true art form taking all the advantages early motion picture photography had to offer. Although this film is quite a long ways from what the real trip to the moon was like but they did splash down in the ocean like our moon missions. To me, this film was by far the best up to that time and many years afterwards. I have many films and have played them for all ages but this one will always be a favorite. For pre 1915 ratings, I would rate it 10 out of 10. Back then it was considered a science fiction but today I consider it a fantasy film. I think that this film can be enjoyed today by everybody with no age limit the world over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Le Voyage dans la lune' is probably one of the few old, I mean really old, movies with a plot and by this I don't mean Chaplin or Buster Keaton kind of a stumble around the city with couple of copper after them. It's actually inspired by a novel by Jules Verne, granddaddy of sci-fi. And if that's not enough the film has special effects and monsters.It all differs a lot from the todays quality but there is a real charm in the effects of the film. A steady camera shots a group of men holding a telescope parts and suddenly, by magic, the telescopes change into chairs and the old gentlemen are seated. Their leader tells them of his mission: a rocket to the moon. After a quarrel it is agreed, that the vessel shall be built. When the wise men arrive to the moon, of course they can breathe there without any additional equipment, they stumble upon the natives of moon, which of course try to kill the men. After a hustle the men escape to the vessel and they happily decent back to Earth.This all is told in about 12 minutes. Film was expensive back then. Only soundtrack is the musical score, though the version I saw had this annoying narrator on it who spoke English with a thick French accent.There was genuine looking thrill and enjoyment in the film and the acting of the cast. They all were experimenting with the stuff and in the era that hadn't heard of special effects or CGI the quality of tricks is actually quite amazing.'Le Voyage dans la lune' is something everyone should see at least once. It's really remarkable to see where the special effects of today begun. There is something truly mesmerizing in the movie as such.It's also fun to think what would the filmmakers and audiences of that era long gone think about the CGI effects of today. A lot has changed in over a hundred years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the first breakthroughs in film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trip to the moon began cinema in the aspect we have come to know. It was one of the first movies to have a complex storyline, many scenes, and special effects (thanks to the fact that Melies was a magician as well as many other things). Much editing went into this film as well. His sets were spectacular - perhaps a little to spectacular, as they drew my attention away from the action at times. I love the scene where the 80 year old french guy with the huge beard bodyslams the king of the moon. You'll probably recognize the scene where they "zoom in" on the moon, although the moon is actually pulled toward the camera as they didn't have "zoom in" technology yet. See this movie - its a fun one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the great pioneers of special effects. George Melies was one of the first motion picture science fiction producers. The film, though short, includes a rather lot of characters and settings. Its basic plot is that a group of men fly to the moon in a rocket, land and find themselves in an extraordinary world. They discover strange creatures who vanish when touched and other oddities before flying home. The film is made exceptionally well for its time and its pioneering special effects include a kind of trick photography used in a scene where the moon gets closer. The acting, though not perfect, is quite good, and i rate it 9/10 for its effects. The effects certainly changed films for good.</fullReview>

The special effects were clever for that stage of film's infancy, and often bordered on surreal during the moon scenes. One of the most impressive aspects of this film was the amount of depth that the sets portrayed. From a technical standpoint, the special effects set a standard for its time.Anyone interested in the origin of film should make it a point to view this classic film that is one of the first complete stories, and an entertaining piece of cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tripping on the Moon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since seeing nods to the landmark work in Martin Scorsese's Hugo,I've been meaning to see Georges Méli?s A Trip to the Moon,but for some reason have never got round to it.After a wonderful day celebrating my dads birthday,I felt that it was the perfect time to go to the moon.The plot:Meeting up at the Astronomic Club, astronauts Barbenfouillis, Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas,Omega, Micromegas and Parafaragaramus decide to build a space ship in order to travel to the moon.Each play their part,they all build the spaceship and set off.Landing on the moon,the group starts making plans to leave their mark on it,but soon discover that the moon has other plans.View on the film:Showing the title to be much more than solely having the iconic shot of the moon "getting it" in the eye,writer/director and star Georges Méli?s displays a creativity decades ahead of its time.Taking 3 months to shoot, Méli?s makes every shot with a surrealist flourish leaping from spectacular in camera special effects moving the foundation of the Moon,to a tribe on the Moon showing who is in charge. Inspired by the work of Jules Verne &amp; H.G. Wells,the screenplay by Georges Méli?s blends the animated Sci-Fi thrills with a cleverly underlying satirical edge. Working as a anti-Boulangist satirical cartoonist before entering the movie world, Méli?s takes a superb satirical shot at imperialism,as the inhibitions on the Moon rise up, and send the scientists on a trip to the earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No wonder the moon was angry...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... lunar opthamologists must be so expensive! So why should you watch this film? Lumiere was one of the first of the filmmakers to try and entertain audiences with fantastic tales versus Edison's shots of reality. I also think Edison actually tried to steal this film from Lumiere, but I could be wrong about that.Lumiere does everything in long shots, there are no close ups. Individual performers and performances are not the point. It is the fantasy in its entirety that is the point. There are girls dressed as ushers that help the scientists, all decked out in long wigs and robes like judges as a head scientist draws their trip on the board. Their rocket ship is shot out of a cannon directly into the man in the moon's eye. The surface of the moon looks like it is overgrown with tree roots, and the scientists simply lie down and go to sleep until passing stars spot them and start a snow storm. They seek shelter in a cave where they realize that if they plant their umbrellas in the ground that they grow like mushrooms. Then they are captured by the natives who look like people dressed in skeleton Halloween costumes with spears. The scientists strike the natives on the head and realize that causes them to disintegrate. They use this to escape, get back to their rocket, and with one scientist hanging on the front of the rocket to get it to tip over the edge of the moon, they and their rocket fall back to earth, into the sea actually, with one of the moon natives hanging on to the back of the rocket. The rocket is towed back to land where there is a grand parade with the lone native shown off as an exhibition and prisoner.I'm telling you the entire story because there is not THAT much story, and the fun is in looking around at Lumiere's interesting and intricate sets. The laws of gravity were known, but past that I don't know how much science knew about space travel in theory, and how much Lumiere just ignored for the fun of it all. It's funny some things they accidentally got right. The capsule landed in the sea, just like American space capsules did. The hitting of the moon people over the head and them disintegrating seems like a forerunner of the zombie movies of later in the twentieth century. And Lumiere got that people liked to look at pretty girls, thus he has his film full of them, scantily clad for the time period, even when they don't seem to have much purpose. But then Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser was doing that on TV - having pretty girls escort CEOs to their chair like they could not find their way from one side of the stage to the other - until about 1990!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all its silliness regarding the way of travelling to the moon, "A Trip to the Moon" is great fun. On top of it lies the fact that this 12 minutes long film was released in 1902 which may indicate just how influential it has been to later film-makers.The story itself is based on the famous and genre-defining science fiction story "From the Earth to the Moon" ("De la terre ? la lune", 1865) by French author Jules Verne (1828-1905). A group of astronomers manage to reach the moon by a giant projectile shot at the celestial body. On the moon, however, trouble stirs as the newly arrived explorers may not be alone.A lot of effort has been put into it, making use of a team of acrobats, well made costumes, great designs and visual effects all contribute to an experience that some would find difficult to believe has been produced at the start of the 20th century.The film can be enjoyed by people of all age groups and as one of the truly pioneering works of fictional film-making it's a must-see for film lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Small Movie for a Man; One Giant Leap for Movie Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Méli?s' "Le voyage dans la lune" (or "A Trip to the Moon") is no less than one small movie for a man; one giant leap for movie kind. Prior to this, film was primarily used, especially by pioneers such as Thomas Edison and the Lumi?re Brothers, as a means of portraying and documenting ordinary life.Méli?s' film however is concerned with the extraordinary, an adaptation of a Jules Verne novel in which scientists travel to the moon (in the most iconic shot, their bullet-shaped shuttle crashes into one of the eyes of the man in the moon), survive an encounter with its inhabitants the Selenites, and make a heroic return back to Earth. It is not just the first science-fiction film, but it is also the first fiction film worthy of note.Now Méli?s had a background in theater and as a magician, and both serve to his credit and detriment in the film. Clever editing, practical effects, numerous props/backgrounds and filming techniques see wizard's hats transformed into chairs, smokestacks belch out smoke in urban Paris, the aforementioned sequence where in a series of increasing shots the scientists' shuttle crashes into one of the man in the moon's eyes, dream images of women in stars and goddesses appearing before the scientists, snow on the moon, an umbrella transforming into a mushroom and subsequently doubling in height and Selenites dissipating into clouds of smoke.Yet when it comes to his presentation, Méli?s is firmly stuck in the realm of the theatrical. His film predates the technical innovations of American directors such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, and consists of static camera shots. Similarly, scenes are presented in a linear fashion, with no kind of intercutting whatsoever. Sets are typically nothing more than obviously painted backgrounds, contrasts are totally out of whack (take for instance how much bigger the scientists are than buildings before their shuttle takes off!) and the "ocean" near the climax is clearly an aquarium of some kind.At the end of the day though, it's hard to fault the film, one that is over one hundred and ten years old at the time of this writing, too much for technical shortcomings, especially when one considers its overall importance in the history of film. At a brisk fourteen minutes, you owe it to yourself to watch this at least once.Side-note: At the time of this review, the movie is available in two different versions (both in HD) on Netflix Watch Instant: one, a black &amp; white version with piano score and a bit too much voice acting for my taste (prior versions I've seen merely consisted of narration as would have been typical of the time of the film's release, since it lacks intertitles) and the other, a hand-colored version with no real voice acting to speak of and a score composed by French electronic band Air. The coloring really helps everything ? costumes, sets and props ? pop out at the viewer like never before, and it combines with the score perfectly to match the film's surrealness, making it the definitive version to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Very First Science-Fiction Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georges Melies' 'A Trip to the Moon' is considered the first Sci-Fi film by some, and some say it's just a fantasy. Well, it is more of a science-fiction than fantasy. It's fantastical and surreal, but to think about the science that was still making it's baby steps, and the knowledge about the outer space, 'A Trip to the Moon' clearly classifies as a sci-fi. And not only - it is science-fiction action film, because how else could you view the fight scene between scientists and the Selenites.Georges Melies was a pioneer of narrative filmmaking. Besides making early fantasy and sci-fi he's also credited as making the very first horror film (The Haunted Castle, 1896). Upon it's release 'A Trip to the Moon' was one of the longest and most expensive films ever made. It took three months to complete. This was the film that influenced many filmmakers around the world including Edwin S. Porter and D.W. Griffith who went to revolutionize American cinema.I also recommend to see the colorized restored version. Originally 'A Trip to the Moon' was meant both black and white and in color. The color version was considered to be lost and found only in 1993. In 2010 the restored color version was released with new amazing soundtrack by Air that makes 'A Trip to the Moon' almost like a psychedelic cartoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Georges Melies really was the George Lucas of his time, the turn of the 19th/20th centuries. He churned out many short films based on elaborate sets, double exposure, time-lapse, colorization and other techniques that really for the first time took film from plain photographic reproduction into the realm of fanciful fantasy."Moon" is very typical of his work, and has somehow become the poster child of Melies films, although I like several others better. It has a real story, a great innovation around 1900, when most films were just short fragments. Melies also put comedy and irony in film, even more so in slightly later "Voyage a travers l'impossible," where scientists from the "Institute of Incoherent Geography" explore the interior of the sun. Here we have a similar story with exploration of the moon. There are many Melies films to pick from, for even though most have been lost, hundreds are left!The film is a must-watch, if only for the many techniques it introduced so early on. And it has inspired many that came after, perhaps most directly Martin Scorsese's "Hugo," a film about a boy who lives in the innards of a great train station and gets to know a girl with the key (literally) to Melies' greatest creation - and the boy's heart.Go see both!</fullReview>

This movie is a must see, from the time when even movies required some imagination out of you.

		<fullReview>There is a fine movie made in 2011 called 'HUGO'. It is about a boy who lives inside the walls of a London train station, keeping the clocks after his father died. In that movie is a character Georges Méli?s, magician, played by Ben Kingsley. While that movie is fiction, Georges Méli?s was a real person, a magician who became a filmmaker over 100 years ago.This very short (15 minutes) movie "A Trip to the Moon" is the one he is most remembered for. It is silent, of course, but has music accompanying it. I watched the colorized version, it was one of the two versions he made. Netflix streaming movies has the recently restored film.Of course in 1902 very little was known about actual space travel so what is depicted here is very crude and implausible. For example it was known that the Moon was over 200,000 miles away and orbiting the Earth, yet this small movie depicts a ship shot by a long canon directly at the Moon, and perhaps getting there rather quickly. Plus when it finally does return to Earth all it had to do was be pointed down and allowed to fall back to Earth. But all that is nitpicking because I doubt this was intended to be a scientifically plausible story, simply an amusing story of several men landing on the Moon and encountering some Moon aliens.A treasure for its historical place in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the whole process of creative filmmaking in its infancy, what a wonderful, surreal effort by Melies. A group of astronomers in their pointy hats, containing astronomical symbols, and long gowns, discuss how to travel to the moon. With little regard for any scientific reality, a huge gun is created and the old guys, wearing top hats and long beards hop in the bullet projectile. With a little 1902 cheesecake (girls in tight pants and shorts) they are heralded off to the moon. In a famous scene, the moon is seen as the face of a man and the projectiles sticks in his eye. What follows is a silly confrontation with the Selenites, moon-men, who, when struck, explode. The old guys are captured and taken to the leader who is attacked and explodes. The scenery is so much fun. Obviously, the special effects are created on a stage with moving sets. This is just a wonderful beginning to a fun time in cinema.</fullReview>

If you liked Scorsese's Hugo, which got me excited about Melies' surviving shorts, go and seek out the new restored version. The new soundtrack sounds odd at times and may pull you out of the experience, though it is better than some synth scores I've heard patched onto silent films. Why do digital transfers of silent films so often choose this disconnected synthesizer music rather than the original music for organ or a small orchestra? Has as much film music been lost as reels of film from that period? Is it just a cost consideration for these digital preservation or digital copy houses? Georges Melies and the other space travelers (professors/wizards?) may remind you of clowns piling into a small car. Space suits and oxygen are not even a concern. There are many strange sights on the moon including lobster-like Martians. While the trick photography effects are primitive, it is great fun to watch this in a communal atmosphere rather than by yourself on a TV or computer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Méli?s' moonshot deserves its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le voyage dans la lune was Georges Méli?s' longest, most ambitious and most expensive film to date when made. It was one of the earliest films to break the boundaries of the short single scene, stitching together numerous shots ? most linked by primitive dissolves ? to achieve a running time of approaching 15 minutes, depending on projection speed. The film proved a massive international success and remains the most famous of the director's works, though not his personal favourite nor arguably his best, and has recently become UNESCO's first World Heritage Film.For his theme, Méli?s plundered the work of the newly popular literary genre of scientific romance, as represented by Jules Verne and HG Wells, so this is also the first significant science fiction film, depicting a moon mission mounted by a society of astronomers, six of whom make the journey in a capsule fired from a cannon. Not that the director is especially interested in the science ? crossing the final frontier is really an excuse to let his imagination run riot.The lunar surface turns out to have a conveniently breathable atmosphere and earth-like gravity, and after seeing the earth rise on the horizon ? a shot that presciently pre-echoes the later significance of real views of our planet from space ? we witness stars and planets metamorphose into human form. Below the surface are caves full of giant toadstools, where an umbrella from earth itself turns into a toadstool and grows to giant size: the moon has the power to subsume even non-native matter within its own fantastic nature. The visitors are assailed by insect-like, gymnastic selenites who explode on impact, and the capsule literally falls back to earth from the edge of a cliff, splash landing in another curious anticipation of real space travel.The astronomers are portrayed as a comic bunch of squabbling, gesticulating elderly eccentrics, led by Méli?s himself, almost unrecognisable in a ludicrous long white wig and beard. Their depiction has been interpreted as a critique of establishment science, but it seems to me more a logical expression of Méli?s' factional world, rooted in stage magic and illusion. These astronomers are more like wizards ? they even dress up for their meeting in robes and pointy hats decorated with stars and planets.Similarly pantomimic is the film's best known shot, depicting the moon itself as a big round grinning humanoid face ? Méli?s again, of course ? that zooms into view using the same technique as in the same director's L'homme ? la t?te en caoutchouc, before getting a capsule in the eye in yet more early cinematic ocular violence. The shot gave film its first icon, still parodied today. Interestingly, it's followed by a shot of the capsule sliding into view on the moon's surface, so what in narrative terms is the same event is seen from two very different angles (compare for example Porter's Life of an American Fireman). Other innovations include an early use of stock footage of the sea and a model shot through a fish tank to show the capsule crashing to the sea bed and bouncing up again, a technique later much favoured by Gerry Anderson.For all these innovations, the storytelling remains primitive and stilted, accomplished in a simple series of tableaux. The film consists of just 18 setups, most of them long shots ? you can almost imagine the curtain falling and rising or the stage rotating during the dissolves. Méli?s packs the frame with crowds of characters all on the move, including a chorus line of pretty young women in swimsuits obviously added for no reason other than sex appeal.Modern audiences used to being guided through the narrative by a complex vocabulary of camera angles and cuts may well find it hard to follow what's going on, for example in the scene near the beginning where the lead astronomer explains the mission to his colleagues using a blackboard on the extreme left. Early audiences had the benefit of a live narration read from a script supplied with the prints, written by the director himself. Contemporary film makers who ask viewers to look so hard at the frame (for example Michael Haneke in Caché) may please the critics but risk baffling audiences.Some original prints of the film were hand coloured, and a digital restoration of an example rediscovered in the 1990s was released in 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As of this writing, the film is one hundred and twelve years old, almost as old as I feel some mornings. The camera remains as steady as a rock while capturing the moving panorama. The musical score is some kind of electronic rendition of "Pictures at an Exhibition." And it's all in fuzzy black and white.Yet, the thing still clicks. A hoary astronomer dressed like a wizard proposes a trip to the moon, drawing a diagram on a blackboard, and the audience of scientists and clowns move as in a kaleidoscope, laughing at him, throwing spitballs, until the astronomer angrily begins to throw pages back at them.The astronomer and half a dozen of his colleagues actually take the trip, shot to the moon in a giant artillery shell that lodges in the moon's eye and produces tears. The moon itself, from a distance, looks like a rude, raw pizza pie. After spending the night sleeping on the moonscape under a pageant of special effects, they go underground. The underground is full of mushrooms. Well, you know the French and their fondness for les champignons. The astronomer sticks his umbrella in the ground and, pop, it too turns into a mushroom and grows to the height of a tree, a champignon de couche.They are captured by the Selenites, who are dressed like devils, jump around like acrobats, and disappear in puffs of smoke. The earthlings manage to escape and return home.There's a lot of motion in the movie. After all, it's a MOTION PICTURE. Nobody sits around quietly for very long. Tomita's musical score helps a lot, ranging around in the electronic atmosphere, from Mussorgsky to Stravinsky. And the score is comic rather than dignified. It's full of burps and gulps.The special effects are amazing for the period and the film itself is still amusing after all these years, though I wouldn't want to sit through it too often.</fullReview>

Its criminally unknown and should be more heard of, or even taught in schools. Watch for its perfectionism, not action (you'll be disappointed on the action front, but saying that, the smoky deaths are mesmerizing).

		<fullReview>Rating A Trip to the Moon or doing one of these user comments is difficult. I can't really compare this to anything else I've ever seen - and I'm not sure doing so would even be fair given A Trip to the Moon is over 100 years old. I'll just say that it's a remarkable piece of film. Imaginative doesn't do it justice. Set design, special effects, costuming, editing, lighting - all are very well done. Georges Méli?s was a man well ahead of his time. I suppose my favorite bit had to be the moon-men. The costuming and actions were very nice. Overall, anyone who considers themselves a fan of movies or cinema should be required to watch A Trip to the Moon. If nothing else, it's an interesting piece of history that established a solid foundation for the 100 years of film to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally called Voyage dans la Lune, this film was made in 1902 and is considered to be the first actual film made - of course the definition of film is up to you as the first ever motion picture was back in 1878 - but this is a movie specifically shot to entertain an audience, it had a plot, characters and special effects.The story consists of a group of astronomers (who seem to resemble wizards) who travel to the moon and then meet alien beings. Although compared to today's films it could seem quite boring this just shows how it all began, and to an audience in the early 20th century elements of this could be creepy and strange as it had never been done on this scale before. I think A Trip To the Moon just shows us how far we've come in the last century; just over 100 years of cinema and we have CGI, 3D, motion-capture, fantastic concepts that really did seem alien in 1902. This film has also inspired much pop culture media as well and the most well-known is probably the 2011 film Hugo which stars Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliés - the creator of A Trip To the Moon, that film in its own right is fantastic but it's nice to see the roots of cinema, and what it looked like. So if you've got about 12 minutes to spare then I recommend you watch this 1902 icon, you can find it on YouTube easily, then you can contemplate that you can watch footage that was shot over 100 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Georges Méli?s's 1902 masterpiece is not just a science fiction movie. It's also a satire on nineteenth-century science. It attempts to show the illogicality of logical thinking, as a great voyage gets achieved by incompetent doofuses, with the movie's most famous scene as the ultimate example."Le Voyage dans la Lune" ("A Trip to the Moon") is also an indictment of colonialism. The astronauts attack the Moon Men - called Selenites - and then bring one back to Earth, where they parade him around. This clearly reflects France's occupation of large swaths of Africa and Asia. Indeed, the statue at the end is similar to an anti-Boulangist cartoon that Méli?s earlier drew.The movie recently played a role in Martin Scorsese's "Hugo", and the DVD that I watched included Scorsese in the Special Thanks section. It's a fine look at what humans once imagined the rest of the universe to be. This is truly one of the movies that you have to see before you die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of astronomers go on an expedition to the moon.This film is a must-see for anyone who loves film. Decent special effects, hand coloring, and a fun story. And this was 1902, before film really took off. Was this the first great movie? Probably yes.Although I had seen the before, I had the pleasure of seeing it at the Patio Theater in Chicago with a live organ playing the soundtrack in both April 2014 and April 2015, thanks to organist jay Warren. With silent films, there is nothing better than a live organ -- it beats anything your stereo can pump out while watching a DVD.No hand-colored prints of A Trip to the Moon were known to survive until 1993, when one was given to the Filmoteca de Catalunya by an anonymous donor as part of a collection of two hundred silent films. This was an unbelievable discovery, allowing long-time admirers to witness the film again for the first time.In 2002 it became the first work designated as a UNESCO World Heritage film, and rightly so. This is a world treasure, not simply a French treasure (though they have every right to pay tribute to Georges Méli?s).The influence this film had on future films cannot be overstated. And the science (or lack thereof) involved is interesting. While the cannon / bullet concept received an upgrade during the space age, the capsule landing in the ocean was more or less spot on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trip to the Moon (1902)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first ever colored movies in the history of cinema, A Trip to the Moon (1902), brings the story of a group of astronauts having a trip to the moon and back after a controversial proposal is suggested by the eldest member of their society in where seems to be a planetarium where an assembly of astronauts, pros and cons, are gathered together to discuss the project. The scientists reach an agreement on doing this project and a few are chosen to do the trip. Their plan is to build a human carrying capsule and then shoot it toward the moon via a very big ordnance. Shot by ordnance seems to be the only possible way of going to a far vertical distance then and maybe the only solution coming to minds of the creators of this movie because at that time the technology of rockets or human carrying shuttles were not yet evolved, though the idea of space exploration by rockets was proposed by a Russian schoolteacher named Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1898 but its technicality published in 1903. However, Jules Verne's novel as one of the uncredited adaptation materials for this short feature has more surprises in itself than just shooting a capsule to the moon and although I haven't read H.G. Well's novel, "First Men in the Moon", I am sure that it too, suggests more sophisticated and of course rather elaborated way to send humans to the moon. But what seems to be more initial in this movie is the way the astronauts return to the earth after an exploration in a planet of apes like environment; they use gravity of the earth to fall from a rock in the moon into the ocean defying the laws and the absolute nature of the astrophysics even known to the time movie was made at. The moon is habitable and has all the four elements of life; it even snows. In there they face with giant mushrooms and are chased and arrested by Martian like creatures who turn into colorful dust when being hit. After destroying their king, the astronauts manage their getaway and proudly return to the earth where they are welcomed by overwhelmed people and politicians, celebrating their successful trip to the moon. Georges Méliés directed this movie with the original French title of "A voyage dans la lune" 4 years after he directed a 3-minute-long short movie about the moon titled La lune ? un m?tre (The Moon at One Meter) (1898) aka: A Trip to the Moon. He is one the first directors in the cinema whose movies are all almost short. I don't know why Méliés uses a lot of cheerleader like girls in most of the scenes but what is apparent for sure in this Sci-Fi short movie is the lack of seriousness of female gender in his created scientific society and to be precise feminism fades here. Most likely they are just there to beautify the long theatrical like shots. The-13-minute-long short movie proposed in both black white and hand painted color but the color version was considered as lost for several decades until it was found by Filmoteca de Catalunya in 1993 and only in 2010 a complete restored version of this film was launched after a one by one restoration of 13,375 frames of the movie was done via today's technology and the missing or too damaged frames were taken from the black white version and then colored. Even though A Trip to the Moon has a not so complicated plot and filming compare to what a today's version of it would have, the visual effects used in the movie were amazing for the era it was made in and if not so overwhelmed, the movie itself was a great success in the early years of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first science fiction movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's incredible how many science fiction movies there are today. But none of them would be possible without this one. This is about a trip to the moon 67 years early of the first actual moon trip. It's about Astronauts that go into what looks like a bullet, and they're fired from a giant cannon into the moon that has a face. They are trapped by (get this) moon men and escape in their ship. Looking at it today it looks pretty silly seeing as how we know how silly this is. But back in 1902, only 1 year after aviation was invented people had no idea as to what was up there on that crazy moon. And they wouldn't for another 67 years. In my opinion go see it. The first time I saw it it was pretty obscure but now it's gained much more recognition and it's even been colorized and released on DVD. So it should be pretty easy to find.</fullReview>

Film has come an unbelievably long way since this movie was released. I can appreciate the simplicity and creativity of this little film. The premise is very basic. Some men are shot to the moon in a capsule using a cannon. The image of the capsule lodged in the moon's eye is one of the most iconic images in cinema. They find moon-men, are captured, and escape. It's such a creative and optimistic little film. It's so much fun to watch. The art, set design, and visual effects are amazing for the time.

		<fullReview>The era of silent films was wonderful, in that it showed us the beginnings of possibilities one had with the medium of cinema. The way events are sequenced and the parts of the tale that the filmmaker chose to portray on the screen, with all the costumes, running characters, smoke, 2 shots of the same event (landing on the moon), and the marvelous sets; a trip to moon is a film that entertains and creates awe.The effects created leave us thinking about the tricks adopted and how can we do something so simple yet fascinating with just a camera, some space in-front of it, and some people, because at the end of the day its about communicating and sharing stories. Cinema is often termed an art of technology but films like these transcend such limitations of time, procedure, and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me play among the stars. Or maybe not. They didn't look too happy about the intruders.This little short is often considered one of the milestones of the early years of cinema. Georges Méli?s takes us on a trip to the moon and back and shows us how much ahead of his time he was, namely 67 years. With lots of people doubting Armstrong actually happening, I wonder how many people back in 1902 truly believed people set foot on the moon. After all, film was a completely new dimension to people's minds and as we, even these days, often doubt how much is real and how much is contrived, people back then may have had their very own way of perceiving Méli?s works.This film's plot is as simple as it's fantastic. Astronomers plan and conduct a trip into space, meet the most fantastic creatures, but communication fails and they quickly return to Earth where they get celebrated as heroes. But the plot is not really what matters here. Neither are the people acting pretty much the same in every scene running around wildly, waving and arguing. The most wonderful aspect is how much creativity and detail Mélies put into each scene in terms of animation and scenery, most of all of course the face of the moon.Surely worth a watch, not only for those interested in the history of the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After discussing about it, a group of astronomers go on an expedition to the moon and encounter moon creatures, beautiful stars and a king among other things. It is based loosely on two popular novels of the time: Jules Verne's 'From the Earth to the Moon' and H. G. Wells' 'The First Men in the Moon'.The iconic 'spaceship in the eye of the moon' image is wildly famous around the world even today though one may not know its significance. I had seen Hugo last year and had read the book (sketches) it was based upon which very much made me want to see this film. This 1902 film is apparently one of the very first sci-fi films in history. Georges Méli?s, a magician and trickster brought his magic and surrealism into the world of motion capture. The screenplay is absolutely childish, immature and absurd and I absolutely loved every moment of it. For people back in 1902, the world was a treasure trove of secrets and things you couldn't imagine. The innocence is quite charming. Or it may have been George Méli?s' intention to make fun of science and scientists. The animation and special effects were innovative at the time it was made. This is very much a stage play and the hard work that went into each and every frame to hand-colour the movie (I saw the restored colour version) has to be very much appreciated. The music which keeps everything entertaining is a highlight. This is one for cinema lovers and kids.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Sci-Fi Picture Of Note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't rate this movie by modern standards, of course. So much now is done by CGI that comparing a modern sci-fi movie to "A Trip To The Moon" would be like comparing a child's scooter to a tank. It just doesn't work. You have to look at it (as best you can) from the perspective of 1902. Using that standard, Georges Lumiere made a brilliant film, which, in many ways, is certainly much more charming than a lot of today's sci- fi blockbusters.It's a simple and very fast paced (even frenetic) story that begins with a group of astronomers gathering to devise a way to travel to the moon, continues through the building of the rocket ship and the entry of the explorers into it, continues with their flight to an exploration of the moon and finishes with their triumphant return home - all in less than 15 minutes.The sets and costumes are wonderful. You have to overlook the fact that the moon has the same gravity as the earth and the explorers don't need space suits or oxygen masks and that the moon was inhabited. This was 1902. In that context, this is a fun movie, and they did get some things right - like an early version of a splashdown. Worth watching, if only to see how much movie making has changed. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film as Fantastical, Childlike Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"La voyage dans la lune" (1902) is arguably his crowning achievement, deservedly revered for its visual invention and the skill involved. It's in good humour, shows him a the peak of his powers and in more ways than one includes all the traits what makes Méli?s Méli?s.I believe Méli?s had a very clear idea about film ? certainly a lot clearer than he is usually given credit for. His cinema revolves around the idea of film as fantastical, childlike magic performed on stage. Mainstream film imbued the first part of the this vision, but the latter slowly gave away to immersive realism, even within the realm of fantasy. In other words, film was taken into directions Méli?s was either unable or unwilling (or both) to follow, and this may be one of the reasons why he diminished. He wanted to make us know we watched films, but the audiences, quickly accustomed, wanted not. Watching his films betray a certain sense of awareness for implementation and experiment (in good humour) with the form and narrative, but his later period (from c. 1907 onward) suffers retrocession. His gags return to simple settings, repeating and referring to old ideas he did some ten years earlier. His late films grew tired.But let's not forget that it's somewhat unfair to him to speak this way. Some hundred films from him are available for the general public, most of which are only a few minutes long, at most, all made in a shorter period of time that separates "Days of Heaven" (1978) from "The Thin Red Line" (1998). Méli?s pioneered technique and above all, fun. And it's all present in this particular film.</fullReview>

It also is one of the earliest films to capture a conflict between two different cultures of people in that the six astronomers sent to the moon end up battling the inhabitants of the moon for apparently no good reason aside from propelling the action of the film, and nothing propels the action better than conflict. The narrative is clear, and the backdrops/sets, cinematography, editing, and special effects are all top notch for their time. Georges Melies set the stage for many subsequent space travel films to come decades later. This one of Georges Melies' best known films. A must watch. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overview of the Best Versions on DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a summary of the best available versions of this movie, and where to find them.There are three black-and-white versions that are outstanding: (A) a digital scan of an original 35mm nitrate print owned by the Melies family; this scan is available through flickeralley (.com). (B) a digital scan of a 35mm PRINT of the (A) PRINT (so a "print- of-a-print") that can be found on the 5-DVD compilation entitled, "Georges Melies: First Wizard of Cinema", also distributed by Flicker Alley. (C) StudioCanal offers a different print, available directly from France. (Go to Amazon.fr and search for "Georges Melies" "studiocanal". It's in the 3-DVD Méli?s edition that comes with a gorgeous book with beautiful pictures?and text all in French!) Here are the pros-and-cons of each version:FLICKER ALLEY (A) has unbelievably crisp picture quality on both DVD and blu-ray, and absolutely crackling detail on the blu-ray. In high-definition, you can see the actors' teeth when they smile. It's a great study version. However, to keep the clarity and retain the fullest frame, the image has not been cleaned up or adequately stabilized. The picture looks like it's in a snowstorm; but somehow this adds to the charm. The real problem is that without additional cropping, the film still has enough jitter-and- weave to make you want to poke your eyes out. But if you want detail, this is the print to see. You have a choice of three soundtracks, and the one by Robert Israel is brilliant. The DVD includes a narration that is derived from a text that Melies himself wrote. It is absolutely delightful. Unfortunately, on the current edition of the DVD version of music-with-narration (which by some oversight is NOT found on the blu- ray disc*), the sound is nearly 2 seconds ahead of the image, creating an odd effect when the cannon is fired, and when the moon gets smashed in the eyeball. *These two discs come together in a Limited "Steelbook" edition that costs about $30, and thus you are supplied with BOTH the blu-ray AND the DVD version, with identical contents (except the missing narration on the blu-ray), coded for Region 1 (North America). The high cost is a result of the main attraction on the set: "A Trip to the Moon" IN COLOUR. More about that later?FLICKER ALLEY (B) is a digital scan of a print of the above print, so the focus is softer, and it is only available on DVD (as opposed to high-definition blu-ray), making the focus softer yet. However, it has been much cleaned, the white speckles are gone, and although there are a lot of light tramlines (vertical black streaks), they are not too annoying. As with ALL versions, splice lines and all larger blemishes have NOT been removed. The image hardly bounces at all. The soundtrack is the Robert Israel music-and-narration, with an option for music-only, and in pretty good sync to the picture. The STUDIOCANAL (C) print is intriguing. All versions I'm summarizing have the complete film; that is, they include the opening in the Great Hall, and the ending with the dance around the statue (absent in some older versions). However, in this StudioCanal version there are a few seconds missing at the very, very end. On the other hand, it has a few more frames and a dissolve that is missing from the Flicker Alley B&amp;W prints. This print is strikingly clean. In fact the whole second half of the movie is so clear and with such depth that you would swear it was filmed yesterday. The image is completely stabilized so that jitter and weave are simply not an issue. The only disadvantages of this version are (1) it is expensive, and (2) the soundtrack is a just-barely adequate piano score. This print runs faster than all other versions and as noted it has a different number of frames, so you cannot just play the Israel soundtrack while watching this film and expect it to be in sync, although I suppose you could approximate it, if you're happy with that sort of thing.The newly "restored" colour version, available in the same Steelbook album from Flicker Alley as the (A) B&amp;W version, is a different animal altogether. It is a spectacular release and the restoration, imperfect as it may have to remain, is miraculous and cost over half a million dollars. Thus the high price of the DVD set. It's worth it. I would have paid twice the amount to own this film. It is not meant for the casual purchaser of low-cost DVD's. However, because of some major image problems, restoration notwithstanding, a good black-and-white print remains indispensable. The Flicker Alley (B) print is the simplest way to see this film in a comfortably watchable version. The disadvantage there is that you have to buy the whole 5-dvd set of Melies films. The ADVANTAGE is that? you get the whole 5-dvd set of Melies films(!!), which has given me months and months of pleasure, day after day!Flicker Alley, or whoever controls these things, would do us all a great favor by taking their high-definition (A) scan of the original nitrate-print, cleaning it up a little, and fully stabilizing the image, setting the Israel soundtrack to it IN SYNC (giving us a music-with-narration and a music-only option), and then distributing it on blu-ray. If additionally they would pay someone (or find a nut like me who would do it for free) to take a couple of evenings to use some movie-editing software to hide the bad splices and cover up the ubiquitous black spots, pieces of crud and splashes of see- through emulsion, which inevitably blemish all vintage films, this would be the ideal version of the movie, notwithstanding the coloured-print?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Creative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I love about this movie is the director's creativity - from seemingly out of nowhere, Melies innovated so much. The first outstanding piece is the richly-painted background of the astronomers' meeting hall. In scene after scene we see very detailed and well-proportioned backgrounds. Clearly the director had a vision and demanded quality in attaining that vision.The second achievement is the acting. The pantomiming is both whimsical and at the same time believable. The costumes are relatively lavish, which adds depth to the story. The idea of these men voyaging to the moon in suits and top-hats is amusing in a sort of enlightenment-era, gentleman-scientist way.Lastly, the number of predictions about trans-lunar travel that turned out to be quite prescient are surprising. From the detailed construction, to the cold temperatures, to the ocean splash-down, there are some interesting details. Barring, of course, the more fantastical elements such as the man-in-the-moon being shot in the eye.This movie is a gem among its peers, because of its very rich production and story. It was well ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trip to the Moon is an honest effort by an illusionist, George Méli?s to make his magical touch felt in the movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Méli?s was a committed artist who devoted much of his life to magic ? he was considered as one of the pioneers of science-fiction cinemas for his clever camera trickery in a time where CGI wasn't even heard of. His ambitious 10 minute effort cost him a hundred thousand francs at that time, and the most tragic part was that he didn't get enough credit and money in the United States for the film because of Thomas A Edison's technicians' chicanery.A Trip to the Moon has two noteworthy moments ? one is the landing of the moon, and the other is the departure from the moon. While the first was adeptly shot by drawing the camera nearer and nearer to the moon as it grew in size. The puzzling moment here is the face of the moon, which has eyes, a nose and a mouth. I did not notice anything complicatedly sub-textual about this part except that it gave us an indication of life on the moon, which is found to be true later. The second part references our traditional views and theories that all celestial objects are flat rather than round ? therefore making the entire movie seem like a farce, because we can clearly see a round moon in the beginning. But who cares? The entire plot is to be taken with a pinch of salt, and what are mainly to be appreciated are the vivid imagination and the camera techniques that were used here. All the encounters on the moon happen as if the scene was shot on a stage, especially the smoky effects to make characters disappear. I cannot comment on the color much since I saw a grainy black-and-white version of the film, but I can tell that the music could have been more appropriate and cleverly used during the scenes to make the comedic portion more effective. For example, raging violins during the disagreement scene, then ambitious sounds during the take off, followed by calm yet eerie music after the landing, and then climatic orchestra during the final encounter.I have to rule out any possibility of symbolisms that some people suggest just because it was a George Méli?s film. That would be like asking a couple of professional artist's to critique a young child's painting. To me, A Trip to the Moon is an honest effort by an illusionist, George Méli?s to make his magical touch felt in the movies.</fullReview>

The Only 2 Complaints I Have Is The Fact That The Minute The Scientists Get There They Take A Nap, And The Moon Race Which Is Seen Now As Rather Racist Because France Inhabited Africa With The Dutch And The English And Back Then This Was Seen As Okay.For Its Time I Do Think The Story Is Well Done(Because Back Then There Were NO Stories When You Sat Down To Watch A Film) And It Was Pretty Good For Its Era. Overall I Do Recommend This Film Highly To Anyone Interested In Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a "Trip to the Moon", directed by George M?lies, one can tell the film was not meant to be taken seriously. Produced in 1902, when the prevailing thoughts of space travel were mainly nonexistent, this film introduces space travel in a comical light, the moon men proving that even if we could travel into space, we probably wouldn't want to. The film opens into a scene of pseudo-scientists dressed as stereotypical wizards (long beards, cloaks, and pointy hats), showing the prevailing thought of the day, that the only way humans would ever reach the moon was with the help of "magic". Yet M?lies, tries to mix in some actual science by trying to create a vessel that seems almost an early 20th century version of the 'space shuttles', shaped like a bullet and moved with propulsion, the shuttle is loaded into a type of chamber and shot at the moon with a few brave scientist/wizards inside. It is then that fantasy comes back into play as the 'bullet' hits the eye of the man on the moon. As the scientists explore the moon, they meet a race of violent 'moon-people' that they must fight before they can return home. Now I'm not sure exactly how much actual scientists and the average person knew about outer-space in 1902, but I must assume they at least knew that the moon was not made of a person. This movie is heralded as the first science-fiction movie, and while it has many of the attributes attributed to science fiction, I believe this film belongs more in the fantasy genre. The wizards at the beginning along with the actual face on the moon, scream fantasy to me, I do not believe that M?lies thought the idea of 'space travel' would ever be realized, I believe he was just making a fun film that the average citizen could enjoy, not a film to make people think about 'scientific advances' in the future or the possibility of 'space travel'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It might have started slow, but picks up speed as the moon landing ensues and dazzles with the special effects that you wouldn't expect to see from a film made in 1902! I particularly enjoyed the imagination showcased on the moon surface, the caverns below, and the exploding moon occupants. There were some shifting landscapes and set designs that are a joy to behold... it's definitely a mix of a film &amp; a live stage show. It was great to see something over 100 years old and still be entertained so thoroughly.You can now find on YouTube a version that has the "missing ending" and I highly encourage it. The full ending has people dancing and celebrating the astronomer's return... and doesn't end with just the capsule being towed back to harbor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing for it's time, but not the greatest as a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing to think this film was made over 100 years, and in addition to that was the first science fiction film ever. And for it's age, it looks great! The film looks fairly crisp for it's age, and the sets and special effects, despite being obviously fake, look really cool. As a film, this is a fairly light tale about some wizard looking scientists going to the moon, but as the first science fiction film, it's actually quite amazing.Several scientists dressed in cloaks and wizard hats decide to travel to the moon. Once they land in the moon's eye, they decide to sleep, and then are attacked by moon men. Will this rag tag team of un-helmeted astronauts make it back to Earth alive? We can only hope!This movie is only 14 minutes, and because of that, there is a lack of tension. And a lack of character. And a lack or realism, but what did they know about space travel back in 1902? Apparently very little. But watching this with it's release year in mind, it's actually fascinating that they managed to conceive a story like this into a 14 minute film that wraps up like it does and moves along at a good pace.The imagination and special effects in this are really quite cool. The backgrounds on Earth are mostly made of hand painted backgrounds mixed with the actual set, and despite being cartoony it actually has some depth to it. The moon is inaccurate to what we learned was on it, but it looks very cool. Despite being before his time, many of these sets look a lot like Salvador Dahli's paintings. This movie has such a good look to it, and the special effects are good for the time, including a very impressive shot where the moon gets closer and closer until the space shuttle hits the "face" of the moon which uses an actual human face. As a movie, this isn't the greatest thing ever, but it is pretty entertaining. As the first ever science fiction film, this is an astounding piece of cinema. Either way you look at it, it's still a unique and fun short film.My rating: *** out of ****. 14 mins. Not rated.</fullReview>

Especially thinking about it in a way that they were discovering ways to create these effects without as many resources as we have now. The scene on the moon with some of those weird flower things is a bit strange, but overall even that scene was pretty neat. A lot of the stuff just seemed to work from the argument discussing the trip to the moon to the celebration at the end. Sure, it is strange having the whole thing narrated and not really hearing what is going on, but it is easy to get in the mood of it and enjoy it nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Journey to the Moon George Melies was a French and one of the pioneers of early cinema. Before his film career he was a magician/ illusionist. What makes his 1902 film Journey to the moon so breathtaking is the fact that its one of the first films to beak away from the Lumi?re brothers style of documentary style filming and use plot and narrative to create this compelling 14min filming at a rate of 16 frames per second which was the stander frame rate at that time. I would compare the spectator ship of this film to the reaction of today audience to a film like James Camrons Avatar. I make this statement as though Melies does not use state of the art CGI he did use techniques like super-imposing, animation, camera trickery and stop-start motion which would have been a expectational voyeurism pleasure in 1902. The other thing that makes this film hold its iconic place is history is the length which would of felt like watching all of the 'lord of the rings' film one after the other as most films were only a couple of minuets long. As I have previously mentioned Journey to the Moon has a narrative but its the first of it kind to have a real genre, its genre being sci-fi and fantasy as well as one of the first film to use special effects. For all they s reasons and more I rate this film very highly. With out it I believe that cinema as we know it would not be the same.Nat Hawley</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Trip to the Moon is quite impressive considering the scope of the project in its time period. The use of editing and multiple scenes with the theatrical sets alone is impressive considering it was made in a time when others were simply filming ocean waves and scenery. However the special effects and the breadth of the story practically makes it an Avatar of 1902. It is quite strange however with the almost monkey like moon people and and its fantasy sets. By fantasy I mean really out there costume design and sets. The sets are theater style with painted back drops (which were pretty impressive actually). The whole film shot from a simple wide shot to provide a view as if sitting in a theater as it will be years before filmmakers begin experimenting with close ups.It is funny to see 1902's vision of the moon and how to get there. Travelling in a bullet launched from a cannon is quite funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The voyage to the moon is a whimsical short film about a group of comical scientists/magicians traveling to the moon made by George Melies. Set in the future, The basic story is that a group of scientists travel to the moon on a shuttle shot out of a large cannon. While on the moon they are forced to seek shelter from a snowstorm in a cave. The scientists discover a strange, subterranean, mushroom filled environment in the cave. While searching the cave the scientists are confronted by strange aliens they are forced to escape from in order to return to earth. While extremely short the film holds all of the light hearted magic of early french film-making. If you enjoy this work I would also recommend later french films such as Amelie and City of Lost Children both of which i consider classics. This is just an extra detail i find interesting but there is a British TV show called "The mighty Boosh" which has a moon with a face on it which is fairly similar to the one in this film although i am not sure if it is a reference to this exact movie.</fullReview>

After much pageantry the astronomer and several other scientists are launched towards the moon. The group lands, exploring the moon, and encountering some of it's inhabitants before returning.This early film is very entertaining. Its sets are spectacular, especially for the time. Melies as the Professor is charming. Many of the tricks and effectsthat Melie employs had been used by him on his previous films. Yet never had his skills been used to tell such a fully realized story. What must have astonished audiences in 1902 is still pretty special. Without a doubt the greatest film of its time, and a classic of cinema.7 out of a 10, and the best of 1902.</fullReview>

Today, this movie's most immediate quality is not its naive look, but its beauty and excitement; it has a highly developed sense of the show. Making such a movie on the threshold of cinema means genius; Méli?s started from zero, he invented the wondrous cinema. Verne still lived when this short was shot; but the movie doesn't resemble Verne, it uses a fancier trend of the Sci?Fi. Did Verne at least know about it?</fullReview>

As far as technique goes, the movie is primitive by modern standards, going from once scene to the next in a series of strange sequences. This gives it a feel similar to a kind of fairy tale, its surreal look and charm making up for the age. Each object in space is given a face (the capsule lands in the eye of the moon) and creatures disappear in puffs of smoke from the touch of an umbrella. It's this delightful weirdness that keeps the movie watchable even after more than a hundred years, still original to this day.Contains: Some Views of Very Mild Violence</fullReview>

When completed, it appears as a bullet and indeed is shot out of a large gun landing directly in the eye of the moon. After their long trip, the travelers disembark and take a nap. On awakening, they are captured by the alien inhabitants of the moon but manage to escape and flee back to their spaceship. They leave the moon and have a perfect splash down in the ocean before they are towed back to the mainland.This movie is a classic by Georges Melie and is remarkable in some facets that strongly resemble the actual later space programs (i.e. a bullet shaped rocket, the splash down in the ocean). There is a lot of action in its short run time, and it is interesting to watch. The sets were also quite remarkable.One thing I found interesting is that there really is no one "star" in the film-it really is a group effort in acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Here to the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often cited as the first example of a film in the Science Fiction genre, Le Voyage dans la Lune (1902) (English: A Trip to the Moon), is nothing short of impressive considering the elementary state of film-making at the beginning of its history. Based upon then contemporary Science-Fiction novels: From the Earth to the Moon (1865) and First Men on the Moon (1901) by authors Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, Le Voyage dans la Lune found success by combining elements of parody and pastiche with a firm narrative not seen before in film. Director Georges Méli?s, who also must take credit as writer, producer, production designer/art director and star of the film, was a former magician and illusionist who was no stranger to the entertainment business. After a brief spell recording what the Lumiere brothers referred to as "actualités," (non-narrative, documentary-like shorts that captured the everyday activities of contemporary society) Méli?s applied his craft to the camera, thus introducing theatricality to the art of film-making. As well as advancing techniques in areas such as production design, special effects, and early editing, the film pioneer took cinema to new heights when he recognized the storytelling ability of the medium.Indeed, Le Voyage dans la Lune illustrates in 8-14 minutes (depending on the fps) what it would take a modern film of the same plot and premise an hour and a half to show. The film begins on a rather prestigious yet playful note when it opens on a conference of astronomers, whose deep and often physical discussion involves traveling to the moon. When a colleague proposes a cylindrical capsule be built and shot out of a cannon directed at the face of the moon, all but one scholar readily agrees. After a bout of arguing, which results in books being thrown at the dissenter's head, the astronomers continue with their plans, seeing out the construction of both craft and cannon. Upon take-off, the bullet-shaped projectile makes a rather short journey before crash landing into the amused moon's eye. Once grounded, the enthusiastic astronomers (now accomplished astronauts), set out to explore the extraterrestrial terrain, where they encounter the rather agile natives, the Selenites.To complement this inspired narrative, Méli?s created an intricate production design, complete with constructed sets, complimentary props and painted backdrops. Adding to the illusion is the elaborate, but satirical costumes, which include the long flowing robes and pointy hats of the astronomers (more like a wizard's attire than a scholarly scientist's), and the provocatively jazzy outfits of the female "manservants," who look more like line of chorus girls than a group of eager assistants. All this combines to create delightfully dreamlike locations, whose inhabitants are simple, but comical characters that heighten the viewer's interest and make the movie absolutely enjoyable to watch.Although all action unfolds before an immobile camera on sets that act as "stages," the film itself is anything but stagnant. The various special effects displayed more than make up for this limitation. Using such techniques as stop-motion, animation, multiple exposures, superimposition, and substitution editing, Méli?s created an impressive array of surprisingly sophisticated and seamless "effects" to awe the audience with. It might very well be that Méli?s, being the magician he was, wrote the narrative around the visual artifices, emphasizing film's capacity to "trick" the viewer by creating alternate realities. Either way, Le Voyage dans la Lune is a spectacular practice in special effects, with a simple, but engaging story and fantastical mise-en-scene that adds up to an extremely entertaining experience.Recommended to both Science Fiction and Fantasy film enthusiasts who wish to see the origins of their beloved genre in film. I also recommend it to anyone who considers themselves connoisseurs of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start, i want to apologize for my English. My English not perfect, so don't panic if you see some grammar mistakes i made while writing this review :-)---When I first saw the movie "Le Voyage Dans la lune", I was 16 years old, and I was studying about the history of the cinema.I've learned about the director "Georges Méli?s", Which was considered to be the first who realized that cinema doesn't have to focus on documentary, it can also become a movie with an actual plot and story."Le Voyage Dans la lune" is a Unique fantasy movie, and the thing i liked the most about it, is the LARGE difference between what people knew then, and what people knows today, In the year 1902, i guess the moon was very mysterious, nobody had a clue about what's going on there, and Méli?s managed to create an original story which includes scientists going to the moon, and also their adventures while their on the moon. I think It's pretty impressive, to show this kind of movie to an audience who never even seen this kind of stuff before.The Other thing that i liked about the movie, is the special effects, which i guess that in this particular year, were amazing, like the flying to the moon part, the part when the spaceship hits the moon in the eye, the spaceship sinking in the ocean, and of course, the weird and silly fight between the scientists and the aliens.The scene that i like the most is the dreaming scene, which presents the scientists go to sleep on the moon and start dreaming, it was a very creative and magical scene, and it always makes me smile.The movie is good, but not just because of the movie itself, but mainly for it's historical part in the world of cinema, and because of all the new stuff that was in the movie, and was never done before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crazy! "Crazy" has got to be the only way to describe the 1902 film A Trip to the Moon. An early science fiction film, the brief 11-minute movie highlights Man's fascination with outer space, which at that time was unreachable. This film also seems like a precursor to random children's cartoons, or could even pass as a clip from a comedy show.After proposing to his Astronomer's a trip to the Moon, the President and a small group ride an overly-large bullet, shot from an enormously-large cannon, into the eye of the moon. Once there, mystical beings appear in the sky above them, it snows on the moon, and they are even set upon by a group of aliens who, from the slightest hit, will turn into dust. To add to my enjoyment, the President and his crew of Astronomers not only defeat the aliens (by slamming their King on the ground), but the President drags the bullet-spaceship by a rope off the edge of the Moon, and then rides that rope all the way back to Earth. Absolutely hilarious! As a science fiction fan, I cannot classify this film as a science fiction film, particularly not being around at the time of its creation. Science was advanced enough that, while we couldn't land on the moon, we knew enough about it that most of this movie is just plain silly. Most science fiction, or at least the kind I read, tries to incorporate what facts it can into them, or, they at least seem more feasible based on technological advances. Also, this film plays out like a bad cartoon or comedy sketch (not that it was horrible, because it is definitely a good laugh); it reminds me of an episode of Astro Boy or something that I could expect to see in an early British comedy series. A Trip to the Moon, while definitely no where near anything we can do now, must definitely have been an achievement in 1902; the special effects were definitely much better than I would have ever imagined for that time. As I began this review, A Trip to the Moon can be described in just one word: Crazy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A groundbreaking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is only appropriate that the pioneer of special effects, particularly those mimicking outer space, George Melie had first made his fame as a magician and illusionist. His masterpiece would come in his third cinematic production about lunar travel entitled, "Le Voyage dans la Lune (The Trip to the Moon)." This stellar film uses groundbreaking special effects to bring entertaining surrealism and fantasy to a concept that the audience at this time in history, was beginning to perceive as a possible reality for the future of technology.The work is largely fantasy based as society had been flirting with the idea of space travel in novels written by the likes of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. The film begins with a meeting among scientists who draw up plans preparing a flight to the moon and progresses to the ship's construction and takeoff. The special effects of the bullet-like ship's launch through a cannon spanning far through the sky, was wonderfully classic, as the fuse was lit and smoke echoed from the nozzle. Unknown to me prior to seeing the film, I would soon realize this takeoff scene is one ingrained in movie history forever. Approaching the (quite literally smiling) face of the moon, they craft splats directly in his eye, soon turning the "man in the moon" to look slightly disgruntled. This image is one referenced often in sci-fi, giving credit to its heavy influence on the generations of writers and directors that would dominate the remainder of the century.It was interesting to see how George Méli?s treated the idea of landing on the moon by portraying the astronomers and scientists almost as wizards. However strengthening the work's intent as fictional, it implicates that the concept of space flight at this time was still simply ridiculous.I think "The Trip to the Moon" was an innovative masterpiece of its time in the field of special effects, but can't help to think it somewhat parodies the more serious sci-fi moon landing novels written by popular authors of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Trip to The Moon from George Melies was well ahead of its' time. It was created by a Frenchmen and its' original title was La Voyage Dans La Lune. I watched two different versions on it on you tube. The first version had no words other than music playing in the background, had a hard time trying to decipher what exactly was happening. Moreover, the second film had a narration by a man with a French accent, could have possibly been the creator George Melies. The first scene is a group of astronomers meeting to make a trip to the moon. The astronomers have these really cool outfits on that resemble a magician because of their long pointy hats. There is so much humor in the fact that they want to build a cannon that will blast them to the moon. The cannon that they plan on use looks like a typical cannon that would be used in warfare. The scenes are well done and they have many elaborate details that make it really interesting. The graphics of them landing on the moon is truly amazing and the inhabitants are creatively depicted. Considering this is one of the very first sci-fi films it is done quite well. This really set the stage for future sci-fi films and shows. Once the explorers' blast off in the cannon and land on the moon, they encounter aliens. The aliens capture the explorers and tie them down, but the explorers manage to escape and kill the aliens. This film is quite entertaining despite its' short length it manages to hold the viewers' attention. Georges Melies executed a tremendous storyline that has been an inspiration to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Trip to the Moon is early film-making at its best with the primitive silent landmark that has charm and originality than most modern day epics. It is a twelve minute piece created and directed by French master mind Georges Melies. The plot of the film was humorous by condemning scientific theory of the early twentieth century. There is discussion and mild arguing on considering the dispatch to the moon. Melies shows a prediction of people's reactions to an event that may be unsuccessful. As the characters land on the moon the film almost turns away from humor and into more fantasy. Mushrooms, constellations and moon men who capture the characters all create a sense of climax in the film and help the characters develop a meaning of the "outside" world. The thought of Professor Barbenfouillis having deep thoughts of flying to the moon in a cannon and discovering a new world beyond their expectations creates a sense of expansion in the early twentieth century. At the time, technology and economy were low and people in general were close minded. This film allowed the inflation of imagination to look beyond what is in front and think of what technological advances can do for the future. The film was created in 1902 and the special effects were amazing. There were no obvious close ups of characters and the stage sets almost looked like cardboard cut outs. The amusement of the film grabs the viewer's attention promptly, especially with the help of narrative commentary. There is even mild sexuality in the film with French showgirls building and launching the professor and his attendees to the moon. A Trip to the Moon is a film that can almost foreshadows the essence of technology and advances that would take place in later years. The film almost shows the reaction of characters in unfamiliar situations and brings the viewers attention to possible conflict. The fantasy and imagination of it all sets the atmosphere for viewers of all ages through hand painted and self-constructed backdrops. This makes it fun and enjoyable to watch and reflect on how technology has changed throughout years and in the oncoming future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Melies' "A Trip to the Moon" is a foreshadowing of the world of technology that will come in the twentieth century. Although somewhat rudimentary when compared to today's standards of film-making, the video camera was the newest technology available. People were not just going to see a movie as we do today, they were going to witness an experience of technology they never had before.The movie begins with a meeting of astronomers who by the order of the president bravely volunteer to travel in the capsule to the moon. As they are making their trip they land into the "eye" of the man on the moon. This was probably done because many movie goers did not understand the idea of craters on the moon and it made the film more relatable to the audience. As they are exploring they see the rising of the earth, as astronauts seventy years later would witness too. They then encounter men who live on the moon but they are easily destroyed, showing the power and might that these French invaders have over them. However, all are rescued and brought back home.The movie itself was a pioneer in the art of film-making and for that its crudeness can be accepted. The editing is very choppy and the viewer and easily get lost if it weren't for the voice-over. There seems to also be problems in the timing of edits in that there are quick cut aways to the next scene. However, for its time period the special effects are dazzling and each scene continues to tell a specific part of the story. The movie itself is a story of pioneering on two fronts of technology, both film and a foreshadowing of the exploration of space to come. It was a film like this that let us enjoy films like "Star Wars" and "Spiderman". With their intricate special effects one can not imagine that it all began with a rudimentary rocket ship crashing into the eye of the moon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon made of Cheese -- fact or fiction?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just finished watching Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey", it seemed only fair to start at the beginning, 1902, to see where his ideas, as well as any science fiction director first inherited their vision. Georges Melies' short film, "A Trip to the Moon" is the birth, the quintessential first born, of the sci-fi genre. With amazing special effects, imaginative characters, and a story that loomed with eerie darkness, Melies proudly created a film that everyone, with no exceptions, would try to mimic through the next century and beyond of cinema. As I watched this short film, my jaw was on the floor. Melies creativity was more than just aliens and space travel, but instead demonstrated the "life" of space. Sure, it is the most unrealistic and unbelievable film about the moon ? but it doesn't matter. The concept of shooting into space through a large gun, hitting the moon in the "eye", destroying creatures with your umbrella, and finally falling off a cliff to get back to the Earth was pioneering. Melies was probably smarter than this film, but by using the formula for the absurd, he forces us to eliminate the scientist in us and proudly watch a science fiction film. My eyes couldn't be removed from the screen, not because it was the most enthralling film created, but because I didn't know where Melies' creativity was going to go next, or what "new" image he was going to impress me with. This film was made in 1902, but watching it in 2008, I felt like I was watching a more modern film. This is what films should be about - not about length or stardom, but instead imagination and creativity. Melies film has sense been a staple in today's pop culture with the use of his imagination in that infamous Smashing Pumpkins video, or honestly, throughout the course of the "Star Wars" saga. If it were not for this one, singular film, the concept of science fiction may forever have been changed.Overall, "A Trip to the Moon" is breathtaking. Watching it is almost like watching that historic image of our first landing on the moon. That wasn't as creative, but the thrill and excitement are still in place. Melies should also be noted that this was one of the first films of fiction ? pioneering both the sci-fi genre as well as a world of fantasy. I would have loved to live during this time, to witness Melies film on the screen, and to walk out with my jaw in the same place it was when I watched it in my home. This film, this one singular film, changed cinema for us today. It is powerful, creative, original, and still used as the foundation for anything coming from the current Hollywood recycle bin. Take a breath, jump into "A Trip to the Moon", and be prepared ? you will never see anything like this again! Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Georges Méli?s a hundred years later is still a genius. Before him films were just documentary style clips of everyday life, but when he got behind and in front of the camera he created much of the magic that we take for granted today in films.Méli?s was a pioneer in many fields of film inventing forms of editing that are the standard of any coherent film today. Without continuity editing and other types of shots movies would not make any sense.His mastery of entertainment on the screen and behind the camera along with his brilliant knack for writing is what makes Le Voyage dans la lune (The Voyage to the Moon) such a timeless treasure.In this film you see Méli?s pull out his whole bag of tricks using highly decorated sets and costumes along with great editing and excellent performances for a silent film. This film is a must see for anyone who is studying film or just wants to learn about where it all started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A short and enjoyable view into primitive film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed A Trip to the Moon when I was browsing through public domain movies. The subject matter and the date of creation caught my attention. I figured I might as well watch it, seeing that it was only 12 minutes long.The story is obviously simple. The title pretty much says it all... a group of astronomers decide to visit the moon (by launching a shuttle from a cannon) and run into interesting things there. Despite its age, its still a surprisingly enjoyable watch. If nothing else, its fascinating to see how much our understanding of the moon and physics has developed. It is probably more of a fantasy than science fiction, although it may have been quite believable in 1902. The special effects (while again, primitive) were actually good.The fact that people were able to think of this and make it into a movie so long ago is astounding, even with all the technical and logical errors. I had a lot of fun watching it. It is a nice casual film that can be seen when your taking a short break, but also carries intriguing cultural messages from the distant past. To be so accessible to modern audiences is an amazing achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for GOVT 490</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What struck me most about the film is the amount of imagination that the filmmakers had. In every stage of the film, their imagination is present. Its hard to imagine what we would think if we do not know what we know now, such as what the surface of the moon is like and how difficult space travel is, when approaching a topic such as travel to the moon. With nothing to form a basis around, such an endeavor, while testing the bounds of credulous, fancied the sci-fi writers of the day.Specifically, the creation of the sets is the most impressive aspect of the film. Every set, from the first room to the launch site to the surface of the moon to the throne room shows a creative spirit that thrives in the wonder of what could be. The sets are extremely detailed, and are completely different from each other, showing both the attention to detail and the range of vision that the creators of the film had.Such sets are more than enough to transport the viewer along with the shell to the moon. With the actors doing little more than just moving on the screen in different directions, it is the narration and the sets that drive the film, and capture the imagination of its viewers as well. Compare that to modern films, where special effects take the imagination away, and where actors are paid millions of dollars while a film is shot in Vancouver in order to save money on the scenery. Such films could learn a lesson from this 105-year-old film: transport the viewer to a location, and you can sell whatever story you like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trip to the Moon, a Good Pick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, "Le Voyage dans la Lune (1902)" also known as, "A Trip to the Moon (1902)," is a very unique picture of bold astronomer's trip to the moon. The film, written by the French author, Jules Verne (1828-1905), the father of science fiction, documents a select group of astronomer's trip to the moon.A large group of astronomer's convenes and the leader proposes his idea of going to the moon and how to get there. After meeting little resistance by the group, the plans are finalized and approved and a smaller group of astronomers are elected to go on the journey. The film takes us through the process of building the spacecraft to the launch of it. The spacecraft is in the vague shape of a bullet and the astronomer's load into the "bridge" before the spacecraft is loaded into a gigantic cannon facing the moon. After a tiny ceremony, the cannon is fired towards the moon and the astronomer's land on the moon safe and sound. Remarkably, they are able to walk around and breathe just as though they were on earth's surface. After taking a nights rest, they wake up to cold conditions and decide to explore, only to run to the local population, called, "Selenites." At a very humorous moment, the astronomers use their umbrellas to destroy the Selenites, and then are chased by a large army of them. They are brought to the leader and they quickly destroy him as well and then are chased back to their ship, which is "launched" by falling through the ocean and picked up by a towboat to be launched home.While the movie is clearly a work of fiction, it is remarkable in a few ways. The mere idea of exploring the moon could have been improbably, yet years later, the moon was landed on and explored. At the time of when this movie was made, it was not known that one could not breathe on the moon without a spacesuit or that an actual spacecraft powered by engines would be needed. The idea of aliens on the moon was most likely very exciting to fans, and yet after an exploration of the moon, none were to be found. While the concepts of gravity and almost reason are left out of the film, it is still well done in terms of the technology and concepts understood at the time. The movie led the way for "The Great Train Robbery (1903)," which became an instant classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trip to the Moon Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Trip to the Moon is a French film from 1902. It begins by showing a group of astronomers meeting to discuss plans for a trip to the moon. The president of the astronomers chooses 5 men to accompany him on the trip. The film then shows the astronomers being shot out of a canon; they then land in the eye of the moon. They explore the new landscape of the moon and end up falling asleep on the surface. When they wake up snow is falling and they are freezing, so they decide to go down into a crater. They disappear 1 by 1 into the crater and reappear in the crater, which is filled with enormous mushrooms, one astronomer tries to judge the size of the mushrooms with his umbrella which takes root and grows into a giant mushroom itself. Strange creatures that live on the moon appear and capture the astronomers. The astronomers manage to escape and destroy some of the creatures as they run back to their shell. They all reenter their shell, except for the president. The president then grabs a rope attached to the shell and pulls it off the edge of the moon. The shell falls into the sea where it is picked up by a steam ship and pulled back to the astronomers' happy return.This film was made using many technological advances in its time. It was filmed with innovative techniques that may seem poor now, but at the time were new and exciting.While if this film were to come out now it may seem cheesy, or uninteresting, it seems like it would have been an exciting film in its own time. I would highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Trip to the Moon movie was very interesting to me. I haven't seen a movie like this before because I'm so use the how the movies are now. I liked how they used a narrator for the movie and the actors are just moving around. It lets me focus on what the actors are doing. What's also interesting is how they use the products in the movie and how they animated the way the film is. For example the moon and how when they got closer to the moon, the moon started to have a face. The way they depict the moon was very unique. Not only was this intriguing to me, I like space and astronomy so this movie caught my attention more because of that. Its great how a short movie like this was just a narration can help you seen what they are trying to do. Like our Professor said, a good movie can be done in ten minutes. The use of special effects especially in that time was used very well. It showed how the astronomers interacted with the creatures of the Moon and how they got rid of the creatures with an explosion and disappearance. I also think this film is very interesting because it seems like a fiction film created from a person imagination of what it would be like to go to the moon and what things will happen while they are there. Overall I think this film was very good and if there were more films like this, I'd definitely watch it. Tien</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the first sci-fi movie... a trip to the moon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew the French could do delicious red wine and scrumptious Brie cheese, but I never knew they could do innovative and entertaining films as well. In 1902, director Georges Méli?s struck more than just moon rocks in his film, Le Voyage dans la lune, or A Trip to the Moon. As one of the first science-fiction movies ever created, A Trip to the Moon enthralled both French and American audiences alike with special effects and cinematography ahead of its time. While the film only runs for about 11 minutes, it is jammed pack with information and amusement. In the opening scene, the viewers are greeted with a multitude of zaniness, with the actors running in every direction possible with no apparent method to their madness. The music is an upbeat classical type that seems to say, "Get ready for an adventure." Because there is no direct dialogue between the characters, the monotone narrator leads the viewers through the flick. He introduces the madcap characters as a group of astronomers and their president. The President is eager to embark on a trip to the Moon but many of his people are opposed to this idea. However, six brave astronomers agree to go on the trip and immediately start building their capsule. After being launched from the Earth, the capsule travels to the Moon and hits the Man in the Moon in the eye. While the astronomers are exploring and studying the moon, they meet a Selenite, an insect-type creature that lives on the Moon. The Selenites are manageable in small groups, but are unbeatable when they ban together. The astronomers are unable to hold off the creatures and retreat to their capsule in hopes of a safe return to Earth. In the end, one of the astronomers and the enemy fall off the edge of the Moon. They land in an unknown ocean, seemingly unharmed. The film is ahead of its time, using techniques that were almost unheard of before its release. Unlike most films of this era, A Trip to the Moon includes a detailed narrative. Many films at this point were silent ones, but George Méli?s was able to give viewers a new perspective. Also, instead of filming all the scenes at the same distance, Méli?s transformed previous direction techniques and made some scenes more personal than others. This more detailed and improved technique gives viewers an in-depth understanding of the film. Furthermore, Méli?s used light to make the effects of his films more compelling. Charles Chaplin even called him "the alchemist of light." In the film, when the capsule lands on the Moon, the use of light makes the Moon jump off the screen and into the theater seats. Without the color difference between the capsule and the Moon, the film would resemble a mere slideshow, instead of a realistic movie. Because of his light and other advanced techniques, Méli?s proved to the world that he could make a film about something that isn't real. With his camera techniques and the pasting of separate scenes together, Méli?s gives the world a new view into the fantasy world. Many critics feel that A Trip to the Moon is fake and unrealistic. However, the genre, science-fiction, should speak for itself. The creativity in this film can't be taken out of context. Of course someone can't survive after falling off the Moon, but in Méli?s' world, they can. The topic of narration also comes up a lot between critics. They say it's distracting and the film should have been kept as a silent one. However, the narration adds to the film, making it easier to understand. With all the characters running around in a mad frenzy, how is the audience supposed to know what's going on? In addition, isn't the idea of innovation and invention to move forward and come up with improved ideas? A Trip to the Moon is not just another old film on a few "Best of the Best Lists;" it's integral to American popular culture. In the Smashing Pumpkins music video, "Tonight Tonight" the image of the Man in the Moon and the capsule in his eye was the focal point of their video. Méli?s' new techniques, innovative camera angles, and an explanatory narrative, make A Trip to the Moon a trip worth taking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Georges Méli?s movie a trip to the moon certainly isn't the big budget special effects juggernaut of today's science fiction films but for its time it was an amazing peace of work. Made in 1902 it is widely created as the first science fiction film made.The film starts with a French assembly voting on taking a trip to the moon. Only one assembly member opposes the idea but is over ruled. Several astronomers and the Assembly President volunteer for the mission. They are given special suits for the trip which resemble wizard costumes. A popular idea for the time was to create a cannon powerful enough to launch people into outer space. So keeping with the thought of the time the space travelers are loaded into a giant shell and put into a large cannon. After some pomp and ceremony the brave astronauts are shot into the eye of the moon.Upon arriving on the moon the astronauts now kind of dressed like Uncle Sam face a strange planet. During the night it begins to snow so they take refuge in a giant moon crater. Once in the crater they encounter giant mushrooms and moon aliens. Frightened by the astronauts on alien gets to close and the astronaut hits him with an umbrella bursting him into a thousand peaces. Eventually the astronauts are overwhelmed by their numbers and taken to the moon palace where the smash the moon king and run for their lives. They make back to their bullet pursued by the aliens where the President hanging on to a rope uses his weight to send the bullet back to earth where it is picked up by a freighter.This film is a great peace of history and was parodied by the Smashing Pumpkins in their video 'tonight tonight'. It is by no means spectacular by today's standards it is silent and the special effects are little more then smoke and card board stage settings, but it is worth watching for its historical value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This funny endeavor of a movie shows how people go to foreign places and that the people of that place do not like them intruding. It also shows the keenness of people and how people can gain the knowledge of how to operate things with ordinary things around them. It's a very funny movie only because some of the ideas are "ridiculous" in the eyes of people in this generation. This little movie showed how technology was developed through small minds and ordinary things around us that came around and gave people ideas on how to form certain things like how to get to the moon. This movie contains humor and intellectual concepts that add on to the cleverness of this movie. The fact that it is a black and white movie gives the movie a sense of olden times and that maybe people were actually like this during that time. The clothing of each character is not ordinary clothing that we would wear at this day and time. The outfits of the astronomers reminded me of magicians. The girls in the movie are given kind of seductive roles in a sense because of the emphasis given to them as if they are the stars in their dreams and how when they are seen off, they wear cheerleading type outfits to bid them goodbye. Overall, I liked this movie because it's different from reality. It's more like you are in a crazy fairytale where people who look like us, dress up in costumes and go to the moon in a shell that they made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analytical Review of A Trip to the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Trip to the Moon, directed by Georges Méli?s, is one of the first science fiction films ever made. The vision and creativity Méli?s portrays in the movie is astounding, given the movie was made over 100 years ago, and the amount of knowledge about the universe was not readily available at this time. Even without the knowledge, Méli?s adapted his particular creative vision of outer space and formulated it into A Trip to the Moon, and provided the entertainment that audiences wanted when seeing a movie. A Trip to the Moon has a more satisfying plot than a number of movies that are being produced today. One could definitely see Méli?s' imagination at work in the film with the creative backdrops to every scene, creative sets to coincide with the backdrops, and unique special effects that are still used today. One such special effect used during still-frame scenes was where Méli?s would stop the movie, take something away from the scene, and begin the movie again making it seem that the object or person had disappeared. This technique, although now highly advanced, is still a commonly used technique by directors. The amount of effort it took to create the backdrops and sets is surprising, as today, most directors create their simulated backdrops with the click of a computer. The sheer notion of having a silent film that is only 11 minutes long and that was produced in 1902, still be inspirational 100 years later, is extraordinary. However, A Trip to the Moon did just that. This movie captures the imagination of Méli?s and others during this time, displays it for the world to observe, and at the same time helped give birth to arguably one of the most popular genres in film: science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Trip to the Moon" or more appropriately, "Le Voyage dans la lune" is an interesting early science fiction film. One of the first of its genre, the director who is also the writer, Georges Melies, conveys a scientific break through to the audience in the early 1900's. Just as film's today have people talking about the future, directors and writers portray their own ideas on the screen about what lies ahead. In a much smaller movie by today's standards, Melies' does the same thing, he shows the audience the possibility of getting to the moon and what to expect.Melies own vision of what the moon looked like and what to expect was not far off. His idea of traveling in a bullet launched out of a large cannon was scientific in itself. How was man going to get to the moon? Surely scientists were working to understand more about space and travel. Melies formed is own idea that gave people something to imagine and vision thousands of miles away.Melies' ability to create this film laid the ground work for special effects. For an early film, the effects were impressive, allowing the audience to imagine more because of its realism. Movies that see into the future in today's film industry have the ability to change imagines and create new ideas on a computer in order to bring it to life. In "A Trip to the Moon," everything was done on stage. Melies' ability to transpose objects and images to fit his movie was the cornerstone for all sci-fi thrillers to follow, most notably, Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one who has never watched an early film I found A Trip to the Moon to be fascinating and thought provoking. Making the presumptuous assumption that this film was meant to be serious with added comic relief, one can make the argument that this film exemplifies early twentieth century adaptation to the rise of technology. To clarify, there is an obvious undertone of the conflict between societal norms established by religion and science.There is a direct contrast and play on intellectualism between biology and metaphysical presences throughout the portion of the film on the moon. Every one of the celestial beings portrayed in the film such as the moon, stars, comets, and other planets, had human characteristics to the point that they were actual beings rather than metaphorical representations. They had personalities and actions provoked by the presence of these scientists on the moon.The play on intellectualism is this metaphysical presence alongside with science and technology. The more obvious of the two is the carrier that brought them to the moon being a simple contraption used to attain the unthinkable. The not so obvious link is the attention to detail established by the presence of elements necessary to support life on the moon. These include precipitation, water in the form of a waterfall, plant life, and the ever reaching presence of the explosion suggesting flammable gasses.Therefore, the film begs the question of these times in that is there a divine undertaking by celestial beings that could or does affect our lives? Or is there more scientific reasoning for life such as the sustainability of life supporting elements along with evolution and adaptation. This is perhaps a reaching analysis of A Trip to the Moon; however, there is definitely a symbiotic and meaningful relationship between these stark details portrayed in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Melies' A Trip to the Moon is a short but insightful film on the manner in which technology was viewed in the early 1900s. Beginning with the introduction of the idea for the trip, this scene portrays the ways in which science was accepted. With the majority of people in the community in agreement and support of the idea, there is one whom adamantly objects. This person may symbolize those members of the community which who were in objection to many scientific ideas. The construction of the "rocketship" is rapidly completely and the five men are on their way to the moon. In this scene it is obvious compared to today's standard the lack of technology involved in the process of building a "rocketship" which would have the ability to travel to the moon. While on the moon, the men discover many things which perhaps were philosophies about what inhabited the moon in 1902. This also shows the limitations of knowledge at the time. The travelers are quickly confronted with obstacles which they were not prepared for and voyage back to the Earth with as much, if not less, ease than they left with. This film generally displays the lack of knowledge and technology in the early 1900s. However, it seemingly foreshadows how we view space technology today. The majority of the population does not understand the dynamics of space travel and prefer to think of it as simple as this movie portrays it to be. However, as we have become more knowledgeable about space we have also developed more realistic views about what exactly inhabits the areas of space we know less about. For the time period, this film is an excellent portrayal the amount of technology and knowledge in 1902.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film A Trip to the Moon produced by George Melies begins with a meeting consisting of the president and the members of the astronomic club. They congregate in a large hall as they await the arrival of the president, Professor Barbenfouillis. The president proceeds to propose his plan of a trip to the moon. All members approve of the plan except one member who violently objects. This scene is important because it portrays the conservative scientific community in the early 1900s. Once order is restored, the plan is approved and five men decide to join Professor Barbenfouillis on the trip. The men proceed to the workshop where the "rocketship" is being constructed. Once the "rocketship" is completed, the travelers climb in and it is then launched out of a cannon. The scenes of the construction of the rocket ship and how it is launched displays the limited technology in the early 1900s and the concepts society had of how technology would be developed. As the "rocketship" travels through space, it finally approaches the moon, which has a huge smiling face. This image portrays the typical "Man in the Moon" concept and is symbolic of early pioneering in technology. The travelers land on the moon and are confronted with many strange "space creatures". Finally, the travelers survive their adventure and head back to planet Earth where they are considered heroes. Overall, the film is highlights the key concepts that society held regarding technology in the early 1900s in an entertaining manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first true film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Trip to the Moon could arguably be said to be the first true film. A film with story, acting, and cinematography. George Melies creates the first action film and the first sci-fi film with his production of A Trip to the Moon. This pioneer work in the earliest days of cinema is one of the most remembered to date. The plot may be ridiculous and the actors far from believable but the film, in its short 10 minutes of runtime, sucks you right in and holds you until it ends. The story is quite simple: a semi-crazy scientist plots and expedition to the moon and has five men and women accompany him. There is a lot of unexpected laughter and some legendary scenes, especially the rocket hitting the face of the moon it the eye, literally in the eye. Also all concepts of physics and all that we know today about outer space is left out mostly because of it not being known at the time. The moon is made out to be an actual face with a wild landscape and infested with creatures who take the crew captive. The film brings a lot of unexpected laughs. After making the final preparations and seeing a giant cannon being constructed and aimed at the moon is my personal favorite. We shouldn't analyze the film on how childish it is. This was the beginning of cinema. This is what made showbiz what it is today. This film began the genres of action, science fiction, and fantasy. It also numbers as one of the oldest surviving films made in 1902!The acting isn't anything to talk about, just a bunch of people running around waving their arms through the air as is most silent acting from the time period was done. What the film should be known for is the primitive special effects. The disappearance of characters on screen, people exploding into dust (on the moon), and the shots of the capsule. George Melies was a pioneer of cinema and the master of special effects for his time. The film should be watched for its advancements in cinema, not its story which is totally absurd. George Melies was truly a master of his profession and I find this film to be a spectacular achievement in film making.4/5 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of astronomers dressed like wizards assemble in a great hall. Using a chalkboard, the leader explains his plan for "A Trip to the Moon". At first, there seems to be some disbelief in the trip's possibility, but the lead astronomer insists. Finally, all agree on the trip. Women with hourglass figures provide the men with refreshment. Next, a bullet-shaped rocket-ship is built. The completed ship is fired at the moon, with a crew of six astronomers inside. The ship pierces an eye of "the man in the moon" (a humorous landmark image and illustrative of the film's enduring success). The men emerge on the lunar landscape. They watch the Earth-rise and are startled by their surroundings. You may be, too... This imaginative work is the most famous of all made by pioneer filmmaker Georges Melies. Compared to 100 years of films released subsequently, it still rates high.******* A Trip to the Moon (9/1/02) Georges Melies ~ Georges Melies, Bleuette Bernon, Henri Delannoy, Jeanne d'Alcy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange but still pretty good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on YouTube and it has to be the weirdest film ever made. It starts off with a man talking about how they are going to get to the moon. Anyway they got on a space capsule to the moon. Saturn and the stars come out of nowhere and the moon freaks blow up when you hit them. I was laughing my head off. They return to the capsule a moon freak jumps on it and they fall into the ocean. When it ended I thought what a how strange was this movie, nobody told me it was like this. Maybe I was. Yes, I know it was made in 1902 but it was still very weird. The moon was talking for crying out loud.This is now the oldest film I've seen and it wasn't the best silent film. I think I will watch The Great Train Robbery and see if that is as weird as this. It would've been very good for back then and today it is still considered to be a classic. This movie deserves 3.5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adventure of great proportions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the first science-fiction movie ever created, "Le Voyage dans la lune" tells us the story of a group of astronomers who travel to the moon by being shot in a capsule from a giant cannon.More than 100 years later, the movie is still adventurous and spectacular to watch. The movie has a great and intriguing imaginary story, of course based on the well known Jules Verne novel.Of course the events presented in this movie are heavily outdated. The astronomers can magically breath on the moon without any spacesuits and gravity also is not a problem. It becomes all the more hilarious when they decide to take a nap on the moon under a couple of blankets. A man can also fall from space Earth into the water and lives to tell the story. The moon is also filled with lots of giant mushrooms and strange hostile aliens and the moon and stars all have faces. Of course totally ridicules all but what did they know back then? Space traveling wasn't possible and astronomers knew very little about space and life in space. Even cars, radios, airplanes were yet had to be developed at the time for commercial use. But in essence the movie also has a core of truth in it, about the capsule being shot into space like a bullet. In that regard this movie is quite amazing and revolutionary about its ideas, though of course most credit for that have to go to Jules Verne. Director Georges Méli?s makes the story work out believable and entertaining, with lots of early special effects and some overall great storytelling.The movie is only a couple of minutes short but that doesn't mean its not well developed. Lots of different stuff happens in the movie, from the building of the capsule, to the actual launch and landing on the moon and the astronomers mishaps with the hostile aliens and their king.Some of the early effects are amazing, obviously especially for 1902 standards but I perhaps liked the set decoration and costumes even more. It gives the movie a really great adventurous and imaginatively look and feel. It makes the movie very pleasant and entertaining to watch, even by todays standards.Definitely a revolutionary and important classic movie, in terms of its directing, story and special effects, that also is surprisingly entertaining to watch still.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over 100 years old!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was fascinating to watch a movie that is over 100 years old. I'm a sci-fi fan and not a movie historian, so my comments come from that angle. I was amazed that this movie was as good as it was - at 14 minutes, it was far more interesting than so many of the 90 minute sci-fi low-budget movies out there. In black and white, the wild sets were fun to watch. They were so different than what one sees in the movies today. It makes me think that people today have stopped trying somehow.Anyway, the movie is good but not great. It's definitely worth watching (what have you got to loose in 14 minutes?) - but it is flawed in all sorts of ways. There are poor choices of when to apply violence (esp. to a dissenter at the beginning), people who look the wrong way when the big moment occurs (being shot into space) and inexcusably bad accompanying narration. Regarding this last point, if narration is going to be added at all (even if it's from early in the century), I'd rather hear a version without a strong French accent that I can easily understand. If not - at least give me subtitles or closed-captioning! That said, let me add that the sets and costumes are great - virtually every scene is to be treasured. Every scene also has a certain high density to it as well - a kind of background detail that I would normally only see in one of the latter Star Wars movies.The story moves along at a quick and efficient pace (another lesson to be learned by many modern sci-fi filmmakers). The narration, bad as it is, really helps explain what's happening.See this movie if you can - it's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the oldest one I have reviewed on the IMDb. It is also the first film I have seen from beginning to end on the internet. Monsieur Melies had a charmingly gallic sense of humour and his film is very like a children's pop-up book. I mean, look at the way everything except the actors seems to be a cardboard cut out. But that doesn't matter. Also, just like a children's book, the moon has a big beaming face. It is interesting that the Man in the Moon was actually a lady. It's contestible, though, whether Mlle Bernon actually looks like the moon. She looks more like a cream pie with a big smiling face. You could also say that she's the Pie in the Sky. The effects are good for a film made more than a century ago. The way the selenites disappear in puffs of smoke is very well done. Prophetically, the film ends with a splashdown. I wonder what Messrs Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins think of this film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long considered Melies' masterpiece, A Trip to the Moon is certainly his most memorable. Take that iconic rocket-in-the-moon's-eye image. That picture survives to this day because of its appearance in books about movies and sci-fi literature. There's also the fact that this was the first time that anyone had filmed an adventure that took place in outer space. And the way they defeated the moon "selenites" by simply hitting them! Must of been wishful thinking to some enemies on Georges part. There's also some fascinating sequences of animated stars with faces on them followed by snow falling while the rocket passengers were sleeping. Obviously, we've come a long way in movie fantasy from Melies' day. But because this film came WAY before moon landing existed, it's still incredibly intriguing seeing how people thought space travel might be like then. MOST definitely worth seeing for Melies enthusiasts and silent film lovers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Moon magnifies rapidly, until finally it attains colossal dimensions"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A Trip to the Moon (1902)' has been called a lot of things: the first narrative film, the first science-fiction film. It's certainly one of the earliest films I've seen with any substantial story, though William K.L. Dickson's (admittedly primitive) 'Rip Van Winkle (1896)' predates it by six years. But, yes, this does appear to be cinema's first foray into science-fiction, a playful loose adaptation of Jules Verne's novel "From the Earth to the Moon" (the director's follow-up film, the even better 'The Impossible Voyage (1904),' was also inspired by Verne). Méli?s' films to date had largely been pithy "trick films," which served as training grounds for many of the optical tricks that he utilises here, particularly stop-motion and multiple exposures.Editing-wise, Méli?s doesn't do all that much. Each shot operates as a self-contained scene, usually photographed from a distance, as though watching a stage-play. However, his use of elaborate backdrops and optical effects is effective. It took me several viewings to appreciate the film's satirical approach, with its bumbling explorers and outrageous abuse of science. I'm very tempted to read sexual symbolism into the film, if only because of Méli?s' 'The Eclipse: Courtship of the Sun and Moon (1907),' in which the Sun and Moon are seen to engage, bizarrely but quite unmistakeably, in a bout of homosexual intercourse. Certainly, there is something suggestive in a group of men entering a phallic vessel, being thrust into a circular orifice, and blasted (ejaculated?) out the other end.</fullReview>

There's no question that this is one of the greatest landmarks in the history of cinema and the amusing story just shows the wonderful mind of the director. This really is a fairy tale about what the moon would be like and this moon creation is something we've seen in the director's previous films but this time out we get to explore the fairy tale. I think the greatest thing about this movie is its visual look, which really blows ones mind when you consider how well it holds up today. The look of the moon is brilliantly done as is the underground creatures that attack towards the end.

		<shortDescription>Delightful, and still current, film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Trip to the Moon Review A Trip to the Moon is a delightful tale of astronomers taking a trip to the moon and back. The film is black and white, narrated film, and was produced in 1902. It was the first science fiction film, on the surface addressing the issue of creatures from outer space. Deeper, the film reflected upon the time period's fears of the dangers of the new technology being developed and imperialist expansion. The story's plot is developed by following a group of explorers from the idea of traveling to the moon to their return. In each scene, another stage of this journey takes place. The group decides to go to the moon in pursuit of knowledge. In the end, though, members of the group sacrificed their life for this cause. An individual making the vehicle to travel to the moon dies in the process. Manufacturing new technology is a dangerous job, and the narrator looks at this as if it were an everyday event. At the time, it was. It makes the viewer question if that fact of life is a necessity. The men reach the moon, and begin to freeze on the lunar surface while resting. These men on the journey face the fact that new places reflect new dangerous, and with the advances in transportation, individuals are able to see more places than ever before. In an attempt to seek shelter, the men evoke the rage of the lunar creatures. They fight these creatures and many casualties occur as a result. Viewers can relate to this violence because they experienced the results of colonialism and imperialism in their society. They saw how violence was evoked by entering someone else's' land. In the end, the astronomers needed to flee home for their own safety. This film is making a statement about what the European powers had to do to for their own safety. It wanted these powers to leave their colonies, for the safety of both parties. The film is different than movies today. In the film, each scene was a long shot and the camera stayed stationary. Today's viewer is accustomed to a camera that follows the action. Watching it is more like watching a play, than a modern film. Despite this viewers in the 21st century can still relate to these themes and enjoy the story. Society today faces neo-imperialism and an over-reliance on petroleum which leads to, sometimes, bad foreign policy decisions. The astronomers traveling to the moon were overexcited about the prospect of new knowledge so they did not consider the dangers. In our society, we also have not fully considered the dangers and thus, can learn a lot from A Trip to the Moon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but insightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon watching "A Trip to the Moon" (1902), this viewer cannot help but think if it was seen as silly in 1902 as I see it today. Living in the 21st century we take things for granted such as the amount of energy it takes to lift out of the earth's atmosphere, or the hostile conditions that exist on the moon, or what the true consequences are of being sucked in by the earth's gravity pull when falling from space. Yet on some level I can't believe that they too knew at least some of these facts. The film has a warm funny feel that makes you want to laugh, and the viewer can tell that in fact it was meant to be silly. For example, the moon has a human face right before the astronomers land there, and they land directly in the eye of the moon. The size of the ship grows dramatically in size once they reach it, and the men have no problem walking perfectly fine, and breathing oxygen. Since there is obviously oxygen on the moon, there can obviously be random explosions. Some of these ideas stem from child hood beliefs and myths about the moon, such as the moon is made out of cheese, or Martians live there. This makes me wonder how much of this film the people of 1902 took seriously, or believed it was at least a possibility of what landing on the moon might be like. Today it is easy for us to look at this movie and think how silly, stupid, unrealistic, it seems, but I can't help but think that on some level they may have believed that the moon might really function in such a science fiction way. The most fascinating part of "A Trip to the Moon" is when the group of men encounter the moon inhabitants. This meeting of a new culture, or species in this case, reflects how modern societies have encountered and dealt with non modern cultures throughout history, an example is the United States and Native Americans. They are met by these strange people and the first reaction the men have is to destroy them because they are scared. The men are taken to the leader and they narrowly escape. Yet that escape is just the beginning of more men coming back to the moon to modernize it in the future, and in their mind make it better. Overall a funny yet silly flick with decent editing work for the year 1902. For this viewer the message is clear, things are not what they appear. The world is not flat, and Martians do not live on the moon, but until you go there how can we ever know the truth. My Rating: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For my 1902nd review, cinematic pioneer Georges Méli?s' A Trip to the Moon (1902), the silent classic featuring that iconic image of an unhappy moon with a shell lodged in its eye. Based on Jules Verne's De la Terre ? la Lune, the film sees a group of astronomers travel to the moon inside a large bullet fired from a huge cannon; once safely on the moon's surface, the scientists explore the terrain and discover a strange race of creatures called the Selenites (portrayed by acrobats from the Folies-Bergere).I feel like something of a philistine for not absolutely adoring Méli?s' A Trip To The Moon: it's an undeniably important work in terms of furthering the art of movie-making, introducing such techniques as cuts and fades, but this classic of fantastical cinema made far less of an impact on me than I expected it to. While the stylised, surreal look of the film is certainly unique, its two dimensional stage scenery and painted backdrops making it feel like an intricate pop-up fairy-tale book featuring live actors, the structure of the narrative, the performances and certain technical aspects left me wanting.I found much of the action fairly dull and repetitive, particularly the first of several protracted, frustratingly static shots?a bunch of wizard-like astronomers waving their arms around?a scene which I imagine would have been even more dreary if it hadn't been for the English narration pointing out details I would have otherwise missed. I understand that Méli?s' static camera technique was probably due to technical limitations of the day, but it does reduce A Trip To The Moon to little more than an elaborate stage production captured on film. The exaggerated performances add to this stagy feel, and the crude special effects do little to help.For the opportunity to witness several examples of iconic movie imagery in context, and for its naive turn-of-the-century charm, the film is definitely worth watching (it is, after all, not that long), but I cannot for the life of me understand all of the rave reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Melies' "A Trip to the Moon" is the earliest piece of movie cinema that I have seen to date. A popular movie of its day created back in 1902 in France, the twelve minute short film quickly tells the story of a group of astronomers and their aspiration and triumph of traveling to the moon and back. Although it is a short film George Melies does a great job of taking a simple idea of traveling to the moon and putting it into a short film that easily tells the plot and story line of the idea that he wanted to get across to those that view it. Though the film would be considered quite crude in comparison to Science Fiction movies of today one cannot help but get caught up in the somewhat humorous, homemade like and primitive "Lost in Space" impression that comes across while watching this early black and white short film. Dubbed the first science fiction movie in movie cinema one can see how science fiction movies throughout time have grown and adapted ideas as well as themes from George Melies' "A Trip to the Moon".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short and unimpressive, but more important than you'd believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this whole film on Tuesday as the primer for a courseon science fiction. Some might question this 14-minute short'svalue as a sci-fi piece, but it does have all the important elements.Allow me to explain.For instance, there's the very concept itself - "a trip to the moon".This was heady stuff at the time, considering the first mannedflight experiments (via the Wright brothers) had only just begun in1902. And Melies' conception of how this might be achieved, bybeing shot from a giant gun barrel in a hollow bullet, was probablythe most plausible way to achieve space travel back then. Thedirector even briefly goes into detail on how the gun barrel mightbe constructed, with a very impressive stage set depicting amassive foundry that belches steam and smoke as the huge dieis cast - and, perhaps unwittingly, setting the stage in a largersense for the century of innovation that was to come. (Somehow, Idoubt that magician-turned-cinematographer Melies had such loftygoals in mind at the time, but one never knows.)Then there's the early conception of what space must be like.Since there would be no significant research into the ways ofspace travel until the 1950s, the whole thing was pretty much up inthe air. Thus, Melies could only base his ideas on what he'dalready seen - Earth. So we have a Moon that is mainly a dark andfeatureless desert (although with some intriguing geologicalformations) and where breathable oxygen is in abundance. You'llnote also that the "astronomers" dress as any good scientistwould have back then - in formal eveningwear.The Moon, of course, is the focal point here. People wanted toknow what it would be like, and Melies let them know the truth ashe saw it - again, based on Earthbound conceptions. Thus wehave the first appearance in film of "moon men", "aliens from outerspace" or whatever you'd call them. In any case, the astronomersare unsurprisingly bewildered by them and fail to deal with them ina productive way at first - but I shan't ruin the outcome for you.Now, down to the bottom line. What we have here is not so much agreat film or even a classic, but an experiment (and not just at theon-screen level). This film was more of a chance to see how farthe medium could move away from reality, and the idea of goinganywhere beyond Earth was as whacked-out as you could get atthe time. People loved it, and as mentioned before, the die wasnow cast. After this point, filmmakers went ever farther and soughtto amaze and delight the viewer at every possible opportunity. Bysimply going through some of the later cinematic creationscataloged in this website, it's easy to tell whether or not theysucceeded.One thing is very clear, however. Without this tiny bit of filmedmadness, I might not have had a website upon which to commenton the movies at all. Remember that when you watch Episode II.Highly recommended - 8 of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine napping under a blanket on the surface of the moon, dreaming of beautiful star- women as snow begins to fall from the sky. Imagine a battle with aliens fought--and won-- using only umbrellas as weapons. Georges Méli?s' groundbreaking short silent film, A Trip to the Moon, allowed the viewing public to open its collective mind to such fantastic images when it was released in 1902. A Trip to the Moon was, by most accounts, the natal attempt to bring special effects to the movie screen, essentially expanding on Lumi?re's previous work by bringing in a fantastic element of his own using "masks, multiple exposure, superimposition as a means of summoning ghosts, the lap-dissolve, etc." (Braudy and Cohen 148). In doing so, Méli?s created films that approach the storytelling cinema with which we are familiar today. In Méli?s film, the prisoner (played by Méli?s himself) seeks to redeem himself by leading a trip to the moon. His attempt is ill-fated, however. In going to the moon, he leaves one political imbroglio to find himself in another. Although he saves the party from the Selenite king, they ultimately attempt to leave him behind and he is forced to ride back to Earth on the outside of the space capsule. Labeled as a satire, it seems as if this activity could be a commentary about the French politics as they existed at the time. However, the use of Follies girls and the playful bow that the cast members back at the audience suggest that the story is little more than the fantasy for which Méli?s was known. While this film was instrumental in opening new areas of cinema to the public, it is possible that Méli?s did not go far enough in his innovation. While his special effects were astounding for the period in which they were developed, at no time did he attempt to move his camera to bring new perspectives to his audience (Braudy and Cohen). While the moving camera seems natural to viewers today, the innovation might have proved too difficult to use and create the smooth edits and special effects that Méli?s chose to use in telling his story. Regardless of its faults, Georges Méli?s created a unique file that told an amazing tale never before seen by the viewing public. His innovations brought films closer to the narrative cinema with which we are now familiar and quite possibly launched the science fiction film genre. It is not surprising that his name is still known today, despite the century that has passed since much of his work was presented to the world.Work Cited Braudy, Leo and Marshall Cohen.

		<shortDescription>A Trip to the Moon- Adventurous and Comical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The short film, A Trip to the Moon by Georges Méli? was I thought comical and revolutionary for its time period (since the golden age of science fiction movies did not start really start until the 1940's and 50's).Méli?s' film I think reflected the ideas of space and astronomy of the late 19th and early 20th century. For example: the moon having a face, and the moons gooey surface. The scene with the aliens, I thought was very modern for 1902, although the costumes were very basic in nature. Georges Méli? showed the aliens as being hostile which, I think shows some similarity to present day movies i.e. Predator.Overall, I thought the short film by Georges Méli? was funny but not very realistic. While watching the film, it made me think about how far the film industry has come from the movie generation of flying saucers attached to strings to the science fiction movies like Star Wars, which we have today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is called the most important film in cinema history, in fact, it is the first in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. The story sees a group of astronomers/explorers plan a trip to the moon, getting into a bullet shaped rocket, and being fired from a large cannon. The iconic image of the film is the rocket in the eye of the moon, and when they get out of the rocket they face moon creatures called Celenites who capture them, but they quickly escape, get back in the rocket, and it drops into the ocean (on Earth I presume) and get dragged by a boat to face glory (or whatever). This film may be shaky, black and white, have cheap looking effects, and be only 14 minutes long, but it is important for many reasons. It invented the Genre (in this case, science fiction), it invented cutaways and fades, and it was the first film to have a real story, all before were just single moments, e.g. a train pulling into a station (which of course terrified people back in 1896), so if you can find it you should definitely watch it. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an old movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw, maybe the most horrible movie I have ever seen. OK maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration. I just saw the movie A Trip to the Moon; which came out in 1902. My first thought about this movie was that it is, "bad." It was not the cinematics about the movie that made it bad, because I do understand that it came out over a hundred years ago. It was the writing; and people have been writing for quite some time now. There were so many inconsistencies all through the movie. I am going to look past the scientific flaws. Back in 1904 not everybody new we could not breathe on the moon or it took more than some high powered canon to get us there. But what bothers me is the Selenite, the moon inhabitants. The astronomers have no trouble destroying the Selenites by hitting them with their umbrellas. When the Selenites are struck they explode into a powdery mess. What I do not like is that fact that the director has the Selenites jumping around like apes. If all it takes is a small whack by an umbrella how come they do not explode when jumping around the set. I do like the soundtrack of the movie. It really helps make the movie a little more enjoyable and plays very nicely with the actions of the movie. Like I said this movie was made over one hundred years ago and was created by a French director. Not only is it crossing time but nationality. I do not care for the movie at all. If I was alive back than I would have probably loved it, but I was born during this time and like movies that are a longer, more dialogue, more cinematics and just more in general. Give me a Spider Man movie. Give me Shrek. Give me The Terminator. Give me whatever just nothing made past the 1970's.</fullReview>
