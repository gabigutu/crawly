		<shortDescription>A Boy and His Dolphin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flipper is an exceedingly pleasant, modest picture about a boy and his dolphin, and features easygoing, natural performances from Luke Halpin, as the boy, and Chuck Connors, as his rugged, seafaring father. The film is the first in the franchise that led eventually to a popular TV show. Producer Ivan Tors, who was also the man behind the Sea Hunt series on television, struck gold again with this one, a nice alternative at the time (and now) to the prevailing Disney family fare. It's hard to pinpoint how this and other Tors projects differ from what the Disney studio was making. The kids are a bit less goody two-shoes, the grownups more realistic. One doesn't have the virtual insurance that nearly every Disney film at the time offered that everything would work out in the end, so the moments of suspense and danger have a real edge. Flipper, by the way, has a real personality, and has a way of making you care for him. For those who care for the sea, marine life or just simple movies about kids and animals, this one's a darn good show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cut-rate aquatic adventure, but matinée audiences didn't seem to mind...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A plague in the waters off the Florida Keys has left fisherman Chuck Connors and his son scrambling to make a living; luckily, a dolphin rescued by young Luke Halpin seems to understand their predicament and leads the boy to fresh fish. Rather dingily-produced underwater tale for kids has a thin plot (with echoes of "The Yearling" besides), but does have a marvelous animal at its center. The acting, photography, and editing are all disappointing, but when Flipper is doing tricks for the locals--even interacting with a swimming dog--it's hard not to smile. Too bad the relationship between the boy and his parents is so stiff (with lots of homilies and fearsome dialogue) that the movie drags whenever Flipper is off-screen. Followed by a sequel and a TV-series. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this on TCM and watched it mainly for the nostalgia value. Though I'm 54 now, I still find a lot to like in "Flipper." I enjoyed the small-town hominess of life in the Keys, the traditional values of Sandy's parents, the boy's independence and sense of responsibility, and of course bare-chested Chuck Conners's buff physique. "Flipper" captured Hurricane Hazel quite effectively and it was a pleasure to see how the community joined together to get through a crisis. Of course the friendship between Sandy and Flipper is the heart of the film, and while some of the plot twists were a bit repetitious and predictable, the story still satisfies. However, I was in the minority in my home. "I hated it with every bone in my body," griped my 13-year-old son. "It was stupid. It was so lame," said my 7-year-old. Oh well. I tried. Maybe "Flipper" can't compete with computer games, but it still has a lot to recommend it. And the theme song still rocks!"?Everyone loves the king of the sea?No one you see is smarter than he..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously--how can you hate this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A "red plague" has hit the Florida Keys and fisherman Porter Ricks (Chuck Connors) and son Sandy (Luke Halpin) can't find fish to make a living. But Sandy saves a dolphin from dying and they became buddies. (I know I know--but this IS a kids film). Flipper (as the kid names him) leads them to a place with plenty of fish and saves Sandy from a killer shark (stop smirking!).OK--the plot is ridiculous and the same shots are used a LOT but it's really hard to hate this film. The underwater photography is impressive and Flipper himself is so cute he's hard to resist. Despite the totally stupid plot I found myself grinning whenever Flipper did cute things like jump out of the water or "talk" to the kid. Also Connors is surprisingly good as a tough (but nice) father and Halpin is easily one of the most likable child actors I've ever seen. He's nice and friendly--he acts just like a kid would. I admit the title song (first played about an hour in) is hysterically bad but I sort of enjoyed it. This is a perfect kids movie--especially if they love animals. I know not everyone loves dolphins but I do and I found this silly movie quite enjoyable. I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Sandy Met Flipper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chuck Connors (as Porter Ricks) lives on the Florida coast, with his 12-year-old son Luke Halpin (as Sandy), and wife Kathleen Maguire (as Martha). Following a hurricane, son Halpin goes to bail out a dingy; and, he is startled when a dolphin jumps out... it's Flipper! As it introduces an enduring franchise, the first "Flipper" effortlessly overcomes its flaws; mainly, parts that go on too long, and look more repetitive and ordinary in hindsight. The catchy theme song, for example, will soon be improved upon, and given its logical place over the credits. The film opens with an exciting hurricane, and features beautiful location and underwater photography throughout. If you know Flipper, the film offers many origin story "firsts", topped by the meeting of Sandy and Flipper. Pete the Pelican is around, along with many familiar elements. The Ricks family line-up is different, however; mother Maguire is present, but no Bud.The "Flipper" character is played by "Mitzie", and others, undoubtedly. The "A Boy and His Dolphin" concept is terrific, and the Flipper character retains its integrity through ensuing years. Halpin is very cute, and seems to improve his performance over the run of the film; his cavorting scenes are charming. Mr. Connors and Ms. Maguire are great parents - they make up much more natural family than expected. Joe Higgins (who also appears in the next "Flipper") and Jane Rose (who also appears in the first "Dark Shadows") are among the supporting players. Note that Connors' friend, who dies during the hurricane, is mentioned as "not of our faith"; this add some depth to the film. ******** Flipper (8/14/63) James B. Clark ~ Chuck Connors, Luke Halpin, Kathleen Maguire</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even though the scenes are used over and over again, it's still a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if you have a dolphin in your fish pen, you're probably the richest kid in the world.After a hurricane blasts through a small town in Florida, Sandy Ricks and his dad go out to clean out a ship. While Sandy bails water out of the lifeboat, a dolphin jumps out of nowhere and scares him to death. After awhile, this dolphin watches him carefully. it's a few days later he and his friend go out for a swim, and you'll see what happens if you see the movie.This movie had a lot of good creators behind it. the idea to watch and take pictures of flipper underwater was pretty darn good for those days. although some of those scenes were played over and over again, the movie is still good.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has its moments but mostly quite dull.After a huge storm ravages a seaside community, a boy befriends a dolphin.And that pretty much is the story. There are some side plots and escapades but it is fairly straightforward and dull. Even silly sometimes. There are some cute moments however, and these are the only things that sustain the movie. Performances are mostly lacklustre. Luke Halpin is okay(ish) as the boy - not as irritating as many actors of that age. The adult performances are mostly quite flat. Mitzie the dolphin (as Flipper) easily gives the most convincing performance in the movie...Not even sure kids will enjoy this much. Other than the scenes involving the dolphin there's not much to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad I missed this as a kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the Flipper TV series re-runs as a kid unaware of this movie that effectively kicked the entire Flipper franchise off. I discovered the movies quite by accident on TCM and they were a pleasant surprise.The first Flipper movie seems to catch the simple but hurricane fraught life in the Florida Keys in the early 1960s. The movie portrays a more spartan and difficult life for the Ricks family and neighbors than the more placid and prosperous life on display in the NBC TV series. Porter Ricks is more austere (played by Chuck Connors) and a fisherman versus the warmer all-American Park Ranger character played by Brian Kelly in the sequel movie and the TV series. The first movie has a Mrs Ricks (Kathleen McGuire) who dies by the time of the sequel movie filmed one year later. Likewise in the Flipper movies there is only the one child - Sandy (Luke Halpin) and no younger brother whereas by the TV series, the younger brother Bud (Tommy Norden) mysteriously appears. Luke Halpin is the only actor who played in both the Flipper movies AND the TV series (a career as one character spanning 5 years).So setting aside the evolution of the Flipper franchise, the first movie sets the scene for the enduring relationship between the dolphin and the boy. Seeing the movie after exposure to the TV series meant the first two thirds of the movie seemed to drag before we get to how Sandy came to have Flipper as his pet. Porter Rick's occupation as a fisherman plays a role in the plot as the finding then the fate of fish becomes intertwined with Flipper.The real draw card of this movie is how Flipper and Sandy become so bonded. Halpin is compelling as he persuades his gruff father to accept this bond. Luke Halpin was cast in the role of 12 year old Sandy Ricks at the age of 15 after 7 years of extensive TV and Broadway stage experience. Producer Ivan Tors was impressed by Halpin's acting history but was unsure if he was up to the intensive water related work the movie required. A quick trip to a YMCA pool near Halpin's Long Island, NY home proved Halpin's claim of water sport proficiency. By all reports, Halpin bonded quickly with the temperamental dolphins - a bond that Halpin described some 7 years later in a magazine interview that was so strong that both he and the dolphins would get homesick for each other after filming of a movie or TV series ended. The chemistry of this bond really makes this movie and overcomes the slow parts and the tendency of the story to drag.This Flipper movie carved an intriguing and popular niche that led to a sequel movie (Flipper's New Adventure) and then the popular TV series in quick succession. Tors was a master at underwater photography which was showcased by the move to full color. Halpin combined a depth of acting talent honed from many previous roles, a real affinity and skill at water related sports, a swimmer's physique and telegenic good looks with the chemistry with the dolphins. These factors along with the filming in the Florida Keys (which lent a rough tropical realism to the story lines) and the refining of underwater photography and the various trained moves of the dolphins laid the foundations for an endearing series that is still in syndication 50 years later. My younger kids and nephews/nieces really loved the movie so it still has a strong pull all these years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our friends in the sea the dolphins get their due in this family film about a young boy who saves a dolphin and the dolphin returns the favor. Succinctly put that is the plot of Flipper.Enough has been studied and written about how next to humans, the dolphin is the most intelligent creature on this planet, some might opt the dolphin is more intelligent. You can sure prove it by what you see with this particular dolphin.Chuck Connors and Kathleen Maguire are the parents of Luke Halpin. Connors is a commercial fisherman, but a fish plague of sorts has decimated the fish population in his fishing grounds and those of the other fishermen. Making matters worse a hurricane appears as the film opens and Connors and Halpin have to beat it back to shore in the Florida Keys.They make it, but the boat is severely damaged. While Connors looks to scrounge up work, Luke saves the life of a stranded dolphin who is on the beach with a spear in him. Pretty soon he's teaching him all kinds of tricks, but dolphins do eat a lot of fish and fish are scarce at this time.I think you can see where this is all going. Doesn't detract from the fact that Flipper became one of the most popular family films of all time spawning two more films and a four year run television series all with Luke Halpin. By the time Flipper got to TV Halpin had grown a bit and his voice changed. His father's profession had changed from fisherman to park ranger and he was played by Brian Kelly. He also lost his mother and gained a younger brother. And Halpin became a bubblegum teen idol of the first order.But for this original film the underwater photography was of Oscar type caliber and the acting chemistry between Halpin and the dolphin was good and unique. In fact some years ago I read that Halpin got the part for his swimming ability.After 50 years Flipper holds up quite well for family viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for the family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got this movie as part of a "Four Family Favorites" DVD set (also has Shiloh, Duma and The Amazing Panda Adventure).I had remembered loving the movie as kid and my son of 5 loves it just as much as I did. Sure it is not high tech or the best acting in the world, but to a child it is a fun movie. My son has watched it about 4 times over the last six months since we have had it.The story had good points for both parents and kids. And although it touches on some points that may be over their heads, it flows quick enough to keep them entertained. If your child loves animals, they will enjoy this movie a lot :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite different movie through modern eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flipper is a very old movie, released in 1963. Though I have always been fascinated by dolphins, and even worked as a dolphin researcher, I never saw the movie, put off by that silly "King of the Sea" song. The movie is much better than I expected. It was done before animatronics and CGI, yet the stunts were completely believable. I worry that they were not stunts, but actual animal cruelty done in the days before SPCA oversight.The father, played by Chuck Connors, is authoritarian. He never asks what happened in his absence; he tells everyone. No one dares contradict him. He likes to grab his wife and kiss her unexpectedly and passionately, reminiscent of a Siamese fighting fish. I detested him, but he was a typical movie father for the era.The hero is what I took to be a 10 year old boy from his height, later revealed in the dialogue to be 12, and played by a 15-year old actor, Luke Halpin. The boy, Sandy, is ridiculously docile by modern standards, and obsequiously does whatever father wants without complaint. Sandy is still every boy's hero, skilled, brave, outgoing, strong, handsome, respected by the community, trusted to run his own boat and fishing nets. Sandy has an erotic obsession with a male dolphin (played by a female dolphin to help tone down the obviousness of the mutual arousal). His parents pretend not to notice, pretending all that bumping and grinding is just cute.There are a few things that don't make sense in the movie. For the first half of the movie, Sandy and an adoring younger girl whom he ignores are the only people his age in the vicinity. Then in one scene suddenly dozens of children appear, and sing that idiotic "King of the Sea" song then disappear again. It is just totally out of place. The song belongs in some animated short for toddlers or in a commercial to sell inflatable dolphin toys.I was rather distressed by the "tricks" scene when they got Flipper to perform various fetch tricks, treating him as if he were a dog. Dolphins have bigger brains than we do, but you would never guess from that silly dog and pony show. They tossed an dachshund into the ocean with Flipper. To me the dog look panicked and could not get out of the enclosure, and tried climbing on Flipper's back to avoid drowning. This was all treated as great fun.Sandy lives shirtless outdoors in the Florida sun on the ocean all day. Yet he never gets a sunburn or even a dark tan. Nobody ever reminds him to put on sun screen. I worried about the actor and whether making that film would have lead to skin cancer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife loved this show. I always hated it. My wife thought the dolphin was cute. I just could not understand how the kid knew what the dolphin was saying. EEEEEEWha just sounded like gibberish. Anyways as a kid I liked police shows more. My wife is a animal lover. If you love animals then give this show a 9. If you love police shows give this show a 3. A 6 out of 10 is a good rating. Many people like the Flipper song. Was the show filmed in Florida? My Cockatoo Teddy would like the Flipper noises. My bird probably could make those noises too. Maybe they will make a show about a Cockatoo next? Who solves mysteries? My wife would watch it!</fullReview>
