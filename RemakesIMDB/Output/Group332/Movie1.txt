		<shortDescription>Should be mandatory viewing for those who rip on Sly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This got some of the best reviews of any recent Stallone film, and after seeing it, I understand why. It's an absolutely hilarious, wonderful movie that shows one of Sly's best performances, and a great supporting cast. It was a long time before I got around to seeing it, but man, am I glad I did. I haven't laughed this much in a long time. And to those of you who jump on the negative hype bandwagon and make fun of Stallone like a bunch of lemmings, check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nearly perfect comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent timing, a fantastic cast, great soundtrack... actually, everything about this movie is terrific. It centers around mixed (and missed) messages, so a lot of it depends upon timing and straight delivery. These are accomplished in a major way.The main center of the comedy, the valise, gets treated in a way that gets a bit old, but overall, I can't get tired of this movie. Stallone does such fantastic comedy and has such an exquisite sense of timing and delivery, it's a wonder anybody lets him do action movies. He missed his calling. Look for Ornella Muti (Princess Aura from "Flash Gordon") as the superb, dignified, and fiery-tempered Sophia, as Snaps' wife and source of fear for the entire cast, and Tim Curry as Dr. Poole, in a genius turn as a mild-mannered professor discovering love for the first time. It's a fairly obscure movie, but if you get the chance to see it, do treat yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love Sly, if you love comedy, if you love gangster films, then this one's for you! It's got all that &amp; more! Marisa Tomei playing Sly's daughter?? It works! The beautiful Italian import, Ornella Muti playing Sly's wife? It works! Chazz Palminteri playing a hood yet once again? That always works! Whatcha got here is 1 Mob Boss (the ever-elegant Sly) tryin' to go straight 'cuz he promised his dying father (Kirk Douglas's cameo), cops who just won't buy it, bankers who can't stand it, a mix-up with "a little black bag", a search for a husband for Sly's daughter, an annoying accountant who skims $$$ off the top to marry Sly's "other daughter, the one that's not Lisa", &amp; this all happens in ONE MORNING!! Ya gotta feel sorry for the guy! How can he cope? He does it - just as Sly as he can be, too!Buy this one if you can still find it. It's a comedy of 'great ethnic proportions'!</fullReview>

One of whom wants to marry the father's other daughter who isn't his daughter............don't even get me started on the 3 bags of money/jewels/knickers.I could watch this film over and over again.

		<fullReview>This movie was a great one you can laugh really hard and not care who's around. If the words "Yes Boss" don't get you laughing then i don't know what will. Tim Curry is notorious for comedy or just being a bad guy in alot of movie but he did an excellent job in this movie with slyvester Stallone. This movie has alot of laughter great characters and a really good unique story line that you don't see very often. Yes indeed the story get's a little confusing but you can't help but love the era of the movie and the way everyone's does so well with their characters.

		<fullReview>This is maybe one of the best comedies I have seen. The whole story is nothing much, but the actors made it it unforgettable. The thing that makes this movie so good is the cast, the actors are really perfectly chosen and they play it really well. There isn't a one single actor who doesn't play good in this movie. Well if you expect Stalone to shoot out crates of ammo, then you will be disappointed. This is the movie that made me realize that Sylvester Stalone can act not just shoot. With two words this is a movie to make you laugh. Tip: if you have a heart condition you probably shouldn't watch this movie without some medical personal attending.(your heart may burst from laughing)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very selective about the movies I buy for my personal library, and this one passed. The whole movie takes place between 8:30 a.m. and 12:00 noon, and the twists and complications never stop. It's packed with memorable one-liners and hilarious images: former hit-men being butlers and making fruit salad, a linguist (Tim Curry) whose unsolicited grammar corrections keep getting misunderstood, the melodramatic daughter (Marisa Tomei) of a gangster named after a cheese.Few movies carry this many successive gut laughs. It's quite an ab workout. It's also comparitively clean&amp;mdash;five or six swear words and some allusions to premarital pregnancy and activities. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, underrated film... rent it! (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll get the bad stuff out of the way right now: This movie is somewhat predictable and Sly mugs for the camera too much.That's it. That's all the bad stuff I could think of to say about this movie. The rest is all good.People tend to react with disbelief when they hear about a comedy starring Sylvester Stallone. While I'm not sure about the range of Sly's comedic abilities, "Oscar" proves that he CAN do comedy, and given the right part, can do it very well.Sly plays Angelo "Snaps" Provolone, a mob boss who promises to his dying father to give up the crime racket for good. The movie focuses on the morning in which "Snaps" is preparing to join the ranks of a bank administration at noon. During that morning, his daughter gets engaged... three times. She also reveals that she's pregnant... except she's not. "Snaps" repeatedly loses and regains $100,000 dollars... and a bag of women's underwear. And then there's his "other" daughter who's not (he thinks) really his daughter. Behind him all the way are his flunkies, reduced from robbing banks to scooping melon balls, and incapable of breaking the habit of calling him "boss" if their lives depended on it.Kudos for expert scene theft go to Peter Riegert as the shifty Aldo, Marisa Tomei as the spoiled brat Lisa Provolone, Martin Ferrero and Harry Shearer as the Finucci brothers and Tim Curry as the unctuous Dr. Thorntone Poole.The critics panned this movie. Rent it anyway and find out just how wrong they were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidden gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1991 release,featuring Sly Stallone's first all-on comedy role since the legendarily panned "Rhinestone" (Unless you count "Tango and Cash" as a comedy,which to me wouldn't be entirely accurate)is a film that got lost in the shuffle of his large cannon of movies(many of which earned him a reputation for being someone who either chose bad film scripts or actually hurt the material he chose to do). That,to me,seems highly unfair,for this movie is a pleasant treat. A nutty comedy that plays like an English farce."Snaps"Provolone(Stallone) promises his dying father that he will quit the gangster business and become legit. On the morning he is to go to work on the board of trustees at a large bank,he is confronted by a number of problems. I won't go into the specifics so as to a)not spoil the plot and b)conserve on writing space,as the movie uses farce devices to full advantage. The principle obstacles include his embezzling accountant(Anthony Spano),his bored and temperamental daughter(Marisa Tomei,pre-"My Cousin Vinny"),his scheming maid(Jocelyn O'Brien),his high-strung wife(Ornella Muti,ravishing),the rival gangsters who are bucking to take over his action,the feds that are watching Snaps' every move and his henchmen(Chazz PAlminteri and Peter Riegert,both fantastic!). Thrown into the mix is a erudite but not-unsympathetic diction instructor(Tim Curry),tailor brothers(MArtin Ferrero and Harry Shearer)who figure prominently in the morning's events somehow,a woman claiming to be his daughter(Elizabeth Barondes)and a new maid(Dallas'Sue Ellen,Linda Gray). Kirk Douglas' cameo as Stallone's dying father was VERY choice as well.John Landis,an ace in terms of nailing comedy devices,either is a great fit for this adaptation or his direction is able to bring the best out of everyone involved,particularly Stallone,who shows that he CAN put his name behind a watchable,entertaining film that doesn't involve excessive(if any)violence. A great cheap rent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has become one of my all-time favorites.Sylvester Stallone and most of the rest of the cast aren't especially known for comedic acting, but they all pull it off brilliantly. The most well know comedy actor in the group, Tim Curry, plays one of his funniest characters on screen.The stars of the movie should all consider doing more of this genre, especially Stallone! I don't understand how anyone can see this movie, and even if they're not crazy about it, at least appreciate the great comic timing each actor brings to their role, not to mention, all the very funny throw-in lines that grace the dialogue.Don't limit actors like Stallone and Chazz Palminterri to action or heavy drama. Fans should always try to embrace new things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what people expects from a movie. Oscar seems to me a very, very good comedy. Unjustly forgotten by critics, determined to condemn Stallone to don't have success in comedy roles. Afterwards, they'll have reason. Not in Oscar. Hilarious screenplay, good rhythm, amazing performances, clever dialogs, the briefcase game is worthy to great 50's comedy masters. The work of John Landis is -as usual- perfect directing actors. He's surrounded to a constellation of great actors and actresses, that confer a solid environment to action development. I love this film. If you are able to forget your prejudice about Stallone, you'll enjoy this magnificent and solid playacting.Nacho Garcia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's Little Antony, and his Imperial." So says Pete Reigert when he opens the door for Victor Spano, behind whom is a beautiful classic Imperial. Although as the "goofs" paragraph says its a off time joke, it's a double entendre intended for the audience. Reigert says it straight and is referring to the car.This is a great little film and Sly is surprisingly good as a hood trying to go straight. My favorite characters were the tailors, the Fanucci Brothers, played by Martin Ferrero, and Harry Shearer. A truly delightful performance, and a magnificent portrayal.Virtually everything about this movie works and works well. Stallone sometimes overplays the part, and another superior actor, someone like James Caan, might have done it better, but Stallone was very good for the most part. I love this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie so much. It has everything a comedy of errors should have, and John Landis did a great job directing this. The script was very good indeed. A little predictable at times, as a lot of the jokes are repeated, but it is all very solid, and I loved the play-like structure of the story. The bag routine had me in stitches; the only other time that has happened to me, was in Clue, which is also a must-see. This movie is laden with cameos, from famous faces such as Don Ameche, Eddie Bracken and Kurtwood Smith. Who can forget that priceless cameo from Kirk Douglas. Sylvester Stallone is surprisingly good here, much better than he was in Stop, Or My Mum Will Shoot, which I won't describe other than to say it is easily forgettable. In fact this is by far and away his BEST comedy. The "Don't call me boss"line is just as funny as the bags routine. Ornella Muti and Marissa Tomei play fiery young women amusingly, and Peter Riegert plays Aldo to perfection. Vincent Spano plays a suitably ambiguous character, but the acting honours without doubt belong to Chazz Palminteri and Tim Curry. Chazz Palminteri is just so adorable as Connie, and the way Provolone treated him was quite horrible.("It's like disarming Germany.") Tim Curry doesn't appear until halfway through, and whilst he is not as funny as he was in Clue, his turn of Dr. Poole is genius, especially when his grammatical errors get misunderstood. Also superb were the lush and beautifully rendered costumes and sets, asides from the acting and the costumes, Elmer Bernstein's score was a treat. From the charming puppet sequence featuring Largo Al Factotum from Rossini's masterpiece Barber of Seville, to the love theme, to the wedding scene, I loved it. Also it was so musical with what the actors were doing on screen. A must-see, and for those of you who haven't seen it, are seriously missing out, and those of you who hated it need your heads examined, for I know a good comedy when I see one, and this is it! NOTE: in the United Kingdom, it is very hard to find, and it has never been shown on TV. But I did manage to get it on DVD, before it became literally non-existent. 10/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a barrel of laughs from start to finish! My first reaction to a Stallone comedy was "Are you kidding?", but he really is funny. From the opening scene, at his father's deathbed, we are taken on a wild ride through a plot with more twists than the best roller coasters, great slapstick humor, and some of the quirkiest characters in film. Part of the charm is that none of the characters seem to realize just how funny they really are. The straight faces through some of the craziest scenes makes me long for an outtake reel! The timing is out of this world, the costumes are wonderful for the period, and true classic car fans will drool over some of the automobiles in the film. If you want a totally entertaining, very non-serious, fun film, this is one you'll want to see. Just be ready for sore ribs from the laughter. I was actually rolling on the floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so funny. I've seen it over 10 times and I still laugh every single time. Some say it's predictable, but that's the beauty of it. This movie is a parody, not meant to be taken seriously. The humor is very dry, so many won't get it. I think it's the perfect combination of the mafia and comedy. The jokes that poke fun at Sylvester just show what a great sense of humor he has. I love the lines, "Don't call me boss." "OK boss." And "little Ant'ny and his imperial". I mean, seriously, how funny is that? Again, not a lot of people will like that kind of humor but I've grown up with it throughout my entire family. I love the little guy in the opening credits singing opera. It's the perfect opening, showing that this is a comedy, not a movie concerned with action and lots of mafia and mobsters. I highly recommend this movie to everyone that likes dry humor.</fullReview>

I remember when it came out it didn't do well, and since we didn't make a whole of money, we went to see it at the Byrd, a second run theatre. I think it was the best $3.00 we ever spent at the movies. My daughter, who is 32 years old, still watches our VHS copy. Our 11 year old granddaughter thinks it's funny.

Probably Stallone's best opportunity to break away from the Rambo and Rocky images, this is one of the most enjoyable, pleasant, family entertaining movies ever made.Where is should be a classic, it was deep-shelved and removed from any video, DVD or online streaming lists. But as the movie's own tag-line said: "In crime and comedy, timing is everything".While Stallone takes center stage, this beautifully arranged supporting staff, wonderfully done cinematography and brilliantly written script make this a movie for the masses that should have had a 2nd and 3rd life in video and DVD sales... and would be one of the most viewed videos on Netflix given the chance.Just the sound bytes of Tim Curry's Dr. Thornton Poole, Peter Riegert's Aldo, Chazz Palminteri's Friendly thug Connie...If you don't catch yourself off guard laughing and this fast moving quippy dialog, you are missing your humor gene.</fullReview>

This may sound chaotic, but the plot flows and you get just enough of each character to feel satisfied.If you need a good family film with lots of laughs Oscar won't disappoint.

What's up Doc? is a wonderful example but hands down the best "bag" movie is Oscar. The bags that make the rounds in this movie add to the hilarity but do not overwhelm the plot, in the last part of the movie in particular the bags add to the frenetic pace and energy of the script. The excellent cast are up to the task of appearing in an ensemble and no one actor hogs the limelight.

		<fullReview>"Oscar" is one of Sylvester Stallone's finest films--definitely his best comedy. That's not to say he's a great comedic actor, but he's surrounded here by hilarious dialogue, really good comic actors, an amazingly intricate plot, sure direction, and wonderful period set pieces. A knowledge of French farce helps in understanding why this is such a good slapstick comedy, but not necessary. People forget that this movie was #1 in America for about three weeks when it debuted. Now, sadly, it's lumped with Stallone's bad comedies, "Rhinestone" and "Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot!" as examples of his inability to be funny. But do yourself a favor and check out this little gem of a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For once in this light-hearted comedy when Sly Stallone plays a gangster ('Snaps' Provalone), he really shows that he can act in comedy, and do it well! Marisa Tomei as Provalone's beautiful (slightly spoiled) daughter is fantastic too- &amp; her beautiful face and comedic good timing actually helps us see why George (in Seinfeld) Costanza fell soo much in love with her. Ornella Muti (Mrs Provalone) shows us a concerned mother and loving wife and is capable of being a strong foil to Stallone - so she has Snaps Provalone behaving like a proper dad to his family. Tim Curry is a gem as the elocution teacher, who tries to teach Provalone correct English grammar by explaining verbs &amp; oxymorons- so that when Snaps gets mad he says to his off- sider Connie- 'you are an ox &amp; a moron'. They all work well together &amp; the end product is a light happy story of gangsters who want to look respectable but still have to make lotsa money. All the smaller character parts fit together smoothly so the plot moves along effortlessly. The main plot from a play by Claude Magnier (a writer of French farces) evolves wonderfully to show the mix-up of the satchel bags that have either jewelery or the maid's underwear. All this is juxtaposed with the police bungling and raiding the Provalone's house to grab the bag of jewels &amp; ending up with the undies- this is very funny &amp; shows evidence of the tight directing from John Landis.I love this movie &amp; watch it on rainy days when the family want to be cheered-up and have a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kudos to the director. he managed to make Stallone seem like a great actor. - And he's not just passable in this, he's really excellent in his role. Who knew he could do comedy? (I mean, on purpose.)More importantly, this film not only takes place in the 1920's, but has much of the feel of a movie from that era. (well, close to that era, and sans the B&amp;W.) It feels a lot like a Cary Grant / Katherine Hepburn movie, with the lightning-fast jokes, quips and comebacks.The cast is perfect. the timing / editing are perfect. The jokes are spot-on and never insultingly stupid. I am surprised to find myself writing such a glowing review, because it's a pretty much meaningless script, but so what? I've seen this about 5 times on cable, and I still enjoy it completely. funny thing: Virtually every review on this site is exceedingly positive, yet it currently only has a 5.2 rating.

This outrageously funny crime comedy about a mob boss going straight (touched off by Kirk Douglas in a hilarious cameo as Stallone's father) is a throwback to the golden days of comedy, with plot contrivances piling on top of each other in glorious confusion.The movie starts out slowly, paralleling Stallone's slow wakeup perfectly. As the day moves on, providing more stress for 'Snaps' Provolone(Stallone), the pace picks up accordingly, barreling forward insistently to a gut-splitting finale.Director John Landis (Coming to America) has an innate sense of what's funny, and piles it on. The ensemble class steals the show, from Marisa Tomei's star turn as Snap's spoiled daughter to Chazz Palminteri's incredible turn as Connie. Tim Curry rounds out the cast as Snap's elocution professor. `I just wanna speak good,' Snaps confides. Other highlights are Peter Riegert, Don Ameche, Martin Ferroro and Harry Shearer as the Fenucci Brothers, and the wonderful Ornella Muti as Snap's shrill wife.This movie is a gem of a film. It pulls many tired clichés out of the closet, brushes the dust off them, and reinvents them into a fresh, new story, one that is immensely enjoyable and stands the test of multiple viewings. On a scale of five stars, this movie earns a seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All poor Angelo "Snaps" Provolone is trying to do is make good a deathbed promise to his father (portrayed snappily by Kirk Douglas): that he will give up a life of crime and go straight. But between his premature awakening at 8AM (by his scheming little accountant, portrayed with earnest pomposity by Vincent Spanos) and the noon meeting with equally scheming bankers, Snaps finds himself hopelessly tangled up with the cops, a rival gang, his pretending-to-be-pregnant daughter and her numerous willing and unwilling suitors, his first love, a priest, two tailors-turned-hitmen, the maid, his wife, and an assortment of henchmen who can't stop calling him "Boss." Tim Curry sparkles as the mousy Dr. Poole, and Chazz Palminteri plods along endearingly as the lovable lunk Connie. Pop up some popcorn, invite a few friends over, and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very old-fashioned, stagey farce, lotsa charm, pretty funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Landis pretty much makes two kinds of pictures - the ones he's really into, and the commercial ones he attempts to do a pro job on. This is obviously one of the former. Sylvester Stallone as farceur is a bizarre idea, but the lead role of wannabe reforming gangster 'Snaps' Provolone is built around his abilities and limitations, and it wouldn't be easy to think of a film where he's better than this. Basic idea is that 'Snaps' is trying to reform, but his gangster 'business' has a lot of ongoing loose ends, plus there's his gang, a rival one, the police, some 'straight' bankers he's trying to get involved with, a recalcitrant daughter, and five or six other catastrophes all going on at the same time. If the similarities to another revivalist screwball comedy "What's Up Doc" weren't evident enough, there's also a number of identical looking bags with widely diverse contents getting endlessly confused and turning up in the strangest places. It's that sort of farce, with engaging, ornate little eccentric characters, of which the show stealers are Harry Shearer and Martin Ferrero as gentle little tailors the Finuccis (who are mistaken for vicious mob hitmen), and Tim Curry walking off with hunks of the movie as a swish elocution teacher. Very very deliberate pacing may put some viewers off, though not me, and it does clearly show its stage-farce origins. A real one-off though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Dealt With Murderers But You Bankers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, this is the funniest Landis movie that people under forty probably have never heard about. The movie is a pure comedy with a gangster attempting to go legitimate to fulfill a vow to his dying father (great cameo by Kirk Douglas). The star of the movie is the great writing. Look, I am not a big Tim Curry fan. I thought he was awful in Home Alone 2, but he steals this movie completely. Wait until you see his rendering of an intellectual English teacher who is trying to 'improve' Snap's wild daughter played well by Tomei. Who will ever forget when he is told by Stallone that he cannot control her and Curry responds,"She has such lovely rounded diphthongs." Snaps responds,"I know that is what got her in trouble in the first place." The movie is a series of mistaken identities, an associate accountant running rings around Snaps, his poor henchmen not making either the transition to regular life or figuring out what the devil is going on in the mansion. The many interwoven mistaken daughters, the henchmen running around, with both the cops and a rival all monitoring Provolone, confused plenty of viewers who gave up. The story will swirl around you, the best way to enjoy it is to understand that it is a throwback to the old slapstick comedies of the 30's and 40's like The Lady Eve. The supporting cast is excellent, besides Curry, watch for Palmenteri who is my favorite flunkie who gets completely lost in the whirlwind of which daughter goes with whom and who is courting whom. By the end of the movie, he is close to a nervous breakdown. My favorite running gag is the money bags: one filled with priceless jewels to pay off the blackmailing former accountant, that is mixed with a bag of his daughter's underwear. Usually, Provolone is just about to conclude a deal with a bribe and he pours out his daughter's underwear in front of the crook. Landis knows how to make one good genre: comedy, when he mixes in action it never goes well (Into The Night). Here, he is in his element. Watch for great supporting actors like Ornella Muti (Flash Gordon) who gets progressively more and more violent as she becomes lost in the blizzard of her daughter is marrying whom? The movie's most quotable line, from my header, is near the end of the movie. Stallone looks at the room full of bankers,"You know I dealt with murderers, thieves and robbers but you bankers!" Yes, those of you who have worked with them will share the biggest laugh in the movie as Ken Howard, the Harvard type, takes slight offense at the slur.As your reviewer, the main warning is that this is complete slapstick with great writing and more twists and turns than a bag of pretzels. If you are expecting any serious drama, you will just hate the movie. I always thought it bombed because all the plot complications lost many people. It is not hard if you focus on the real daughter (Tomei) and the unknown second daughter. It pivots around these two women, if you lose sight of this, trust me, the movie will do a flyby on you. Stallone failed at other attempts to make a comedy (Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot), this one works. Landis is an impresario at comedy, the dialog is funny from the first frame until the very ending. There is a movie long running joke about guns falling out of the gang's pockets always provoking rage from Snaps. Reviewing comedy for you is easy, it made me laugh throughout the entire movie. There really are no dead spots here. Again, just worry about the two daughters and let the rest of the convolutions spin around you. Wait until Curry tells Connie that he left a participle dangling, he turns around and checks his fly. I loved all of Landis pure comedies even 3 Amigos. This is no exception, it will make you laugh the entire movie. An Underrated Treasure From A Great Director Of Comedies. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic cast. You'll laugh out loud. I haven't laughed this much in a long time. Sylvester did great in this comedy, he was really funny. The plot is great, it has twists, you keep on laughing the entire time.I haven't watched the original one so i don't know which one is better but I'm totally satisfied with this version, it has everything a great movie needs. I'll be honest with you I rarely find comedy movies worth watching (most of them just makes you laugh few times only) but this one takes comedy into new level.While watching it I kept on laughing my family got excited they wanted to watch it.I watch this movie whenever I feel down. This is maybe one of the best comedies I have seen. It's a must-see movie, way better than modern comedy movies.</fullReview>

Oscar is not one of Stallone's best and for sure not one that you are going to remember the next day the comedy looks forced and the acting sometimes over the top not bad just over the top but Stallone tho is easily the best part of the movie who is surrounded by a very talented cast of Tim Curry, Ornella Muti, Marisa Tomei, Kirk Douglas, Chazz Palminteri, Kurtwood Smith and Eddie Bracken and more.

		<fullReview>This is exactly whatever you're thinking right now, only a better version of it. Yes it's got the classic bits all plays have, the silly puns, the rhythmic lines with characters feeding off one another, the tempo in scenes is a lot more regulated than in regular film... but it's actually pleasant and not overdone here. You can actually watch a film that doesn't carry all the smugness from theatre or with the overplaying of actors, and about that: Stalone does an amazing job, because it's not an easy role mind you. All the other actors play their part superbly, from the young accountant to Peter Riegert as 'Aldo', Palminteri or a young Marisa Tomei, and oh man Tim Curry, hilarious performance. This is just pleasant throughout and dare I say for anyone, whatever generation and age, provided one would only understand what he's going into. Developments abound, constant plot twists, lots of various dynamics all acting at once, and some of the gags are hilarious (one scene in particular with the suitcase we would all remember). Not a dull or vain moment. And by the way, who *IS* that Oscar ? Top, top comedy. You should watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Oscar" is a hilarious movie that keeps you laughing throughout. You even feel quite exhausted after it's all said and done since there's so much going on. The great thing about the movie is being surprised minute by minute. The basic story is about "Snaps" Provolone, a powerful Chicago gangster that is feared by many. However, Snaps is about to go straight because he promised his dying father on his deathbed that he would go legit. However, it's not going to be easy. In only 24 hours of trying to be straight, everything goes straight to hell, and everything that could go wrong does. And that's when all of the fun begins. This is a terrific comedy that can be enjoyed by just about everyone. Sylvester Stallone can really be a card and is hilarious when given the right opportunity. His facial expressions and outbursts are truly unforgettable.John Landis scored big with his spoof of high finance magnates "Trading Places" and revisits similar terrain in "Oscar," only this time the big money was made in the crime syndicate field. Landis shrewdly sets his satire in the Depression period to provide for the same kind of contrast between rich and poor that he showcased in "Trading Places", when Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche wagered to see what will happen when poor African American Eddie Murphy is allowed into their world to make business decisions. This is filled with hilarious dialogue and is delivered perfectly by everyone. Yes, even Stallone. And you felt so proud when Chazz was ahead of everyone else after not knowing a thing about a thing.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light-hearted watchable gangster comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on the 1958 French play "Oscar" by Claude Magnier and it's also a remake of French 1967 movie "Oscar" staring Louis De Funes. I haven't seen the French version and considering my dislike for French comedies (with few exceptions) I don't think I ever will. So there won't be any comparisons between the French movie and Hollywood version. The only thing you need to know is the action here is set in 30's America in world of Italian gangsters instead of 60's France and the world of French businessmen.The story here is completely ridiculous , but it's a FARCE people , it has to be that way . The story has to be slightly confusing and full of action and twists. Maybe that's the reason why the USA audience didn't liked it ? It's kind of weird considering it's a homage to 30's comedies that are still popular today. It feels a lot like a Cary Grant / Katherine Hepburn movie.Some jokes feel repetitive and the story gets predictable in some place , but it never hurts the movie too much The story is pretty much an excuse to put the characters in funny situations. The characters are well defined and likable. The movie is loaded with memorable dialogue and wordplay . "Oscar" feels like a mix of screwball comedy and «commedia dell'arte».Sylvester Stallone always had a great sense of humor even in his most serious movies (contrary to what people say). Here he is having fun spoofing his own image and shows a really good comic timing . He does an admirable job and actually fits his role. "Oscar" has also an all star supporting cast: Don Ameche ("Trading places") , Marisa Tomei ("My cousin Vinny") , Tim Curry ("Rocky horror picture show"), Kirk Douglas ("Spartacus") , Kurtwood Smith ("Robocop") Chazz Palmenteri ("Bronx tale") . Watch out for Arleen Sorkin (the voice of Harley Quinn in "Batman TAS") in small role of manicurist. Everyone is good here and fits is/hers role perfectly.John Landis directs "Oscar" in solid way. "Oscar" actually feels like you're watching a stage show and that's not a bad thing.Forget "Rhinestone" and "Stop or my mom will shoot". This is Stallone's best comedy (not counting his action comedies) and John Landis best movie in the 90's ( before he lost his touch completely). "Oscar" is not earth-shatteringly important movie or comedy , but it's pretty fun movie in universal way (you can watch it with all of your family and everyone should find something funny in it). I give it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Stallone Gave Up Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar is a screwball comedy based on the Claude Magnier stage play.It was a remake of the 1967 French film of the same title with the settings moved to the Depression era New York City.Its central character is on a mob boss trying to go straight. It stars Sylvester Stallone in the title role together with Marisa Tomei, Ornella Muti, Tim Curry, and Chazz Palminteri. Angelo "Snaps" Provolonep made a promise that he would reform his life and give up his involvement with criminal activities upon the death of his father.Unfortunately,there are a variety of personal and professional obstacles that he must go through.Among them is that he needs lots of money since he is getting married soon.His accountant asked him for a raise.Later,he discovered that his daughter got pregnant.And there are more.Critics thrashed Oscar and compared Stallone to comedy as one movie writer would put it,"Stallone is to comedy as John Goodman is to ballet".But despite the fact that he isn't a comic genius,he definitely can go through gags and made fun of by others without getting mad.In other words,he can tolerate how others would treat him.Unfortunately,this movie became a traumatic experience for him that he gave up comedy and never did a comedic film again.But nevertheless,it was still a funny film that would enjoy somehow.Regarding Stallone,he was decent in comedy.Too bad many people believed the numerous critics who trashed this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An over looked gem of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As some of the other reviewers have already noted, how nice to see Stallone in a movie out of context with what he is normally portrayed as (a gun toting military and/or mercenary and/or whatever M-16/AK-47 wielding guy). Wow. Nice to see some depth added to his character in this movie, as most of the "other" movies don't seek to show this, as they are only pander to the lowest common denominators; money and the Cro-Magnon mentally exhibited by the people who can't wait to see the "kill-them-all" movies. I truly believe that Oscar will be one of those movies that gains appreciation as time goes by. It's a nice 1920's based love story with Stallone as a "reformed" gangster trying to walk the straight and narrow as a promise to his dad on his death bed. The sets and costumes really make the movie, in addition to the many twists and turns along the way. Several well known actors and actresses add to the enjoyment - as well as many unknown actors (to me anyhow) also add to the viewing enjoyment. If you love a good comedy, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. And if your like me, you'll end up watching it again and again, not only because it not only makes makes you laugh and smile, but because it's a very well done movie, I only wish Stallone had done more like this. Maybe it's not too late for him to do a few more.</fullReview>

This performance shows Stallone at his best surrounded by top performers. While some may find it too much like a theatre play, (no special effects, no explosions, no fighting), most will appreciate this very funny and effective script, which I consider in the same class as «Bringing Up Baby» (1938) and «Arsenic And Old Lace» (1944).This film improves on those classics with quick scene changes and efficient use of multi-level space. Great camera work. Years ago, I must have viewed this film at least 10 times, each with great pleasure.</fullReview>

The way the characterization is done is an excellent example of cinematographic-craftsmanship at its best. "John Landis" - the director, obviously had a lot of fun while making the movie, as the timing , which is the key for a great comedy, has been matched perfectly with actors skill-level.The way the story (stories) unfolds, corroborates the "perfect murder" kind of deal. After seeing all this I'm not really sure why Stallone has not done more of such comedies, though a hint of in a few of his action- based movies like "Stop or mom will shoot you" - another great movie. Though I don't think that he will ever able to match the performance. Kudos to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High art it ain't....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone in a comedy after a disastrous attempt in Rhinestone almost a decade earlier. He does an admirable job and it is probably the only time where he's actually intelligible. Although, he and most of the other co-stars are overacting their hearts out (that is part of farce), except a surprisingly subdued, Tim Curry, the master of overacting.The plot belongs in a Katharine Hepburn/Cary Grant comedy and it doesn't really really reach high logic. Whatever happened to that bag of money, for instance and who cares? Stallone and company tries hard to actually make the words they are spouting make sense.The film is a bit too long, though and the slamming doors and characters walking in and out does get a little boring at the end. The most thankless part is Chazz Palminteri's as Connie, one of the henchman. He has one priceless bit, though, reminiscent of a ZAZ routine that is pretty old but still makes me laugh. Most of the time he is made to look dumb and a runner between he and Stallone (Yes, boss... Don't call me boss... and so on) is only funny the first time.The whole thing is flooded with familiar faces and they are too numerous to mention and that is part of nearly all of John Landis' movies but they don't really add anything. Ornella Muti, a relatively unknown looks very uncomfortable in comedy surroundings and she is kind of shrill and annoying.Still, the movie is not a total bomb that it was made out to be back then and it is a vast improvement from Stallone's embarrassing turn with Estelle Getty a year later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does everyone think Sylvester Stallone is terrible at comedy? I never saw "Rhinestone" as that is considered one of the worst movies ever made and while I thought "Stop! or my mom will shoot" was illogical and hokey at times it was mostly entertaining. But "Oscar" out of all his attempts at comedy is Sylvester Stallone's best attempt at comedy and it remains a mystery to me why this did so terrible critically and financially. Maybe critics and audiences had trouble accepting Stallone as a gangster doing something different from "Rocky" or "Rambo". I mean yes like "Stop! or my mom will shoot" this one is very illogical and confusing at times. But if you put your full mind into the movie and think about it you will realize it is very funny. While Stallone is terrific I think some of the best scenes in this film belong to Tim Curry. Some of his scenes made me want to laugh out loud! I cannot really summarize the film because many parts are confusing but I can certainly say that critics and audiences need to stop putting it down and give it another try because they don't know what their missing. Sure it's no "Godfather" or "Goodfellas" but it is a very funny little gangster comedy that has the intelligence one misses in comedies. All in all "Oscar" is no masterpiece but it is very funny and enjoyable and that's enough for me to recommend it. It also proves that Sylvester Stallone is not a terrible comedy movie star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Oscar" is quite a funny movie from director John Landis about an early thirties gangster called Snaps. One day, Snaps (played by action hero Sylvester Stallone)gets up one morning and decides he will clean up his act and go straight.All the cast are very enjoyable, including Kirk Douglas, Don Ameche and Tim Curry, while Sly Stallone does well in the role of Snaps. Handled well all round, the film never takes itself seriously, while being consistently humorous. "Oscar" is a good night's entertainment thanks to Michael Barrie and Jim Mulholland's simple adaptation of Claude Magnier's original play.Sunday, July 28, 1991 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

"Snaps" Provolone is trying to get both the suitcases full of 50Gs in his possession but oddly enough keeps getting the suitcase of underwear!! its a merry-go-round of comedy, mix-ups and fun! it is a film for 12 and ups, I don't think younger kids would quite understand what is happening in this film but then again thats just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY HEARD***Sylvester Stallone turns in a surprisingly good performance in this stage play brought to the big screen, and the supporting cast delivers sufficient chemistry to maintain the viewer's attention in what could easily have become one more dull farce from the Hollywood meat grinder. The film comes across as very playlike, with pacing that admirably mimics a live production.All the primary characters are memorable and well-defined, which also serves to enhance the live-on-stage appeal of the movie. I have never seen this work performed live, but it's easy to imagine how it could be staged, even how the sets would be constructed.The movie is loaded with memorable dialogue and wordplay - in fact, if any criticism could be made against it, it would be the excess of verbage - and even Stallone manages to slip in a few nice touches, here and there (the Oliver Hardy-like look of suffering into the camera, for instance). The two Fennucci brothers' interplay is as skilled and as natural as Tom and Dick Smothers, who really WERE brothers. Sometimes various characters' accents will slip - was that REALLY supposed to be an Irish brogue spewing from the maid? - but by and large, the individual performances overshadow occasional goofs. The 'Irish' maid and Sofia Provolone are the two weakest characters, not really having enough lines (or enough CONVINCING lines) to show any depth of character.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, though I hate farces, as a rule. I think a lot of the reviewers who claimed to despise it are just having a knee-jerk reaction to Stallone's presence, and have overlooked the quality of the story itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film.I was impressed with the casting and the actors' portrayals. For those of you who didn't like it....WHY? It is meant to be slapstick comedy and that's what it is. If you're expecting something else, then you'll be greatly disappointed. It if smack full of one-liners and inuendo. I believe it does an excellent job.I thought Sly did a great job as Snaps. M Tomei stole the show as Snaps daughter Lisa - awesome performance. Great group of actors who all carried their character to form. If you walk away from this movie disappointed, then I can only surmise you wanted more out of it. I think the movie is wonderful for its genre.There were a few plot issues that weren't addressed or solved and just kind of ignored as necessary. Even with that the film works.Few comedies can I sit through repeatedly; this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lines are too efficient to be realistic, but that style lends itself well to the non-stop humour inherent in this well-done satire of mob movies. The comedic drama is over the top, the wide variety of accents is enjoyable, and the plot twists keep it moving.

		<shortDescription>Loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a lot of positives going for it. A star-studded cast, solid musical themes, and plenty of twists and turns that kept me guessing throughout the entire flick. It's movies like this that you watch simply to be entertained, and Oscar does exactly that.There are no evil villains out to take over the world, no viral toxins that can wipe out mankind, no aliens that walk around masquerading as humans, just a simple story that becomes complex via a superb script. You say the acting was bad? The movie is a -farce-. It's supposed to be viewed as a simple play, not a contender the "more serious" movies.I'll never understand the logic behind statements such as "Anyone that liked this movie must have absolutely no taste when it comes to movies." It's not a wise move to generalize the entire populace based solely on what the individual believes. Oscar is not a movie that was filmed with the intent of being taken seriously. To try to make it what it isn't is to disable any chance of enjoying the picture. Those that suspend belief can appreciate the true humor that saturates this excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming from a stage actor, this movie is simply incredible. The vocal and physical feats that are accomplished in this movie are some of the most complex and challenging actions for any actor. Everything that is done in this movie is done to a perfect beat, from walking in tandem, to speaking in unison. If you EVER hope to become an actor, watch this movie.If you dislike this movie because it is not the typical Stalone movie, I have one thing to say to you. Variety. Stalone has been typecast as a rough guy, so why shouldn't he be allowed to break that mold. Personally, I fell that Stalone and all the other actors did and incredible thing in making this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Day In The Life Of The Provolone Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would never have dreamed that Sylvester Stallone would appear in a film that has its basis in a French farce. But Oscar is exactly that.Taken from a play by Claude Magnier with the same title, the action is transferred to 1931 Chicago where gangster Angelo 'Snaps' Provolone is looking to go legitimate because of a promise he made to his dying father. The father is played by Kirk Douglas and Douglas's death scene opens the film and it's hilarious. Sly Stallone looked like he was having one great old time spoofing his own image. The rest of the film is a day in his life dealing with bankers he's coming in with, an embezzling employee, a rival mob, a daughter looking to break loose from the family, and the police.It's all done at a pace that rivals Billy Wilder's classic, One Two Three. In fact Oscar would have been a classic if they'd somehow persuaded Billy Wilder to direct it. It just needed that extra something from a comedy master.Still Stallone gets good support from several generations of Hollywood players who range from Don Ameche as a priest to Marisa Tomei in her film debut as Stallone's daughter.Catch this one if it's broadcast, especially you Stallone fans.</fullReview>

Furthermore, its got the guy from III who got his ear bit off (also the Dad/Cop in that cheesy adolescent what-if-god-was-one-of-us show "arcade" or "aracne" or whatever). Moreover, it has Tim Curry as a linguist, a hilarious change of character if you just watched Rocky Horror. In addition, it has that guy who was the criminal ring leader in the first RoboCop (also the Dad in THAT cheesy adolescent let-me-remember-what-I-was-like-when-I-smoked-Pot 70's SHOW). Oh yeah, is that Morrissaah Tombay as the daughter? Tell her to marry George Costanza. Finally, Stallone is cool. Have a coke and a smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen "Oscar" a number of times, and can't get enough of it! It is by far the most hilarious movie I have ever ever seen! I rolled on the floor with laughter each time I saw it. If you like a funny movie, with an Italian twist, this is definitely the one to see!!! The cast was excellent: Sylvester Stallone, though noted for his action-packed adventure roles, was nonetheless outstanding as a comic actor, and Marisa Tomei was absolutely incredible -- I adored her (to this day I still look for her movies!). Special kudos as well to Vincent Spano, Ornella Muti, Linda Gray, Tim Curry, and all the other members of this wonderful cast. I highly recommend this film!</fullReview>

The film is, is constantly amusing, and funny, and never becomes tired or old, and the gags are quite good!. And what a perfect cast!, they were all excellent,however, Marisa Tomei, grated my nerves a couple times. The Directing is good!. John Landis does an excellent job here, keeping the film fresh and funny throughout, with only a couple of dull spots, Solid job. The Acting is great!. Sylvester Stallone is AMAZING as always, he is hilarious throughout, is very convincing, and was very likable! (Stallone rules!). Vincent Spano, is very good as Anthony, he was a little dorky, but very likable!. Chazz Palminteri, is excellent here, he is constantly amusing, and had one of the funniest moments in the film when he pulled out all those weapons out of his pockets. Kirk Douglas, is good in his cameo as Stallone's father. Linda Gray is good as Theresa's mother. Tim Curry is actually funny here, and not annoying, i liked him!. Ornella Muti, is amusing as Stallone's wife, and did a good job here, plus she had decent chemistry with him. Elizabeth Barondes, is good as Theresa, and was kinda cute.Marisa Tomei is somewhat annoying here but she was GORGEOUS!, so she was bearable.(if that makes any sense., but then again, maybe that was the point of her character?. Kurtwood Smith, is good here, as he always is, i liked him. Rest of the cast is great. Overall well worth a look!. *** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Oscar" looks at first glance like an homage to "One, Two, Three" the classic Billy Wilder comedy from 1961, wherein Jimmy Cagney must deal with the visiting daughter of his boss who is both married and pregnant - courtesy of an East German communist. Tho many elements are common to both pictures (borrowed pregnant girls, men living thru the most hectic day of their lives, non-stop gags and ever-increasing speed) "Oscar" is a unique film, full of terrific gags, wonderful characters (played by a combination of the best modern actors and classic stars of the past like Don Ameche, Eddie Bracken, and Yvonne deCarlo). The action is fast-paced, the direction brisk, and the script full of wonderful surprises.Watching this film is like a wonderful roller coaster, full of dips, hills, climbing, falling, and laugh out loud thrills. I highly recommend this film, and once you've seen it, start checking out the classic movies/directors/actors which this film has used for it's inspiration.</fullReview>

When he decides to go straight, all the people from his past show up and throw his plans off track.I like Peter Riegert in everything I've seen him do, and he plays a great smart-aleck gangster.Marisa Tomei is a superb 'wild' teen in her era. She is also the perfect drama queen.I think this movie is like a classic, I enjoy watching it again and again.</fullReview>

Lots of character actors like Eddie Bracken and Art Lefleur. One scene I like is the "Finucci" Brothers playing Boggie Woogie piano with Vincent Spano. Marisa Tomei, William Atherton and Ken Howard have their moments as well. Overall, more worth multiple viewings than say; "Daylight".Abandon "Rambo", try some "Snaps". Good fun, plot twists, nice sets, lots of quality cast. I own a copy on laserdisc and show it to Stallone comedy virgins regularly. If they can take it ...I put on "Rhinestone"!!!A Good Time Is Had By All!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guaranteed Laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't smile at least once for this film, you're not paying attention and you have no sense of humor.This plot was focused and the writers knew it when they went through the character development. They cut out items that would have slowed the plot and kept you on your seat with surprises everywhere. Even when you expect something to happen, the reaction still brings a laugh. After they laid the pavement and structure for the storyline, they group big name actors and ones you wouldn't even think belong in this satire of movie, yet the overlying development takes over to make it even more hilarious. Stalone in a comedy, Tomei as a bratty rich daughter, Curry as an elocution teacher, and more that draw you right in as the film moves along. You have to keep on your toes just to name all the actors that pass through the scenes.The movie, set during prohibition, starts with a gangster's father passing away and begs that his son give up being a Chicago bootlegging crook. The next day his accountant shows up asking the ex-mob boss for his daughter's hand in matrimony. However, the person the accountant wants to ask to be his bride is not really the daughter of the gangster. The unwitting father, ready to become a straight investment banker, doesn't realize this and goes to his actual daughter to tell her his upsetting news. The story unfolds as he unwittingly finds out his could be son-in-law stole $50,000 from his books and tries to get it back, get a husband for his real daughter, have his elocution lesson, and size a new suit before bankers arrive to help him invest his money in their vaults. Meanwhile the Feds are watching and have high doubts the crime leader gone straight has heeded his father's word.Wonderful piece to add to any movie collection and great for those who just want a good laugh now and then. Something that would be enjoyed to watch back on the BIG SCREEN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well done little farce with nonstop action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little skeptical when I first rented this movie, and was pleasantly surprised. Stallone plays a 1930s big-time gangster who decides to go straight. Unfortunately he has absolutely no idea how to do it (nor does anyone else in his circle), and to compound the problem the police view his honest efforts as yet another crime scheme that they must uncover. The action and dialogue are nonstop. The plot twists, weaves, loops, and backtracks at a dizzying pace, yet you can easily follow it. It's almost like being on a roller-coaster ride. Stallone does a marvelous job portraying a tough yet likable mob boss, yet I think his reputation as a brainless action stud hobbled this movie's deserved success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have absolutely NO idea why this movie was such an apparent flop, as it certainly deserves more praise than it does criticism.It is witty, hilarious, and intelligent...probably the 3 things that you would LEAST associate with Sly Stallone normally, yet here you can positively see him revel in them while sending up his own tough guy image every chance he gets. Yet through all this he never makes me cringe as i do when i see Ahh-Nuld in one of his "comedys". Here Stallone really does shine, and seeing him actually enjoying himself is worth the rental alone.Perhaps its just because audiences couldnt buy Stallone in a comedy movie without machismo and violence, perhaps it was poor marketing, but there is no excuse for this film to be as forgotten or as ignored as it is. If you love the classic Stage-Style comedy parodies (and i believe this is based upon one) this will be a rare treat.Charming, intelligent, energetic, and funny, it deserves a decent viewing, so give it a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect stage farce, timelessly brought to film. 10/10. Spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Atssa so you won't forgett'.Unabashedly limited to stage set locales, Oscar (1991) is perfect for what it is: a Depression-Era French farce by Claude Magnier, based on The Marriage of Figaro, then adapted for the screen. People typically like to observe that this was Sylvester Stallone's failed attempt to do comedy, together with his other, intolerably insulting attempt, Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot! (1992), which does NOTHING for the reduction of ageism. Well; d'you know what?...forget `Mom'-this is GREAT! Oscar (1991) is impish and clever in every way that `Mom' is not.The screenplay by Michael Barrie &amp; Jim Mulholland (who was actually cast as the barely-seen Oscar of the title) has been written with effortless-looking chutzpah, and is a complete joy! It's peppered with cutesy touches, caricatures, physical comedy, quotable Depression-era one-liners; and easy, untaxing stage farce developments reminiscent of Charley's Aunt. So accept that you're watching a cartoonish farce, and leave any pretentious dissatisfactions at the door.The casting alone (by Jackie Birch) is pure perfection. Stallone looks good as a macho mobster without smirking his upper lip as usual. To his credit, he plays Angelo 'Snaps' Provolone pretty straight except for his baleful looks to camera-which are such terrific fun, they leave you wanting more. But it is the supporting actors that walk away with this spoof, esp: *Tim Curry (as the UNFORGETTABLE Dr Poole, 'Snaps' elocution master); *Chazz Palminteri (who broke through with THIS MOVIE as Connie the hood-who's not really an `ox-andda-moron'); *Pieter Riegert (as Prevalone's flunkie and ex-gangster, Aldo, who's now a butler trying to `buttle'); *Harry Shearer (of Montgomery Burns fame from the Simpsons, here playing one of the famous and terrifying Fanucci brothers); *Martin Ferrero (as the other, heavily accented Fanucci brother, who supposedly does that moonwalk-spin); and *Marisa Tomei (as Stallone's sexy femme fatale daughter Lisa). Tomei ended the year with a Best Actress for My Cousin Vinny.The rest are a slew of cheeky male actors, including the particularly goggling and gangly Paul Greco; and some rather ageing surprises (check out the cast list for yourself)! Obviously, this is a boys' movie. The women actors are less terrific; their lines and characters are less well developed, and so apart from Marisa Tomei only Elizabeth Barondes (as Angelo's `OTHER daughter, Theresa') is good.Joycelyn O'Brien is frankly BIZARRE with her pancake make-up and Irish brogue, while Ornella Muti really has too disruptive an Italian accent which distracts us completely from her acting. Linda Gray, from Dallas, is only memorable for her own goggling eyes so UNNECESSARILY accentuated by eyeliner. Even Yvonne DeCarlo (YEP, Lily Munster), is completely wasted as an old Italian mamma, unaccountably wearing lipstick and fake eyelashes! Yikes! I mean, what was their makeup department ON?!Not surprisingly, it's the movie's quotability that's responsible for my perfect rating. Dr Poole and the hoods make excellent elocution foils for each other. When Connie vouches for 'Snaps', `...Even in the old days he was known as an honest crook' and Dr Poole observes `Ha, that's an oxymoron', 'Snaps' reproaches Dr Poole: `Leave Connie alone, he does the best he can'. On another occasion Connie again says `Congratulations, Doctor! Will there be a honeymoon following?', Dr Poole chides, `Watch it there, Connie, you've got a dangling participle'; at which Connie looks down and turns around to fix himself!Dr Poole (Tim Curry) is just such a hoot. His wide, inane face despairs many-for instance 'Snaps', when he's banging his head into the table and Dr Poole tries to cheer him up with that inane grin. The grin is no help, and 'Snaps' just goes back to banging his head! Dr Poole's makeup is perfect, for once; but the same style was also applied much less desirably to Joycelyn O'Brien's Nora, the always-ignored maid, on whom it makes no sense.There are many touches making the characters seem very familiar, even though few of us would physically remember the Depression. Everyone is totally frustrated with one another-the sexual politics are particularly contemporary. Of course, the centre of the maelstrom is Little Anthony (Vincent Spano), 'Snaps' accountant. He causes all manner of mayhem and misunderstandings, in this case mostly financial, with his marriage `nest-egg'-reminiscent of the Marriage of Figaro, on which this farce is obviously based. Meanwhile, as the Depression-era bankers reluctantly arrive for their banking deal with 'Snaps', one of them (Howard) petulantly remarks `Let's just get this over with, I have to get back to the office and turn down a loan.'My fav. scene is Connie's `disarming Germany' scene (oh, btw, watch Evil Roy Slade (1972) for this scene's equal-ERS is highly recommended). Here the scene lasts a full minute, almost completely without lines.On second thoughts, that's my second-favourite. My VERY favourite, of course, is the animation of an operatic `puppetoon' Barber of Seville during the opening credits. I remember watching this at the cinema and being STRUCK with the desperate need to stride right back into the next session. Thank you, David Allen Productions, for paying such attention to detail that the puppet's tongue flutters visibly in its mouth as he sings `(Lalala)^7 -La'!One last thing: the plot's social consciousness is represented by an undercurrent of Catholic shrieking about unwed mothers. The Catholic solution was to have them be packed off to convents....as if the power had EVER been in the hands of the SOCIALLY weaker sector (women) to POLICE the actions of the stronger (men). That's the quintessential ineptitude of church attitudes in a nutshell. We have, of course, since discovered the human rights-abuses executed at those very same convents in real life, all over the world. Conclusion? Religious handling of social problems was/is profoundly abysmal, with added culpable unquestionability. So, even in a comedy, there has to be social impact buried within the screenplay for it to have real social resonance.Oscar's humour has that in spades, justifying my rating of 10/10.</fullReview>

Playing the straight man to a host of folks, he simply attempts to take one simple yet very important day and live it as though it were any other day, with hilarious results.The miscues, puns, hidden meanings and misdirection make you wonder how you ever overlooked Stallone's talent before.

		<shortDescription>Movie not for the shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies. I love the departure that Mr. Stallone takes for this. I know that he has probably suffered for it, but I admire him for his bravery in stepping out of his expected role.The movie was panned by the critics, but, by golly, you just have to be intelligent in order to appreciate this movie. Most movie critics are just a lot of pompous windbags with air for brains.The movie begins with a subdued, rainy opening where "Snaps" (Stallone) is visiting his father on his deathbed. One wonders, "Have I come to see a comedy, or not?" and soon realizes that this is one of the most slapstick, yet sophisticated comedies ever! The mood abruptly changes with the opening credits set to the backdrop of a resounding rendition of "Figaro". The movie takes off and keeps you riveted to the very end! Be careful, you'll be laughing so long that you will miss other witty banter and sight gags!This is one movie that you will need to see again and again to pick up the morsels that you missed the first few times. One of my favorite lines is when Connie (Chazz Palminteri) asks "Will there be a wedding following?" to which the prissy elocution teacher, Dr. Poole, (played beautifully by Tim Curry) responds, "Watch it, Connie. You have a dangling participle!" Connie acts very embarrassed and turns around in a gesture to adjust his fly.Marisa Tomei is a treasure in this film. She convincingly plays Sly's daughter. She likes to think of herself as a modern woman but is trapped in her little-girl pink bedroom with storybook characters adorning the walls, all the while wearing peignoir sets with feather boas and smoking and listening to the most modern, bawdy music! (Snaps: The music you kids listen to today! Don't think I haven't heard the words to Minnie the Moocher!) She, along with a vengeful maid's help, devises a plan to get out. She is going to let her father think she is with child. This is a driving force for the comedy of errors that ensues, along with three identical black bags that keep getting confused with one another.I could go on and on about everyone's role. I love the great gags of Five-Spot the stuttering stoolie (expertly performed by Eddie Bracken), and Sophia, Snaps wife, (Ornella Muti - fabulous!) complaining to her husband and asking where he got the driver who keeps the motor running (out of habit) when he dropped her off at the bank. Everyone is perfect for their part in the film. Each and every one is a jewel of a performance. Kudos to all - everyone who had anything to do with the film, and thanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is an ignored film by John Landis, it is either this or "The Stupids," both of which are hilarious when given half a chance! Stallone may not be as funny as Roberto Benigni, but he certainly has the comic genius of say... Arnold Schwartzenegger. This wacky comedy embraces its theatrical roots, locks into one location, and proceeds to fall apart in a manner that only "Clue" can challenge. Stallone did such a great job; he received such terrible press, he'll probably never do one again. (I know "Burn Hollywood, Burn!" he was good in that, too!) Tim Curry is also a delight, as always!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Oscars For Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 1991's Oscar.Plot In A Paragraph: Angelo "Snaps" (Stallone) Provolone made his dying father a promise on his deathbed, that he would leave the world of crime and become an honest businessman. Snaps sets about to keep his promise, and become a banker.Rival muscle man Arnold Schwarzenegger had scored big with two comedies in 'Twins' and 'Kindergarden Cop' so Sly hoped for similar results when he tried his hand at comedy. Oscar would have been a great stage play, but it just doesn't work on film and more damagingly its not very funny. A lot of the jokes are from the 30's and are poorly delivered and just not funny.Whilst not as bad as some would have you believe, and you have to give him credit for trying something different. The movie does have a certain charm to it, mostly thanks to Stallones performance. Most of the supporting cast are very poor, so despite an energetic (if over the top) performance from Sly. Oscar never raises itself above anything other than "ok" or "alright"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy without comedians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the depression era and 4 million are out of work. Chicago gangster Angelo "Snaps" Provolone (Sylvester Stallone) promises his father on his death bed to go straight. A month later, he's looking to put his money into the banks who are desperate for his cash. His young accountant Anthony Rossano wants a big raise to marry Teresa. Teresa told Anthony that she's Snaps' daughter and Snaps thinks Anthony is talking about his spoiled daughter Lisa (Marisa Tomei). Anthony had kept almost $50k of Snaps' money and offers the jewels he bought with the money in exchange for his daughter. Then Lisa lies to her father that she got pregnant by their former chauffeur Oscar. She wants to escape her over-protective father. Snaps is eager to marry her off. There is a long-running misunderstanding between Snaps and Anthony. Also speech therapist Dr. Thornton Poole (Tim Curry) is secretly in love with Lisa. Police led by Lt. Toomey is sure that Snaps is working on a large illegal deal.This movie tired me out. It's one of those old fashion screwball comedies where there are a ton of misunderstandings and a bag of jewels that keeps going to the wrong person. The problem is that the movie is relying on the miscommunications to be funny all on their face value. Isn't it funny that Snaps and Anthony don't understand each other? For me, a comedy needs more than misunderstandings. It needs real comedians with real comic timing. Sly is yelling a lot and his anger is suppose to be funny. Vincent Spano is even less funny although it may be his annoying character. At least, Marisa Tomei tries to be wacky but she's also rather annoying. I watched this a long time ago and I watched it again recently. Both times, the movie gave me a headache and that's the last of Oscar for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going legit has its dilemmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Oscar" is set in a single day and centers around a central location in the period of the early '30s: the mansion of going-straight mob boss Angelo "Snaps" Provolone.The environment is a tangled web of confusing and conflicting circumstances, all done with purposeful absurdity and silliness. New challenges and complications muddy up the day of Snaps attempting to lead the honest life after giving one last request to his dying father. Can he do it? Well, maybe if he manages to settle down and think apart from so many building distractions, such as dealing with anyone from his spoiled daughter and pestering son-in-law-to-be to his simple henchmen that need looking after and wising up.The flow starts to feel routine and eventually claustrophobic due to seeing the same do-nothing areas, as well as the situational humor eventually turns tedious from watching similar gags run their course. Minor characters stand apart such as the informant "Five Spot Charlie" with his eccentric lip smacking and stuttering; Chazz Palminteri plays a hit-man who tears up to touching events. Though the laughs don't always come so easily with "Oscar" compared to other Landis films like "Animal House," "Three Amigos," "Coming to America," "Trading Places" and even "American Werewolf" considered.This is a movie that relies heavily on its situations and characters--since it was modeled after a stage play--however some of the cast aren't so hysterical that it radiates across the screen to make a viewer instantly loosen up and go with its zaniness. Stallone, for instance, frequently uses this kind of booming intonation like a professional wrestler to show aggravation; it's commanding, but not for comedy's sake. This had potential to be a breezy if still fun film, though some sparks went missing to clench a solid pacing and the movie in turn felt up and down. Had it one moment, gone flat the next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Remake Should Be !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is where there isn't much to be said unless that everything was perfect. Well, almost everything.The thing about remakes is that they always look as copies. This one doesn't. In fact it's so original in its own way. I even liked it more than the French movie.The secret is simple. They call it : the script. Nowadays, Hollywood knows nothing about such an element. And the coping has become their chief concern.The coup de maitre was mainly in this selection of another world. America in the 1930 instead of France of the 1960s, Italian gangsters instead of Parisian businessmen. This didn't make the things authentic only, it made it a homage to Hollywood comedies of the 1930s as well.And this dialog. It managed to be as fine as any dialog you met in any classic, being that sharp, witty and swift. Let alone American. This is what creation is all about. Now, I forgot the original movie, and that's what makes (Oscar ? 1991) ORIGINAL apart.The casting was good yet with The fatal mistake : Sylvester Stallone ! Aside from being too coarse to be a comedian, too fake while delivering some lines, he seemed too young sometimes to play the role. Just imagine Clint Eastwood as Angelo Provolone. At least he could have been truer.I loved the editing. It's an assured hero here. The performance was over the top. I must refer to (Peter Riegert), where is a big talent like him anymore ?? Every second of (Yvonne De Carlo) was so sexy. Listen to her saying "Chauffeur". Just waw! However, this movie is more beautiful. Sadly we don't run into comedies like that, rather remakes like that, many times from the American cinema lately.Finally, it isn't perfect. But who said that there is perfection on earth. In this case just hitting the 99 % is the perfection. And this one did it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Oscar for third time in a row, I was wondering whether all the reviewers who gave this movie a negative, were constipated when they watched it. Either the people who don't like this movie has some serious problem with their mind or they're just lying because they don't like Stallone.Oscar is a wonderful comedy, which will make us laugh laugh and nothing but laugh. It's set (beautifully) in the thirties and all the characters, their expression and mannerisms resembles the time. Stallone is a live wire as the gangster 'gone straight' and evokes laughter in more than one occasions. All the supporting cast were wonderful except the guy who played Anthony Rosano. They could have opted for somebody with a better comic timing. About plot, there is not much to say, but there is lot to say. In fact, the movie is all about confusions, oxymoron, and a lot of dangling participles. You'll understand that once you watch it.The stupid reviews the movie garnered held me from watching it for almost one year and it strengthened my belief that Stallone is one actor who every reviewer in Hollywood loves to hate. Its like... if you wanna pretend you're a brainiac, rip up Stallone's movies and bam you are Einstein. Its prejudice, the one thing which the reviewers should never have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but not even remotedly as funny as the French original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The French original starring Louis de Funes, one of the greatest comedians who ever lived was much, much funnier. The non-stop plot twists of the storyline of this film were equally matched by the non-stop nervous outrages of comedian Louis De Funes, who was at his best in these type of screwball situations. Oscar was one of De Funes' most hilarious films (maybe only topped by the film 'Jo') with non-stop nervous, slap-stick behavior. The scene where De Funes goes berserk (goes REALLY berserk, because he's berserk from start to finish) and starts pulling on an imaginary nose and playing it like a violin is absolutely priceless. Stallone isn't near the comedic genius of that nervous, little angry guy Louis de Funes played, but he turns in a good performance. I'd highly recommend seeing the original, however, which is one of the funniest things I've ever seen, in any language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landis In Fine Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Oscar" is a vastly underrated, amusing and fast-paced throwback to the screwball comedies of the 30's and perfectly paced by director John Landis ("The Blues Brothers", "Animal House", "Trading Places"). Like a pro, Landis nimbly manages the adept comedy timing needed for this kind of farce (a film form that is the easy to screw up!), by assembling a very fine cast (Harry Shearer, Peter Riegert, Tim Curry, Marisa Tomei amongst MANY, MANY others) around an amusing performance by, of all people, tough-guy Sylvester Stallone, in the more successful of his two attempts to change his audience appeal and reach, a la Arnold ("Twins") Swarzennegger. Believe it or not, Stallone is very funny - as the straight man - but the film really falls back to Landis's superb comic timing, editing and wonderful supporting cast to carry the mirth straight through. Particularly noteworthy are Harry Shearer and Martin Ferrero as mob tailors The Finucci Brothers, and also very funny is a late-film appearance by Rocky Horror's Tim Curry as mumbler Stallone's elocution(!) coach, Dr. Poole. The technical credits are splendid, particularly Bill Kenney's large Provolone-home set and redress of the Universal New York Street backlot, the editing by Dale Beldin is tight, Mac Ahlberg's photography is fluid, and maestro Elmer Bernstein contributes a lively score with plenty of comedic stingers. Spiritedly written in the right tone of comedies of yore by Michael Barrie and Jim Mulholland ("Amazon Women on the Moon", TV's "The Tonight Show"), "Oscar" is not earth-shatteringly important in the grand scheme of AFI movie comedies, but it sure tries to ape the best of them, and succeeds marvelously. A great, fun picture, perfect for Landis aficionados, Stallone fans, undemanding families or students of early film comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Oscar" is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorite comedies. There are twists and turns that keep you hopping and the cast is absolutely outstanding. I've worn out one video and I'm very protective of the one I replaced it with. It's very hard to find copies, and it's not available on dvd - if it was I'd buy it in a heartbeat!Sylvester Stallone shows impeccable talent and comedic timing as the son of a man (Kirk Douglas), who's dying wish was that his son would leave the gangster lifestyle. After carefully planning the transition to honest business man, the day of transformation arrives. Naturally, that day is the day when everything imaginable happens to thwart his plans. Neither the rival gang nor the police believe that he's going straight, his accountant reveals that he's been stealing from him because he's in love with his "daughter", the maid runs off to marry the man he had hoped to have for a son-in-law, and that's just for starters!The entire movie is based on that one fateful day, and it is hilarious from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie when it first came out on video years ago, and for one reason or another I never got through the entire thing. I heard about how bad it was over the years, so I never gave seeing it again much of a thought. But, it was on TV recently, and I figured I'd give it a chance. Let's just say, I'm not sorry I did.I don't understand why everyone said this movie was so terrible. It had a great cast, it was pretty funny (I thought the recurring underwear gag was pretty good), and it was nothing more than light-hearted fun. Yes, the story was completely ridiculous, and to think all this stuff could happen over 90 minutes is insane. The thing about a comedy is you'll either laugh or you won't. It's about the most subjective genre of movies, and I guess you'd find things funnier if you were already in a good mood when you started watching it.So, Stallone and John Landis fans, especially, should give this a chance. Rent it, or catch if they show it on TV some time. Anyone who doesn't fall into one or both of those groups might still enjoy it for what it is.Rating: 6.5/10</fullReview>

There's nothing I hate more than an action (or film) star that is full of him/herself. In my opinion, Schwarzenegger is the best action star. He isn't ignorant and makes films for the fans -- not for paychecks. Considering films he's turned down, I think that is evidence.

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies, like "Plan 9 from Outer Space" or "Showgirls" that is so absolutely horrible that it ought to be a cult classic. It is ostensibly a comedy, but the laughs come out of the sheer ineptitude of everyone involved in making this monumental stinker. I recommend renting "Oscar" to watch with a group of your funniest friends, a la Mystery Science Theater. You won't have a dull moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Differences with the original french movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's based on a famous french theater comedy, played in the 60's by "Louis De Funes". The play lasted a long time before becoming a movie with the same actors. The US remake is quite good, and Sly's really surprising as a comic actor. The original context is different, DeFunes is a rich industrialist, not a gangster as Sly, but the gangster-comedy is a good humoristic vector. The big difference with the original french movie is the mime and body expression kind of humor brought by Louis DeFunes in the original. DeFunes is particularly known and appreciated in France for his great mime talent, he used to greatly improve all the comedies (except a few bad ones) he was playing in with great mime acting and other bits of humor he added to the original script. In fact the script was different when they started the play, DeFunes added a lot of new comic scenes to it, luckily these were rendered as a movie cos the play was not intended to become a movie when it started, but it had so much success that they decided to shoot it.Well for the french-speaking, I'd recommend you to watch the original french "Oscar" movie if you liked the US version, DeFunes is unique in it and it's really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The funniest gag in this dismal film, an unintentional insult to Sly in a Hollywood system that doesn't acknowledge Cockney rhyming slang.Oscar opens with a man visiting his father on his deathbed, then segues into a plasticine model singing The Barber of Seville. Amazingly, it actually manages to get worse from this point on.I always cut Sylvester Stallone a lot of slack for reasons I've never been quite able to fathom, and even cast a kind eye over Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. But this overplayed, rigidly directed (supposed) comedy really is unbearable.A period piece (which, when shot with modern film techniques makes it look like a TV movie) it has such gems as a man who stutters, gangsters who say "boss" when told not to, an "Irish" maid and Sly as an all-mugging "Godfather". As you can see, this is a picture that takes comedy back further than the 30s in which it's set.As mobster Angelo Provolone Stallone learns a new word every day. Bizarrely, Angelo's word of the day here is expeditious, defined by him as "to be efficient and speedy". For if there's anything Oscar isn't, it's efficient or speedy. In fact, it's yawn-making 120 minutes of stretched-out pap.Why am I even bothering to analyse this tripe? The characters aren't believable, the script isn't interesting, the narrative is tedious. I hate bandwagons, but this film is bad. Really bad. Stallone's comic timing is... what comic timing? The acting is overplayed, the script poor and derivative. And derivative of stock comic situations, too. The scene where Chazz Palminiteri empties his pockets of weapons is so predictable it's untrue. See also: the final bag scene.Let's be positive. The plot, when it finally gets going, is actually fairly clever in a contrived, drawerroom kind of way. And I did laugh at the cheesiness of four lines: "I'm smoking a salmon." "Well put it out."/"Not in front of the help." "Trust me, he's no help."/"Of course I knew. I just had no idea."/"What killed him?" "Someone stepped on his fingers." "And that killed him??" "He was hanging from a window ledge at the Addison Hotel at the time."And that's it. The rest of it, from the constant shouting (from Ornella Muti particularly) is draining, and even the incidental music is an annoyance. Sylvester's allowed to break the fourth-wall, sub-Hardy style on two separate occasions, an act of pure desperation here. It is nice to see that IMDb voters have actually gone against the tide, with ? to date - a 5.2 average for this movie (and less than 30% of voters giving it below 5). And out of 37 comments, 33 of them are positive. Sadly, however, I must agree with the majority of external Oscar reviews, and the tagline ? "It's a comedy of criminal proportions!" ? and remark how terrible it all is. Forget Judge Dredd, Cobra, The Specialist... this is the worst Sylvester Stallone movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a comedy, but it's not that funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's written like a comedy, it has some actors who know how to play a comedy, it has occasionally funny lines, the timing is even occasionally on -- but all the parts don't hang together. It has homages to the comedy sketch "Who's On First" and comedy movies. It has farcical elements with several identical bags that get semi-rapidly switched, exchanged, brought in and out, but even the switching isn't that well done. Marisa Tomei is cute and almost funny, and her sudden romance with the the Boss' speech therapist is more believable the Stallone's mob boss persona.Stallone just isn't a natural born comedian. And the actors just aren't that funny together. It's definitely a wait for Late Night TV movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "comedy" with too much "baggage"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somebody please take me to a psychiatrist....because I "must" have been mentally ill to go see "both" of Stallone's attempts at making comedy films. I'll review ..."Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"... another time,this night belongs to , "Oscar".Like many,I thought this could be a really funny film,given the fact that I regularly laugh "unintentionally" at a lot of his movies to begin with. I had not been so let down by a comedy since,"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu" (see my review of that one!) I sat and sat and sat and just when I thought a situation was building to something really funny,it fell totally flat. Like Stallone saying his daughter should marry Dr. Poole (okay,is that funny because he's clueless and weird?) I can honestly say the only thing I laughed at (heh-heh) was when he was going on about the "records" his 1930's daughter has been listening too. "Minnie The Moocher" by Cab Calloway!! The most tired gag in this movie was done 100 times better in Streisand's,"What's Up Doc?" It's the old,mixed up each others tote bag plot! Totally unoriginal! One has ladies underwear in it,OH!...ha.I would not waste my time with this again,even if I had absolutely nothing to do that day. YAWN!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did anyone notice that this entire movie is filmed in one room? The characters never leave the house, they just move from one room to another! One of the weakest effortless films Iv'e ever seen. I happened to be at Disney world when this piece of trash was being filmed The entire thing was shot on one little so called "set" right inside the theme park. Sly was there for about three days and probably was paid $10 million. Script awful, characters awful, shooting awful! What a job Sly has!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's impossible to argue there wasn't an inordinate amount of effort and craft that went into "Oscar", but it's for that very reason the stink wafts all the way to high heaven - only truly talented men (though few women, in this case) could create something so awful. All I have to do is think of Don Ameche, Kirk Douglas, Chazz Palminteri, Tim Curry, et. al. displaying so much trust in their source material, their director, and their Sly and fearless leader, having truly convinced themselves that every face-slap, every double-take, every hand-waving exclamation *MUST* be comic gold, and I'm depressed for days. To call "Oscar" an abomination is being way too kind to the French. It's almost incomprehensible to believe that Vincent Spano starred in both this *and* John Sayles' masterpiece "City of Hope" in the same year. "Oscar" is truly one for the textbooks of how to make a horrible, horrible, horrible movie, and (in Sly's case) still walk away with 20 million, even when box-office receipts barely top 26. Marisa Tomei should (once again) be painfully tortured and executed for (once again) a mind-numbingly inept display of "acting". And to whoever played Theresa (I won't take the time to IMDb you) - may God have mercy on your soul. I wouldn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where is the guy who directed Trading Places or (to a lesser degree) Spies Like Us? You failed me here pal! First things first, Sly Stallone is NOT funny. Not even close. (see Stop or my Mom Will Shoot! Actually, don't see that.) He never even said anything witty when he killed people in his action movies. Well, not like Arnie! He would toss a guy off in front of a subway and say "Get on the right track" OK, with that out of the way, this movie also is not funny. You would have to be from Bulgaria to think was funny. Its like a VERY BAD Three's Company episode. I'm talking late Three's Company when Jack worked for that guy with the beard. So many misunderstandings! Marisa Tomeii is terrible, Sly is unwatchable, the funniest people in this movie have the least screen time. Poor Harry Shearer.... OK It might be easier to tell you what is GOOD about this movie: Red Forman plays a cop. That is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of only two movies that I walked out of the theater before it was over (the other being cobra, another Stallone flick go figure). The story was bad the acting horrible I think they even burned the popcorn the night I went to see it. Anyone that liked this movie must have absolutely no taste when it comes to movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sly needs to stick to 'Rambo' and 'Rocky' movies and forget about doing comedy. Plot was weak. While this is suppose to be a comedy, it got very few laughs from the audience. One of the few movies I was tempted to leave after the first twenty minutes.</fullReview>
