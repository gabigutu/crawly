		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn is simply charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina is a movie that was made for Audrey Hepburn. She is simply charming as the title character. The story is Cinderella like in that Sabrina, a chauffeur's daughter with a crush on the playboy son of her father's employer, goes to Paris and returns as a mature sophisticated lady who charms everyone she meets.The picture is enhanced by the direction of Billy Wilder and the casting of Humphrey Bogart and William Holden (Why did they make him blond?)as the Larabee brothers who vie for Miss Hepburn's affections.But the film is clearly Miss Hepburn's and one can see why she was one of the most beloved actresses of her time. Watch Sabrina and you too will fall in love with her. A marvelous film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder, a genius when it came to adapting films from another medium, teamed up with Samuel Taylor, who wrote the play, "Sabrina's Fair", and Ernest Lehman, to create a a delightful comedy that will remain an old favorite because of the great charm the creative men imbued this movie with.Some comments on this forum remark about the disparity of age between Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. They all seem to forget that Ms. Hepburn played opposite with men much older than her, namely, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Rex Harrison, Fred Astaire, Gregory Peck, just to name a few. The actress was always effective and showed she had an enormous charisma no matter who was her leading man."Sabrina" looks as good today, as when it was first released thanks to the timeless black and white photography of Charles Lang. The big asset of the film was the unusual pairing between Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. Both actors were wonderful together, as we witness in the film. William Holden, as the younger Larrabee, is excellent as well.The film is a delightful comedy that, in comparison to Sidney Pollack's misguided and undistinguished attempt to bring it to the screen can't even compare with the witty and elegant film Mr. Wilder gave us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Cast &amp; A Well-Crafted, Worthwhile Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of things work together to make this an entertaining and satisfying picture. With Billy Wilder's story-telling skill, Audrey Hepburn's unsurpassed charm, plenty of talent in the rest of the cast, and a worthwhile story, there is a lot of credit to go around.The story is based the kind of interesting but slight premise that Wilder handles masterfully, and as a result the story is filled with both funny moments and thoughtful moments, all of which work well. There is a variety of well-chosen settings, always interesting but never pretentious.Bogart and Holden both play their roles flawlessly. The two of them make an interesting combination with Hepburn, and it works even better than you could hope. John Williams also plays the proper English chauffeur as few others could have. There are also a number of good moments for the others in the supporting cast.With all the other strengths, it may still be Hepburn's picture most of all.In "Sabrina", she has a role that allows her quite a variety of scenes as her character grows and changes. It plays to all of her strengths, and makes Hepburn herself the most appealing aspect of an enjoyable and well-crafted picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is Audrey Hepburn was the most attractive actress that I've ever seen, and she certainly proves this in this movie.Even in the beginning of Sabrina,Hepburn's voice-over instantly draws your attention to this attractive,well mannered actress.Then when you see Audrey for the first time,it is love at first sight-what a beautiful lady she was!Billy Wilder gets a thumbs up for selecting Hepburn as Sabrina-you could say that Hepburn was Sabrina.She had that unusual charm and magical beauty that very few actresses have(even today).If you get this movie,you'll fall in love with Audrey-just like I have.If you compare this movie to the 1995 remake,this movie wins hands down.Sadly,they don't make movies like this anymore.Am I an Audrey Hepburn fan?Of course I am! I always have been and I always will be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, as I can't see it stated anywhere else; I just have to write it down and see if anybody at all agrees with me. It's very unwise for a Hollywood production to have the stars they've cast shoulder all of the burden of trying to make the script seem convincing.I don't think the screenplay did a very good job at all of explaining just why these two men were so attracted to Sabrina (save for the fact that she happens to be played by one Audrey Hepburn... ) The character of the chauffeur's daughter behaves in the manner of an entitled brat - just because she can't have the man she wants, she writes a bitter little suicide note until she's shuffled off to Paris.Upon her return, only her appearance has changed; her character still remains somewhat aloof, but she's discovered how to utilise her looks to twist men around her little finger. This has the effect of making the two vying suitors we're shown seem shallow. This is a perception that is only confirmed when one of them attempts to woo her using the same seduction techniques he's already tried out on dozens of other girls (yet Sabrina seems amused by this, rather than dissuaded!) Meanwhile, the older brother takes advantage by trying to kiss her under the pretence that he's acting in his missing sibling's stead (as if that type of advance would really go over smoothly... ?!)Throughout the entirety of the film it felt like we were meant to harbour affection for these characters just by virtue of who was playing them; Sabrina/Audrey because of her elfin beauty and gauche naiveté, Linus/Bogart because the payoff is a reversal of what happens in Casablanca and he gets to be with the girl for once. I didn't buy their motivations as anything recognisably human, and therefore didn't derive much satisfaction from the resolution of the story...I think that established persona's and star wattage should only be relied upon to achieve so much. The underlying construction of what they were given to work with just didn't seem solid enough to me. The one benefit to casting icons is that there are very few 'boring' scenes, there are just quite a few scenes that don't appear to make much narrative sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The master of many genres, Billy Wilder, does his magic here with this delightful comedy. Although maybe not one of his best, it still holds up after over 50 years. There has been a lot said about the casting of Bogart as Linus, the stuffy businessman and I disagree with most of it. I think that Bogart is perfect for the part of the seemingly humourless, financial wizard older brother. Granted, he is not the prettiest actor....never was.....he's a generation older than Audrey Hepburn.....and reportedly hated the movie and his co-stars. All that aside, he rose to the occasion and his playing of the role is subtle. Seeing him come to the realization that he is falling in love with Sabrina is so well done that it sneaks up on you.Audrey Hepburn is just magical, as she always was.....there is nothing more to say about her....words fail me.William Holden is surprisingly good in a comic role but why the blonde hair?He's breezy, unreliable and thoroughly likable and it becomes obvious that Sabrina is much too good for him. However incongruous it may seem, she belongs with Bogart.The support in this film is top notch.....John Williams....what a great British character; Walter Hampden is a scream as the drinking, cigar smoking father who just wants an olive for his martini. Look for Nancy Kulp as one of the service staff before her days as Jane Hathaway on Beverly Hillbillys.This is a wonderful film........watch it, you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder and Hepburn make a classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the reason why you watch movies. This is why people feel so strongly about them, make them part of their lives, and love to talk about them. It reminds us of what is good about the movies and makes us long for a time when you can have this kind of talent, both in front of and behind the camera, make wonderful,touching, hilarious films."Sabrina" may not be the best film that Wilder, Bogart, Holden, or Hepburn made, but it came along at a time when all four of them were going through the best part of their careers.Holden was not too far removed from winning the Oscar for "Stalag 17" and was about to enter a "golden" period, starting with "The Country Girl" and continuing on until "Bridge on the River Kwai. Bogart ( a last minute replacement for Cary Grant), had just completed "The Caine Mutiny". Hepburn had just won the Oscar for "Roman Holiday", and Wilder had "Stalag 17" and "Sunset Boulevard" completed, and would have a string of hits that started with "Sabrina" and continue on until "One, Two, Three" in 1961.All of the stars were properly aligned for "Sabrina". Although I think Grant might have been better in the part, Bogart worked hard to be semi-tough and likable. I'll be honest and say I found it disturbing to see him try to win over Hepburn. His features were too worn and hard to be completely winning. He and Holden worked well together, which is amazing when you consider they couldn't stand each other off screen.Hepburn, of course, is gorgeous. She's the perfect combination of charming, elegant, tom-boyishness, and beauty.Wilder does it again with his screenplay and directing. First he assembles an excellent supporting cast, especially Walter Hampden and John Williams. Then he keeps the comedy coming and seldom lets up for us to catch our breath. His use of the camera is terrific too. I love the shot of Bogart at his desk in the distance, while the camera shoots through several doorways.Top notch production, first rate cast and wonderful screenplay and directing add up to a classic every movie lover should own.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn as a mousy chauffeur's daughter? Yes, and she's beguiling trying to gas herself in the garage (before quickly cracking a window) because gorgeous, rich playboy William Holden doesn't notice her. But it's nothing that a little time away in Paris won't cure... Hepburn is absolutely radiant in this picture: dark brows over big Bambi eyes, sensual, flirtatious lips, and that long, long neck. She embodies the spirit of the Cinderella heroine, and director Billy Wilder milks her gamine appeal for all the millions it is worth. Holden is blithe and lively, and Humphrey Bogart manages to make his stuffy unease rather charming. Clever, biting, romantic, sweet, this version of "Sabrina" has it all. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

David (Holden) is the younger of her employer's two sons, and has been married a number of times. Linus (Bogart), the older one, is interested only in the stock market, having no time for women. Sabrina has loved David her whole life, but he "doesn't even know she exists". Trying to rid herself of him, she decides to leave for Paris, where she attends a cooking school. Sabrina returns later, looking like a glamorous woman of the world, and David falls for her.I don't want to say any more, but I advise everyone to immediately go rent this movie.

		<fullReview>'Sabrina' looks at first glance to be one of those rags to riches tales, as Audrey Hepburn's chauffeur's daughter takes herself to Paris and comes back a sophisticated young lady. However, she isn't the one who undergoes the most striking transformation in this charming romantic comedy.William Holden plays the playboy son of the house (and he could probably have done this kind of role in his sleep) while Humphrey Bogart of all people plays his crusty business-focused older brother. Bogart is surprisingly good in this in a rare foray into comedy. Hepburn of course is just luminous. John Williams, as Hepburn's deadpan snobby chauffeur father is good fun, as is Ellen Corby (grandma from 'The Waltons') as Bogart's secretary. And how nice to see 1910s movie idol Francis X Bushman in one of his later character roles (as the father of Holden's intended).This Billy Wilder movie compares well with his more cited titles such as 'The Seven-Year Itch', 'Some Like It Hot', 'Sunset Blvd.', and 'The Lost Weekend'. It is also much better than the remake with Harrison Ford which limped out in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Didn't Cary Grant Do This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina would probably have gotten several stars higher on the list had Billy Wilder gotten Cary Grant who he originally wanted to play the part of Linus Larrabee. Grant was originally supposed to play the role, but according to a recent biography of Wilder, dropped out at the last minute. Wilder went scrambling for a replacement and got Humphrey Bogart instead. He also would have preferred to work with Joseph Cotten who played the part on Broadway, but Paramount said he wasn't a big enough movie name for equal billing with Bill Holden and Audrey Hepburn.In fact Cary Grant was asked and didn't do three Wilder films, this one, Five Graves to Cairo and Love in the Afternoon. Eventually though he did wind up working with Audrey in Charade.Bogey was miscast and he knew it. He also knew that this was Hepburn's film and it was Holden's studio. For whatever reason he was reportedly surly and obnoxious on the set. He's got no spark whatsoever in his performance as Linus. But Hepburn has the spark as does Holden. They were having an affair on set so Sabrina's crush on Holden rings true.Very simply Audrey is the daughter of John Williams, the chauffeur on the Larrabee estate in Long Island. Walter Hampden's the head of the clan and he's got two sons. Sober and industrious Humphrey Bogart and playboy William Holden. Gawky teenager Audrey is crushing out on Holden. Williams decides to send her to Paris and cooking school where she matures.So much so, she catches the eye of both Larrabee boys. Who will she end up with? Fortunately for Bogart he got an Oscar nomination for The Caine Mutiny in the same year so Sabrina didn't do him any harm.Audrey's fans will adore her in this part. Bogey's fans should skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Cinderella story, Audrey is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn, Billy Wilder, Hubert de Givenchy, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Charles Lang. With names like that attached to a project, do you even need a movie? Fortunately we got one. A great one! Sabrina is a charming and moonlit romantic comedy from two masters of the genre. Billy Wilder and Audrey Hepburn. It's essentially a retelling of the classic Cinderella story. The girl who is poor but falls in love with a prince and is made over beautifully to get his attention. There's no wicked step-sisters in Sabrina and no-magical faerie God-mother, but who cares. Hepburn is Sabrina the daughter of a chauffeur to a rich family named the Larrabee's. The Larrabee patriarch has two sons played by Bogart and Holden. Bogart is the older and more business savvy brother. He is realistic and practical and regards the family's name and fortune with the utmost care and regard. This is contrary to Holden who is more of a careless playboy seeking fun and women in life. He's been married three times, always falling in love or at least confusing lust with love. Hepburn at the start of the film is desperately in love with Holden and watches him at a ball from up in the tree under the moonlight. To help her get over her crush she is sent to refining school in Paris where see learns how to cook, speak, and dress. Basically she becomes a lady. What emerges is a swan from the ugly duckling and for the first time Holden sees her and falls in love. However time has passed and Sabrina doesn't exactly feel the same way anymore. Plus Bogart expresses his own interest in the elfin' and glamorous chauffeur's daughter. Watching all this play out in such a romantic and funny way is pure cinema. All the elements come together in this film. Hepburn looks magnificent in Hubert de Givenchy's gowns and dresses. The scenes on the racquetball court are whimsical and absolutely priceless. Frederick Hollander's musical score is breathtaking and haunting, sending the audience far away from their problems and allowing them to become completely involved in the characters and story. Really to tell the truth there isn't much plot, but the story is good because it's so simple. Sabrina isn't a complicated movie at all, nor is it very in depth in exploring what true love is. But at the heart it's a faerie tale. It doesn't need to be realistic or profound. If you're looking for answers about the true nature of love and self-sacrifice then you won't find any in Sabrina. However if you're looking to be swept off your feet and taken to a far away place where naive, blind, and moonstruck romantic love are the rule then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I finally turned the corner on this thing called "mass entertainment." Any movie that doesn't aim higher than being M.E., just is not going to cut it for me. 'Sabrina' is mass entertainment. If you never find anything questionable while you watch movies, you'll like this.'Sabrina' is a viewpoint-shifting mess. By the time it's over we've seen her situation from three different angles, to no discernible benefit; it doesn't feel intentional. The trio of leading characters are all wanting. In a fair number of remarks, Linus (Bogart), a stuffed shirt, obviously thinks Sabrina is pretty dumb. His remarks are the kind a snob makes. It doesn't matter that Sabrina doesn't notice. She's got problems too. She's convinced she wants the movies 'idiot' for most of show. In many, many scenes, Hepburn is just an irritating, girly princess. Hepburn was blessed with astonishing looks but that's not enough, and in about half her movies she's downright petulant and annoying. And the way directors play up her little girlishness is pretty creepy.Bogart looks rather good for someone who's going to die in three years. He looks too old for Hepburn, but he doesn't really look old, per se.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a shocking disappointment. After expecting something that would live up to Hepburn classics such as "Roman Holiday," this movie was a wet, cold slap in the face. The plot is outlandish and obvious, the humor is absurdly broad and Humphrey Bogart, as Linus Larabee, looks old and unhappy, as if he is appearing in the film at the point of a gun. William Holden, as David Larabee, is far too old for his role and he plays the playboy as such a transparent cad that it is hard to generate the slightest sympathy for him. What a free spirit such as Sabrina would see in either man is far from obvious. The development of the supporting characters is bafflingly erratic, particularly Walter Hampden as the Larabee patriarch. Oliver Larabee begins the film as a flinty business man and transforms, without the slightest explanation, into a comic lush by the end. The film is clearly an effort to create an American comedy of manners and class, but the translation into an American setting is a nearly complete failure. I cannot tell how it appeared to audiences at the time, but 50 years on it appears sloppy and dated. It is painful to consider how much more compelling it might have been had Cary Grant taken the role of Linus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie's Society Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tennis, anyone?" That trite statement actually comes from a play. It was spoken by a young, struggling actor of some rugged handsome looks, sometime in the 1920s. He said it with a now - famous trademark lisp. Yes Humphrey Bogart said that line. You see, when he started out in Broadway productions he was a juvenile actor. He played young social butterfly types (hard to believe, isn't it?). But there was a rational reason to think this, among the producers on Broadway - young man Bogart came from a prominent upper middle class family in Manhattan. His father was Dr. Bogart, a physician to wealthy people. His mother was an magazine artist. So yes...one could easily see that young Mr. Bogart would be used to saying things like "Tennis anyone" now and then...and so could play the young friend of the hero or the caddish social butterfly false lover or...well you can picture it! It is with great respect to Humphrey Bogart's determination to be a real actor...to play real people...that he broke out of this cul-de-sac of juveniles and ended up in the roles he is loved for: Rick Blaine, Sam Spade, Charlie Allnut, Fred C. Dobbs, Philip Marlowe, Captain Phillip Francis Queeg, Duke Mantee, Baby Face Martin...characters we know are real for better or worse. Not light hearted society types we will never meet in a million years.Yet Bogie did return to this arena once in his later career - after his only Oscar. In 1954 he played Linus Larribee, older of a pair of brothers (his younger brother is William Holden as David Larribee) who are the heirs to an industrial and shipping empire headed by their father Oliver Larribee (Walter Hampden). Into their upper class lives descends Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn), the daughter of the family chauffeur Fairchild (John Williams). She has long had a crush on David, a real playboy, and once even tried to commit suicide (to be saved by Linus, without his realizing it was a planned suicide). She goes to Paris to study cooking, and returns after two years a sophisticated, attractive woman. And she turns the world of the Larribees upside down.There is a merger in the works between Larribee Industries and the largest sugar cane plantation owner in Puerto Rico (Francis X. Bushman), whose daughter (Martha Hyer) has always liked David. David is not crazy about this, and when he is reintroduced to the new Sabrina he is knocked off his feet. This jeopardizes the entire business plan (which involves using the sugar to manufacture a new type of all-purpose plastic that the Larribees have the patent rights to). Linus, who is the "ant" to David's "grasshopper", is determined to undue the effect of Sabrina on his brother, and (if necessary) romance her himself. He does...only to find that she is quite intoxicating, and that he is falling in love with her.It has been suggested that Bogart was wrong in this film (like Gary Cooper was in Billy Wilder's other Hepburn comedy, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON), because he was too old and his image didn't fit. Well, it is true that we have another May - September relationship here, and that Bogart's personae after his string of memorable performances was not as a financial type. Cary Grant, the original choice for the role, might have seemed better. But Grant is as much a misfire here as Bogart appears to be. The problem is Holden. One can see Bogart as a hard working type and Holden's older brother quite easily, but Grant (with his English accent)would have made Holden seem out-of-place. They would have had to change the Larribees into a transplanted English family in America to make Grant fit in perfectly. That might have worked - but it would have strained belief.Bogart rarely played comic roles after 1940, but in his late 1950s films he did do comedy a bit more (here, in BEAT THE DEVIL, and in WE'RE NO ANGEL). He demonstrates a natural gift for delivering comic lines (after David has an accident with a pair of drinking glasses he sat on, he is recovering and wants to write a poem to Sabrina about the accident - when he asks Linus/Bogart for a rhyme with glass, with a slight pause Linus/Bogart suggests "alas"). His performance is enhanced with his film partners Holden, Hepburn, and Williams and (best of all) Hampden.Williams is quite upset at the idea of his daughter marrying any of the Larribees. He is quite class conscious (and admits it), and in one of Bogart's best moments he tells Williams he is a snob! As for Hampden, one can only bless Wilder for casting him. Walter Hampden was one of Broadway's leading stars (especially in Shakespearean roles) between the teens and the 1930s. His production of HAMLET was considered one of the best ever on the American stage. But he arrived late in Hollywood, and although an impressive character actor rarely got any impressive role. His performance as Oliver Larribee, the last vestige of robber baron elitism in American society is wonderful. This includes his hiding his huge cigars from his wife (he is caught smoking in Linus' clothes closet at one point) to his sputtering about a young débutante with an Adlai Stevenson button. He and Bogart share some nice give and take scenes, courtesy of Wilder's directing, here - just in time for Hampden, who died a year after this film was produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paramount Pictures bought the rights for the Broadway play 'Sabrina Fair' expressly for Audrey Hepburn, coming off of the phenomenal success of her very first film and Oscar win for Best Actress the prior year in "Roman Holiday". With a two million dollar budget and seven weeks of shooting in October/November of 1953, "Sabrina" was filming even before there was a finished script. Director Billy Wilder even asked Hepburn to fake an illness on the day they were shooting a scene still being rewritten! The result however remains one of the all time great romantic comedies, casting Hepburn against a pair of mismatched brothers, David (William Holden) and Linus (Humphrey Bogart) Larrabee. Linus in fact is such a corporate stiff that he's seen dictating a letter to his brother about reporting to work on time, while David seems singularly obsessed with fast sports cars and hit and run marriages. I found it amusingly interesting that the Larrabees were getting into plastics well before Dustin Hoffman could get that advice in "The Graduate".Two years at cooking school in Paris transforms the waif like Sabrina into a fashionable young woman who's learned how to live. Responding to her father's constant lament that she should stop reaching for the moon, Sabrina counters that now ... "the moon's reaching for me".As a stand in for his brother, Bogey proclaims himself Joe College with a touch of arthritis as he begins to court Sabrina. But he does manage to pull off one of the smoothest moves of his movie career when he comments 'it's all in the family' just before kissing her for the first time.One can just imagine how audiences of the 1950's might have been taken with the glamor and party life depicted in the film, unattainable as it was for the majority. Yet in the midst of it all, Audrey Hepburn exhibited a natural and quiet sophistication that endeared her to an entire decade of movie goers. Her self assurance in the role of Sabrina earned her a second Best Actress nomination in as many films.Stay attentive, and you'll catch Bogart's character request his secretary for a pair of tickets to 'The Seven Year Itch". Ever the self promoters, Paramount was already getting audiences ready for their next big hit for the following year, also to be directed by Billy Wilder.</fullReview>

Sabrina Fairchild will always be Audrey Hepburn. I really don't see why people complain Bogart was miscast in the role of Linus Larrabee. He was perfect in it. Is it because he wasn't the so-called "romantic" leading man type one usually has in mind or because of the negative behind the scene stories. If Cary Grant had been cast in the role then David Larrabee wouldn't be that important anymore. Special mention to Walter Hampden as Oliver Larrabee and Ellen Corby as Linus' secretary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, 'Sabrina' may not look like a comedy but that's because the humour is very subtle. There's a party scene where everyone is enjoying themselves, Sabrina and David are having a romantic moment while Linus is in the next room testing the unbreakable plastic. Sabrina's suicide attempt in the garage was hilarious.Coming back to the film, 'Sabrina' is a classic romance. The chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart is very sweet. While it may look like a film about Sabrina's journey to be with her love, it turns out to be someone else's journey. There are some lovely moments between Bogart and Hepburn. The background score adds to the romance. On the surface Hepburn and Bogart may seem like an odd couple but as we see how Billy Wilder brings them on screen, the oddness vanishes. Both the actors are superb. Bogart downplays his part while Hepburn is charmingly vivacious. Holden does well.My only complaint is the David-Alice angle. In the end, why does David decide to go through with marrying Alice since he clearly does not love her? Was that just to create a happy ending? There are some nice location shots of France and America. We don't see much of France but the little we see seems a little too romanticized. The cinematography is good.Billy Wilder's 'Sabrina' is a classic and for me it has stood the test of time. I have seen both remakes earlier and they certainly let down. A great movie for classic romance lovers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful and perfect and impossible to walk away from! Hepburn is sophisticated, (if not a little bit unempowered compared to her later work) and Bogart is absolutely charming. My dad usually hates movies because they are either silly or violent or there's too much sex, but I could bring this one home knowing that everyone would have a good time. We built a fire and drank coffee and curled up for a movie everyone could watch together. The '95 version was not bad either. It captured the heart of the original but placed it I a more recent setting..This movie just made us all feel good and brought us all together. The extravagance of the Larrabee family conjures up the fabulous, dreamy world of yachts and butlers and fine sherry, and Sabrina's innocence/sophistication is completely endearing. It's a great film for a nostalgic, cozy night. I personally recommend it for cold evenings in, an evening of gift-wrapping, or the comfortable come-down time after a huge holiday gathering. Whatever the situation, be sure to catch this one with the people you love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly delightful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rent it, buy it, borrow it if you must, but please watch this movie. It was so enjoyable that within minutes I completely forgot it was black and white. The characters are portrayed so convincingly I never had the impression they were "acting". It was really a charming movie. Even Linus, as played by Bogart, had some really humorous lines all deadpanned as if he were a bit serious when speaking them. The movie flows seamlessly from one scene to the next and never left me craving better dialogue. Modern day movies just don't seem to have the grace of films like this one. It was a treat to be reminded of how people viewed life in that era. A Cinderella story it is indeed, but it is so much more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wilder Shores Of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to be not just stating but over stating the obvious to say yet again that Billy Wilder was a writing-directing genius, that Audrey Hepburn was not only drop-dead gorgeous but also a gifted actress, that Bogie and Bill Holden were consummate professionals who were virtually strangers to bad performances but I'm being constantly reminded that there are people reading these Boards whose parents may not have been born in the era when Sabrina was made and I guess you could argue that those of us a tad longer in the tooth have some kind of moral obligation to discuss artistes whose work is now becoming available on DVD in an effort to help them distinguish the wheat from the chaff. Virtually all the books about Wilder - and possibly Hepburn and Bogie as well - mention the tension on the set between lone wolf Bogie and cosy threesome Wilder, Holden and Hepburn and the amazing thing is that this doesn't show on screen. Wilder makes a big thing out of the fact that the 'Baron' - an outstanding cameo by Marcel Dalio - is making souffles at Hepburns Cooking School in Paris as if to reinforce what he (Wilder) himself is doing from beginning to end in this delightful confection. Everyone was on top of their game and boy, does it show. This is one of those films that no one should even DREAM of remaking because that's like trying to reconstitute as an adult a snowflake that enchanted you as a child. Untouchable, unmissable. As another poster said, this is why we go to the movies, for moments like this. Magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't think it is a "good" movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mediocre is the word that can describe the film.Humphrey Bogart looks truly "exhausted" in the film, and Audrey Hepburn, on the contrary, looks too calm. She behaved just the same before and after her training of how to be a sophisticated lady in Paris. Is there any difference that has been performed by Audrey Hepburn that is supposed to be found between a girl of a humble beginning and a lady that has been influenced by the romance of Paris? There should be, but I could not sense that from the unchanged, undisturbed peaceful look of Audrey Hepburn. Worse is that, this so-called "consistent" look makes Humphrey Bogart quite a stupid old guy who seemed to be waiting for a crush over a young lady...Humphrey Bogart is an actor that is charming when he doesn't mean to. A review of his works might tell us one thing: clever talks and deliberate witty responses didn't give him an Academy Award. But a tough while tender "man" in "The African Queen" gave him that. Why? Because he was tortured by the nature, and no so-called acquired sense of humor that disguises a lonely heart could be found anymore, and till then a real man as well as "actor of the actor" is therefore reborn. I can't agree more with the Academy that they didn't give him the award until he showed what a man really is, definitely not an old rich guy getting on with a romance with a lady whose facial expression doesn't mind a slight change no matter who she's playing! Every one loves Audrey Hepburn. False! Me, at least, feel nothing for her. She was adored by people throughout her life because she had something that a lot of women craved for, especially the so-called elegance and the way she delivered it. Yet, a true movie fan with critical eyes and skeptical thinking will question her position given by the history. Wasn't it a mistake? Katherine Hepburn, Betty Davis, Sophia Loren, and even Vivien Leigh truly truly did a far better job, but they were not so much loved by the audience. Why? Because they were too good to be appreciated...A film critic shall be fair and objective and this is the only thing that I hope for the people who read and is going to read my comment on the movie "Sabrina", an overrated romance full of clichés.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful movie with a great actress - Audrey Hepburn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever wondered why so many people grieved over the loss of Audrey Hepburn, you should rent Sabrina and find out. I sickens me when I think of the actresses we have today and their off-screen antics, but that's another story. Ms. Hepburn gives a wonderful, believable performance as a chauffeur's daughter who goes to Paris and comes back a sophisticated young woman. I enjoyed many of her roles but I think this is my favorite because it is such a lovable and loving role. The storyline is not unique but wears well with age and makes you long for the romantic comedies of 1950s Hollywood.So why did I not give this almost perfect movie a 10? I just never could bond with Humphrey Bogart or his character in this movie. Maybe it was because Mr. Bogart was nearing the end of his life, but there seemed to be a lack of energy and a real sense he was in love with Sabrina or she with him. I heard Cary Grant was supposed to play this role, but I honestly don't know whether it would have made a difference to me - maybe it was just the age thing. James Mason does a better job with a May-December romance in "Georgy Girl" in my humble opinion. But then again, did it really have to be a May-December thing? The storyline really never played on the age difference in the first place. Why not have cast a couple male actors with a slight age difference a little older than Sabrina? They really didn't have to be a lot older than the heroine and it would have been more effective and more believable in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best romantic comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The romantic comedy genre isn't one I usually gravitate towards but since it did star two of my all time favorite actors, Bogart and Holden, it was required viewing for me. I enjoyed the movie immensely despite some issues I had with the plausibility of Sabrina's transformation. The film is moving, thanks mostly to Linus's restrained courting and Sabrina's relationship with her father, and there are wonderful comic moments, thanks to Holden's perfectly timed wise quips and lighthearted nature which clash with the senior Larabee's pragmatism. Hepburn is as charming here as she is in Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's. The ending makes perfect sense given David's commitment problems and the fact that in my opinion Elizabeth seems more alluring than Sabrina, though our heroine is perfect for Linus. Terrific film, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of great reviews posted about this movie -- Don't trust them. I am a big fan of Audrey Hepburn, and a fan of Bogart and Billy Wilder.. Sabrina does none of them justice.In Sabrina (played by Audrey Hepburn) the title character has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old girl. That's okay in a sense, because films are about growing as a person.. but her character only ever grows in superficial ways, entirely subject to the whims of circumstance.No one in this film really knows what they want. The characters are all extremely weak. There are only about 3 or 4 lines where Bogart sounds like himself.It's kind of slow and a little boring. Honestly I only finished watching this movie because I know that Billy Wilder can deliver, and I'm glad I finished it. The ending was good, but overall this movie was definitely below average.There are many films out there I've found to be a lot more satisfying. Charade, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 7 year itch were all better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's As Simple As Getting Caught In The Rain In Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. "Isn't it Romantic?" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of " You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide": "All I can think about is the plastics' merger": "I can make a soufflé out of oyster crackers": "What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?": "Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there"; and finally, "If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, "Sabrina", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, "Sabrina") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; "North By Northwest", "The Sweet Smell of Success" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including "Sunset Boulevard" and "Double Indemnity"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. "Isn't it Romantic?", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: "Isn't it Utterly Human?". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it's more of a feminine word, and not one which I normally use - this movie is one which I would describe (in addition to "superb") as "delightful." Humphrey Bogart made a few more films prior to his death, in his 50's, a little over two years after this movie was released. He was the type of actor (like Nicholson and Redford today), for whom aging did not provide any obstacle, in terms of needing a radical change in his roles -- and we all missed a great deal by his being felled by cancer, without the many additional films he would otherwise have made.The three leads - Bogart, accompanied by Audrey Holden and William Holden, are perfect in their roles. They are throughly engaging in whichever of the three permutations any two are together, as well as when all three are on-screen at the same time.The three primary supporting actors - Bogart's and Holden's wealthy parents, and Hepburn's chauffeur father, are very likable and their parts well-played. The remainder of the supporting cast is excellent, as well.The enjoyment of this film is in no way dependent on any real suspense - the outcome is no surprise, and most of the ongoing events predictable. This is one of those stories where the pure charm of the actors and characters, and a wholly-engaging story stand by themselves for its success.This is also an outstanding nostalgic piece for the film and life styles of the 1950's, and as a memorial to three of movie history's most remembered and honored "A" list personalities.(Since I first saw this film, viewing it again also has a special enjoyment for me, During the latter 1980's - early 1990's, my company employed a marketing consultant for several projects. His office was in the building at 30 Broad St., in New York City. This is the same building actually used in this picture, and with a special sign made for the film, was "The Larabee Building," with the family's home offices. I had occasion to visit my colleague, a native New Yorker, there, many times - as well as seeing a lot of the city as you can enjoy with persons like him and his wife, lifelong, well-connected city residents.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If they had cast a different group of actors to play Sabrina and the Larrabee brothers, I have a feeling that my overall feelings towards the movie would have been different. Sabrina truly succeeds on the weight of its acting. It takes a certain amount of talent to pull off the wit and charisma the script demands but in the end, Bogie ends up being Bogie, Hepburn is Hepburn through and through and Holden plays off both of them. Add a multi-talented supporting cast led, in my opinion, by the classic Walter Hampden and Sabrina becomes a classic Hollywood treat that you can enjoy whenever you're in the mood.Sabrina returns from a two year trip for school to Paris. As the chauffeur's daughter to a wealthy business family, she fancies their younger son, who was not only her childhood friend, but is also the troublesome playboy of the family as well.Although I'm skeptical of some of Sabrina's six Oscar nominations, it's hard to argue that it was a beautiful effort in a year dominated by Brando's On the Waterfront. Anyone curious about why Audrey Hepburn is revered the way she is should check out this movie and draw their own conclusions. Here she is surrounded by an accomplished cast, received an Oscar nomination for her acting, and is forever known as one of Hollywood's all-time greats according to many opinions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through Bogart's laid back cool, to Holden's outlandish car driving and overlooking of the woman that secretly loves him, this is another prime example of Audrey Hepburn's method acting. She's sweet, young, and outgoing as Sabrina, the girl over the garage who falls in love with both sets of brothers who are played as two completely different people. One (Bogart) who resembles more of a father figure, and the other (Holden) acting 25 but looking 42. This movie has turned into a remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear, and though I haven't seen it, I could certainly see it during the movie. It was a very strong film that wasn't the kind you would catch yourself "ooh" ing over, just your classic staple of a confused love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder classic romantic comedy with Audrey Hepburn as a chauffeur's daughter who goes off to Paris and becomes cultured, then returns home to catch the attention of wealthy playboy William Holden. This doesn't sit well with Holden's older brother, Humphrey Bogart, so Bogie sets out to split the pair up by wooing Audrey himself. There's a lot of love for this movie and it's not hard to see why, with solid direction, a good script, and a trio of legends starring. Unfortunately, I've never really loved this one. The main reason for that is that I feel like Humphrey Bogart was just terribly miscast due to his thirty-year age difference with Audrey Hepburn. He was older than John Williams, the guy playing Audrey's father in this. I can't help but think that casting someone like Gregory Peck, who was just two years older than William Holden and had such wonderful chemistry with Audrey in Roman Holiday, might have improved things on the romantic end. Despite Bogart's age and reported unhappiness on set, he does a good job. Audrey's charming and beautiful as always. Love her wardrobe in this. Holden has a nice chemistry with her (the two were involved in real life) but I've never been overly impressed with him and this does little to change that opinion. He does fine, I'll leave it at that. It's a fun movie and hard to dislike, in spite of some quibbles I have. It's primarily a showcase for Audrey and worth a look for her alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slickly done Cinderella story. And who wouldn't root for the gamin princess, Hepburn. One minute she's a plain Jane chauffeur's daughter, the next she's the belle of the high-falutin' ball, thanks to a Paris makeover. No more hiding in a tree watching the beautifully upholstered cavort around the employer's mansion. Now she's a center of every guy's attention. But she's got to decide which of the two millionaire sons (Bogart &amp; Holden) to tie up with, which means crossing a tricky class line. Oh my, such a dilemma for a poor servant's daughter.As I recall, the movie was quite a hit. Certainly Hepburn's svelte figure and pixie-like features presented quite a contrast to the bosomy blonde sex goddesses of the day. All in all, she's a highly appealing screen presence whether as a tree waif or as the belle of the ball. Bogart's a rather odd choice as the older brother. He's showing his age and unfortunately only a couple years away from an untimely passing. Still, he and the much younger Hepburn manage to make their scenes together fairly believable.The plot's really little more than a showcase for screen vet Bogie, and the fast-rising Hepburn and Holden. Good thing the filming effort seems so effortless since many of the later scenes stretch beyond necessity, no doubt to accommodate the two leads. Overall, what the movie shows is how really slick Hollywood professionalism can transform a slender story idea into an appealing movie experience, regardless of length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Larrabees are a wealthy family, living in a palatial estate on Long Island. Oldest brother Linus (played by Humphrey Bogart) is the formal, dour businessman, running the family company. David (William Holden) is a playboy. Among the staff living on the estate is the family chauffeur, Thomas Fairchild (John Williams), and his shy, awkward, plain daughter, Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn). Sabrina has had a crush on David for most of her life but he has hardly noticed her. Sabrina goes to study in Paris and comes back, two years later, a changed woman. She's sophisticated and beautiful and soon catches David's eye. However, David is engaged to Elizabeth Tyson (Martha Hyer), the daughter of a business mogul whose company Linus wants to merge with that of the Larrabees. If Sabrina wrecks the David- Elizabeth relationship it would likely spell the end of the business merger. Linus sets out to prevent Sabrina from getting in the way but in the process falls for her himself.Directed by one of the all-time greats, Billy Wilder, and starring Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn and William Holden this movie oozes class and style. Substance is in shorter supply, however. Plot is charming though a bit clumsy and not entirely solid. Some elements were too convenient or too contrived. Bogart and Holden were too old for their roles and Bogart seems overly stiff as Linus.However, Audrey Hepburn more than makes up for this, bringing beauty, sweetness, charm and elegance and lighting up the screen.Overall, a good romantic-drama, but hardly a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly Conceived Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Billy Wilder, old movies and this trio of stars, I was looking forward to this. But I feel it's a bit of a letdown. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, is luminous (and she is, as usual, paired off with a suitor far too old for her). But part of the problem is what the story does with her character. She pines away for Holden, and then goes away to cooking school in Paris. Why does she go? Did she want to go? Unknown. While away, she writes her father a letter saying she is over Holden. But then, when she returns, she (in a rather absurd coincidence) runs into him at the train station. The two connect. So she wasn't over him after all? Or was she over him, but then fell back in love when she saw him? What was her plan if she hadn't coincidentally run into him? Who knows? Later, Bogart and Holden sort out which of them gets to "have" her, which is rather sexist and also robs her of her agency. (Surely a charming girl like that must have other options besides a buffoon and an old man.) Holden hasn't been given much of a character to play. He's all charm and nothing else. The script never rounds him out with grace notes that might have helped us to understand why he lives such a vacuous life. As an actor, Holden has consistently shown an ability to locate the darkness buried inside his characters, but he never seems to tap into that quality here. (It might have been interesting if Hepburn, during the course of dating Holden finally realized what a shallow loser he is and dumped him. And then maybe Holden, in turn is forced to reexamine his life. But the story never explores that darker, more interesting possibility. Instead, Hepburn is a pawn in the men's games.) As for Bogart, he was, of course, one of our great stars and did amazing work in dramas and crime stories. But in a light romantic comedy like this, he's very much out of his element, like Holden is. (Bogart took the role after Cary Grant turned it down.) Bogart manages to capture the cold sourness of his character just fine, but he never locates the man's gradual transformation into a guy in love. He never seems interested in Hepburn at all, which is oddly something of an accomplishment, given how beautiful Hepburn is. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bogart is too old, unattractive and emotionally cold for Hepburn to ever give him the time of day. When these two would-be lovers are reunited at the very end of the film, they hug rather than kiss. It's as if the filmmakers are acknowledging the absurdity of that these two might actually be right for each other. Or perhaps they know that there's something rather gross about the fifty-ish Bogart kissing the twenty-ish Hepburn.</fullReview>

She was in love with Holden her entire life, and then Humphrey was able to on a whim make her forget Holden and fall in love with him. And, there was no great chemistry between them as it happened. He really was too old for the role and not only too old but just not good for it. It just didn't make much sense to me. There should be some romantic deep moments or something to justify such a story. And the ending also, wasn't believable. Great classic actors miscast. Miscast big time! They didn't jell together.

		<fullReview>In terms of the plot and story, the movie is good, it develops slowly and while often things appear to be strange, they do make sense at the end. Light entertaining movie, Audry Hepburn, anyone will fall in love with her! I am rating it 6, because the movie seemed to be ordinary, and just found the ending sick. Please don't read from here, if don't want to know the climax. Just because, someone is rich, caring, doesn't mean he can become a husband. He's fatherly for her. His demeanor, personality, and shrewdness is often cheap and while looking at the role of 22-years old Audry Hepburn, he doesn't seem to be suitable for her. On this count, the movie did disappointed and left a bitter feeling at the end. Even if they could have shown it, her leaving David (and Linus too), that would have appeared more graceful. It would have portrayed the feelings of female pride, independence, yet tender nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sabrina (1954)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Girl loves boy. Boy ignores girl. Girl returns home. Boy lusts over girl. You get the picture. It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of a romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This mayn't be the best of Billy Wilder's films, but it is one of his most underrated. As a romantic comedy, it is funny, sophisticated and moving, with beautiful production values, a delightful script and sparkling performances. Wilder's direction is great, while the story is clever and engaging. I also love the cinematography and especially Audrey Hepburn's dresses. The score is romantic, and the script is wonderful and sparkles like bubbles and champagne. I heard this film had a difficult production, if that were the case I don't think it showed. The performances are equally wonderful. The lovely Audrey Hepburn is radiant and charming, William Holden shows real star quality and despite the claims he hated doing Sabrina Humphrey Bogart(or so I think) is perfectly cast. In conclusion, this film is a gem. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn is a chauffeur's daughter who sets her sets her sights on the playboy of the manor (William Holden) in "Sabrina," a 1954 comedy directed and written by Billy Wilder and starring the above plus Humphrey Bogart as Linus, Holden's brother. Holden plays David - and he's the man Sabrina has loved from childhood. When she returns from studying cooking in Paris, she's grown into a beautiful, chic young woman, and David notices her for the first time. Because David is engaged to a "suitable" woman and fearful of him causing yet another scandal with a woman, Linus tries to distract Sabrina by making a play for her himself.All the actors are superb, of course, if the casting is a tad odd. As usual, Hepburn is playing opposite men many years her senior - Holden by 11 years and Bogart by 30. People often ask the reason for this occurring again and again with Hepburn. The answer is easy. Though she is actually of the Tab Hunter-Robert Wagner era, which is the first group after the Golden Age of Hollywood, Hepburn was a much bigger star and much more sophisticated than anyone of her generation of actors - as big and sophisticated, in fact, as stars of the golden age. Therefore, she was always cast with equals. Can you see her costarring with Tab Hunter? No. Sabrina is a perfect role for her - gamine, sophisticated in her Givenchy gowns, wide-eyed with that amazing smile. Bogart wanted Bacall in this role - she was too worldly to play Sabrina.Originally the Bogart character was to be played by Cary Grant, which makes a little, if not a lot more sense. Holden's hair was dyed blond to give him a younger appearance. At 35, he is disarmingly handsome, very charming and quite funny. He and Bogart don't look much like brothers. A bigger problem, in my opinion, is that Hepburn and Bogart don't really click, as good as they both are in their roles, and they are great. When Wilder was asked about how difficult Bogart was, he shrugged it off. "Didn't he make fun of your accent?" the interviewer pressed. "Oh, everyone did that," Wilder said. "It doesn't matter. All was forgiven" - and he made reference to Bogart's dreadful death from esophageal cancer.I know many will not agree, but the only downside of this film for me was the ending - without giving anything away, I just didn't buy it. However, it is highly recommended and a wonderful movie. You might not share my feelings about the ending, which will make it even more enjoyable.Wilder told a story about not having the script finished and asking Hepburn to stall for time in filming the office scene where she pretends to be holding a board of directors meeting. "She would say she forgot a line..." Wilder recalled. "You see, what Marilyn did naturally, Audrey had to work at."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Cinderella Story: Director/Auteur Billy Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Sabrina" (1954) Audrey Hepburn plays the role of a chauffeur's daughter named Sabrina Fairchild. Sabrina has always had her eye on a man by the name of David Larrabee (William Holden), but David never paid any attention to her. He lives in an estate with his wealthy parents, his brother Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart) and many servants, as well as Sabrina and her father. Sabrina's father, Thomas Fairchild (John Williams), sends her to Paris for several years to study Culinary Arts, where at first all she could think of was David. When she returned, she had matured, and David is still on her mind. David finds her stunning and loves her. However, David is engaged to be married, so Linus proposes a plan to ship Sabrina back to Paris without David's knowledge. After spending several days together, Linus and Sabrina fall in love with each other. Their love affair cause chaos and confusion for everyone."Sabrina" is a classic romance movie with a twist of comedy and drama. This movie tells people everywhere that they can find love in places they would have never expected, even their own backyards. In many ways "Sabrina" follows the same format as the classic Cinderella story, in which a young, poor child grows up and falls in love with a rich, handsome prince, or in this film, a business man and his chauffeur's daughter who eventually fall in love.Billy Wilder could not have chosen a more perfect person to play the role of Sabrina. Audrey Hepburn's innocence and charm makes Sabrina seem realistic. Hepburn's wardrobe for that time period makes her look the part of a young child turned fashion icon. Humphrey Bogart, on the other hand, seems a few years older than the character he is trying to portray, unlike his co-star William Holden. Holden does a wonderful job of playing the role of the wild, promiscuous male. Together the trio make a great team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderfully enjoyable Billy Wilder comedy-romance, 'Sabrina' works so well because of the perfect casting of Audrey Hepburn as the lovestruck chauffeur's daughter, Sabrina Fairchild. This is Hepburn's production, and she is a delight in every scene. William Holden and Humphrey Bogart are two of the most mismatched brothers you'll ever see on screen, but they both turn in their customary solid performances to assist in making 'Sabrina' one of the most lovely films of the 50's.Sabrina Fairchild is a chauffeur's daughter who lives at the Larrabee estate. She has always been infatuated with handsome younger son David (Holden), a playboy and heart breaker if there ever was one. But he simply does not care for he nor notice her, and poor Sabrina has to watch on from a tree as he romances pretty ladies at a family party. Unhappy with her present state, she locks herself in the garage and turns on all the car engines, hoping the fumes will engulf her. Good old reliable Linus (Bogart), the elder brother to David, finds her in the nick of time, and saves her from what could have been a very nasty fate. After all, Sabrina is off to Paris soon.In Paris she enjoys herself and meets a wealthy old Count who is only too happy to escort her to balls and buy her pretty things. She returns from Paris the epitome of glamorous perfection- just like the Audrey Hepburn we are used to. She's beautiful and sophisticated, and David does recognize her at first. Of course, she still wants David, and suddenly his blinders have been taken off and he starts to fall for her. A big problem crops up when Sabrina beings to fall in love with the sensible, less exciting yet kind Linus. Linus has feelings for her too, so what we have is a very intriguing brother-girl-brother love triangle! Hepburn is luminous as Sabrina, this may well be the film in which she looks her most beautiful. Her costumes by Givenchy are STUNNING, and Hepburn also proves her unique quality as an actress, turning in a very good performance. The early winsomeness and charm is there in droves, and everyone who sees this will very likely fall in love with her, just like the Larrabee brothers.Holden and Bogart are good in their roles, with many viewers having a query with the significant age gap between Bogart and Hepburn. Yes, he is a lot older than her, but Bogart's control and skill as an actor make this seem less so. By embodying his character as a busy man who has not found the time to fall in love or the right girl who understands him to fall in love with, Bogart oversteps the trap of playing just a simple 'old guy looking for a young pretty girl to wait on him'. Bogart didn't like himself in the role, or the film, but many fans sure did and still do! Wilder's direction and script also contribute to making this film a classic. Beautiful, enchanting and romantic, 'Sabrina' is a wonderful film. I can't use enough superlatives to describe it, unfortunately.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, Very Cute!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The three stars, , Bogart Hepburn and Holden enliven this very cute romantic comedy. Hepburn (Sabrina) is lovesick over the carefree David Larrabee (Holden). She even attempts suicide but fails over her grief. So her father ships her off to Paris to learn about the world, sophistication and cooking. She returns a lovely and charming young lady. Hepburn looks absolutely breathtaking. I even rewound the DVD to catch a glimpse of her in her shorts. And those stems of hers, whoooieee! Just a little eye candy for 1954. Anyhow, Linus Larrabee (Bogart) courts Sabrina in an effort to distract her from David. He eventually succeeds. The reason was to prevent the wealthy Larrabee family from a scandal of getting hitched with their chauffeur's daughter. However, Linus finds himself falling in love with Sabrina, but tries desperately to hide it. Bogart is good as the dour and business-like brother. He even has some cool delivery with dry humored one-liners. Hepburn is absolutely luminous and doesn't miss a beat. Holden is good at times, although I wish they could have cast someone else. This is a cute romantic comedy of the 1950's and I hope it can be shared with the younger generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classy tale with a sharp wit and romantic side that is true and light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina, on the surface, is very much like a fairy-tale, but in that context Billy Wilder gets to play around a bit. Not so much that the material gets too dark- this isn't Sunset Blvd after all- but just enough so that you and I know who the devil made it. It's a story of a girl, dreamy-eyed Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn), a chauffeur's daughter, who has had a crush on one of the two brothers of a prestigious/wealthy family on Long Island all her life. But she is sent off to France to learn how to cook, and she returns as a strikingly beautiful woman to the brother David, who before saw her as just the chauffeur's daughter. But before he can toss away his (next) marriage on Sabrina- not to mention a merger of a plastics deal- the older, loner brother Linus who runs the company, wants to try and sway Sabrina from being with David... and in the process falls in love himself.There is the romance, and the comedy, but also a firm study of class. It's interesting that it's Sabrina's father, Thomas Fairchild (John Williams) is even more opposed to her daughter dating a Larrabee than the patriarch Larabbee is. Why can't she just become a cook, he says, and be apart of that class? The patriarch has his concerns as well, but even Linus, after a momentary look at David thinking "what are you doing dancing with Sabrina" realizes David should be able to whatever he pleases - "It's the 20th century after all", he says. To which the father responds, "Why, I could pick a century out of a hat, blindfolded, and come up with a better one." And yet for Wilder's commentary, via the original play and screenplay, he also serves up some classic Hollywood escapism. What woman wouldn't want to have a kind of story like Sabrina's where love is just so much in or out of reach as to be unattainable, but things always seem bright (that is unless one has to sail off to Paris all by your lonesome). And Wilder casts just perfectly well to suit the wonderful dialog; Hepburn makes this film, even more than her male co-leads, as an adorable figure, irrepressible but with some deeper subtext to her (watch her as she quietly contemplates her lot before her silly botched suicide letter/attempt in the garage). Bogart, despite criticism of being too old for the part, plays his notes of comedy, sincerity and uncertainly just right (I loved the scene on the sailboat where she asks about his past loves, and his response being classic Bogie). And despite his original misgivings with Wilder's sense of comedy, he rises to the occasion just as well as the naturally charming William Holden, who is given one of the longest but funniest ass-jokes in movie history.Sabrina isn't the stuff of super-academic or intellectual movie-going. It's a perfect example, however, of how to do a fluffy-but-serious romantic comedy right. Writers (err hacks) who are assigned the drek that is meant to pass as the rom-com genre today should take a look back at Sabrina to see what makes characters likable or just meaningful, what makes a story work in such a context, and what the right casting can do even when the material is 'light' in nature.</fullReview>

Bushman, Walter Hampden, Marcel Hillaire, Joan Vohs, Marcel Dalio, Ellen Corby, David Ahdar, Marjorie Bennett, Colin Campbell, Charles Harvey, Nancy Kulp, Kay E. Kuter, Paul Harvey, Bill Neff, Emory Parnell, Marion Ross, Emmet Morgan, Kay Rieh....Director Billy Wilder."Once upon a time in the north shore of Long Island".......Released in 1954, director Billy Wilder's "Sabrina" was a highly popular romantic comedy and yet another smash hit for actress Audrey Hepburn, who was still a new star in the Hollywood firmament, having won the Oscar for her debut film Roman Holiday" in 1953, starring opposite Gregory Peck. She had been born in Belgium to a wealthy British banker and a Dutch baroness, survived the horror of siege and starvation in WWII. In the years following the wars, she delved into ballet and modeling. Before long, Hollywood became enamored of her. With her exotic voice, elfin charm and impossibly thin body, she was a different creature from the other Hollywood female stars of her day. Here she plays, Sabrina Fairchild, the daughter of a chauffeur to a wealthy family, the Larrybees, in Long Island, presumably in the early to mid 50's. She has always nurtured a secret crush on the spoiled and careless playboy David Larabee (played by William Holden who dyed his hair blonde for the role). To get over him and to learn a trade, her father sends her to a cooking school in Paris. There she meets an old Baron who teaches her to be sophisticated and worldly, in hopes she'll return to attract David. She returns to discover that David is engaged, although he is now drawn to the new Sabrina. Before long, David's uptight, workaholic businessman brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) also falls for Sabrina. The tide turns when Sabrina returns Linus' newly-sprung affection. The romantic comedy was quite modern in its theme of social climbing and going after what you want, making Audrey Hepburn a very modern heroine in the movies. But the touchy subject of class and social status, as well as liberal ideas such as going after what you want, is never drilled into the viewer's brain with sharp pain but is instead beautifully handled as a romantic comedy and leaves a good taste in your mouth. Audrey Hepburn, who would become a fashion icon, wears the gorgeous Oscar-winning costumes by Edith Head and her long time French designer Givenchy quite well, but her acting is always above reproach, making her more than simply a model in front of a movie camera. She was able to suffuse the otherwise bland role with enough wit and punch as to make her sympathetic. Veteran star Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca) is simply wonderful and in the latter scenes with Hepburn there is quite a lot of chemistry between them. This "Cinderella" type story is incredibly well-written, with an unabashed satirical commentary on the pretentious upper-class and the social class barriers, which was as much a problem in the 50's as it is today, believe it or not. Sabrina is far from being a gold digger, for she is capable of really loving both David and Linus and if she is going after what she wants, this is a modern trait that women at the time would applaud. Hepburn's charm and girlish spirit keeps her from appearing like some cold-hearted gold-digger. Rather than pulling a few tricks to get the rich man of her dreams, she merely blossoms into beauty and "becomes who she really is". As usual, she is paired with an older man, Bogart in this case, as she was to do in later films- with Fred Astaire in "Funny Face" ('57), with Cary Grant in "Charade" ('63), etc; this always done to emphasize Hepburn's youthful appearance. As in "Funny Face" and even "My Fair Lady" (64), Hepburn goes from plain, unattractive girl to beautiful woman in a classic ugly duckling/swan transformation. This film is greatly responsible for the inspiration of later films, such as Gary Marshall's 1990 movie "Pretty Woman". In 1995, a re-make of "Sabrina" was released, starring Julia Ormond and Harrison Ford, a beautiful if strangely diverse updated and modern tribute to this classic film. Original music by Frederick Hollander, providing the movie with romanticism and nice melodies, art direction by Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira and fine cinematography by Charles Lang. This is a great movie with lots of heart and a classic of 50's American cinema. Look for such interesting tidbits as Humphrey Bogart's "Casablanca" fedora hat, a mention of "The Seven Year Itch" which was a play at this time and would be director Billy Wilder's next film, a film which would make a greater star out of Marilyn Monroe and look for a small bit part played by Marion Ross (the mother in "Happy Days").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bubbly and Shrewd, the Wilder Touch Is Ever Present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its cynical humor and the European-based sensibilities around different classes, this is most definitely a Billy Wilder picture. Truth be told, it is not quite in the same league as other Wilder classics like "Sunset Boulevard", "Some Like It Hot" or "The Apartment", but on its own, it's an airy soufflé of a comedy served on a perfectly lovely warming dish. What I like most about this movie is that Wilder keeps the fairy tale trappings of the story grounded in mordant wit and shrewd observations about business mergers, bribery and class snobbery. This is what keeps this movie surprisingly fresh today and why I assume it was ripe for a remake by Sydney Pollack. But only Wilder is capable of making a suicide scene in an extra large multi-car garage slyly funny or a discussion about class differences between a chauffeur and his employer seem mutually patronizing.Torn between the characters played by her leading men, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, Hepburn as a chauffeur's daughter is charming. This was her first introduction to Givenchy fashion on screen, and the difference in her appearance between "Roman Holiday" and "Sabrina" is actually more startling than the one in the movie itself. It is no wonder she became such a style icon from that point forward. With his street-savvy screen persona oddly out of place within the blue-nose Long Island surroundings, Bogart comes across as rather dour in his role of older brother Linus, a role ideally pegged for Cary Grant who canceled at the last minute...damn the luck. On the other hand, Holden is hilariously breezy as shallow, ne'er-do-well younger brother David. I always wished he did more comedy during his lengthy career. The ending is inevitable, but leave it to Wilder to mix sweet and sour better than a Cantonese restaurant. The DVD also includes a brief making-of documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Sabrina, it's a great film. Simple plot: a young girl goes to Grance and comes back a young woman, catching the eye of her boss. Audrey Hepburn is strikingly beautiful in this ? her beauty alone carries the movie. William Holden is well cast as the playboy son. But poor old Humphrey Bogart is dreadfully miscast as the wise older businessman brother. There is, unfortunately no chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn. Cary Grant would have been much better but he foolishly backed out. He would have been the perfect candidate. Despite the lack of chemistry ? and although a large part of the film, doesn't make Sabrina an unwatchable bad film. What the film lacks in chemistry it makes up in great direction, story, script, scenery and acting. You cannot help but love it. Without the immense appeal of Audrey, this film would probably have not been so successful. Sabrina is a film anyone can watch and fall in love with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this movie when I found it in a high street shop for three ninety nine. Being a fan of the old classic movies i thought i should give it a go. I did and enjoyed every minute. As is traditional for Humphrey Bogart or Bogie as he is known he plays a smooth, charming sophisticated character with ease and this is apparent throughout. He also reveals in a very believable way his soft side when he admits his reasons for remaing single in the movie and his hurt of a past girlfriend, and of course he is the only actor who can produce the line "its all in the family" in such a way as I find it sweet yet amusing. Willian Holden also shines in this movie as the rich and wealthy playboy yet is slightly unconvincing in the role of playboy turned to lover. He does however make the film amusing with a scene when he is having glass removed from you know where. And also implies humour when asking Lynes what rhymes with glass when later trying to compose a poem to Sabrina. Audrey hepburn shows her acting talent aswell as her beauty in this movie as she wraps the two larabee brothers roung her fingers. Its fun to watch and is another film that shall remain a great tribute to the great Billy Wilder who has given us movies like this and some like it hot also a well worth movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After MANY years gone by, I saw SABRINA last night on a local station's Sunday night classic movie offering. Delightful. You may stop reading here.There inevitably are some addenda to show how clever I am:Bogart was working hard, but frankly was seriously mis-cast. His age did not work against him, not at bit of it, but his personality, even his face. I doubt he could smile without looking hardened or sinister, important in much of his work, but not wanted here in romantic comedy. There was the scene coming home in the open car -- his sad line about being ten years younger -- when he looked not like a greying fuddy-duddy wishing he could charm the young beauty next to him, but a thug.Holden looked much more comfortable than in the more celebrated role in SUNSET BOULEVARD. He also was able to display his athletic prowess.The title character displayed her considerable charms in costumes daring, if improbable, for the mid-'50s. Those SHORT shorts and the one piece outfit more dance costume than street clothes. Accordingly . . . I could not take my eyes off her.This is a fine period piece, but allow some social commentary. Bogart's character speaks for the Good Corporation, a philosophy which arose after the Second World War as reaction to the piratical reputation, businessman as callous heavy, that reached apogee in the 1930s. Did he want money? No. He had always had plenty. Power? Rather too vulgar. No, he wanted to use the might of his capital to create a better world. He got to me, this pug-ugly little guy in his plush office. He definitely deserved to Get The Girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sabrina - variations of an old theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does it tell about me that I'm so thrilled by the movie "Sabrina"? I first saw it (the original) once or perhaps more than once when I was a teen. It did impress me but I sort of forgot about it. As a grown-up I heard of the remake and as a fan of Harrison Ford bought the video. I loved it and watched it several times.Now, I finally got back to the original as it was sold on DVD for a nice price. The old magic is back and even stronger. Emotionally, this script and both its interpretations capture me. In my opinion both versions have excellent casts including the supporting characters. Scripts and dialogs are witty and captivating. In retrospect it is really amazing how similar both versions are regarding the script as well as their mental effect on me. The newer one seems to be just this: a nicely refreshed version of the original one.After watching Sabrina of 1954 again, I read from different sources about the trouble between Bogart and his co-stars. This knowledge took a little from my genuine pleasure. On the other hand a certain dislike of Hepburn by Bogart might even have helped to make him believable as Linus. I suppose he's meant to struggle against his feelings for Sabrina - and this shows in a subtle way (even if it might be Bogart trying to hide his lack of interest in Hepburn).There are several absolutely funny scenes in the movie but my favorite scene is the dancing scene with Sabrina and Linus in the indoor tennis court. It's wonderfully written and performed great - even more regarding the possible problems between the two leads. It shows a good deal of chemistry - at least in my opinion.I'll continue to watch and enjoy both versions of the movie probably because I'm a romantic at heart and true romance is so scarce in today's world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be confused with the teenage witch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to be something of a romantic to fully appreciate this remarkable film. It helps a lot to be enchanted with Audrey Hepburn, as most of us are. Her performance as the daughter of a chauffeur who gets to choose between two very rich brothers, David and Linus Larrabee (William Holden and Humphrey Bogart), is subtle, slightly mysterious and delightful. Much of the enchantment of her character is based on things implied rather than things said or acted out. We know that her metamorphosis in Paris is guided by the 74-year-old Baron St. Fontanel (Marcel Dalio), whom she meets at cooking school. We can discern that she learned more than how to crack an egg. The transformation of her heart from one brother to the other is revealed primarily in her facial expressions as she measures kisses and the sharp stab of pleasure in the center of her soul. We are kept in limbo about whom she chooses until the very end.This is a girl's fantasy for grown-ups, and one of the best of its kind. The script, from the play by Samuel A. Taylor, is well-paced and psychologically true in a way that is not immediately obvious. The dialogue, while clearly dated and somewhat pedestrian at times, nonetheless stands up well. The sets are large, very large (director Billy Wilder loved to give us a sense of the vastness of the American corporate empire at mid-century): the Larrabee offices, the garage where Sabrina starts all the cars (I think her father, sleeping overhead really would have awaken instead of just tossing and turning), the family estate with its indoor and outdoor pools and courts. There's some pleasant diversion with old man Larrabee (Walter Hampden) and his huge cigars and olives. (The way Bogie is able to smash the little jar, swoop up the olive and land it in the mouth of the old guy in quick motion was a nice trick that surely wowed them on the set. Did Bogie cut his hand or Hampden swallow some glass?) The servants as Sabrina's cheering section and her father (John Williams) with his very correct class prejudices divert us as well.As for "old stone face" Bogart being miscast, I don't necessarily agree, but certainly Cary Grant would have been a better match for Miss Hepburn, as we would see in Charade (1963). William Holden, on the other hand (in blond coiffeur), seemed completely at ease in a comedic role. Nonetheless, the cynical edge that lent depth to his character in, e.g., Sunset Boulevard and Stalag 17, was entirely absent here. I think a scene in which he sardonically justifies his playboy ways might have fleshed him out more.As for Miss Hepburn, she was entirely involved, subtle, driven, nearly flawless, warm and winning. She is especially gorgeous in black and white. Bogart didn't particularly care for her, I understand, complaining about the many takes in her scenes with him. But she was nearly an ingenue, in her second important film, and he was, in his fifties, the veteran of many, many movies. Somehow they both overcame the lack of chemistry, and in a way, made their relationship "sensible" rather than heated. I think Wilder didn't mind this because he was aiming at something deeper than "happily ever after."Of course Wilder employs a voice-over, a kind of Wilder signature, almost a joke, because as usual the device is abandoned before long. However it did allow us to hear Hepburn begin the film with the magical words, "Once upon a time..." as she describes the fairyland of her childhood, the Larrabee estate.She this for Audrey Hepburn, who occasionally played a teenager in film, but was never one.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

Audrey Hepburn is Sabrina, a chauffeur's daughter that falls in love with her father's employer's playboy son (William Holden). The playboy's older brother, played by Humphrey Bogart, pretends to woo the young and charming Sabrina; only to actually fall in love with her.Also in the cast are Martha Hyer, John Williams and Francis X.

		<shortDescription>Charmed and charming, funny and warm, New York and Paris (kind of)...a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina (1954)A sweet, lightly comic film with impeccable credentials, including director (and writer) Billy Wilder. Audrey Hepburn had become a sensational star the previous year with Roman Holiday and she is the charm and light of this one. There is a slight echo of the earlier movie, in reverse--she is now the poor girl who is mistaken (at times) for being cultured and rich, and throughout there are the slight, American versions of class structure being broken down. Mostly though, this is about a girl in love, but mostly in love with being in love, and it doesn't totally matter to whom. Certainly the one she thinks is so wonderful is not, though he's charming in the likable way that William Holden, probably a cad himself, is so good at. Playing his older brother in the film (forget family resemblance here) is Humphrey Bogart, a nice, somber guy completely caught up in being a successful businessman. And so there is a natural set up for conflicts and jealousies, and confusion. It's not quite a classic screwball comedy, though it's funny in a warm way all the way through. The seriousness that Hepburn brings to her role is less crazy and more charming and delightful. And romantic. We need her to be dreamy, and she comes through. Once the end approaches, we really don't care too much what happens as long as she is happy, and we are content enough it works out the way it does for the two brothers, with a small twist or two right up to the end. I do quaff slightly at Hepburn being even remotely interested in the Bogart character, so obviously three times her age and dull as a brick (he is no Rick here). I suppose it fits every older man's desire (in the audience) to think they might actually be attractive to someone so young and obviously pretty. This gets pulled off more convincingly in Hepburn's next major film, where Cary Grant did after all pull if off, Charade, if only because Cary Grant is Cary Grant. But I know, we are supposed to close our eyes to logic in nutty comedies, and the rest of the set-up manages to stay intact here on Long Island, 1954. Bogart certainly is a model of kindness and patience, and we can see a young woman wanting that in her man, whatever their ages. A highlight for me: Hepburn sings "La Vie en Rose," the Piaf hit, while they drive in the car. Twice. Makes you want to go to Paris.Bogart was apparently such a nasty presence during the shooting (partly because he was a replacement for, yes, Cary Grant, who backed out), he later apologized to Wilder. And Hepburn's gowns (which are part of the plot as well as the usual necessity) are not by Edith Head (who won and accepted an Oscar for them) but by Givenchy, who continued a long association with Hepburn. The 1995 remake? Well, the plot line is intact, and you might prefer the new style of acting and filming, but for me this old one has just a perfect balance of love and lunacy, with great writing and a wonderful awkward central cast. I mean, a somber Bogart and zany Holden vying for the ever delicate and slightly clueless Audrey Hepburn? Who would have thought that would work? It does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is simple. read the names of director and actors. see few scenes. and the verdict is clear. but Sabrina has the precious gift to be more than a charming story or the stage for the grace, subtle games and seductive acting of Audrey Hepburn. the spell of film is complex and almost touching. because it is a trip across the sensitivity of a period, social differences clash, flavor of modern fairy tale - but not so modern - and the air of dreams about stars, princesses, true love. it has humor and slices of lesson about life, it has a special note and the best director for a delicate subject. because the story of Cinderella is always far to be easy.Audry Hepburn is the star and this is not surprising. but her beauty and shine and fascinating manner to use each nuance of the sides of role is result of the connection with her partners. and this small detail does Sabrina almost perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Tale of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic love story portrayed with a star-studded cast is a category where the 1954 version of "Sabrina" can be found. A girl of lower standing desperately in love with the neighborhood boy from high society while his family disapproves any union between them due to a business-related marriage already in the works. Who wouldn't want to watch this black-and-white love story?This movie is made even more appealing because of who was cast for the lead roles. The lovely Audrey Hepburn?most known for her role as Holly Golightly in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?plays the female lead, Sabrina Fairchild, as she brings to light the challenges between social standing and love; the dashing Humphrey Bogart?known for his role in the tragic love story "Casablanca"?plays the older brother, Linus Larrabee, who steps in to woo away the unforeseen complication from Sabrina's transformation; and the ever charming William Holden plays David Larrabee, the boy Sabrina has been in love with her whole life. If the music is where you find the most beauty in films, you will not be disappointed. "Sabrina" utilizes adaptations of songs from La Vie En Rose to Isn't it Romantic with Hepburn singing bits of the French version of La Vie En Rose. Each piece fits beautifully with each scene, allowing for audiences to enjoy the accompaniment without feeling like it was too much all at once. If you have not already, or if you have only seen the remake of "Sabrina", I encourage you to watch the original. If nothing else, you have spent 113 minutes of your life watching a classic love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Runaway From Who You Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina is yet another one of those Audrey Hepburn films that personifies just how beloved she can be. She is the definition of everything you want in an actress. Beautiful, elegant, and she has all the charisma in the world. Sabrina is a film that she gets to showcase each of those things, and it works to perfection. Yes, the film is a twist on the Cinderella story, but I actually found it to be much more original than it appears to be.The film is actually pretty dark when you get down to it. It involves our main character attempting to commit suicide in the opening few minutes, and she nearly succeeds. The main love interest to Sabrina, Linus, also had once attempted suicide, so it's not your typical romantic love story. Sabrina is the daughter of a wealthy family's chauffeur and is head over heels in love with one of the family members. Of course, she is barely noticeable to the stuck up family and David never even cares to pay attention to her until she comes back from Paris in a beautiful dress with tons of make up and a new haircut. He comes on as a pretty unlikable character so it was hard to buy into that relationship, which is what the script intended for. It isn't until Bogart's character, Linus, shares his intimate past and they go on a fishing trip that I felt Sabrina fit in. Some people have a problem with Bogart's performance, but I thought it was brilliant. He was going through cancer at the time and had problems on set. But his performance is better than 95% of other actors out there in perfect conditions.What I think I love most about this film is that the ending and where our characters end up fits in with who they are. The whole film we are led to believe that our characters need to change who they are or just stay miserable in order to be most successful. But in reality, Sabrina and Linus deserved a new start and a new life. Paris was that for them. Back in the day, films had a tendency to present a clichéd ending that really only ended in happiness. This happy ending made sense to me and it never felt forced. Sabrina is an all time classic film, and definitely one of Wilder's best.+Hepburn's charisma +Intimate character moments +They deserve each other +An ending that makes sense, even if it's predictable +La Vie En Rose 9.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't get any wilder than Sabrina. Sabrina is a beautiful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, this romantic movie is indeed, a classic from the Golden Age of Hollywood. It was made from one of the best directors of all-time, Billy Wilder. Based on the play, Sabrina Fair; Sabrina tells the story of Sabrina Fairchild (Aubrey Hepburn), a very shy young woman, who lives with her father, Thomas (John Williams). Thomas works for the Larrabee Brothers, David (William Holden) and Linus (Humphrey Bogart) as their live-in chauffeur. Things become very complex, for Sabrina when David fall head over heels for her, after she spent a year, at a Paris cooking school and returns home, transform, into a glamorous classy socialite. Fearing that David, will ruin their company with his cheating and womanizing ways; businessman Linus, starts to take steps in wooing the young woman, in an attempt to prevent David from destroying an oncoming company merger, and his own marriage. Can Linus, stop David from falling in love, or will Linus end up, falling in love with Sabrina, himself? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, I have to say, that I was never a huge fan of love triangle films. I always found them, a bit mean-spirited and wishy washy. The plot isn't that strong, when you think about it. It's kinda weak. First off, it takes forever, for the plot to get going. We have to wait, a long time for Sabrina to get back from Paris. I was really, hoping for a quicker pace. The film drags on, a little too much. Second off, the plot is very shallow. It's really hard to believe, that Sabrina wouldn't get notice. I know, it's based on 1950s standards, but she's way too gorgeous, even in the beginning. I really doubt, she had anything really bad about her, that she would try to commit suicide. Honestly, with the pony-tail, and plain clothes in the beginning. She looks a very attractive normal young woman. She's look like, a girl that I would, have love to date at the time. She's way too beautiful. After all, it's Aubrey Hepburn for goodness sakes. This film has that, shallow, 1999's She's All that, unbelievable in attractive. I really doubt, people were that, thin-headed, back then. Films like this, really lacks in storytelling, because of the weak conflict. They isn't as much drama for the script to work with. After all, they still, pretty damn rich, no matter, what the outcome, is. I really hate, how often ignorance, the 1% are, in this film. It's telling the lower social classes to act rich to get notice. Wow-really wow. How- snobby. I was never a huge fan of 1950/1960's glamour type movies, because I felt that they allow the fashion to be a bit overbearing. It was a bit much in the second half of the film. The glamour really went overboard. I really doubt, going to Paris for cooking school, would make you into a fashion model. I really hatred, what Sabrina has become. She rarely show, any of her cooking skills. In my opinion, the whole idea of her, going to Paris, was just there to push, the fashion onto the masses. The costume designs in this film are more famous, than the story. A lot of people, will probably, remember the dress, Aubrey Hepburn wore in this film, than anything else. I hardly remember, anything else. Don't get me wrong, the costumes are great, but I would have, love for the writing and humor to out shine the look of the film, more. The writing was kinda lacking. One thing, the movie could have, done better, is if the filmmakers allow the film to be filmed in color footage, than black and white. It kinda hurts, the look of the film. Despite, the positive themes that the movie is sending out, everything in this film, looks so gloomy with the black and white footage. There wasn't any good reason for this film, not to be in color. It's not a film noir, after all. It's supposed to be a Cinderella story, so it needs to be in color! This film was Audrey Hepburn's second film, meant to capitalize on her rising popularity from her Academy Award Best Actress win from the 1953's film, Roman Holiday. Audrey Hepburn does her best, despite being typecast, yet again as another socialite. The acting from her is very top-notch, here. She's very cute, and really shines when she has to. I don't really think she deserve to nominate for Best Actress for this film, but I'm just glad, they didn't play her, as an obnoxious gold-digger-like character like she would later play in other films. The supporting cast is pretty good. William Holden looks and acts like a believable playboy. During production of the film, Hepburn and Holden entered into a brief, but passionate and much-publicized love affair. Meanwhile, Bogart complained that Hepburn required too many takes to get her dialogue right and pointed out her inexperience. Bogart at this time, was very irritable, frail and insecure with himself as romantic lead. He really didn't want to do, it. He only took the role, when first choice, Cary Grant drop out. He didn't get along with anybody, during this film. He thought Aubrey Hepburn was a spoiled brat. He and William Holden couldn't stand each other. He was very ill, and would die, a few years later this film, from throat cancer. Despite that, Humphrey Bogart is great, as the stern, business-driven, older brother. The May-December Romance didn't bug me, as it could had. He wasn't miscast. The music is pretty good from Friedrich Hollaender. I love the use of La Vie en rose. It's match, so well with the film theme. In 1995, the film was remade with Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Greg Kinnear in the respective roles. It's not that good. Overall: While, the movie has some faults. It's still a great watch. A must watch for any movie lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isn't It Romantic? 'Fraid Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina is a movie which has 'me' written all over it. A romantic comedy directed by Billy Wilder and starring Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. I should be writing a review right now proclaiming my love for it, but unfortunately that's not the case. Despite my best efforts, I can't get emotionally engaged with this film. That was disappointing enough, although the thing which drove me crazy is that I couldn't figure out why Sabrina doesn't engage me despite being my cup of tea; a giant mug of tea with a chocolate digestive on the side.I know many people comment on the issue of a young girl being involved in a relationship with a man old enough to be her father, but once you've seen enough classic Hollywood movies in which this is the case, then you get used to it. Sabrina's love interest David Larrabee (William Holden) didn't strike me as an interesting character initially, but on closer examination I think he does have some personality in how superficial he is, but I'm not convinced you would want to kill yourself over this guy. Also is his hair bleached in this film, it looks terrible.On closer inspection, I believe the major flaw in Sabrina is that the title character is simply not interesting. I never caught onto this previously due to Audrey Hepburn's natural lovable charm, but when thinking to myself about what are this character's personality traits, a tumbleweed went by in my mind. Her transition from ugly duckling to glamour goddess is unconvincing; I imagine making Audrey Hepburn appear unattractive is impossible, but her appearance when she returns from Paris compared to her earlier self is largely the same aside from her just wearing more classy attire. Due to this the scene in which David meets Sabrina for the first time after returning from Paris and he doesn't recognise her is hard to digest. Compare this to the 1995 remake (which yes I think is a much better film), it gives the character of Sabrina an in depth personality, a character transition which is more substantial and stronger chemistry between the leading lady and her two male co stars, but that is for another review. Bogart's role is the only character in the triangle who I find has any character development, playing against type as a sympathetic businessman. I find Sabrina isn't without its moments, such as William Holden getting glass up his...you know. Was this word commonly known in 1954? Did 1950's movie goers get the joke? Sabrina is more ordinary than Wilder's other movies, and I feel it could have been directed by anyone. I assume Wilder wanting to directed something lighter for a change, not that there's anything wrong with that, however this is his only movie from the 1950's which I don't like. I guess you can't win 'em all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Is Fair In Love... With Sabrina &amp; Her Men.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Samuel A. Taylor's play named Sabrina Fair, Billy Wilder's Sabrina is a delicately crafted, elegantly narrated &amp; fervently performed cinema that also marked Wilder's final collaboration with Paramount Pictures and isn't just one of the best romantic comedies of its time but remains one of Wilder's most celebrated &amp; well-known works of his glorious career.The story of Sabrina concerns its titular character, Sabrina Fairchild; the daughter of a wealthy family's chauffeur who has been in love with one of her employer's sons all her life. The plot covers a love triangle between Sabrina, David; an oft-married playboy she's always been in love with &amp; Linus; David's older brother who's always busy working &amp; expanding the family business.Co-written &amp; directed by Billy Wilder, the film carries the usual wit &amp; charm that is often found in Wilder's films but this time the romance is also handled in a much warmer manner and overall, the famous writer-director has done a splendid job behind the camera, once again. The camera-work is smoothly carried out, editing is pretty concise, music is absolutely heartwarming &amp; even the costume department manage to make its mark.Yet, what's the biggest strength about Sabrina that cemented its legacy in my opinion is its trio of stellar performances from Audrey Hepburn, William Holden &amp; Humphrey Bogart. Hepburn beautifully captures the love Sabrina longs for, Holden feels incredibly natural in his playboy role &amp; Bogart delivers one of his best performances in what's quite an offbeat role for him.On an overall scale, Sabrina may take a much familiar road with its premise, may offer a very predictable story &amp; may not be the masterpiece I expected but it also resonates an irresistible warmth &amp; comfort which, under Wilder's supervision &amp; its trio's magical on-screen chemistry, has played a key role in keeping its legacy alive even after 60 long years. Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A joyous movie that is dramatic in tone and humorous in presentation.OK, a story of a rich boy poor girl and to make it more interesting is a triangular love story and to make it more interesting is the two boys who fall for same girl are brothers and to make more interesting is that the girl is their driver's daughter. Enough of revealing the plot now.It's SABRINA's story that is played by Audrey Hepburn with histrionics that are good for the scene and with emotions that are apt, she made Sabrina a lovely lively girl. Humphrey Bogart is just fine though I saw a bit of discomfort in few of hi emotions especially when is trying to hide his emotions from Sabrina. William Holden is the lover boy and seems apt in it. All said an above is handling of acting and expressions by Billy Wilder, the master director. I actually resort to his movies when I am not in good mood and he brings back a smile on me. This movie does that very thing again, he sets the screen on a serene charming pace that as the things fold we just are so lethargically in love with the whole it. If there has to be a mention after writing and acting, then it's editing and costume design. A scene where Sabrina denies going out just because its not the right attire speaks for the care taken to keep the dresses right. The dialogues are actually very beautifully told, rain in Paris, oh, such a nice thought. See it to know how romantic are conversations. I believe if you need to have a beautiful romantic film, then the conversation between the boy and girl needs to be romantic is every word. They have to be like poetry, fluid, enticing and ah so touching. This movie may not be having all such traits yet each conversation lights up and adds flamboyance. I go with 4/5 for Sabrina.If you are not willing to see this movie in purest form, then see it in a corrupted form of "Yeh Dillagi" in Hindi by Akshay Kumar, Kajol and Saif Ali Khan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic comedy gold from Wilder &amp; company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "Sabrina" tells the story of Sabrina Fairchild, a tomboyish chauffeur's daughter who falls in love with the handsome son of her father's employer. Unfortunately, she's practically invisible to him; that is, until she returns from a sojourn in Paris looking the picture of elegance and beauty. However, her arrival comes at an inopportune time since her would-be beau is about to be married.This gives a general idea of the plot, though there's more that I've left unsaid. The story turns out to be an interesting one populated with memorable characters. Adapted from a Broadway play by Wilder and Ernest Lehman, their screenplay won a Golden Globe and garnered an Oscar nomination.An enviable cast played a big part in showing the screenplay to the best advantage. All three leads were Oscar winners who contributed countless legendary performances over the course of their careers. Many feel that last minute replacement Humphrey Bogart was miscast but I doubt that original choice Cary Grant could have done as well. Audrey Hepburn is luminous as the title character and William Holden was a welcome addition to the film. The supporting cast is also impressive, especially John Williams as Sabrina's father and Walter Hampden as the patriarch of the Larrabee family.Billy Wilder's Oscar-nominated direction is impeccable and the film benefited from high production values all around. The Edith Head costumes secured an Oscar win while the attractive cinematography and art direction were both rewarded with nominations. From top to bottom, the movie shows polish and attention to detail."Sabrina" leaves little to be desired as a lightweight romantic comedy. How can you not like Bogart &amp; Hepburn in the same movie with a side of William Holden for good measure? While it doesn't gel to absolute perfection, the results are close enough to make it a sure-fire classic in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great stuff - and that's from a guy who hates rom-coms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been having a bit of a mini Audrey Hepburn season lately, and SABRINA is my latest watch. And what a joy it is to watch! It's a fast-paced, witty and engaging little movie about a little mouse of a girl - Hepburn, of course - who becomes a society star and has to pick between two rich brothers in the process.The story is lightweight and frothy, but where this film really works is the script, which is just great stuff. This is one of those old-fashioned Hollywood efforts which is just a joy to watch, with top-name actors delivering their lines with aplomb. Hepburn has never been lovelier here, with none of those irritating characteristics than some of her other characters possess (I'm thinking of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S in particular).It helps that the calibre of the cast is superb, with a fine turn from Humphrey Bogart particularly notable. William Holden plays his cad to the hilt, and there's fine comic support from Walter Hampden and John Williams. SABRINA is also notably funny, and that comic routine with the stuck olive is one of the most hilarious things I've seen in a good while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film Oozes Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the flaccid remake with Harrison Ford: the original version of Samuel Taylor's play positively oozes style. The plot is contrived, but the film's main attraction comes from watching Audrey Hepburn glide her way through the role as the eponymous heroine, in love with David (William Holden), but eventually having her romantic dreams reworked. Holden doesn't have to do much in the role of David, other than to act as a comic foil to Bogart's Linus; his older brother who, despite his commitment to sustaining the family firm, eventually finds himself falling in love with Sabrina. The script crackles with witty one-liners, while Billy Wilder;s cinematic narrative unfolds at a great lick, so much so, in fact, that we are blinded to the plot's manifest implausibilities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder directed this comedy that's stars Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina Fairchild, recently returned from Paris, now grown up and sophisticated, who is also the daughter of a chauffeur(played by John Williams) for the wealthy Larrabee family that has two sons: Serious Bachelor Linus(played by Humphrey Bogart) an often divorced playboy David(played by William Holden). Sabrina had always loved David, who is indeed impressed with the transformation of the once skinny and awkward Sabrina, but strangely, she finds herself falling for the much older Linus, and he for her... Great cast and direction in this likable if slight and unlikely story. Still, the cast and upbeat tone of film is tough to resist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audrey Hepburn's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting down to watch Sabrina (1954) reminds me why there are so many posters of Audrey Hepburn, rolled up and ready for sale in any respectable big-box-mart or multi-media store. The image of her holding a ceramic cigarette holder, embroidered with diamonds and clad in satin is a famous tableaux from Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961).But even before Breakfast at Tiffany's she was a household name with her work in Funny Face (1957) and her first lead role in Roman Holiday (1953) for which she won an Academy Award. Despite her continued success after Breakfast at Tiffany's in such films as Charade (1963) and My Fair Lady (1964), Sabrina remains in my mind the premiere showcase of the actress's charm.The story of Sabrina begins with the capable actress playing the titular character, a near invisible fixture in the world of the Larrabee clan. The Larrabees would be considered part of the 0.5% today. Sabrina narrates this fact as she describes them and their indoor and outdoor swimming pools and tennis courts respectively. She however is not a Larrabee but a Fairchild; the chauffeur's daughter. Still she pines for, and is unhappily in love with the youngest son of the multimillionaire dynasty David (William Holden). David however has no interest in her and enjoys the life of a playboy while his older brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) takes care of the business. Things change however after she returns from cooking school in Paris with a new air of elegance.It is that elegance that makes Sabrina such a great film. Throughout the film Audrey Hepburn is dressed in a multitude of exquisite dresses and gowns. Rumored to have been designed by fashion master Hubert James Marcel Taffin de Givenchy, the Oscar for best costumes went to Edith Head a woman nominated 35 times over the course of a 57 year career.The elegance of Sabrina even sinks into the crisp clear cinematography and set design. Billy Wilder shot the exteriors for the film along Long Island Sound. The area was considered a popular escape for 19th-century wealthy industrial barons, including Charles Pratt and his sons, J.P. Morgan, and F.W. Woolworth. They built large private estates along the island thus many in New York society dubbed the area the Gold Coast; a place where wealth and privilege came to unwind.It was this corner of the world where Holden and Hepburn began a highly publicized love affair on-set. Meanwhile Bogart became increasingly belligerent. The part was originally given to Cary Grant who backed out last minute due to scheduling problems. feeling miscast, Bogart butted heads with Wilder but eventually came to appreciate his work on the film. And why wouldn't he? His comedic timing and swarthy charm while unseen since The African Queen (1951), still hold weight. In fact, next to Hepburn's magnetic smile, his wit and witticisms are the next best thing.There was a respectable remake made in 1995 starring Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond, who as you know went on to do?well, nothing much. Not to say Ormond isn't a gifted actress but the role of Sabrina Fairchild are some big heels few actresses can fill. Ford also produced the film which would lead one to believe it was really more of a vanity project than an attempt of a decent remake.Even with a remake soiling Sabrina's legacy, the movie remains one of Hepburn's strongest films. It's funny, its romantic, it has a lot of heart and its downright beautiful to watch. The script is sharp and witty and is bolstered by the comedic whims of William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. The film is further aided by Edith Head's decadent costume design and stands as one of the biggest reasons to like the late, great Audrey Hepburn.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't make a profitable wedding without breaking a heart ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anything, the opening voice-over and the following exposition, warn us that "Sabrina" is of pure 'fairy tale' material, borrowing its plot elements from both the myth of Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling.And as a Cinderella-figure, Audrey Hepburn, in her second feature-film, illuminates the screen with her genuine gamine charm, walking barefoot as if she truly waited for the Charming Prince carrying the lost shoe. She's less convincing as an Ugly Duckling though, but if Audrey Hepburn is supposed to be 'physically forgettable', and transform into a glamorous woman in one change of haircut and wardrobe, but since it's a fairy tale comedy, so let's just accept that Sabrina starts as an average adolescent to better emphasize her status as an underdog heroine.Sabrina lives in the Larrabees' mansion in Long Island, as the chauffeur's daughter. In other words, she doesn't belong to that world, but is close enough to dream about being one of these attractive and classy rich girls, just because it's the only way to catch the eye, then the heart of David Larrabee, whose idleness and three consecutive marriages never discouraged her. Why not? William Holden, as a rich and handsome playboy, is the perfect 50's version of the Charming Prince. Yet David doesn't care much for Sabrina, not until she comes back after two years of cooking-study in Paris, as an unrecognizably sophisticated lady.Again, we accept the idea that David wouldn't recognize the chauffeur's daughter, and the subsequent misunderstanding, if not hilarious, is amusing in a cute way. Sabrina finally won his heart, by becoming one of these women he always coveted, and we're supposed to cheer for that. As innocent a comedy as it is, the content gets incredibly shallow and superficial, but it's a credit to the casting of Hepburn, who's so hypnotically herself, that she gets away with it. Simply said, her gorgeous face and innocent expression make any negative thought impossible.Naturally, the on-going romance meets disapproval, starting with Sabrina's father, played by a caring and loving John Williams (the detective in "Dial M for Murder"), who wished Sabrina's trip in Paris would cure his daughter from her obsession named David, while Paris only helped her to see life in rose-colored glasses. The Larrabees are also concerned because Sabrina undermines their plan to marry David with the daughter of a powerful conglomerate President and make a highly profitable merger. This is where Linus, David's no non-sense and all-business brother, played by Humphrey Bogart, intervenes.To prevent his brother from the temptation of flying away with Sabrina, Linus spends time with her, planning on a short-term to send her alone to Paris. But the story deals with these relationships rather ambiguously, Davis is in love with Sabrina but never makes efforts to cancel the wedding and we're never sure about the sincerity of Linus' growing affection toward Sabrina. These considerations disappear the time of a magical moment when Audrey Hepburn sings "La Vie en Rose", a sweet and timelessly magical interlude that makes us forget the course of the story and gives the film its true reason-to-be.Now, when I watch a romantic comedy, I usually keep in mind the genre-defining pattern consisting on two people that everything opposes, and who end up together at the end. Being the obligatory principle borrowed from fairy tales, we judge a romance less from its predictable outcome than the way it gets to it. And because Linus was cynically about to break a fragile heart like the necessary egg to make the marriage's omelet possible, and because of the ambivalent attitude of David, I didn't know with whom Sabrina should have been to make a satisfying ending. What Sabrina saw in David I could understand, given how immature she was, but what she saw in Linus, I couldn't get either, given how grown-up she became.But this is not a flaw on the story, which is written by Billy Wilder with the usual amount of talent and wit, indispensable for a comedy no matter how unsubtle some situations can get. The film has its share of gags, corny lines, a comic-relief William Hampden as Larrabee's distracted patriarch and even Billy Holden plays his role in an over-the-top joviality as if he really enjoyed being that guy, and his enthusiasm was quite communicative. But there is something strange going between Hepburn and Bogart, precisely because they played their roles with sincerity and believability.Indeed, Sabrina was like a little flower who finally bloom under the sun of optimism and confidence and yet she was trapped in the middle of a business plot that tried not to buy her love, but to console her broken heart with it. And it's precisely because Bogie plays the role with his own dramatic note that I could believe his infatuation and the subsequent redemption. But right performances don't make believable chemistry just like good ingredient don't make a good recipe? and I'm sure the 'all in the wrist' French chief cook wouldn't contradict me.It's commonly known that Bogart took the last minute role turned down by Cary Grant, and I'm afraid to admit that Grant would have done a great job given how used he is to romantic comedies, and how similar he looks to Holden. Not that Bogart wasn't convincing, but he gave some gravity to his performance, totally contrasting with Holden's jollity, and it's not surprising that Hepburn fell in love with Holden during the shooting, screens don't lie, their chemistry was real.As much as I enjoy the film, I can only judge the romantic comedy from its ending, and on that level, no matter how prestigious the package Hepburn, Bogart, Holden and Wilder was, the conclusion was really telling about how awkward the relationship was: a hug, just a hug. Sabrina deserved more, and so did we, and maybe this is why I looked forward to watching the 1995' remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Hepburn with a side of Wilder and a little Holden, hold the Bogie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is mostly for Hepburn fans, less so for Wilder acolytes, and has little if anything for Bogieists or Holdenites. Wilder is milder here than anywhere else (except maybe his other Audrey, Love in the Afternoon), leaving a little wit and cynicism scattered about to remind viewers who sat next to the camera. Bogie is uninvolved and uninvolving, reads his lines dutifully, and has NO chemistry with Hepburn. The only advantage of his casting (as opposed to Grant) is that the romance isn't a foregone conclusion--Bogie's romantic days were behind him. And shoulda stayed there. Holden is 10 years and several previous Wilders too old for his carefree playboy--the bad bleach job just makes him look older. At least he and AH have some on-screen chemistry (and a lot more off-screen). Not much of a comedy, all in all, and no romance. Audrey carries it, and carries it off, both with ease</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SABRINAI thought it was not a bad movie. It is the kind of movie that is nice to put on on a wet Sunday afternoon.I only recorded this movie from the TV because it has Audrey Hepburn in it. She was a great actress. I have not seen many of her movies, but I intend to watch more.Sabrina is played by Audrey. She is a chauffeur's daughter who has loved the son of her fathers rich employer since she was a little girl. The only problem, he looks right past her and takes no notice of her, until... she leaves for Paris to get over him. But when she comes back 2 years later... he is smitten. But so is his brother.I thought the story was quite good and the acting was good also. But then it should have. It had some big names from it's time. Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart &amp; William Holden.Like I said... this movie is good for a wet weekend... but it is not really a film I could watch over and over. I will probably watch this again in a few years when I have forgotten it. For Audrey... out of the 3 films I have seen of hers so far... this is the worst. But it is still good.I will give this film a 6 out of 10.Roman Holiday for me is still her best.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sabrina" (1954) and "Roman Holiday" (1953) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two.Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented.The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants.The two movies are packed with actor talent.Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923).Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling.The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome.New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is.At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points).The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things.The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way.Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family).Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career.But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all.She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954).A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954).----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.Email Tex Allen at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Visit WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for Tex Allen movie credits and biography information.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps my favorite Billy Wilder film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch this film, I'm a little sad that Humphrey Bogart spent so much of his career -- particularly in the 1930s -- on rather shallow thug roles. The forties were his heyday with a number of outstanding parts, and in the 1950s there were a few particularly impressive films -- "The Caine Mutiny" and "The African Queen"...both favorites of mine. But perhaps I enjoy Bogart even more in this film because he is cast against type -- it's a rather gentle, light comedy/drama role. And he is so very good here! I also tend to think that one of the reasons he fit so nicely in this role was that in his youth he was somewhat privileged, his family living in New York's fashionable Upper West Side, and summering at a 55 acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in New York State -- just 12 miles from my home town. This is one of a handful of films (including those previously mentioned, along with "Casablanca") that if not made with Bogart would have made his filmography weaker.But this film also belongs to Audrey Hepburn...one of her earliest major roles. And, she shines it it...particularly in terms of at the beginning of the film playing a girl who then grows up and becomes very sophisticated while in Paris. A wonderful, wonderful role...and I say that as not a particular fan of Hepburn.And then there's William Holden, who comes off third in this film, though he does so pleasantly. He's very likable here, although he had many other films that were much stronger for hi.The supporting cast is excellent, as well. Worth noting are character actors Walter Hampden and John Williams. They add much to the production.I rarely give an "8", but here I will. This is a gem, and it's definitely on my DVD shelf!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an incredible cast for this movie! You have Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, AND Bill Holden?? How could this not be a wonderful film? So much better than "Sabrina" with Harrison Ford back in the 90's. This was, and always will be the original. And it is. If you like classic romantic comedy, or you love Audrey Hepburn, you will certainly enjoy this one. It is not an overly subtle movie, and the characters sometimes change their whole outlook quite suddenly, but this is fairly common of the genre, and is not a particular flaw of this movie.If you are more interested in classics or Audrey Hepburn than romantic comedy, then you probably won't like the 1995 remake. If, however, you enjoy romantic comedy in general, and are willing to accept that they are not the same movie, I believe you may enjoy the remake even more than the original. I did, and I adore Audrey Hepburn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful romantic comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina Fairchild (Audrey Hepburn) is a beautiful and shy lower-class girl whose father (John Williams) works as a chauffeur for the rich Larrabee family. She watches the elegant and lavish parties from afar and is head-over-heels in love with playboy David (William Holden). Attempting to commit suicide, the more business-minded brother of David, Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart) intervenes and saves her. Her father decides to send her off to Paris on a cookery course where she arrives back re-invented, capturing the eye of David. Linus has set up the marriage between David and the daughter of a potential business partner, and so tries to sabotage their relationship while falling for Sabrina himself. And so begins a love triangle between two rich brothers and the girl they always ignored.This is a familiar fairytale story of an 'ugly duckling' who is given the chance to show who she really is to the people that have failed to recognise her previously. How this film manages to tackle it from a seemingly fresh perspective speaks volumes about the sheer genius of director Billy Wilder, who is undoubtedly one of the greatest film- makers from the Golden Age of Hollywood. It achieves in equal measures an air of magic and sweetness of which can only be found in the 'golden oldies', with three truly great comedic performances from the lead trio.Yes, it is wholly unbelievable that rich boys David and Linus would fail to recognise someone as astoundingly beautiful as Audrey Hepburn until she puts on some expensive earrings and a nice dress. But that is a minor quibble that one must expect from a romantic comedy. It is instead a film to sit back and enjoy. As strong as all three leads are, I felt this was Bogart's film. Most of my laughs came from his strange obsession with his company's newly designed plastic that he advertises to anyone who will listen. Having only seen him in hard-boiled noirs, it was nice to see him flexing his comedy muscles.In an age where production companies s**t out one soulless rom-com after the other that seem to serve no purpose other than to fill corporate pockets and earn some easy money for some B-list actor, it's reassuring to know that there was once a time when scriptwriters and directors alike would put genuine heart and talent onto screen and page, and create a romantic comedy that can be genuinely entertaining and truly heartfelt.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sabrina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar nominated director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment), this was rated very highly by the critics and had good leading stars, so I decided I should see it. Basically the Larabee family are very rich, and the two sons do their own things, Linus (Humphrey Bogart) runs the family corporate empire and has no time for a personal life, and David (William Holden) is employed by the family but never shows up spending time having fun and being married and divorced three times. Young and awkward chauffeur's daughter Sabrina Fairchild (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Audrey Hepburn) has had a crush on David since childhood, but he has never really noticed her, until he returns home after two years from Paris. She is more elegant, sophisticated and beautiful and she seems to have finally caught the playboy's attention, not recognising her, she is happy to finally be gaining his interest, but Linus is worried. David is already engaged to be married to another woman, if the wedding doesn't go ahead a big corporate deal will go bust, so workaholic Linus starts a friendship with Sabrina to draw her away. In the process however it seems that she may be falling in love with her, and he returns the same feelings, so much so that when he tells her to go back to Paris, he dashes to leave with her on the boat. Also starring Walter Hampden as Oliver Larrabee, John Williams as Thomas Fairchild, Martha Hyer as Elizabeth Tyson, Joan Vohs as Gretchen Van Horn, Marcel Dalio as Baron St. Fontanel, Marcel Hillaire as The Professor, Nella Walker as Maude Larrabee, Francis X. Bushman as Mr. Tyson and Ellen Corby as Miss McCardle. Hepburn is radiant and elegant as the shy young woman, Bogart is cool and charming as the "tough guy", and Holden does alright as his brother, the direction by Wilder is good, the story when it made sense was not bad with some soppy and funny stuff, I can't quite agree with five stars out of five, but it is I suppose a worthwhile romantic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Humphrey Bogart was number 36, and Audrey Hepburn number 13 on The Greatest Movie Stars, Hepburn was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Bogart was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 27 on The World's Greatest Actor.

		<fullReview>It is wonderful to sit down and watch a film that simply captivates you and charms you the whole way through. There are almost no films that do that today, but 50 years ago that was the standard. This film is no different. Three of the biggest stars of all time: Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, and Audrey Hepburn teamed up with one of the best directors of all time, Billy Wilder, to create a beautiful and charming story that simply doesn't stop. The acting is good, as expected, and the screenplay is pure Wilderesque: a touch of romance combined with snappy dialogue and humorous one-liners. The movie may not end as the audience wants it to, but deep down we know that it is the way it should have ended. Wilder always knew how to make an opening (Sunset Blvd., Double Indemnity) and he also knows how to make a great final scene. This film has one, and it makes the film a classic. It's all in the family.</fullReview>

William Holden(in my opinion one of the top 10 actors of all time) is his usual superb self, because William Holden always plays himself first and the character is always William Holden in theatrical disguise. Bogart and Hepburn( as Bogart and his leading lady always are); are a delightful pair. A great snuggle and settle film. Always worth the escape to Romance---------------Because???? Real Romance will never die, at least I hope not. Oscar for Costume design--Lots of Major Oscar Nominations but no wins which usually tells you the movie is great. A Must See on a Cold Winters Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make them like this anymore; Audrey Hepburn was wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the 1995 movie with Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear and Julia Ormond first, and I was quite happy with it. In fact, while Humphrey Bogart was good in this one, he didn't seem right for the part of Linus. I liked Ford better. The 1995 version of the movie was good as a whole, but it certainly doesn't compare with the original, and I don't think it ever could. Not that trying to remake a masterpiece was a bad thing. One problem: are there any more Audrey Hepburns out there? Maybe so. But she was one of a kind. I've only seen a few of her movies. I need to see more. Whether depressed, sophisticated and happy, serious, or just plain silly, Hepburn could do it all. The actors playing the servants were great. You really wanted to care about these people, and they showed that they loved Sabrina. And John Williams was great as Sabrina's father. The chef in Paris was quite funny. There wasn't really a bad acting performance, as far as I could tell. And while this wasn't anywhere close to 100% comedy, there were some very funny moments, both physical comedy and clever writing. And the music was wonderful too. Some movies today still try to give us the great music of the past. But too many films have to do today's music. It's nice to have something different for a change. I especially liked it when Linus played 'Oh, Yes, We Have No Bananas'. I won't say that if you watch this movie that you can forget the newer version. They're both good in their own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isn't it romantic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Long Island Chauffeurs daughter is desperately in love with the youngest son of the family her father works for. Sent away to Paris for two years (partly to learn how to cook, and partly to cure her infatuation), she returns with a sophisticated new look, and finds that he is now infatuated with her.As is clear from the above outline, and from the very beginning of the film which starts with the line "Once upon a time there was a little girl...." this film is basically a fairy tale in which Hepburn's Cinderella gets to choose between the two sons of the fabulously wealthy Larrabee family. It features a wonderful cast - William Holden excels as the charming playboy David Larrabee (the original object of Sabrina's affections), and Bogart, somewhat cast against type as a romantic lead, shows a deft touch for comedy as older brother Linus, who attempts to disentangle his brother from Sabrina only to find himself falling for her too.This is a tale which could easily become mawkish, but is kept from doing so by witty dialogue and wonderful physical comedy (Linus manipulating his brother into sitting down on a champagne glass, and then providing him with a hammock with a strategic hole cut out is my favourite, but there are many such moments). But this is Hepburn's film, and she is magnificent. Her transformation from gawky teenager to sophisticated young woman is entirely convincing, and she never looked lovelier. Forget Pretty Woman, forget Maid in Manhatten, this film did it first and it did it better. Get a big bar of chocolate, unplug the phone, and sit back and enjoy the most beautiful face ever captured on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this movie was smart! The dialogue could have almost been used verbatim in a 2003 remake. Actually, I have noticed that Harrison Ford was in a mid 90's remake, but I have yet to subject myself to it. Harrison is a good enough actor, but always gets put in the wrong roles. He is probably 60, looks 70, yet gets cast as 40...very irritating. Anyway, Sabrina is easily one of the best comedy / romance movies of all times. I checked this site, and totally couldn't believe the year it was made. If it had been in color, and didn't have well known actors that were relatively easy to gauge their age, then I would have easily guessed it 20+ years newer. If you don't get the movie, and / or you attempt to take it literally, it may seem somewhat weak, but for those of us that pick up on the intent, this is a winner, and possibly one of first to use such techniques.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the one difference between this version and the later version was the composure of the characters, Hepburn in particular. Julia Ormond practically falls apart when Linus reveals his horrible plan. Hepburn merely strides out of the office, dignity still in tact. I did like the ending of the newer version better than the simple ending of this one though. Still, all in all, it's a sweet, innocent romance (You hardly see PG romances anymore. Isn't it awful?)without all that sexuality and immorality, something I can indeed appreciate and watch with my parents without any qualms! As far as this movie goes, all I can say is that this statement is a matter of opinion. What I think, may not be what you think, so all I can say is rent it and judge for yourself. I enjoyed it, but you might not. After all one man's trash...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful romantic comedy from Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart and William Holden star as rich brothers, the former an ever-busy CEO the latter a lazy, womanizing playboy. Audrey Hepburn plays their chauffer's daughter, Sabrina, who is in love with Holden. He doesn't even know she exists. Hepburn's father sends her to Paris to forget, but she comes back with the sophistication necessary to conquer Holden, and does so effortlessly. Unfortunately, she's threatening a major corporate deal with Holden's new fiancée's father. Bogart steps in and tries to seduce Hepburn away from his brother, for reasons of business only. Who would guess that he falls for her as well? Well, anyone who's ever seen a romantic comedy, I suppose, but the film's lack of surprises is no major fault. Hepburn could carry the movie by herself without a problem. Bogart and Holden are good, but I for one never looked at them, except to be slightly disgusted at Bogart's romantic leanings towards a 20-something gal (what happened, did Bacall get too old for the guy?). Hell, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were as good in the 1990s remake (which I saw when it first came out). Sabrina also benefits from some truly skillful direction from Wilder. I am not a Wilder fan, in particular. I do recognize his talents, but, as far as I've always thought, he was a talented mortal working amongst the classic Hollywood deities, the directors and stars of that era. Sabrina increases my opinion of him, both as a director and as a writer. The film has some unusually extended sequences. For example, the first time Bogart tries to get Sabrina from his brother's charismatic grasp, when he meets her on the indoor tennis court. The audience understands exactly what's happening plotwise within ten seconds. But the scene is protracted beyond our expectations. When Bogie kisses Hepburn, we sit there watching her slow reaction. This is quite the good film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only one thing wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn made only a handful of films in her career and probably has as high a rate of excellence in her movies as anyone, (at least until later in her career). Some of her movies, (War and Peace, The Nun's Story, The Unforgiven) are about much more than her personal charm. Others use her charm but they are not strictly about her, (My Fair Lady, Two for the Road), and so are not classic "Audrey Hepburn" movies. if someone had never seen an Audrey Hepburn movie and wanted to know what the fuss was about, I would recommend five of them: Roman Holiday, (1953), Sabrina, (1954), Funny Face, (1957), Love in the Afternoon, (1957) and Breakfast at Tiffany's, (1961). If you are not an Audrey Hepburn fan after seeing one of those, you never will be. I think I'd rank Sabrina second to Funny Face on that list. it might have been first except for a fatal flaw. The flaw is not Audrey, who is the ideal Cinderella and makes every scene she is in glow. Nor is it William Holden, who steals the picture, (as Greg Kinnear would in the same role in the surprisingly good 1995 remake, which recreated the look of the original film amazingly well). But why remake it at all? The reason is that flaw. When I first saw this film and for the next several times I saw it thereafter, I didn't mind Humphrey Bogart's performance as Linus Larabee, the serious older brother who steals Sabrina away from Holden. I like Bogey and he was the right age and looked the part of the middle aged businessman. But more and more, I find I cannot stand his performance, especially when I think of the man most commentators say they would have selected for this role: Cary Grant. All right, grant may seem a stretch as a sober businessman, (which he was, by the way, in real life). But he would have added a lot more liveliness to the part and made with Hepburn and Holden the three most charming people ever to be in one film. The whole thing would have taken off like a paper airplane in the wind. Harrison Ford in the remake was no Grant, either, but he at least seemed to be enjoying himself. Instead, we are stuck with old stone face. Reports indicate Bogart was in a grouchy mood during this one, didn't want to make the picture, didn't like Wilder, or Hepburn and loathed Holden. He's like a drain the charm of each scene he's in goes down. Grant could certainly play a more mature version of Holden who could get romantic at the end. His scenes with Audrey in Charade, nine years later, sparkle. That should have been their second film together. When I see this film today, I just can't help thinking of what might have been.</fullReview>

He plays the serious and responsible son of a business tycoon who eventually spends time with the beautiful chauffer's daughter (Sabrina) while Linus, the ne'er-do-well younger son, whom Sabrina has been in love with all her life, is recovering from an accident that leaves him tending a tender part of his anatomy.

While it's not one of Billy Wilder's most important films, it's a wonderful movie in its own right. The crisp B&amp;W photography is lovely to look at, and the cast is just about perfect. Audrey Hepburn is her usual delectable self, and even Humphrey Bogart - who at first seems way out of his element - fares surprisingly well.

It was also fun to see Nancy Culp as a maid. Light comedy. Audrey is cute, then sophisticated, but she doesn't seem comfortable in her sophistication, like it is taking a supreme effort to maintain this masquerade. I wonder if she could keep this up for long once she got comfortable with the man she finally settles with. Again, recommended.

		<fullReview>To be honest, I first saw Pollak's "Sabrina" (1995, I think) and I thought Wilder's Sabrina would be the same thing. Well, it's not. I have to admit, Pollak did a great work actuallizing stuffs that were kinda old (like Sabrina going to Paris to become a Cheff). But Wilder is... UNIQUE. He can take a simple story and turn it into a Classic. He's an Author, not only a Director. He creates a world. A world full of cinism and humor. And, he always knew which actors he should hire.Here, we can enjoy William Holden's innocence (he starred "Sunset Boulevard", directed also by Wilder... that's my fav. movie of all times), Audrey Hepburn's beauty and charm, and Bogart's last movie, I think (or so).So, don't miss it. It's a great movie. A real Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say just this, this is the most beautiful and romantic movie I have seen in awhile. Audrey Hepburn definitely should have won an award or SOMETHING for her performance as the little girl-turned into a sophisticated woman. They did a great job with William Holden's character of David Larabee as well. I hated him the first minute I saw him on the screen, and I think that they wanted that reaction. Sabrina is a little girl in the beginning madly in love with David Larabee (Holden), a mischievous playboy. When Sabrina tries to commit suicide because he breaks her heart, Linus, David big brother(played by Humphrey Bogart), she is sent off to Paris to go to a cooking school. When she comes back a beautiful woman, David can't keep his hands off of her. This will ruin the chances of David making a million dollar deal with his fiancee', though, and Linus tries to break the two up, only to fall in love with Sabrina as well! The only question is, who gets the girl? I loved this movie. I had "We Have No Bananas Today" stuck in my head for a week after I bought it. I got it to watch Hepburn, but Bogart is excellent as well! A definite must see!</fullReview>

Is it really at the end, when David forces it out of him, or closer to the middle -- does he really *mean* "I wish I was my brother", or is that simply another device to distract Sabrina from David? Or even at the beginning, that first night in the tennis court? Every time I watch the movie I come away with a different opinion.

One of my favorite parts is when David (Holden) is arguing with Linus (Bogart) about marrying Elizabeth Tyson (Martha Hyer). Linus wants David to marry Elizabeth for purely lucrative reasons. But David doesn't want to marry her because he doesn't love her. Here's the best part of the scene:David: "I haven't proposed and she hasn't accepted."Linus: "I proposed, and Mr. Tyson accepted."David: "Did you kiss him?""Sabrina" remains one of my favorite movies, because it's a light-hearted comedy that will keep you smiling for days.

		<fullReview>A precursor to "Pretty Woman" (1990), Billy Wilder's "Sabrina" (1954) stars William Holden and Humphrey Bogart as a couple of millionaire businessmen. They're oblivious to the charms of Audrey Hepburn's Sabrina, a lowly worker, until she travels to France and learns how to be "sophisticated" and "glamerous". At this point the film turns into a traditional fairy tale, Sabrina escaping class barriers and marrying Bogart. Pauper and prince then live happily ever after.Some have complained that "Sabrina's" male love interests are too old, but the "dirty old man" aspect of Wilder's plot merely amplifies how tawdry the whole picture is. In keeping with the film's politics, Sabrina's working class father is painted as a self-hating man who begrudgingly accepts that any and everyone can transcend class boundaries (if you're young, hot and can afford finishing school!) and the film contains a speech in which Bogart basically advocates supply-side, "trickle down economics". That a speech like this would appear in a 1950s film is very surprising.5/10 - Ignoring its despicable message, "Sabrina" is wonderfully lit and Hepburn is somewhat enchanting. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

They have anything you can imagine at their mansion, big rooms, sports grounds, luxurious cars, and so on. Life there is like life in paradise. They have a chauffeur called Fairchild who has a shy, awkward, very young daughter called Sabrina. Sabrina has been in love with David, the younger boy, all her life. David is a playboy who has been married three times and divorced every time. She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself " I don't want to run away from life any more." David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Be Bogart's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina Fairchild (Audrey Hepburn) is the daughter of the Larrabee family chauffeur, Thomas (John Williams), and has been in love with David Larrabee (William Holden) all her life. David is an oft-married, idle playboy, crazy for women, who has never noticed Sabrina, much to her and the staff's dismay. Sabrina then attends culinary school in Paris and returns as an attractive and sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her. David's workaholic older brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) sees this and fears that David's imminent wedding with a very rich woman may be endangered.I love Audrey Hepburn! As far as I know, she can do no wrong. Now, as far as her "hotness" goes, she's a bit thin here (eat a sandwich), and not as "hot" as in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", but that would be a hard film to match (truly her masterpiece). I also enjoyed Humphrey Bogart as the successful brother who likes firing guns at plastic. I'm not big on Bogey, but this role really sold him to me. William Holden is normal here. While he has great potential as an actor, he has some films where he just blends in as an everyman. This is one of those.There should be some controversy over Bogart (roughly 55) kissing Hepburn (roughly 25) -- what's the age difference? Thirty years! (Even Holden is roughly 36, though that's forgivable.) But, if you're Bogart, that might be acceptable -- much like Harrison Ford in the 2000s. Certain older men just have that charm.I would recommend this film with gusto. If you like Bogart, Holden, Hepburn or director Billy Wilder, you really can't go wrong with this. And if you're not experienced with older films, this would make a fine introduction. My favorite Bogart, and Hepburn really never disappoints.</fullReview>

Comedy ventures from very broad to situational to slapstick (brother David sits on champagne glasses in one of the funnier scenes!). Trio of delights is the perfect stars, with Holden seeming just a bit too hammy but Hepburn totally captivating and Bogart as a cynical, shell-shocked middle aged man caught up in his fantasy of her while he tries to be a pragmatist against his feelings. I've heard that the part was written for Cary Grant, but I just can't see it. Bogart's battle scarred face and hardened mannerisms truly do make him a surprising match for Sabrina! If Grant was stuck in there, he'd be bound to win over Holden (in fact, many scriptwriters just skipped the motivation where Grant was involved -- just see the mediocre "Pride and the Passion" for a literal example). Bogart is just perfect, and this deserves to be remembered as one of his finest performances.</fullReview>

How could she suddenly afford $1000 designer clothes with a father who was a chauffeur? Another reviewer brought up a new word... ME (mass entertainment)--or what I call boiler plate. This was boiler plate has no pretensions to be more. Bogart even got in a little (left wing motivated right wing defensive commentary)...making people's lives better through private enterprise..Since I am gay this thing had about as much appeal as a series of root canals. It certainly is way over rated... Audrey Hepburn wearing flats so she won't tower over Bogart....skinny as a rail...as an irresistible sex goddess don't see it. Maybe if they had made her unusually ugly before cooking school with bifocals and a bun---but I didn't appreciate any difference in the before and after Sabrina--except heavier eyebrows and other trendy make up of the era.It is strict boiler plate...thus a 6.... minus 3 for plot vacuums filled by "star power." Just having them there you don't need much of a story type thing.The sound track the cinematography the acting is also all boiler plate nothing notable there....so I give it a 3.DO NOT RECOMMEND</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Different Take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let's get some of the obvious stuff out of the way. Overall, I liked the movie, I thought it was quite good (if not magnificent). Yes, Hepburn is wonderful, and the part seems custom tailored for her. And let me throw in that I quite enjoyed John Williams, always a favorite of mine, delivering his usual strong supporting performance as the chauffeur.But I fail to see why people think this is a hilarious comedy. It had a few amusing moments, but I would never call it a comedy. To me it came off entirely as a light romance story. But then again, maybe I just wasn't born with the Billy Wilder comedic gene. While his serious films-- Sunset Blvd, Lost Weekend-- have always scored high with me, his comedies-- 7 Year Itch, Some Like It Hot-- have always left me completely flat. I don't know what it is, but it seems to be consistent. The quintessential example is Stalag 17, a movie which I consider almost a frankenstein patchwork of serious and comedic, where I love the serious story, and find the comedic side to be pretty dumb. So maybe I shouldn't be surprised that I didn't find humor in Sabrina. Maybe that's just me, and your take will be different.But what I really want to talk about is Holden and Bogart.I've read a number of reviews here that castigate Bogart's performance, and play up the chemistry between Holden and Hepburn. I didn't see it that way *at all*.Holden comes off as a shallow jerk. Chemistry with Hepburn? He wouldn't give her the time of day, and now he's all hot for her? It's clearly the most shallow of shallow infatuations, I didn't find any real chemistry. Well... *her* performance makes you feel like she has real feeling for him, but he struck me as just turning on the charm for the latest hot babe he's lusting for. Which is what his character *should* be doing. It's a fine performance, but it's not *chemistry*.Where's Bogarts performance is more subtle (and should be). I think he does a *fine* job of working against type. I think he's completely convincing and completely on top of the role when he's playing the businessman. Indeed I *loved* his speech about *why* he busts hump to put through big deals like the plastics deal, beyond just the money. A rare bit of pro-capitalism from Hollywood.So you don't think he had real chemistry with Hepburn? GOOD! He's not SUPPOSED TO! Part of what makes the movie interesting is that you, the viewer, is *never sure* just where he's at with her. Is he really falling for her, as it sometimes seems? Or is it all just an act, as he outlines to his father? The movie wouldn't be half as interesting if we clearly knew what he was up to and where he was coming from. And what's more, the gloomy awkwardness he often displays around her, is entirely appropriate, because it seems that he's not sure himself. He's wrestling with himself. He's growing feelings for her but reluctant to accept or even admit them. And what's more, let's face it, this guy, who seemingly hasn't dated since college, IS going to be awkward with women. You would not *expect* him to have this great charismatic chemistry with her under these circumstances. And yet, there's enough there that I, at least, did find myself pulling for the two of them to get together.So I guess I'm the only one who's *glad* they cast Bogart instead of Cary Grant (despite the fact that I'm a *huge* Grant fan, he's my favorite actor). If Grant had had the role, it would've been obvious from frame 1 that Hepburn was fated to end up with him. With Bogart, we were never really sure *where* it was going. And that makes for a vastly better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivated this child of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this again just last week on Cinemax. It's in black and white (that never scared me off).Made 12 years before I was born, I saw it when I was in college (late 80's) and I've loved it since. I like the 1995 remake with Harrison Ford, and my favorite line from the remake (Sabrina to Linus): They say you're the world's only living heart donor. I love that line, but while there isn't an equivalent of that zinger in the Bogart/Hepburn version, I do think this is the superior product. This has Audrey Hepburn (Ormond can't compare), and it has the comedic/surrealistic touches of Billy Wilder (yes, Pollack can do comedy. I thought Tootsie was funny under Pollack's direction, and maybe Pollack should stick to original scripts like that).More than that, Sabrina is a product of the times. Compare the 1995 and the 1954 versions. There are lines in the 1954 version that can't be said in the 1995 version without people laughing at the wrong times. Are these more cynical times? Are there things we can't believe people doing now (like Linus's noble attitude in the end), making the remake seem anachronistic? I think that's the real problem with the remake. This 1954 version exists, and it sparkles and zips along faster than Ford's version. Ford's version doesn't distinguish itself enough. It's likable, there's that one line I really love, the actors are pretty, but it might as well be a Tom Hanks/ Meg Ryan vehicle, or (if remade yet again in the new millennium) a Matthew McConaughey/ Kate Hudson yawner.Remakes have a tough time usually, but it IS possible to improve an original. I thought The Fly with Jeff Goldblum took the story in directions I'd never imagine (focused on the romance!). Howard Hawk's His Girl Friday improved on The Front Page by turning the reporter from a guy to a girl. Or at least, strike out in a different direction. When Howard Hawk's The Thing from Outer Space was remade into John Carpenter's The Thing, Carpenter stuck closer to the original short story and added groundbreaking makeup effects. When Howard Hawk's Scarface was redone by Brian DePalma into Pacino's Scarface, he turned Scarface into a Cuban immigrant, and set the whole thing in Miami. Everything's changed, we're reminded of many things about the original, but the remakes are creatures of their own mind.So, I think I'll stick to this original, with the irreplaceable Audrey Hepburn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sabrina Fairchild (Audrey Hepburn) is the daughter of the chauffeur working for the Larrabees. Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart) is the stiff older responsible son. Sabrina is infatuated with the irresponsible thrice-divorced playboy son David Larrabee (William Holden) but he only sees a little girl. He flirts with Gretchen Van Horn and she comically tries to kill herself on the eve of going to Paris for cooking school only to be rescued by Linus. The lovesick Sabrina is befriended by Baron St. Fontanel. Linus arranges David to marry Elizabeth Tyson for business reasons. David is taken by the returning Sabrina but he doesn't recognize her at first. With his business deal in jeopardy, Linus tries to lure Sabrina away from David.The lovely Audrey Hepburn is absolutely enchanting. She makes a good romance into a great one. The movie could try a little harder to make her a tomboy in the early parts. She owns the screen from start to finish. The thirty years difference between her and Bogie is problematic but she makes it work somehow. She is simply magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sabrina (1954): Dir: Billy Wilder / Cast: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, William Holden, John Williams, Martha Hyer: Enchanting romantic comedy about young Sabrina Fairchild, daughter of a chauffeur. She is fixated on a playboy who is the brother of a wealthy individual who is trying to seal a deal but it depends on his brother marrying the daughter of the client. Sabrina is sent to Paris where she embarks in cooking classes but upon returning she is then noticed by the playboy who never noticed her before. To avoid a major business disaster her time is occupied by the wealthy man who ends up falling for her. Beautifully written yet predictable romantic comedy is another achievement by Billy Wilder whose range spans from Double Indemnity to Sunset Boulevard. His delivery here is presented as a modern day fairy tale where one factor dreams but never realizes her awakening to the real thing in plain view. Audrey Hepburn is captivating as Sabrina who longs for love and finds it in the most unlikely place. Humphrey Bogart as the tycoon realizes his love for her is a second chance at happiness. William Holden is superb as the irresponsible brother. John Williams is endearing as Sabrina's father. Martha Hyer plays Holden's fiancée whom everyone is struggling to maintain his attention on. For romantics anticipating love in the unlikeliest places. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes you CAN make a silk purse . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . out of a sow's ear (or, in SABRINA's case, a chauffeur's daughter). Aging business mogul Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart) tells his playboy younger brother David (William Holden) that he thinks of Sabrina as an "Ethyl" because she lives over the brothers' eight-car garage and always smells like gas. What every viewer can see for themselves, however, is that Aubrey Hepburn as chauffeur's daughter Sabrina is by far the most attractive belle at the frequent Larrabee balls. This is quite plausible, since modern psychology teaches us that self-made rich people are driven to become so to compensate for their less-than-average looks. Ironically, most of them are so hellbent on remaining rich for posterity that they mate within their "plain Jane" peer group, making each subsequent generation homelier than even their unattractive parents. Millions are then spent on plastic surgery (which does nothing to improve the genetics, but that's another story). Darwin explains all this in his Theory of Natural Selection, or Survival of the Fattest. However, long-in-the-tooth Linus thinks outside the box, and eventually realizes that what he will save on the expense of an elaborate wedding by eloping with the hired help--combined with lower plastic surgery costs for the spouse and any possible offspring--will cancel out much of the potential gain to be had by marrying a fellow fat cat Miss Moneybags. So it's homburgs off to SABRINA.</fullReview>

This Sabrina with Ms. Hepburn (she's a better Eliza Doolittle), Mr. Bogart, &amp; Mr. Holden is rather stiff, isn't as lighthearted and romantic as the one with Ms. Ormond, Mr. Ford,&amp; Mr. Kinnear. Take the scene where we first see Sabrina and Linus together. In the original, she's in the garage attempting suicide, &amp; he stops her; and in the remake, she goes to David's room to tell him how much she cares &amp; that she'll be thinking of him while in Paris, only to find Linus there instead. The latter is so cute and funny. And romantic chemistry with Sabrina/Linus: was there any between Audrey/Humphrey? Not that I could tell. Now, between Julia/Harrison it clicked the first time they were in the same room. Enjoy the version you wish, I'll be watching the remake. :)</fullReview>

She was truly a classic and timeless beauty with a sense of style, class, and grace every time that she entered the room. Audrey Hepburn made you love her effortlessly just by being herself. Audrey's Sabrina becomes a woman with style after two years in Paris in a prestigious cooking school. When she returns as the chauffeur's daughter, David Larrabe (played by William Holden) finally take notice of her. Unfortunately, he has to marry a wealthy woman to maintain the family's wealth. His brother Linus Larrabe (played by Humphrey Bogart) has to steer Sabrina away from David or the wedding and plans for a merger are off. Hepburn steals the scenes out from Bogart and Holden hands down. The film is a classic because of her. Nobody else could have delivered Sabrina so well. I didn't realize that Ms. McArdle, Linus' secretary, was played by Ellen Corby from the Waltons. Still It's a Wilder Classic. Maybe it should have been filmed in color.</fullReview>

A marriage between David and Elizabeth would seal the deal.Sabrina gets in the way of all this and it is up to the emotionally repressed Linus(Humphrey Bogart) to try and take Sabrina's attention away from David. He soon finds himself falling in love with her which causes bigger problems. Which brother will she choose?Hepburn is excellent as the shy girl who transforms into a confident and elegant young woman. Hepburn has good chemistry with both Holden and Bogart. Bogart does a wonderful job portraying the emotional changes Linus undergoes throughout the film, he starts off very repressed and serious, when he spends time with Sabrina he slowly begins to enjoy life and finds himself becoming more relaxed in her company. Holden steals every scene he's in as the dashing and fun loving David.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Linus Larrabee falls for the chauffeur's daughter? No big surprise there. Who wouldn't fall for Audrey Hepburn in this exceptional romantic comedy? She was never less than a magnetic screen presence, but here she's so heartbreakingly beautiful I defy anyone to resist her charms, even if they don't like the rom-com genre and are too cynical to enjoy the storyline, which is of course basically a warmed-over Cinderella. The moment where she emerges at the Long Island railroad station every inch the sophisticated parisienne is the most heart-warming cinematic makeover since Bette Davis walked down the gangplank of that cruise ship in Now, Voyager, and she's simply stunning in the party scene in the long Givenchy frock - offhand I can only think of Rita Hayworth in Gilda or Ava Gardner as equally iconic screen figures. Bogart is a little miscast, but it works nonetheless. The ending is lovely. And the dialogue - so often a Wilder strong point - simply sparkles.</fullReview>

Though it may be called a cutesy Cinderella story, Sabrina is deeper than a mere fairy-tale. Sabrina is a romance, a drama, and a comedy in that wonderful way Billy Wilder movies are (not all but a few. Other examples include Some Like it Hot). For Sabrina's problems do not end when she finally piques David's interest. They begin, like in real life. Sabrina is a beautiful blend of fantasy and reality, so possible, yet so impossible. No, I don't think Bogart made less of a Linus than other actors could have. If Cary Grant had done the movie it would have been no worse, yet no better. Thank you.</fullReview>

While I was ready to believe that he relieved her of her virginity in return for the lovely wardrobe &amp; the poodle, I had to doubt it when she told Linus Larrabee, "It was really only a change of haircut; inside I'm still the same."

It is not an overly subtle movie, and the characters sometimes change their whole outlook quite suddenly, but this is fairly common of the genre, and is not a particular flaw of this movie.If you are more interested in classics or Audrey Hepburn than romantic comedy, then you probably won't like the 1995 remake. If, however, you enjoy romantic comedy in general, and are willing to accept that they are not the same movie, I believe you may enjoy the remake even more than the original.

		<fullReview>Sydney non commercial TV station is having its kind of Audrey Hepburn festival with one of her film each week. So I watched Sabrina! Black and White! Apart from the tremendous enjoyment of such a charming, witty and sooooo funny story. I was thinking about today's generation and even one or two generations before theirs; Would they enjoy or be able to enjoy such a work? My first answer would be that they would not or could not and therefore I would tend to be sorry for them. But in second thought perhaps I'm wrong and even if I'm not, no doubt they have their own enjoyments just like we (the living dinosaurs) have ours and perhaps too would be unable or would have much difficulty to enjoy some pleasures of some centuries back. To conclude in this train of thoughts, there are so many choices about that sometimes it's not even a chronological matter, just a matter of inclination. Some of Sabrina's comments are so to the point and well written, I envy their authors and keep apologising for daring participate, but I enjoy contributing and it helps me keeping a little more memory about each film I have seen. Here I have read so many times about the whole Sabrina story, yet I would not be able to tell concisely about this film I watched no longer ago than last night. But what I can tell is how much I enjoyed it, just like many comments described how enjoyable it is. I also hope by sharing some feelings on these movies it may be of some benefit for others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sweet experience, that lasts, and to which i know i will come back several times.Audrey Hepburn, the icon, begins here. I think Roman Holiday was just an unconscious prediction of what would come. And that shows here, the moment Sabrina comes back from Paris. Audrey had probably so much of natural ability to captivate sweet attentions on-screen as she of intentional poses. She works with her face above all, also with her pose and her walking (in a distance plan, she works with her subtle body movements). She danced, ballet, that probably counts for the effect. But besides that, there was a collective effort involving many (very) competent people, that would eventually make her the person with more class and charm on screen. Givenchy had a lot to do with this, in my opinion. This makes this film particularly important to watch, for it has the very precise moment in which, on screen, the changing happens. Givenchy only dresses Hepburn after Sabrina comes back from Paris. With the clothes, she assumes a new pose, everlasting, i would say.The film exists to frame the precise moment of this transformation, so the Cinderella set up is used. I think this was all deliberate, and cleverly conceived. So we, viewers, come to fall in love with Audrey, Bogart and Holden represent us on screen, falling in love with Sabrina.A side note is there i think it's not immediate this fascination for the on screen character of Hepburn. Her face captivates, despite its funny look (which would later name other Audrey dedicated film), but her class takes time to absorb. Probably that's why her characters came to love older men in her films.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surrounding young Audrey Hepburn with Humphrey Bogart &amp; William Holden was a pretty good idea anytime. In 1954- this film was the product. Billy Wilder does pretty well attempting a romantic comedy here. This film was Audrey's followup to Roman Holiday. She is fine in both films.Bogart was getting pretty old to be doing romantic leads, but he always seems to fit with younger women. I think most men in their 50's would like to fit in with the twenty-somethings lots.Wilder fans will find this film pretty much fits the mold and everyone is at a good spot in their career doing good work on this one. While each cast member has better films, I like this one as a good film. Even Wilder has better ones, but this one still bears his trade mark well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By 1954, it had been a few years since Billy Wilder's last foray into romantic comedy, and, in any case, he had achieved the bulk of his success with cynical, often darkly-humorous dramas, such as 'Double Indemnity (1944),' 'The Lost Weekend (1945),' 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' and, most recently, 'Stalag 17 (1953).' His adaptation of Samuel A. Taylor popular play, "Sabrina Fair," marked a significant turning-point in Wilder's career, and it was only after 'Sabrina (1954)' that the director became celebrated as one of Hollywood's finest entertainers, triggering such acclaim that he effectively dedicated the remainder of his film-making days to producing comedy. With a cast to make any film producer salivate at the mouth ? Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Audrey Hepburn ? the film is an engaging Cinderella story {in contrast to Hepburn's previous breakthrough performance in 'Roman Holiday (1953),' which might be described as Cinderella in reverse}, and seems very conspicuous among the director's body of work, but pure Wilder is countless other regards.Sabrina Fairchild (Hepburn, looking impossibly elegant) is the daughter of a chauffeur, and has spent her childhood and adolescent years idolising the youngest son of the wealthy family by whom her father is employed. However, haughty playboy David Larrabee does not share her affections, and, indeed, hardly acknowledges that she even exists. After a two-year absence in Paris, during which she almost comes to forget her irrational crush, Sabrina returns to Long Island as an elegant and mature young woman, and it doesn't take long for David to sit up and take notice of what he's been missing. However, David's weary, business-orientated older brother, Linus (Bogart), fears that such a romance will prove detrimental to an approaching business contract, and so ventures to deflect the imminent passion by showering Sabrina with affections of his own. Meanwhile, the young woman's chauffeur father, Thomas Fairchild (John Williams), silently stresses that his daughter is attempting to break the class barrier, and his wealthy employer (Walter Hampden) is likewise thrown into panic at the very thought.The film's screenplay, written by Wilder, Taylor and Ernest Lehman, is smart and brisk, constantly moving forwards, though never into unexpected territory. The acting is universally excellent, with the performers each finding a steady balance between romance and comedy, and Bogart {just three years from his premature death} obviously relished the opportunity to abandon his typical tough-guy persona and have some fun in a lightweight role. While the story does distinguish itself from its contemporary romantic comedies through several dark episodes, such as Sabrina's attempted suicide and Linus' suspect intentions towards her, Wilder's film is a women's picture through-and-through. The film is sorely missing that trademark cynicism to be found in most of the director's other screenplays, and, by the end of the film, everything has been wrapped up nicely ? perhaps too nicely ? in preparation for a happy ending. As a Wilder picture, it's something of a letdown, but, as far as Cinderella stories are concerned, 'Sabrina' is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long admired as one of the film business' most mordant wits, Billy Wilder has only recently been given his full honors as one of the great directors, fully on par with Ford, Hitchcock, De Sica, etc - even noted dissenter Andrew Sarris has finally come around. It's as if his track record was working against him all these years: anyone who could make as many smart, sarcastic, deeply felt and compulsively watchable movies as Wilder has in one career MUST be a clever fraud. But Wilder was one of a small handful of Hollywood moviemakers who constantly pushed the boundaries of the Production Code, nearly always leaving the bar raised a little higher in his wake with each project...for which all of us in the audience (minus a few blue-haired biddies) must be grateful. Even a slightly flat souffle like SABRINA benefits from his presumption of the audience's intelligence: like all his work of this period, SABRINA is a movie for adults - although there are too many out there who assume this precludes idealism, romantic longing and fairy-tale fade-outs. Audrey Hepburn is extremely affecting in the lead role; already a star, her performance as the butterfly gamine Sabrina might be her finest. Bogart (hardly Wilder's favorite actor by a long shot) is miscast, not for his age - he's, after all, playing a man who is far too old to be romancing this girl - but his obvious antipathy for Hepburn (his famous quote on his co-star: "She's all right, if you don't mind a dozen takes") is a hurdle not even Wilder can overcome, yet this flaw is nearly offset by another great performance by William Holden, Wilder's lucky charm. Wilder consistently gave Holden the kind of roles that allowed him the kind of acerbic straightforwardness and native intelligence Bogart himself had made his bones with a decade earlier, with the added dimension of youthful virility and good looks. As a result, Holden became not just a huge star, but one with an undercurrent of integrity that served him beautifully in later films like THE WILD BUNCH. The 50s didn't yield very many brand-name marquee toppers of Holden's quality - Robert Ryan comes to mind, and Sterling Hayden showed flashes of it - and, if nothing else, SABRINA showed audiences that the Holden of SUNSET BLVD and STALAG 17 was also an accomplished comic actor, who nearly walks off with the picture. While it's true that SABRINA, for all its charm, is an overall disappointment from Wilder (it comes off a bit like Lubitsch-vinaigrette), take it in context: if this very entertaining comedy represents a failure for Wilder, imagine how good his triumphs are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, instructive to compare SABRINA 1954 to SABRINA 1995!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film - read others above for a summary of this modern day Cinderella story! Worth buyng. Definitely on my "chick flick" list also.I still think that 1995 SABRINA is a tad better-- even tho the cast on both is superb.My tiebreaker is - the supporting cast. Their roles are more developed---so the story denouement is thus more believable.Maybe it's because I've seen more of the 1995 supporting actors around...Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee matriarch) was great at playing powerful matriarchs. Here, she is again in command and WATCH her dialogues with both sons - especially LINUS!!!But 1954 Audrey Hepburn is also fun to just watch...as no one transforms to elegant fashionable woman better than her---but Julia Ormond (also radiating European-bred elegance) comes close. (Script writers - actors - would-be directors - take note!!! Lots of style in both versions!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some bizarre casting, this is a lovely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a young lady, Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn), who is the chauffeur's daughter for the Larrabee family. Despite being poor and him being a hopeless playboy, she has visions of falling in love with and marrying the rich David Larrabee (William Holden). Well, after she returns from college, she has blossomed into a beautiful lady--so beautiful that David is head over heels for her. However, the very business-oriented older brother, Linus (Humphrey Bogart) sees that if this romance is allowed to grow, it will hurt the company business. So, being the manipulative sort, he arranges for an accident to happen to David and takes over the job of wooing Sabrina himself--even though he is a rather cold fish. Amazingly, over time, the mismatched couple manage to create a spark of love--and this leads to even worse complications.As many people have heard, Humphrey Bogart apparently hating being cast in this film, as he felt too old to play this character. Well, he was right--Linus should have been younger and it seemed strange seeing Bogart romancing a lady half his age. However, if you look past this, you'll see that the film is exceptional throughout. The biggest star of this production is the director, Billy Wilder. He exercised such a deft hand and the film just exuded quality--you can't help but get sucked into the story. Sure, the actors were excellent, but it all worked so well despite bizarre casting because the guy in charge was so skilled at creating the perfect mood. An absolute charmer and quite the romantic picture despite dour old Humphrey! By the way, this film was re-made years later with Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond and Greg Kinear. While this is a very good film as well, it certainly wasn't necessary--adding nothing to the original tale--and messing it up a bit along the way (why make the virginal Sabrina more worldly and sexually active??). And my advice is why see the re-make when the original is better?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent dialog and a fine supporting cast aid this "class war" comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sabrina Fair" was a very successful Broadway play, written by Samuel A. Taylor, before Taylor and Ernest Lehman turned it into a well-remembered (1954) screenplay for Billy Wilder who also produced the movie. Under Wilder's direction, the project turned into a vehicle film for Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart, instead of Betsy Drake, Van Helflin and Charles Drake,m who could have played the parts believably opposite John Williams as Fairchild (the butler whose daughter Sabrina happens to be). The film retails the story of a girl lost between two worlds who has always been in love with one of the Long Island Larrabee brothers, the oft-married non-working David, but then has to choose between him and his dour, homburg wearing, umbrella toting nose-to-the-grindstone brother Linus as well. Frederick Hollander wrote a breezy score and Charles Lang Jr, provided fine B/W cinematography for the resulting romp. Edith Head provided the high-fashion costumes with uncredited assistance from Hubert de Givenchy. Hal Pereria's and Walter Tyler's Art Direction succeeded throughout, while Sam Comer's and Ray Moyer's set decorations played a subtle but powerful role in bringing the world of the Larrabees to cinematic life. Eugene Loring's choreography enlivened several scenes as well. Among the fine supporting cast, one can notice Emory Parnell, Nancy Kulp, Marjorie Bennett, Marcel Hilaire as the chef, Marcel Dalio as the Baron, Martha Hyer, Joan Vohs, Francis X. Bushman and Nella Walker, Kay Riehl, Walter Hampden as the family patriarch, a miscast Ellen Corby, Raymond Bailey and more familiar favorites, all else well-employed. This is a play with unusually intelligent dialog, whose sub-theme is the degeneration of the U.S. under public-interest lawmaking into what it was to become--an elitism of corporation CEOs, bureaucrats and unworthy gatekeeper 'bosses'. The film's best line may well be the one that suggests that no one ever called a chauffeur's daughter enlightened for marrying a millionaire. The problem with the main actors I suggest is that they are all somewhat miscast. Of the three, Humphrey Bogart gives the best line readings, but he cannot play a successful upper-class professional of any sort. Audrey Hepburn is pretty, fey and surprisingly adept at reading comedy lines for her age, but she never quite seems like an intelligent person who happens to be a chauffeur's daughter who can belong as a grownup to a world of any elite. And William Holden is simply too everything for his part--a bit too old, too polished and too charismatic, as well as trying too hard; his fine steps forward as an actor, however, moving toward "Picnic" and his noteworthy later work need to be commended here as well. The film is more thoughtful than one might expect and quite clever in its characterization of human beings stuck in class types within a country that was supposed to have none. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie twice and I love Audrey Hepburn even though I was not even born when she did just about all of her movies.I have watched many of her movies on cable and on videotape and love them. I adore William Holden as he is so handsome and charming in this movie. Now for the bummer ,While its fun to watch Audrey and the handsome Holden in scenes together it is dull when Bogart is on the screen ,He is a terrific actor but is majorly miscast here,I cannot fathom how he was picked to portray a love interest for then 25 y/o goddess Audrey , he was 55 at the time and much too old and in my opinion a very unattractive man,(Harrison Ford at least had some sex appeal in the remake and has nice looks).. , supposedly he hated doing this movie ,detested holden and even disliked Hepburn and had wanted his wife Lauren Bacall to play Sabrina.I wish they had used Cary Grant as was rumored originally picked to play the part. I give this movie 2 stars out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie even with Bogey out of character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart was once quoted just after signing his biggest contract deal ever with a movie studio, as saying "I like having lots of money, it makes me able to tell the big shots where to get off". He plays one of those big shots in Sabrina. His part of Linus is well played, even though this is not his usual character role of a wide open if reluctant champion of good. Audrey Hepburn has little trouble convincing us that she is ready to step into a snobbish lifestyle, since that was probably her normal personality. The film's weak spot is William Holden. Holden is not often accused of great acting and this movie helps prove that point. Strong point: lots of major actors and actresses; weakness: William Holden's less than believable role as David.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hepburn is a joy but Bogie phoned it in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart was badly miscast. He was far too old for the part and there was zero chemistry between he and Hepburn. He basically sulks and pouts through the film, which could have been one of Hepburn's best. Oh if only Cary Grant had accepted the role. We are expected to believe that Hepburn falls in love with him over Holden. Yeah, right. The chemistry with Holden is all over (and off) the screen. Bogart, on the other hand, comes off as a dirty old man lusting after the radiant Hepburn. The film had everything going for it, Billy Wilder at the height of his powers as director and one of the most appealing female leads of the 20th Century. Instead it just comes off as a creepy film about a unappealing and lecherous old man who pursues the love of a young woman. Poor girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First time the remake is better than original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think that a film with Hepburn, Holden and Bogie would be a perfect film, well it isn't!! First off, Bogie is Waaaaay TOO old to get our young Audrey. What is he going to do? Sit her on his knee and tell her bedtime stories! To top it all off, Bogie acts cold towards her. There is no real emotion showing through in his acting. This is a part that calls for him to fall in love with her, and he shows nothing. I learned after watching this that it was rumored that Bogie hated Hepburn and would ignore her inbetween takes. Well it seemed to be true because watching this film he doesn't seem like he cared for her at all. Poor Audrey.Second, Audrey is much TOO pretty to pass as an unattractive girl in the beginning of the film. This is just like what happened in "My Fair Lady". She is a goddess. How can any man in his right mind NOT be interested in her. PLEASE!! You can not make her unattractive. So putting her in this part just doesn't work. Especially with BOGIE! Don't get me wrong. I love Ms. Hepburn, and in this film she is very charming just too pretty.The only one who gets it right is William Holden. He is a charm as the younger playboy brother. In the movies he rarely got it wrong. The relationship between the characters Bogie/Holden and Hepburn/Holden were played well on screen. The rest of the cast were fine and at least helped make this film some what enjoyable. It just ticks me off thinking that this could have been so much better if the casting had been different. Sorry people, I am just a stickler for believablity. My recommendation: The remake of "Sabrina" made in 1995 is MUCH BETTER. Now they got it right! Pass this one by like it never existed....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fairy tale of class relationships framed as an American "romantic comedy", in which a chauffeur's daughter falls in love with a son of a rich capitalist family.Although the strict Marxist framing seems somewhat dated today, there are indeed still lessons to be learned from this film. The self-hating father, whose identity is based entirely on the ideology of his oppressors, remains a compelling case for proletarian re-education. And as a cautionary tale about the (literally) seductive powers of the bourgeois, this film retains its power.Although the reactionay ending is disappointing, any film that presents American tycoons and European aristocrats as virtual pedophiles, ravaging the naive energy of the proletariat, cannot be all bad.Stylishly filmed in black white by the always reliable Billy Wilder. Some decent jokes, plus Bogart. 5/10.</fullReview>
