		<shortDescription>The Salvation of Linus the King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tempting though it may be to compare this film to the 1954 version, you will miss the point if you do. To understand the true magic of Sydney Pollack's masterpiece, read the Samuel A. Taylor play both films were based on. While I'm sure the play was a great evening out at the theater between martinis in the 1950s, it's somewhat incredible that two film versions so profoundly translated this lightweight romantic comedy, each in its own time.In 1954, Billy Wilder used an incredible cast to entertain. No, Bogart should never have been cast. Cary Grant might have created the dynamic relationship with Audrey Hepburn we fortunately got to see later in Charade, but if Bogart had not been cast would the film hold its classic status? Hepburn transfixed an audience and brought to the world La Vie en Rose. William Holden is period eye candy, and the film will always be fun.Forty years later, however, Pollack made an important film. Taylor's play is, after all, just a fairy tale, and this film fully realizes it. Ormond is enchanting. Kinnear ripens the always empty David. Fanny Ardant brings a french cinema quality to the film's Paris episodes. Marchand's "I didn't teach you this" culminates what may be one of the best written scenes in American film. You can watch this scene over and over and each time gain a better understanding of how great acting can define a relationship, this one between mother and son, for an audience.But this film should have been called Linus. Harrison Ford's tour de force performance as the greater Larrabee fulfills Pollack's mission to tell a simple story of how a king is transformed by the love of a woman."It was a lie, then it was a dream."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic comedy doesn't get better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original "Sabrina" before ever seeing the remake. I adored Audrey Hepburn in all of her movies, and this was not an exception. Her comedic timing was perfect. She was completely believable as a young ingenue, and of course, she would not be Audrey Hepburn if she weren't absolutely breakthtaking on screen. But while I enjoyed the original, I have seen it only once, whereas I have seen the remake so many times I have lost count! The 1995 "Sabrina" is a gem of a film. I keep hearing myself describe it as funny, but sometimes I wonder if that's even the right word. That's because except for that rather unexpected burst of laughter from Linus' secretary, which cracks me up EVERY time I get to that part, I have never found myself laughing aloud while watching this movie. But the humor is so cleverly written, it is impossible to ignore just how charming and comical this movie is.The script is wonderfully brought to life by the outstanding cast. Harrison Ford is superb as Linus Larrabee. He plays Linus as a serious and almost ruthless businessman, and yet gains our sympathy as he gradually shows a tender and vulnerable side to Linus' cool exterior. Greg Kinnear is well-cast as Linus' dish of a younger brother, David. True, David is self-centered, careless, and carefree. But Greg Kinnear plays him with utter charm that we understand why Sabrina and women in general are so taken with him. And what of Julia Ormond? Well, I think she was absolutely perfect as Sabrina. If she had felt any trepidation essaying the role that had been so closely identified with an icon like Audrey Hepburn, none of her nerves translated on to the screen. She IS Sabrina. I think it's a wonderful combination of her beauty and acting skills that helped her succeed in this role. The sincerity of her performance makes Sabrina so appealing and completely lovable.The performances of the three leads are complemented by a fine supporting cast made up of John Wood, Nancy Marchand, Dana Ivey, Richard Crenna, and Angie Dickinson. Some of the film's funniest moments involve their characters. And then there is the exquisite soundtrack composed by John Williams. The score is at once dreamy and intoxicating. Two songs that were written for the movie, "(In the) Moonlight" and "How Can I Remember?", are just as memorable and perfectly capture the feelings of romance and longing.Hollywood has made a number of successful romantic movies, and I think "Sabrina" ranks as one of its best. Its charm never wears off. It sweeps you off your feet and makes your heart soar. It is a marvelous, marvelous film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinderella has nothing on her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised at how good this movie is. A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart. The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.And let's just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this. No way could this be anything near as good as the original. And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded. Julia Ormond, who was given Miss Hepburn's title role, seemed nothing far removed from ordinary; and Greg Kinnear, who played the playboy David Larrabee, seemed a poor imitation of William Holden. Of course Harrison Ford, I told myself, is another story, since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman, and a fine, accomplished leading man. He would be, I suspected, the lone bright spot. In the original, Humphrey Bogart, a little past his prime, and in not exactly the best of moods, and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn, played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances. Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.He did, but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh, so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be. I mean, Cinderella move over. Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven. It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur's daughter than what transpires here.Quickly here's the premise of this celluloid fairy tale/romance: Pretty but ordinary Sabrina, born of working class parents, her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees, grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate. She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers, David, who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name. When she comes of age, she goes away to Paris (apparently to work for a fashion magazine: in the original Sabrina, she goes to a cooking school in Paris), picks up confidence and a new kind of eye-popping sophistication, comes back and...well, gets noticed.The basic skeleton of this, the story from the first Sabrina (1954), which is dreamily romantic enough and then some, is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina's character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic. Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow's end she gets. I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script (trading e-mails perhaps): "They want romance, they want woman's fantasy? They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting? How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome, very rich brothers? She can take her pick. We've give 'em romance, we'll give 'em dreams come true!" And they do. Not only that, but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment, and they do that very cleverly.Of course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Ford--at his best, by the way--and Julia Ormond, a hard-working and talented actress (I recall her from Smilla's Sense of Snow, 1997), who knows how to be cute without fawning, supported by Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood and Angie Dickinson. I mention Miss Dickinson because, as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding, she gets to deliver this "let them eat cake" line: "We thought we'd use recycled paper" (for the wedding invitations).The script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy. For example, when Sabrina removes her glasses (the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan) after gaining sophistication in Paris, she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein: "America is my country and Paris is my home." (Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris, Texas--but that is another film, and besides, I digress...)I also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris would-be lover who kisses her, and--noticing that she is not as engaged as she might me?observes with perfect decorum, "I'm embarrassed that you're somewhere else."Memorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt. By the way, he has a number of good lines, and he delivers them well.I especially liked it when he sadly confessed: "I was sent to deal with you. I sent myself." It is probably better if you haven't seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons. Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez. They really are very different people. And comparing Billy Wilder's 1954 film (from the play by Samuel Taylor) is a little like comparing Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber's.Bottom line: see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the business-first character of the "only surviving heart donor" very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>Many won't agree, and the critics may have panned it, but I feel this fantastic , feel-good movie exemplifies what all great movies should be: entertaining , intelligent, thoughtful, with touches of comedy, pathos, and respect for the human condition.. I find myself watching this magnificent work over and over and over, and never tiring of it. I feel Harrison Ford delivers his best performance, bar none, and really shows that he is one our best actors. Julia Ormond: well, what can I say. Just absolutely the most beautiful, sexy, wonderful actress living today... I fall in love with her all over again each time I watch the movie. Greg Kinnear is a very believable co-star and funny, funny... the players are selected very well , each contributing mightily to the final effect! The director really knew what he was doing and keeps the movie going strong.. congratulations to all. I wish there were more works like this, and would really like to see another done with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in the title roles, oncemore!. Bravo! Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comparisons are hardly ever fair, yet people insist on making them. DON'T compare this film to the original. Who cares? Judge it on it's own merits, and you'll come up with a winner. The interaction between the players is seamless. The dialog is witty, intelligent, at times touching, and always believable.This "Sabrina" is a delight. A truly classic romantic comedy in the finest sense of the word. Harrison Ford portrays Linus Larrabee, perfectly blending ruthless billionaire and socially awkward male. Flawless in business matters, he's out of his element and totally unprepared for the consequences of what he originally deems a simple matter, turning Sabrina Fairchild's interest to himself instead of brother David (Greg Kinnear), thereby saving both an impending marriage and lucrative corporate merger.Julia Ormond's Sabrina is just the right mixture of sophistication and innocence. Daughter of the Larrabee's chauffeur, she's grown up on the family estate, yet outside of their social circle, of course. Passionately in love with youngest son David Larrabee, we see her in the movie's opening moments hard at her favorite pastime, spying on David and fantasizing that she is the girl he's currently schmoozing at mother Maude's annual birthday bash. Her father, Thomas Fairchild (John Wood) in an effort to broaden her horizons and get her past this obsession with David, arranges with Maude (Nancy Marchand) to send Sabrina to Paris for a year. He hopes she will learn about life and independence while working in the Paris offices of Vogue.While Sabrina is away, David meets beautiful Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), up and coming pediatrician. Coincidentally, she is the daughter of Patrick Tyson (Richard Crenna), owner of Tyson Electronics, a high technology firm that Linus has had his eye on for some time. As his brother's relationship blossoms, Linus quietly begins buying up Tyson stock.To Linus, everything seems to be proceeding as it should be. David and Elizabeth have finally set a date. He and Patrick Tyson are in serious merger negotiations. Maude and Ingrid Tyson (Angie Dickenson) are planning their children's monster wedding. All is about to change, however. A year has passed. Once again, Maude's birthday party approaches. It's also time for Sabrina to come home.Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job, mixing just the right recipe of romance and comedy throughout. We, the audience, are just as stunned as the movie's characters at the "new" Sabrina. With a Parisian haircut, in chic black with enormous sunglasses, she is nearly as unrecognizable to us as she obviously is to David. In town to pick up a gift for his mother, David, ever the playboy, offers what he clearly sees as an incredibly hot girl a lift home. He has no idea it's Sabrina, and she exacts a small measure of delicious revenge during the ride, watching him squirm uncomfortably as he tries vainly to remember who she is.To make amends and intrigued by the mystery, David invites her to "his house" for a drink. She accepts gleefully. The charade continues until they arrive at the Larrabee estate (quite a bit of which was filmed at the Harrison Conference Center in Glen Cove, NY), whereupon Linus instantly recognizes her and welcomes her home.Linus, who never misses much, also sees trouble. Big trouble, judging by the smitten look on his brother's face. Thomas Fairchild, in turn, watching his daughter steam out a dress for Maude's party, doesn't like it much either. This was not at all what he had planned when he sent her to Paris.The night of Maude's party arrives, complete with a live band, perfect weather ("It never rained on a Larrabee party. The Larrabee's wouldn't have allowed it..."), and, this time, as an invited guest, Sabrina.Admittedly, there are many actresses on screen today for whom the word "beautiful" is but a pale description. Even so, I would put Ormand's Sabrina on the party's walkway as one of the most incredibly stunning appearances of all time. She is, literally, breathtaking. And David, to the panicked concern of his mother and brother, is done when he sees her. Finished. Forget Elizabeth. Forget the impending marriage. He sees nothing but Sabrina, while Maude and Linus see a billion dollar merger about to go into the tank.That's enough plot synopsis. Suffice it to say that Linus and Maude decide to get David out of the way while Linus puts right what is going terribly wrong. You'll have to watch the rest of this charming film to see how it all turns out.The casting is first class. Besides Ford and Ormond, Nancy Marchand's Maude is acerbically intelligent, blending wealthy arrogance (Can't we SEND somebody?") and human compassion for Sabrina, with a deep love, and intimate knowledge of the psychology of her two sons. Greg Kinnear shines as the lovably lazy David, who works hardest at doing nothing productive. Lauren Holly's Elizabeth is the perfect opposite.The supporting players are no less capable in their respective roles. John Wood is always elegant as the quintessential chauffeur and loving father. It brought a smile to see Crenna and Dickenson together again as the Tysons, and veteran character actress Dana Ivey is a gem as Mack, Linus' watchdog assistant (But he PAYS me to tell him..."). Some of the movie's best scenes are with the remainder of the ensemble cast in the servant's kitchen, particularly those with Rosa (Miriam Colon).So, in conclusion, I emphatically urge you to rent, or better still, buy this film. Though the Bogart/Hepburn purists will probably flame me into oblivion, I'm sure you'll find it entertaining, heartwarming, and absolutely leisure time well spent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina contains about every cliché you could possibly imagine: an apparently dowdy young woman undergoing a makeover whilst abroad and returning home looking stunning; a young playboy who the girl has always loved initially failing to recognise her with her new look then pursuing her romantically; the overly-serious older brother using the girl in a plan to achieve his business ends then realising that he really does love her; the younger brother proving at the end that he's not so dumb after all - the list of stereotypes could go on and on. However having said all that, when such a seemingly familiar film is as well made and as beautifully scripted and acted as Sabrina, it's hard not to be swept along with it and to enjoy every minute. I loved the performances here, particularly from Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond. I've never seen Ford play such a staid, uncharismatic character as Linus before but I get the impression from watching the film that he enjoyed the opportunity to take on this kind of part. Ormond makes an extremely engaging leading lady, perfect for the role of Sabrina. I particularly enjoyed Sabrina's mirthful reaction to seeing Linus put on the baseball cap while he's trying to win her affection. Also very funny was Linus' effortless recognition of the new-look Sabrina thus revealing her identity to a confused David. John Willliams also contributes a nice score. This is a classy romantic comedy, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of romantic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romantic is the word for this movie. The story, the settings, everything adds up to romantic. And it's clean - no gratuitous sex scenes or foul language! A rarity for a 90s movie. This movie has a timeless quality to it, and part of the reason is the (again) extremely romantic score! Many critics panned this version of "Sabrina", unfairly comparing it to the original Audrey Hepburn "Sabrina". Nobody could ever compare to Audrey Hepburn, but Julia Ormond is a fine Sabrina in her own right. She makes the transition from awkward teen to glamorous woman with subtlety and grace. Greg Kinnear shows a natural flair for acting in his first major movie role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They don't make 'em like they used to. In fact, it seems no matter how they try, they just can't make 'em like they used to.Sydney Pollack's remake of the 1954 romantic - comedy "Sabrina" from Billy Wilder is as flat as a tack in this 90's setting. Absolutely nothing works for Pollack or new screenwriters Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel. This sort of film just does not suit the style that so complimented the likes of "While You Were Sleeping" and "Sleepless in Seattle". There are so many things wrong with this pic I could go on forever about what has no effect.Harrison Ford is no Bogart. Though I consider him to be a fine actor, "Sabrina" is proof he is not a romantic lead. Ford is unable to make any impact as hard-nosed business man Linus Larrabee, and everything he tries fails, including all his comic moments and any intimate scenes with Julia Ormond, who, by the way, is no Audrey Hepburn. Miss Ormond is no more "Sabrina" than Danny De Vito is "Conan". She cannot even begin to do anything with this character, if only because hers, and every other character are all so out of place in the nineties. In fact this is one of the biggest mistakes that Benedek and Rayfiel have made in setting this definitive 50's romance in the modern era. Big miscalculation. That is what the whole show turns out to be.Ford and Ormond create zero chemistry, and he looks old enough to be her aging father (at least 30 years older). You just can't believe him, feel sorry for her or buy into any aspect of their relationship. Flick struggles to be funny throughout, and none of the cast is able to rescue, resurrect or otherwise resuscitate this floundering, very lost film. What did Pollack think he was doing? Surely he of all people should have known to leave this doomed remake well alone.Entire cast struggle to communicate character motivation, and little else, including Paris scenery, can help this misplaced, poorly judged dead weight. One of the most disappointing remakes I have ever seen.Saturday, February 17, 1996 - Greater Union Melbourne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so terrible I don't know how I even managed to finish it. I've seen the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden and I have to say that this version does not at all compare. In fact, this version has me wondering if the filmmakers even saw the original.**********SPOILERS**********The movie has so many flaws that I can point out more than just a few. In the original, Sabrina goes to Paris to study cooking and the night before she leaves, she tries to kill herself. In the hideous remake, she goes to Paris to work for Vogue (I know the story had to be slightly updated, but this is ridiculous) and there is no suicide attempt. Also in the original, Audrey Hepburn portrays Sabrina with a certain confidence and certainty, while Julia Ormond's performance makes Sabrina more neurotic and overanxious than ever. The filmmakers also thought it fit to destroy the character of Mr. Larrabee and to make his wife (now a widow) a representative of the company. Lastly, while the ending in the original leaves much to the imagination- ending just as Sabrina and Linus meet on the boat, the remake decided to take it a step further and create about 10 minutes of dialogue between the two actors. I cannot stress enough the dismay I felt while viewing this cinematic disgrace. If you want the real story, stick to the black and white classic because a remake is not always better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This adaptation of an almost classic film makes some weird changes and leaves others that look like an anachronism in a world forty years later. It's better to take the new film for what it is and judge it on its own merits and flaws. Sabrina's sojourn in Paris is too brief to remake her and for Paris to become an obsession on her return. How does she land directly into the world of high fashion? It's hard to accept the younger brother's sudden transformation from a playboy into the responsible serious role of his older brother. It happens towards the end just when the plot needs a new direction. Just as his new doctor finance suddenly reappears when needed. She and all the minor characters are just one-dimensional figures. Ford is well?no Bogart but Humphrey wasn't any better in the role either. Julia Ormond, despite the criticism on this forum, is the one bright star. She shines and has a bit of Hepburn quality in her radiance as a grown woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film. The acting, the music, the dialogue, the gorgeous scenes of Paris and New England, and the glamourous parties. Julia Ormond is no Audrey Hepburn, but who is? I think she hit all the right notes as the shy, clumsy girl who goes away, blossoms, and comes home confident and glamourous. Ormond's Sabrina never loses her innocence or her good heart. Greg Kinnear was hilarious as the lovable ladies' man (and looks a lot like William Holden in the original). Nancy Marchand was hysterically funny as the crabby Mrs. Larabee, and John Wood turned in a good performance as Sabrina's father.But I did have a harder time with Harrison Ford's Linus. He seemed too dark and too greedy to buy as loving Sabrina, even when he called off the merger. It always seemed to ring false in a way. He seemed a lot like the character of Richard in "Caroline in the City". But I regress. This is a very good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film I found it quite enjoyable to watch. It could have been much better though. A lot of it was a straight remake of the 1950's original. The things that they updated were a bit strange to say the least. Sabrina goes to Paris to become a photographer? Why exactly? Chef's make a heck of a lot of money these days there is no shame in being a cook. I wasn't that interested on her finding herself in Paris. Nor did I like her haircut when she came back. It was very severe and made her look rather old. The Handsome younger brother - I'm sorry but if I had a choice between Greg Kinnear and Harrison Ford. I would pick Harrison Ford every time, and twice on Sundays! If you are going to have a handsome younger brother then for goodness sake cast someone that is better looking than Harrison Ford. Linus' clothing left a lot to be desired. The bow tied suits and the huge glasses. If they wanted to convey that he was old then it would have been better to have had him dressed in three piece suits (waistcoat as well as jacket) with a tie, not that stupid bow tie business. That was far too old for the character. He also could have been wearing bi-focal glasses which would have made him older. I don't know why they killed off the father, perhaps because they couldn't find someone who would intimidate Ford.I did think that the film shouldn't have ended where it did, you should have been given a glimpse of the life that Linus and Sabrina had in Europe. I felt that this film needed that, it felt rather unfinished. I didn't feel this way about the original, perhaps because it was set in a different time period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Passable but overlong remake of the classic Audrey Hepburn vehicle will play best for those not familiar with the original. The cast(Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, Greg Kinnear) performs well and its production values are high but director Sydney Pollack's pacing tends to flag. By contrast, Billy Wilder's direction of the 1954 version is much tighter and quicker. Interestingly this "Sabrina" is 15 minutes longer than its predecessor but thanks to Pollack those extra 15 minutes feel like 30. Also, Barbara Benedek's and David Rayfiel's script lacks the wittiness that scenarists Billy Wilder, Samuel Taylor("Vertigo") and Ernest Lehman("The Prize," "North by Northwest") provided the first time around.Bottom line: 6 out 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, of course. Still, it just saddened me that so many people seem to prefer this to the original. Sure, in the original, Bogart was a bit miscast but hey! He was still Bogie. (anyhow, supposedly Cary Grant was an original choice and they even considered Holden for the Linus role instead) The point is - it was a single, cohesive storyline, with distinctly drawn characters and impeccable pacing. I really wanted to love the remake, but the most glaring flaw was the narcoleptic Julia Ormond. She has the uncanny ability to suck the oxygen out of any room. She actually seemed BORED with the role...as if it weren't artsy enough for her. She was just dull, lifeless and frankly, quite unexceptional. You never got what the fuss was about. If they had to remake it - why cast such a freaking LOX when there were so many delightful, charismatic young actresses who could have given the film a sporting chance? I just don't get what so many people seem to find so enchanting about this utterly forgettable bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>remakes = lack of new ideas?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't even watch to the end and had to stop in the middle - which I usually never do for a movie or a book. Everything seemed dull.- Julia Ormond: is sad and ugly, even when she is supposedly that new fashionable woman back from Paris. She doesn't have the playfulness and liveliness or even half of the class and sense of style and fashion of the original (and she is supposed to have worked at Vogue). Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's (The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young) and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep, as the assistant photographer. In the original, it is not deep or detailed either, but at least it is done in a fun, lighthearted way at the cooking school.- the dialogs:they were painful, dull and the self-awareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars, or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father.- I felt sad for Harrison Ford, because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast, but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place.- I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link, except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing? - In the old times, they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today, we over explain. An example. In the old version, when we are first introduced to the Larabees, we see a painting of the family on the wall, then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride, the arrogance of a rich family, the annoyed expression of Bogart, the delighted smile of his brother, the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version, we have a painfully long explanation of who is who, showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending, where Linus gets on the boat, asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt, and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads.I could go on and on, scene by scene, from the chauffeur, to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook, to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs, the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable remake about a chauffeur's daughter romanced by a likable young and his older brother , an aging tycoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Light though overlong romantic comedy-remake (of the 1954 classic movie) with nice actors , luxurious scenarios and decent direction . The known story of Sabrina (this role is a good vehicle for Julia Ormond) , the chauffeur's daughter , who falls in love for a millionaire (Greg Kinnear in his film debut) , the handsome younger brother in the wealthy mansion where her daddy works . But then , his older brother (Harrison Ford a solid acting by this veteran actor) and their mother (Nancy Marchand) are opposed to this relation. As the older sibling attempts to woo her away for for strictly business issues . Enjoyable romantic tale of a well-known story based on Samuel Taylor play titled ¨Sabrina Fair¨; it is packed with comedy , romance , agreeable situations and overall , emotion . Including some scenes from Paris which are particularly lovely and fun . Interesting and amusing screenplay based on the script written long time ago by Billy Wilder , Ernest Lehman and Samuel Taylor , being rightly adapted with surehand writing by David Rayfield and Barbara Benedek . Main cast is frankly excellent , though Julia Ormond as gorgeous young who has a longlife crush on Greg Kinnear -as a womanizer billionaire- are far from Audrey Hepburn and William Holden respectively . This fine cast works , giving acceptable interpretations , though inferior to original and classic picture (1954) by Billy Wilder and starred by Humphrey Bogart , Audrey Hepburn, , John Williams , Martha Hyer , Francis X Bushman . Support cast is pretty well , and plenty of familiar faces such as John Wood , Richard Crenna , Dana Ivey , Paul Giamatti , Lauren Holly , Fanny Ardant , Patrick Bruel , Elizabeth Franz , John Wood as the old chauffeur of the household where Sabrina falls in love , among others . Colorful as well as glamorous cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno , Federico Fellini,'s regular cameraman . Marvelous and sensitive musical score by the great comp0ser John Williams , Spielberg's usual. This motion picture reboot -acceptable if overlong for a romantic yarn- was professionaly directed by Sidney Pollack , but without originality . Polack (dead at 72) was a classic writer and filmmaker who wrote and directed several successes such as ¨Jeremiah Johnson¨ , ¨Three days of the Condor¨ , ¨Out of Africa¨, ¨The Keep¨, The interpreter¨ , ¨Tootsie¨ , ¨The Firm¨ and many others .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SABRINA, in my opinion, is a sweet, heartwarming, and charming romance with terrific performances. If you ask me, the way that Sabrina (Julia Ormond) and David (Greg Kinnear) met up again after several years was very romantic. It was also really funny when a ménage ? trois began after Linus (Harrison Ford) fell for her, too. As far as I can see, this movie had terrific performances, excellent direction, perfect casting, and nice scenery, especially for a movie set in New York. Oh, yes, the Paris scenery was especially lovely. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, or Greg Kinnear, you should definitely see this movie. Prepare for lots of charm, wit, laughs, and romance when you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Sydney Pollack (a very talented filmmaker) must've have gone into this remake of 1954's "Sabrina" knowing that he could never capture lighting again in the same bottle. Old-fashioned plot about a mousy chauffeur's daughter returning from a Paris trip looking like a million bucks and being wooed by two wealthy brothers was done complete justice by Billy Wilder in '54, directing an incandescent Audrey Hepburn in the title role. Here, Pollack assembles a solid cast but can't manage to update the plot without seeming plastic; all the magic is mechanical and artificial. Julia Ormond has the thankless task of trying to fill La Hepburn's shoes, though Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear are well-cast as the brothers and the romantic sweep of Sabrina's story makes this passable entertainment. It certainly wasn't a well-advised move to redo a classic, but the attempt itself in this cynical age is--at the most--commendable. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit surprised looking at Sabrina's user ratings. I thought it would be around 7, but it wasn't. My vote for this movie was a perfect 10, simply because I can't find any flaws from this movie. Sabrina is definitely my all-time favorite!Well, I know this genre is not for everybody's taste, but this movie is very easy on the eyes, very light, entertaining, funny and most of all: magical. Here's what I love about the movie: 1. The story itself the usual 'ugly duckling' story and it's also a remake, but in this movie they turned that average story into a very lovely one. 2. The casting of everybody in this movie: Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood, and other actors are done very well. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond is just wonderful.3. Their acting is also very good, especially Dana Ivey as Mack, Linus' secretary. Her laugh was a hilarious one :) 4. The music? It compliments the movie. The movie would not be as magical if it wasn't for John Williams' score. His scores are just superb. I can't praise enough about it. If you don't believe me, just hear the soundtrack.5. And last but not least, I just love how Sydney Pollack create those extremely beautiful shots. My favorites are the Paris and Nantucket scenes. They're very very very lovely.Overall, this is a movie that can put you in a very good mood..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first caught Sabrina while waiting in an hotel room to be picked up...I just threw on cable to kill time and was totally surprised to be enjoying the movie. I am not a fan of whimsical romances, but am a fan of Harrison Ford (which is why I chose to watch at all in the first place) and he does a brilliant job with this role and makes it something special. All the acting, indeed, is underplayed with the exception of David (Greg Kinnear) who needed to be overplayed.No, I haven't seen the original, but I doubt I'd like it much because the real charm of the remake was it's comic dialogue and I understand that it is not present in the original. There's just something about hearing Ford say 'I love it [dancing], they call me Bojangles at work' and 'I like Sabrina - I always have - but I'm not going to let her blow a billion dollar business deal...I don't care what she did with her hair...' that I doubt Humphrey Bogart could duplicate, even if he had the lines.I gave this movie a 9/10...it probably would have been 10/10 but there's something in me that refuses to give a 'romantic comedy' a perfect mark...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To paraphrase the film, no-one is as pretty as Audrey Hepburn, even Audrey Hepburn. To me Hepburn's greatest asset was well trained voice and diction. This, Julia Ormond has also. And her performance is very fine indeed. So much for the leading lady issue. This film is finely crafted. The script is clever and never boring, the visuals are attractive and the musical score is outstanding. John Williams shows his versatility here. The orchestral pieces are strong but I am also impressed with the original songs. "How can I remember" is one of the prettiest little songs I have heard in a long time. I hope it has since become a standard. Here is an entertaining film without a bad guy, without violence, without explicit sex and without any bad language. Obviously escapist, yet the message is positive. It is a miracle it did as well as it did at the box office! Harrison Ford helps - his is a pivotal character and performance. A very fine production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No need to compare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care what anyone says; there's no need to compare 1995's SABRINA to the Audrey Hepburn classic. This one, in my opinion, is far superior to the original. By default, film as an art-form has evolved and matured far beyond where it was almost half a century ago. Unless the original was of undebatable achievement in every aspect, from technical to artistic (which the original SABRINA wasn't), the remake will usually be more refined due to the natural evolution of film making technique and sensibility. Side by side, the 1995 SABRINA is more clever in dialogue, plot, and filming. Let's not even get into how the Hepburn version is better simply because it's OLD, or a legendary actress was in it; who's to say 1995's SABRINA won't become a classic and Julia Ormond won't become a legendary actress? (Well, I think all Julia fans would agree that she's ALREADY legendary, from her debut, and throughout every single effort she's made.) On top of that, Harrison and Greg made much more charming and convincing Linus and David than the original cast. another touch that made it better was changing Sabrina's Paris trip to becoming a photographer instead of a cook. It gave her so much more confidence and validated her as an individual who's accomplished in artistic achievement and sensitivity(which matched her sentimental personality far better). It was also a great move to have Linus truly be the head of the family by taking out the father. That way, Linus became even more of a figure to be intimidated by, and the weight on his shoulders seemed that much heavier. The original SABRINA didn't do a very good job at convincing us why Linus should fall in love with Sabrina. The 1995 version did a great job showing us how Sabrina managed to melt Linus's icy exterior by being sensitive, understanding, encouraging, and challenging to him. What can I say? I love 1995's version. If you havn't seen it, please give it a try. You will be delighted.</fullReview>

"Sabrina" doesn't really work if you spend the whole movie wondering why any man would want to bother with such a wet noodle.Of course, the same could be said for the Harrison Ford character as well -- who'd want to waste her time on such a fuddy-duddy when the uber-charming Greg Kinnear is waiting in the background? Though Kinnear's charm oozes out so thickly you can practically see it, he manages to stay just this side of smarmy, making you wish the movie was about him.There's no compelling reason to see this as long as the original is out there available to rent.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't ever remember opining that a remake of any film ever made improved upon the original. The closest I can recall to this unprecedented phenomenon might apply to a sequel as opposed to a remake. (Many thought that Godfather II improved upon the original.)Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Billy Wilder fan and if judgment were to be made by simply comparing his directorial product with that of Sydney Pollack, I'd have to give Wilder the nod. Likewise as effective as Greg Kinnear is in the role of David, he's up against Bill Holden being Bill Holden, seducing the camera as effectively as he did Miss Hepburn in real life.I suppose it's controversial to favorably compare Harrison Ford with Bogie but so be it; Ford wins the Linus Larrabee contest and Lauren Holly gets more out of the small role of Elizabeth Tyson than Martha ever dreamed. She gives more insight into the personality of the bride-to-be with an arched eyebrow than Miss Hyer could have with another 100 words of dialogue.John Williams wins a close photo finish against John Wood in the Tom Fairchild 'Stakes while on the same card Dana Ivey delivers a ten length rout over Ellen Corby as Linus' assistant Miss McCardle (Mack). As I sit here and type I still can't help but smile over her performance as Linus instructs Mack to acquire tickets for whichever Broadway show no one can tickets for: Mack: For Whom?Linus: Me.Linus: I know, I seldom go to the theater.Mack: Seldom?Linus: Okay, I'm not a theater buff!Mack: Buff?Linus: gruntsMack: The most difficult tickets will be for a Broadway musical.Linus: OkayMack: That means that the actors periodically will dance about and burst into song.?and when she refers to rummaging around in Linus' underwear drawer as being "like touching the Shroud of Turin"?Hepburn's performance in the title role is close to flawless as she has ever delivered, and she's delivered more than a few monster efforts so I have to favor her, but I find myself loathe to deny the heat Julia Ormond generates in every scene with Ford.But in the final analysis I'm going to cast my vote for the 1995 version because of a script rewrite/casting decision. Walter Hampden's performance as Oliver Larrabee could very well be unimpeachable, so the 1995 production eliminated his part entirely and built up Nella Walker's part as Maude Larrabee and cast Nancy Marchand in the role. She's absolutely wonderful! As much as Holden was playing an all too familiar role, Marchand may have just re-donned the old shoes she wore for 114 episodes as Margaret Pynchon. No matter, she's right on the money as the matriarch of the Larrabee clan. Her ability to portray a woman who comfortably wear the mantle of power has, in my mind, never been in question. Even when Marchand was losing her final battle with cancer, Livia Soprano the puppeteer was still exercising control over the members of her family. We lost a great character actor when she died. Final score? 1954 ? 8, 1995 ? 10. A wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sabrina - the Harrison Ford version. I'd never given this flick a chance until recently, because of the Bogart/Audrey Hepburn version. The story line is adjusted from 1954 to 1995, but with little respect for the earlier Taylor/Wilder script. Maybe it's a dumbing-down thing. In '54, the characters really didn't understand what was happening to and around them. That's half the fun of the script - figuring these people out, and then wondering when they'll get it themselves. No such thought-provocation in '95. Everyone knows just what they're thinking and doing and saying, and they play it out with the all subtlety of a Louisville Slugger. Nothing to figure out here. Apparently director Sydney Pollack can't trust his audience with that.Still, there are a few laughs. It's not a waste of time unless you've got something better to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of the original "Sabrina" from 1954 and it shows. I haven't seen the original movie yet, but I've got the feeling that, except for changing the cast and giving them some new costumes, they haven't done anything to modernize the movie. Some will say that's a good thing, but in my opinion a movie from the mid nineties shouldn't exactly feel the same as one from the mid fifties. Each time period has a different atmosphere and that should be shown in the movie. Now this looks like a very (yes, maybe even too) naive movie. The Larrabees are a wealthy and prominent Long Island family who have their own driver. The driver has always lived on the estate with his family and while his daughter, Sabrina, was growing up, she spent a lot of her time hidden in a tree, watching the Larrabee family and their garden parties. She knew them all: Maude, the modern matriarch of the family and their company; Linus, the serious older son who has expanded the successful family business into the world's largest communications company and David, the most handsome one of the two brothers who hasn't worked a day in his life, who has had plenty of girlfriends and who is the center of Sabrina's young world. But David doesn't see her as a potential girlfriend and when Sabrina is sent to Paris, he completely forgets about her. Now, after working two years for Vogue magazine in Paris, Sabrina has returned to the Larrabee estate. But she no longer is the insecure teenager she was when she left. She has blossomed into a beautiful and sophisticated woman, making spin the heads of more than one man...As I already said, the story and actually the entire movie is incredibly naive. I don't mind about that when I see it in a fifties movie, but this is a remake. This was shot in the nineties. So much more is possible. I'm certainly not saying she immediately should have started a sexual relationship with David, but the story should have had more than a slight face lift. On the other hand I must also admit that the acting in this movie wasn't bad. Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, Greg Kinnear and Nancy Marchand certainly know how to play their roles convincingly, but it just isn't enough to save the entire movie. That's the main reason why I give this movie a 6.5/10. This is only for the absolute fans of romantic comedies.</fullReview>

She's obsessed with David, almost kills herself over him, and then years later, when she's "over" him, she falls in love with his brother as quick as can be. At least the Audrey Hepburn version had cool clothes and Audrey looked better post-makeover! The pacing in this new one was AWFUL- so slow and boring. Harrison Ford looked ashen and sickly. The fashion was just terrible. I mean, I know every dressed like that in the 90's, but honestly, that dress the mom wore for her birthday party, with the huge bow? Disgusting. Plus, that whole thing with Sabrina "finding herself" in Paris? Obviously, it didn't work too much considering the moment she was with David again she was shy, hesitant, and BORING.

		<fullReview>I was surprised to see so many love this film. As I have not seen the original I will not compare them, nor do I think it is fair to compare remakes to an original. A movie is made to be itself and should be evaluated as is.While they may have tried to modernize the movie it was not modernized enough. It seeps through the screen that it is based on values and images decades ago. Take the architecture of the corporation premises which so clearly is designed to convey the common man of the 50's awe respect for the 'corporate giants' of his days. The architecture is an echo of the 50's not the 90's. An interesting fact is the lack of other employees in the offices apart from the secretary. But of course it can symbolize the loneliness of the corporate all-business shark.So is the glamour girl style of Sabrina, styled over the romantic ideal for a 50's young woman. They put in a 1950's girls personality in a 1990's woman. Sabrina of the 1990's would appear much more modern and critical of the men and their behavior and not such a push-over, a willing vessel for the men's admirations. Also she would have been engaged in education and career not only seen as an object destined for the role of a wife, as was more common in the 50's.Is Ormond doing a good job? Perhaps. If she was trying to follow the director's desire to portrait a 1950 girl. I just find her personality archaeic and out of time and place. The character is simply not believable for its time. Why portrait a classic Hollywood movie star and not a modern woman? (I think they perhaps tried too hard to make her look like Julia Roberts)Also not believable as a corporate shark was Harrison Ford. If the director had pushed him a little more to the nerdy side, it would have worked well with the bow-tie. He did look a little funny with the old fashioned hat, black&amp;white and the mobile phone of it's days with the immense antenna. But as with Sabrina the conversion to 1990's is only half lived. Not totally committed.The best and most believable performance was actually the mother although also she was clearly cut out of the 1950's dominant mother. I came to think of the 30's Groucho Marx's favorite victim, Mrs. Dumont.The pattern goes on with the immense staff of the household, which with today's salaries would be outrageously expensive and eccentric. Even for the 50's it would be a grotesquely big staff even more so for a modern family. I think we would have to go all the way back to the 30's to believe in this household.Also unbelievable is the lightening transformation of a teenage school girl to a dazzling sophisticated self assure young woman overnight who even manages to acquire an exquisit French wardrobe on a meager photographer assistant's wage, which surely would have been meager because so many would want the job. I am not sure she would have been paid all together. "Working for the honor."What remains for me is an uncommitted attempt to remake a(ny) success which seems picked out of coincidence; - the film doesn't show WHY it was remade and modernized. It doesn't claim its own right so to speak. It seems simply like a blind, ill thought through refreshment with no care for details or cinema art. It's neither the 50's nor really the 90's really. Not a pure romance and not really a comedy. One overseen joke in the comments or trivia is the painting behind David in his little used office. It is actually a Pollack painting, the same name of the director. Jason/Sidney Pollack. Well, actually and actually, I simply mean it is in the Jason Pollack style. Don't know if it is an actual reproduction or copycat.I agree with one of the other comments. This film is simply a mess. And an uncommitted one as well. It should have been burned, not released. I was too nice giving it a 6.</fullReview>

But I tried to view it with an open mind, because occasionally I will like a remake even more than the original (I like "You've Got Mail" better than "The Shop Around the Corner," for example).But I think, even had I never seen the original "Sabrina," this version still would not have hung together for me. I thought Ormond and Kinnear were good, but found Harrison Ford (whom I usually like) unconvincing and unattractive in the role. (At his age, I don't think there would have been anything wrong with letting him look his best, even if he WAS a work-obsessed nerd.) What I most missed, however, was the light, magical and very funny quality (and probably writing) that Billy Wilder brought to the original. I felt very sleepy and bored watching this one, and I found the sexual tension that the director and actors tried to create rather forced. But my friend finds the movie very romantic.

		<fullReview>The first Sabrina was a classic and Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn can never EVER be replaced. Harrison Ford does a horrible impression of Humphrey Bogart. He fails miserably with his attempt to sound like Bogart. Whereas Bogart sounded cool, Ford sounds fake and there is no other word for this movie but HORRIBLE! It changes a classic into a stupid chick flick and nothing that was good about the first is kept in this one. I am not a big fan of remakes although there are some that are done well. This is not one. Harrison Ford should stick to action movies and stay far away from Humphrey Bogart impressions. I am sure that there are people on SNL who can do better impressions - and as a joke. It is impossible to take this movie seriously or to even slightly enjoy it. It would be funny to watch Ford's failed impersonations except that they are ruining a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of the movie "Sabrina". I am a fan of Harrison Ford and Greg Kennear. Sidney Pollack is a great director. So what happened? There is a saying "Say nothing if your words cannot improve the silence." That is my sentiment on remakes - especially in the case of this movie. Stick to the original !! How could such an "A list" cast yield such a lemon, I will never know. So much of what made the original movie endearing or humorous was removed for the sake of modernization, and never replaced by anything nearly as engaging or romantic.Nancy Marchand as the family matriarch, while killing off the hailarious father of the original movie was abrasive and garish. Harrison Ford's attempt to be distant and lonely came off as grimacing pain. Maybe he was attempting to imitate Bogart's trademark facial expression, but even Bogie shelved his famous facial tics to play Linus Larrabee. Kennear, who came off hapless and vulnerable in "As Good As it Gets" just seems feckless and pathetic in this role. There is no way anyone could understand why Sabrina has loved this man all her life without once seeing his true faults. There is not enough chemistry between our modern Cinderella and either brother to create a tug of war in Sabrina's heart. If I were she, I would have dumped both the Larrabee duds of this update and run off with Papa's secretly stashed $2 million (another addition of the update).The only thing they updated well was Julia Ormand's startling transformation once she reached Paris, and the ingenious idea of making her a photographer. The point that "love conquers class" was downplayed for modern audiences. But the remaining themes play lukewarm and weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming romance, but not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most critics panned this film because it did not measure up, in their opinions, to the original with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. Frankly, I never believed Bogart in the role of Linus in the original, at least not in his conversion. Bill Holden and Greg Kinnear both have the same kind of personality to make David's character work.Of course, in truth, Harrison Ford was not that believable as the parsimonious scold - his conversion seemed too easy. On the few occasions in his career where he's attempted to play an unsavory person, he's had mixed results. I think Michael Douglas might have been a better choice for Linus - he can be both Gordon Gekko and Andrew Shepherd without raising eyebrows.The saving grace for this film is Sidney Pollack's direction. The story flows well and it's hard not to smile often. Only the jaded and cynical will not feel better at the end for having watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harrison Ford takes on the Humphrey Bogart role in the Sidney Pollack remake of Billy Wilder's 1954 SABRINA. Greg Kinnear plays his younger brother, and Julia Ormond plays Sabrina, the free-spirited daughter of the chauffeur for the massive estate run by Ford and his mommy (Nancy Marchand). Sabrina comes home from a long stay in Paris at an awkward moment for the wealthy family, and it is up to the stuffy, aloof Ford to persuade her to return to Paris. Ford is much too old for his role, although he is very convincing in his portrayal of an obsessed business tycoon. You'd almost think he was appearing in another movie, something involving, say, a murder or kidnaping. Ormond is not nearly appealing as Audrey Hepburn from the original, and in fact she is less appealing than her costar Lauren Holly, who plays a doctor soon to marry Kinnear. So I don't buy that Ford eventually falls for Ormond at all. I also didn't give a hoot about the details of the family business. Kinnear, who is actually pretty funny as Harrison's kid brother, is inexplicably left out of the entire middle of the movie so that it can focus on Ford wooing the confused Sabrina, who thinks she loves Kinnear but then decides she loves Ford. Yuck. Imagine kissing the wrinkly-faced Ford. I would have some fun with Ormond's lackluster performance and undistinguished appearance right about here, but instead let it be said that it simply was a bad idea to remake this film. SABRINA 1995 was not Ormond's fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sabrina - A Wonderful Retelling of a Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julia Ormond is sensational as the young Sabrina Fairchild, daughter of the chauffeur (John Wood) of a wealthy family. Sabrina has been in love with playboy brother (of wealthy family) David (Greg Kinnear) all her life, and is dismayed when her father sends her off to Paris to get a new view of the world. However, years later, when she returns as an older woman, David then realizes how 'right' she is for him, even if he's finally setting a date with one of his two-week lovers. Behind this interaction, older brother and businessman Linus (Harrison Ford), whose pleased about David's engagement, seeing that he's marrying the daughter of wealthy business competitor Mr. Tyson, knows that Sabrina just might end the marriage and the merger. To make things work out, Linus pretends to start being interested in her. This is a delightful tale about love with beautiful music and visual shots that will make you very pleased. The movie is unique enough to be considered a film of individuality, not another version of the same film. Both Sabrina (1954) and Sabrina (1995) are well done, just different. Rating: 4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many critiques on this site suppose that it is somehow superior to the original. I am not sure how this can hold up. While Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear are fine actors in their own right, comparing them to the coupling of Bogart and Holden is ridiculous. Just because a movie is OLD does not make it better, but if it is impeccably filmed and acted superbly, what is the point in redoing it to inferior standards? I suggest that the state of movie-making has in fact declined, as the art form has given way to popular sentiment, over-the-top portrayals of characters, and remakes which attempt to market themselves on previous successful attempts. To say that someone who repainted a Michaelangelo has made it somewhat made it better because painting has "evolved" is equally as stupid as saying any remake improves. And while Audrey Hepburn is not the world's finest actress, she has a unique cinematic quality which cannot be imitated or reproduced, much like her co-stars in this film. Please Hollywood, stop reproducing classics simply because there is a drought of originality and screenplays. Try rereleasing these classics so the public can see movies as they were meant to be viewed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, but not as good as the original.The Larrabees are a wealthy family, living in a palatial estate on Long Island. Oldest brother Linus (played by Harrison Ford) is the formal, dour businessman, running the family company. David (Greg Kinnear) is a playboy. Among the staff living on the estate is the family chauffeur, Fairchild (John Wood), and his shy, awkward, plain daughter, Sabrina (Julia Ormond). Sabrina has had a crush on David for most of her life but he has hardly noticed her. Sabrina goes to study in Paris and comes back, two years later, a changed woman. She's sophisticated and beautiful and soon catches David's eye. However, David is engaged to Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), the daughter of a business mogul whose company Linus wants to merge with that of the Larrabees. If Sabrina wrecks the David-Elizabeth relationship it would likely spell the end of the business merger. Linus sets out to prevent Sabrina from getting in the way but in the process falls for her himself.The original Sabrina was released in 1954 and was pretty good (though not brilliant). Directed by one of the all-time greats, Billy Wilder, and starring Humphrey Bogart as Linus, Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina and William Holden as David, it oozed class and style ( though substance was in shorter supply). Plot was charming though a bit clumsy and not entirely solid. Some elements were too convenient or too contrived. Bogart and Holden were too old for their roles but Audrey Hepburn more than made up for this, capturing the beauty, sweetness, charm and elegance of Sabrina perfectly.This 1995 remake faithfully follows the original plot, while updating the settings, technology etc to 1995. However, the director and writer didn't seem to put much effort into updating the characters, as all they seem like they are 1950s characters in a 1990s movie. There's a stuffiness to it all that is quite irritating. Some contemporisation of the characters was in order.Where this stuffiness is most noticeable is with Julia Ormond as Sabrina. Sure, it would have been impossible to find someone to fill Audrey Hepburn's shoes, but Ormond doesn't even come close. She is beautiful and elegant but lacks Hepburn's charm, sweetness and warmth, coming across as aloof and wooden.Overall, a reasonable romantic-drama, but not a must-see.</fullReview>

Okay, enough about the original. I love the actors in this remake. The chemistry is definitely there. And the love triangle is great. Not your typical love triangle either, by the way.The soundtrack is magical. And they did enough homage to the original version (using even much of Billy Wilder's script) to just perfect the movie. I love the Cinderella elements and Sabrina's time in Paris is perfectly depicted. And for a movie that was filmed 20 years ago, this movie has aged well.

		<fullReview>Sabrina (1995): Dir: Sydney Pollack / Cast: Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear, Lauren Holly, Angie Dickinson: Satisfying yet inferior remake to Billy Wilder's 1954 romantic hit. Julia Ormond stars as Sabrina, perched in a tree to fancy the sight of an engaged man. When she returns from a trip she is transformed into a beautiful woman and catches his attention but he is married to the daughter of an investor whom older brother Linus wishes not to lose. He spirits her away to keep his younger brother from infidelity but finds himself falling for her. Still a lovely story with conviction yet it feels like a remake. Directed by Sidney Pollack who previously made Absence of Malice and Tootsie. Ormond accepts the brave task of filling the role previously mastered by Audrey Hepburn and she pulls through, and Harrison Ford is taking a shot at romantic comedies, on break from his usual action persona. He is a reasonable suggestion for someone to fill shoes once wore by Humphrey Bogart. Greg Kinnear plays his brother with the same glee possessed by William Holden in the original. Lauren Holly plays his wife but after her success with Dumb and Dumber she is unfortunately mere cardboard here. Angie Dickinson is also underused here after her previous success. This is not as good as the original but it is a well crafted and worthy romantic charm. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1995, "Sabrina" stars Julia Ormond as an 'ugly duckling' daughter of a chauffeur for a rich Long Island family. After blossoming in Paris for two years, she returns wherein the handsome playboy of the family finally takes notice (Greg Kinnear), but so does the all-business-minded son (Harrison Ford), which creates havoc. Nancy Marchand, John Wood, Richard Crenna, Angie Dickinson and Lauren Holly have support roles.The first 50-55 minutes are compelling and amusing drama, but when the story takes a surprising turn in the second act it bogs down with slow-moving and uninteresting romancing. Despite this, there's certainly enough good to glean here to make it worthwhile. Romance-lovers will obviously find more to cherish.The film runs 127 minutes and was shot at Salutation House, West Island, Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, and Manhattan, as well as Martha's Vineyard.GRADE: C+ (5.5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sabrina shows the difference between Americans and Europeans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The underlying message of this movie is the message of this movie is the European culture compared to the American culture. It is shown that the American lifestyle has a lack of balance between work and life. Americans are workaholics. Which can affect the well-being of a person. But ultimately will bring us all to the "American Dream". In the movie there is a huge contrast between Linus, the one who is obsessed with work and making more money to the point where work is all he thinks about, and David, who lives his life to get the girls and try out everything never working to pay for it in the first place. Sabrina fell in love with David and his lifestyle, she wanted the popularity and fashion, until she went to Paris and realized the importance of balance between work and play. She tells her father that her favorite thing about him is that he became a chauffeur just so he could have time to read his books. That is something that the American society doesn't understand, it's always work more hours to make more money so you are secure. American's look to the future instead of living in the now, but if you are always looking to the future and not enjoying the now then the future will stay in the future. Europeans work just as hard as anybody, the difference that they have is that they know when to stop working and have fun. Also, the Europeans will do something that they enjoy rather than having a job that they dislike to have security for the future. Sabrina tells Linus that in Europe it's all about pleasure, they work as hard, they just know when to quit and enjoy themselves. This is brings joy to the people of Europe, why people love to visit and never want to leave. Health is very affected by the amount time and energy is put into work. American's long work hours has a huge impact on a person's health. What will give when long hours at work are being added? The more a person tries to work more hours the less sleep, exercise, relaxation, nutrition, and outside social time they will get. People don't think of the consequence if they work through their lunch break, or stay at the office late to finish a project early. Not only is having the separate time away from work good for your physical health and can prevent illness, it is good for your mental, emotional, social, and spiritual health. All fun and no work is hard on a person, it can result in depression and a rut. People will tend to keep themselves in the rut to get to their goal. People are disillusioned when they think that money can bring them happiness. Driving an expensive car, living in an enormous house, and having unlimited material objects are only good for temporary delight. Most people who are blessed with wealth are only blessed for a limited time. Eventually, the money fades. When this happens, they do not know how to handle this seemingly irreplaceable loss. By revolving their lives around making, spending, and/or saving money, they are disheartened without it. The youth of America are taught that success comes from finding a high paying job and wearing uncomfortable, expensive clothing. Young adults are pressured to finish high school and attend a good college to earn a degree. Finding a "respectable" job, rather than working in a field of interest and enjoyment is considered success in today's world. The working world would be dominated by truly happy people if everyone would do work that they love instead of wasting energy for money and riches. Sabrina repeats the notion that working constantly is too much and playing is never going to be enough. In Europe, they understand balance between working and relaxing for their own personal enjoyment. They understand that life is meant to lived right now not in the future.</fullReview>

It was even more dull that it sets up a romance with the daughter of the driver, so the low class. But as the cast is really cool and talented and that the characters aren't self-indulging or despicable and that the director offers a slow, romantic place, well, at the end, it was rather good. For a 90s movie, you have the feeling it's a 60s movie and the Paris depicted there is indeed the eternal (old) city of lights !

		<shortDescription>Harrison Ford has difficulties as romantic lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina Fairchild (Julia Ormond) grew up as the mousy daughter of the chauffeur (John Wood) of the wealthy Larrabee family on the north shore of Long Island. It was a grand estate and she would spy on their grand parties from a tree. Maude Larrabee (Nancy Marchand) inherited the Larrabee Corporation from her dead husband. Cold-hearted Linus Larrabee (Harrison Ford) took the company to even greater heights. David (Greg Kinnear) is the playboy son who Sabrina is completely infatuated with. She goes off to Paris to work on Vogue as a lowly assistant. She slowly moves away from her David infatuation to a love affair with a photographer. Meanwhile David is falling for Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly) whose family business Linus wants to merge with. Elizabeth wants to marry David but he is reluctant to let go of his playboy lifestyle. Sabrina comes home and David doesn't recognize her at first. David becomes infatuated threatening to derail the marriage plans and Linus' big business deal.The movie is asking too much of Julia Ormond. She looks too old to play a teenager. She is also too young to play the love interest for Harrison Ford. Their chemistry is way too cold. That is the biggest missing element. Greg Kinnear actually has better chemistry. They could have worked together in a romance. Harrison Ford is not good in this role. In fact, I have difficulty pointing to any good romantic leading roles for him that actually worked without an action thriller. However, the movie has the solid foundations of the '54 film. That much is there. It has some great scenes. It seems to always work when Julia Ormond gets emotionally walloped. She's possibly the best part of the movie. Ford just doesn't have that extra gear to be the sensitive romantic lead when the movie calls for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I know that usually the remakes of such classic films are destined to be heavily criticized and to be expected with prejudice. But in this particular case, that kind of attitude would be definitely wrong and unfair. The 1995 version of Sabrina by Sidney Pollack is by far better in my opinion. The story is of course the same. A young and inexperienced girl goes to work in Paris and "reinvents" her personality and her style. When she comes back, radically changed, she finally catches the attention and the romantic interest of the man she has been in love with since her teenage years. But his strict and workaholic brother is determined not to let the romance evolve at any cost out of fear that this could destroy his business plans! As far as the characters are concerned, the truth is that there has been a little but important change. For example, Julia Ormond's Sabrina is stronger, more confident, independent and eloquent than the character of the 1954 film. Audrey Hepburn played a naive and more intimidated girl. Greg Kinnear's David in in exactly the same mood as in the original, meaning a good-hearted, charming, but a little superficial and irresponsible playboy. Now, in my opinion, the most interesting character is the older brother, Linus, who in this film is portrayed as having a much darker, cynical and introverted (almost rude) character than in the original. I personally like this change because I think it makes the plot and the hero more interesting (I think the line "the world's only living heart donor" is hilarious and a classic!) At this point, we should absolutely give an honorable mention to Harrison Ford's performance(for which he was nominated for a golden globe that year). He plays the sort of "villain" of the story in a most convincing and elegant way. Contrary to most of his roles, this time Ford adopts harsh facial expressions (almost not smiling at all) and a very severe look. this is why his attempt to soften a little bit in order to approach Sabrina creates- an almost adorable- contradiction. Personally, I think that Ford and Ormond have definitely more chemistry than the original couple of Bogart and Hepburn and that they are way more convincing. Finally, I would like to mention the magnificent music of John Williams and the songs of Sting- all these create a really romantic but still modern fairytale. I highly recommend the movie since it's romantic, funny and quite clever actually. I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, if not better, remake ... faithful to the fairytale aspect of the original "Sabrina" and to our modern (yet no less romantic) sensitivities ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1995 saw the release of a great American romantic comedy in Hollywood tradition, "The American president", but it's Pollack's "Sabrina" that deserves the title because it's based on the 1954' classic, directed by Billy Wilder and starring Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. Yet, there's more in "Sabrina" than a simple remake.There is a natural reflex from every movie buff, which is to prefer any "original" film to its remake. It often has to do with the classic status reached by the first movie, inevitably dismissing any attempt to remake it. But at the risk of sounding like another heretic, I thought Sydney Pollack's remake, if not better, is a solid match to the original acting-wise and more than anything, storytelling-wise.I insist on the storytelling department because it contradicts the idea of the original's greatness relying on its monumental cast, incomparable to the Sidney Pollack, Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear and Julia Osmond's quartet. Yet "Sabrina" approaches the two myths of Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling and ask for us to root for Sabrina, a woman who never attracted men, yet ended up being in the middle of a business scheme, until winning the heart of a businessman. No matter how fairytale, the material is, its convincingness is not to be taken for granted, and no matter how great are the actors, their transformation, their chemistry is still something that depend on the storytelling, more than the acting.And it's extraordinary how Pollack not only remains faithful to the fairytale aspect of the story and to the sensitivities of the 90's in the same time, starting with the heroine herself. Sabrina is supposed to be the Ugly Duckling, she's the chauffeur's daughter who spent most of her time in David's shadow, before finding herself during her trip in Paris. The problem with Audrey Hepburn is that she was incapable of being unattractive no matter how hard she, or the make-up and costume design, tried. Julia Osmond, on the other hand, being that unknown brunette with the same sweet charm as Juliette Binoche, with small glasses and long hair, is convincing as the not-too attractive girl on the surface.And the new script doesn't insult our intelligence by labeling her as a 'dog', she's just a shy, insecure person who had to discover her inner attractiveness before ever trying to seducing. And the Paris' transformation give much more depth and consistence to her evolution, when she comes back, we know Sabrina hasn't turned into a glamorous woman but as a confident one. Paris' effect is really palpable and makes it strangely believable that David wouldn't recognize Sabrina. I'm not saying that these details hurt the original film, but Pollack, probably moved by a humble desire to pay tribute to the 'untouchable' classic, compensated the modest cast through a particular attention to human details, that inevitably highlighted the original's flaws.And the real masterstroke comes with the casting of Harrison Ford as Linus. Ford exudes the perfect mix of seriousness and vulnerability. He easily passes as a grown-up man who spent so much behind the office that someone had to show him the preciousness of life, and how it can't afford to be wasted. And all through his interactions with Sabrina, we keep on wondering if he's aware that he's falling in love, and if it's reciprocal. Both Linus and Sabrina are part of a hypocrisy that betray an endearing defenselessness, and makes them two persons ironically fitting one another. And while Pollack could have kept the movie's track and bring David to make the deal possible, he also develops his seemingly one-dimensional personality.I liked Holden in "Sabrina", and his chemistry with Hepburn was so sincere it really veiled any hint of sentiment toward the elderly Bogart. But Holden's shining moment when he accepts to marry his fiancée almost felt like a deus-ex-machina. How could David finally give Sabrina up so eagerly? Well, Pollack gave me satisfying answers by making David grow up in maturity, by taken into consideration that his character's arc had to be closed by the fact that for the first time, he'll allow his brother to live his life. And strangely, the romantic comedy, also turns into a subtle and positive satire about family relationships in business, allowing Nancy Marchand to shine as the authoritarian, yet compassionate mother.What I admire most in the remake is Pollack's attachment to make the story more believable and endearing by today's standards, he knows he won't reach the same legendary status as the original, but he knows that this very status asks for believability. His characters are extremely well-developed, he gives a spectacular supporting cast to his movies, and the whole film is such a delight to watch, that nothing could have ruined it. The ending was the only hit-or-miss, and while I thought the hug between Hepburn and Bogart was awkward, just a kiss in Paris wouldn't have been enough to ruin the whole efforts.But I wasn't surprised, that Linus would apologize to Sabrina, considering the scene where he broke her heart, a scene whose emotionality clearly surpasses the original. I loved that he asked for her help, because he needed her, and in return open her heart on how much she needs him. That's what I call, a beautiful romance, comedic or not, it was the perfect conclusion for a movie that had so much to prove to be respected, and that even managed to be superior to the original film, and it's one of the rare instances where I'm not hesitant to give it a higher rating.It doesn't diminish the classic status of Billy Wilder's "Sabrina", Julia Osmond is not Audrey Hepburn, and Harrison Ford isn't Bogart, but like I said for the previous film, good ingredient don't necessarily make a good meal, what matters is how the director makes his interactions believable and emotionally appealing. And Pollack brilliantly succeeds in both exercises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good remake, but not the "classic" that the original is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a good film. With fine actors and performances.But, no matter how wonderful he is, Harrison Ford is not Humphrey Bogart. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. And Greg Kinnear is not William Holden.And I think the difference is most easily seen between Bogart and Ford. Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Bogart often wasn't (but every once in a while he was magnificent). But there was something very special and unique about Bogart in the original. Perhaps that it was so against type...making the transformation at the end so much more stunning. But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made).People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him.Another difference, in my view, is what each film "is". This version is a romance movie. The older version was a fairy tale.Harrison Ford is excellent here, and it occurred to me several times while watching the film that it's too bad we didn't see him more often in romantic roles during this career. Julia Ormond was excellent, as well, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen much of her in recent years...but in looking it up I see that she has remained busy, but mostly not in leading roles. Greg Kinnear was one of those actors who kinda snuck up on me; this was his first significant role, and it made me realize that he was much more talented than I would have thought based on my former experiences seeing him on "Talk Soup".Angie Dickinson has a "nothing" role as the mother of "the other woman", and Richard Crenna's role as the father of the "other woman" was probably the least impressive work he has ever done on celluloid; he was really a very talented supporting actor. It was always a treat seeing Nancy Marchand in a film, and no exception to that here. John Wood as Sabrina's father...very good. A real gem of a performance, which may be often overlooked, is that of Dana Ivey, the secretary! I recommend both the original and this remake, although I doubt the remake will end up being the classic that the original was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people get very worked up over remakes of their favorite movies. I won't tell you that I particularly enjoy the experience; I don't. But as I watched this version of Sabrina, after having watched the previous one with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, it occurred to me - my mind was wandering - that remakes of movies, like the originals, are like different performances of a given play. No one, I hope, would argue, after having seen a great production of Hamlet or Macbeth, that those plays should not be done again by others. Of course, one could ask why do them if the new company doesn't have something to justify yet another production of them. But there's no reason to argue against further productions in principle.That's how I feel about this version of Sabrina. There are things that I particularly enjoyed in the previous version that I didn't like here. I was very aggravated that this Sabrina did not learn the lessons of self-confidence in Paris that her predecessor did: those lines are cut out of this script, and when she goes to the Larabee party after her return from Paris, this Sabrina is a bundle of nerves - she has not learned self-confidence.This movie is also more often funny than the previous version. That would be a plus for those who want to laugh more during a movie.So, in the end, for me this was not as enjoyable a performance of the story of Sabrina as the previous one. But that's because the aspects of the story that interest me aren't focused on in this version as they were in the previous one. For someone else who is looking for and enjoys different things, this version might have more to offer.And such a person might give it a higher rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>another enchanting and mesmerizing film. although it's a remake, as almost all remakes aren't that good as the original, i personally loved this version other than the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart version.Julia Ormond portrayed the role Sabrina Fairchild so realistic and in such an elegant way you will be really taken away by her acting. and of course, the dashing Harrison Ford with elegant looks that fit the role Linus Larrabee. and let's not forget the funny portrayal of Greg Kinnear as the younger David Larrabee, the long time crush of young Sabrina.full of enchanting moments under the moonlight and on top of the tree, you will fall for this wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't bad, but I'd recommend the original more highly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sabrina" is a pretty easily likable romantic comedy, a genre of which I am a fan, even though it is hard to find good ones. This is a decent film, but now that I am comparing it to the 1954 original, it is easier for me to be critical. This movie has a good plot, some humor, and decent romance. Also, I am pleased to find movies like this with so little objectionable content, making it appropriate for the whole family, though the younger ones may not be completely interested. I hate to complain about this movie, but there are a few downsides. It runs too long overall, and it slows down too much toward the end. If you ask me, Harrison Ford doesn't really fit his role and seems to old and lifeless for the part he is intending to play. Also, I'm afraid Greg Kinnear simply cannot fill the brilliance of William Holden's shoes in the original. Julia Ormond takes Audrey Hepburn's role fairly well, but none of these three can possibly compare to the excellence of the original cast. The old film really was not outdated and didn't need to be updated, as films like "The Shop Around the Corner" or "The Parent Trap" did. Despite those things, I'm not going to criticize this film any more. It's good for a date film or when you don't want to think too hard but just want to be entertained and happy. I give it a slight recommendation, but I'd suggest the original with more priority.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Remake Of The 1954 Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SABRINA (1995) **** Good remake of the same-titled 1954 film starring Audrey Hepburn. Story of two wealthy brothers creating a romantic entanglement with the homely, timid chauffeur's daughter named Sabrina Fairchild (played by the luminous Julia Ormond). Within the lavish Long Island Estate, Ormond's life constricts of a helpless infatuation with the younger and charming brother (Greg Kinnear, in his second major role in film) whom she has always adored from afar. Upon arriving home from Paris years later, her new stand-out beauty entrances her love hero into romancing her. In the hope of landing a merger businessman brother Harrison Ford tries to turn Ormond's eyes onto him. Though 'Sabrina' isn't an exemplary motion picture, all of the players involved work together well in this poignant and entertaining romance-comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a great Cinderella story with a dose of humor and some pleasant surprises. Harrison Ford was a bit stiff and starchy, but that just provided for a better surprise toward the end. So, fire up the popcorn machine, get something cold to wash it down, and prepare to be dazzled by the lovely Julia Ormond, humored by a rascally, wavering Greg Kinnear, and perplexed by an unhappy, confused Harrison Ford.I first viewed this movie in the big theatre. My wife and I enjoyed it so much we bought it when it was released to VHS. It was our first experience with the plot be it movie or play. We have watched this movie at least thrice at home since purchasing it which should tell you it holds up well upon repeated viewings. We were unaware of the earlier version with Bogart and Hepburn and have only recently seen that one. This version is very well done and I think most people will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing very wrong about with movie except it probably shouldn't be called Sabrina as it would draw unfair comparisons with the 1954 classic. This is a good movie as light-hearted comedy romance should be but I find it somehow takes itself too seriously in trying to make a "good" movie. The leads have a tendency to play their parts almost the same way as their predecessors did in the original movie except for Harrison Ford, who played the role of Linus Larrabee as Harrison Ford would. Julia Ormond is a talented and beautiful actress. It's a good thing she had other roles in which to shine, because Sabrina will always belong Audrey Hepburn. By the way, why did they take out the character of the elder Larrabee who had some of the best scenes in the original. Nice to see Angie Dickinson in this movie looking very beautiful as always.</fullReview>

Now recently I've begun to earn my own money and now it's in the shelf with the other dvds i love.The movie is a simple love story, but it's simplicity and yet still complexity dazzles me. I loved Julia Ormond's quiet character Sabrina and actually kind of fell in love with her final love. I don't want to spoil the movie by giving away anything, I would just like to recommend it to others. It's sweet, romantic and you leave the screen kinda change afterward.

		<fullReview>Hi, I just watched this on BBC1 with 888 on, so as a Dutch person I can also fully read everything thats being said. Ignorant of this being a remake from an original that starred two legends, I did not set out to view it in comparison to the 1954-version. Instead, I just loved the household staff right away, especially her father (the Remains of the Day scene! the Marry me for my money scene!). And of course I recognized Ms Marchand from The Sopranos. But what I wanted to say is this: I just really enjoyed the dialogues, also becaused I expected some kind of comedy, but this turned out to have more depth to it. In fact, I thought the Paris scenes were a bit superficial, except for the last scene, where Miss Ormond explains why "La Vie en Rose" is her song. Who would have thought of Long Island as being profound, after all? Tip of the hat goes to Dana Ivey as the somewhat robotic secretary and mister Kinnear as the archetype of a playboy with a heart. And to be quite frank: I thought mister Ford was the father, and he sure looked too old to be of any interest to a young woman like Sabrina, so for me the end of the movie was a bit of an anticlimax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the hit romantic comedy made in the 1950's starring Audrey Hepburn, "Sabrina" is the kind of movie that would have seemed old-fashioned 70 years ago!! It's not a poor attempt, but it just isn't believable. Had it been set back in the 50's, then maybe. But the attitudes, costumes and general effect seem much to glossy and fairytale like to take seriously.Julia Ormond is good in the Audrey Hepburn role, but Harrison Ford is not a good romantic lead and puts no energy into his part. The chemistry between the two seems forced and un-natural. Overall, this is too sugary, too glossy and too fluffy. Not a complete misfire, but not enough to recommend.

Although Harrison Ford was not young when he played in this movie, still I found him attractive. Julia Ormond, like fairy, white pink with simplicity and elegance, was hard to deny. The most moving part should be the time Linus revealed the "lies" to her, the change in Sabrina from happiness to sorrow. I can even feel her sadness, the loneness. I felt really sad though I could guess out the happy ending. It is kind of movie like you've got mail, my best friends' wedding, which make you laugh but moved. love in this movie was romantic and warm as coffee in the summer afternoon sunlight.</fullReview>

Audrey Hepburn merely strides out of the office, dignity still completely in tact. I do like the ending of this one better though. Ford is handsome, witty, and charming, plus he offers an apology, which never happened in the old one. As far as this movie goes, all I can say is that this statement is a matter of opinion. What I think, may not be what you think, so all I can say is rent it and judge for yourself. I enjoyed it, but you might not. After all one man's trash...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Sabrina of 1954 was always one of my favourites, not least because of the astonishing Audrey Hepburn, I looked forward to the remake with mixed feelings. However, this turned out to be a blessing. Julia Ormond may not be Audrey Hepburn, but she certainly possesses enough class and dignity to make the role of Sabrina worthy. Some of the quiet scenes with Harrison Ford are simply magical and her appearance at the ball just after her return from Paris is equalled in my opinion only by the entrance of Barbara Stanwyck as and in "The Lady Eve" from 1941 - an apparition, simple and pure. Pollack has created an absolutely worthy remake - 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sabrina' was originally, a charming film made by Billy Wilder &amp; crew and starred Hollywood legends Humphrey Bogart, William Holden and Audrey Hepburn. This 'Sabrina' is an updated version directed by Sydney Pollack that stars Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear and Julia Ormond. Considering that this was a movie based on another movie, one cannot comment about this without the shadow of the original. I understand that many viewers have different opinions about both movies and I respect that. My opinion about it, is that both films have their pluses and minuses (for the lack of a better term) and those facts should be realized before attempting to insult either film. This is why I will try to be unbiased when writing about these films (I can only try). I only heard that 'Sabrina' (1995) was a remake after viewing it. I have personal ideas that have had negative effects on my watching/enjoying remakes yet I am reluctant to hate this one so I went out and saw the original. After seeing the 1954 original, my perception of remakes changed. Not to say that this new version surpassed the original nor vice versa but I have a more positive view of remakes now that I have seen both. Since 'Sabrina' is a title role, I must say that both actresses fit into their roles rather nicely and in my attempt to justify both of everyone, will say that favorites depend on a certain individual's perceptions. Both are definitely enjoyable films. My reasons for enjoying the original is first of all the direction of Billy Wilder. He is a great director that is definitely going to be (if not already) known as one of the best of all times. His work on the original is superb. Another reason is that this was made with well known actors and each at a high point in their careers. Even though I liked this version, I must say that the story wasn't that well developed (I understand that the script was being written as it was being shot) and there is where the newer version excels. The 1995 version featured much more developed sequences and additional dialogue that contributes to the solidity of the film and although I don't believe in computer coloring (horrible!), I think that 'Sabrina' looks better in color.These are my personal opinions which I can only hope that others share so that they can enjoy these films as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasons for seeing this remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two fundamental reasons for seeing this version of the film -- reasons that were either omitted or overlooked when the original was created forty years earlier:1. In this remake, one is able to watch Sabrina as she emerges from her shell and finds herself. Julia Ormond pulls this off beautifully, whereas one cannot really imagine Audrey Hepburn in a shell of any sort.2. Upon watching the original Sabrina, I was furious at the way Sabrina forgave Linus on the spot for toying with her emotions. I got much more satisfaction from watching the ending of the remake, wherein Sabrina, standing up for herself as she did not in the original, tells Linus, "I don't know how I can believe you," and Linus is obligated to explain himself -- nay, prostrate himself -- to gain her forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is first of all absolutely romantic so if you don't like romance, please don't watch it. It has great performances (I think better than the first version). Harrison Ford &amp; Julia Ormond are very good but Greg Kinnear is the best, his role as David is the funniest thing I've ever seen specially the part when he is sedated and Sabrina visits him. My favorite part though is when Sabrina meet David in the street and he offers to take her home but he doesn't know who she is, when they get home he invites her to his mother's birthday party and she gets out of the car and Linus was there and he just says: hello Sabrina , how was Paris? you look very grown up. I just love that part because when you finish seen the movie you realize that even when Sabrina was all her life in love with David and that she leaves behind her new life in Paris when she knows he's going to get married because she thinks they are meant to be together more so when he sees this new Sabrina, David is not the one who recognize her. Linus secretary and Maude L. are really funny too. The settings are beautiful. This movie does not have one bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen both and love this version MUCH better. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond is just terrific. Unlike the original where Bogart was like a wet fish with Hepburn. Who couldn't fall in love with Sabrina. Julia does a great job in this role. We watch her transform from an ugly duckling girl into a beautiful graceful woman. She made it totally believable, unlike Audrey Hepburn who you just couldn't make unattractive. Harrison Ford is great in his role as Linus, the "nose to the grind stone" older brother. He is always a dream to watch. He just gets better with age. Unlike Humphrey Bogart in the original, you can SEE that he is falling in love with Sabrina. Also unlike Bogie, Mr. Ford is a lot more attractive and charming. Greg Kinnear, as David the younger playboy brother, steals the film. He is fantastic. As the film goes along, you see that Sabrina has a crush on David. After the her change, David starts going crazy for her. When Linus thinks she is out for the family money, he finds a way to stop his brother. He starts to hang out with her to learn what she's up to and falls in love.This film has a superior cast, lot of beautiful scenery and some great music as well. This was so much better done that the original. My advice is to watch this and forget there even was an original. You won't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming romantic comedy, remake of the old classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess to not having seen the original 1954 version with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden so have no means of comparison. I adore Audrey Hepburn and normally disapprove of remaking a classic, but admit I quite enjoyed this one, if for no other reason than its stars, Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond.This is the story of the tomboyish daughter, Sabrina, of the chauffeur employed by the wealthy Larabee family, who spends much of her teenage years in a tree spying on the Larabee family members and their lavish parties. She has a tremendous crush on the younger Larabee son, David, a handsome, carefree playboy, so to distance his daughter from this crush, her father ships her off to Paris, where she trains as a fashion photographer. Meanwhile, David has become engaged to Elizabeth, a match encouraged by David's ruthless, business oriented older brother, Linus, who is hoping for a business deal with Elizabeth's parents. Then Sabrina returns home from Paris, and David, scarcely recognizing the beautiful sophisticate she has become, falls in love with her. This younger brother becomes injured, so to divert Sabrina's attention and ensure the business deal, Linus starts paying court to her, but hasn't counted on the feelings he's starting to have for her himself...It's been awhile since I've seen this movie, so have forgotten most other cast members, but found the magnetic Harrison Ford perfect as the older brother, Linus, both as the wealthy, serious business tycoon with his big specs, and later, the socially inept romantic lead (Personally, I cannot imagine Humphrey Bogart, as fond as I am of him, playing the role of Linus.) Julia Ormond is absolutely stunning, proving herself a veritable swan that has emerged from her ugly duckling, tomboy, tree perching years. I agree that she is surely one of the most beautiful actresses to grace the modern screen, and have the feeling she's held her own here, living up to the standards set by Audrey Hepburn. As the saying goes, it's a tough act to follow.This is a wonderful comedy romance that, as others have also noted, makes me want to also see the older 1954 original.</fullReview>

The characters are wonderfully well drawn and superbly played. Little details that come out in Harrison Ford's character are so nicely thought out. Watching it a second time and then a third--as the years go by--let you see every last thing his character is thinking. Then there are two stories. The first of Sabrina going to Paris and winning over David. Then Linus keeping her away. Both are full of intrigue and I find that first you fall in love with Sabrina and soon you fall in love with Linus. It's well worth the time to watch it and would make an exceptional date movie. It would make wonderful conversation for afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good as you-know-what</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* Yes, I, a self professed Audrey Hepburn fan, say that this adaption is just as good, if not better than the original. The structure and story of the film is fundamentally the same, but changes are made in just the right places, to modernize the film, give it a Cinderella/real life feel. The results speak for themselves. Some of the best touches are: 1) Sabrina's transformation Sabrina not only becomes grown up and beautiful, (she is genuinely gawky in the beginning) but she has a knowledge of the world and an appreciation of life and beauty that makes her seem wise in her young age. She isn't as tortured as she was in the original (no suicide attempt - I always had to suspend disbelief at that point in the original - she didn't seem that torn up in the first place to kill herself.) 2) Linus Linus is better developed than in the original. Harrison Ford was the best possible choice to come after Bogie (both being action/adventure stars in a rare romantic role.) He is shown to have more than one side - (rather than just cold, then good). Bogie is great, not to be replaced, but Harrison Ford is good, good, good. Linus has different sides, and his feelings come through a little more. 3) Side stories are expounded More so than in the original, side elements like David's relationship with his finacee, Sabrina's relationship with her father, the servants lives, and Sabrina's life in Paris, are really shown more than the original, and this makes us really care about them. 4) A longer ending - we actually see what Linus and Sabrina say to one another after they have both confessed they love each other, something I always wanted Bogie and Hepburn to do. Some things that could have been better: 1) David William Holden was so good as the playboy - so smooth. When he let down that tennis net, any women would have surrendered. Kinnear is attractive enough, and he displays enough of a fly boy attitude that we know what sort of life he leads, but Holden was so convincing that anyone could see why young, innocent Sabrina would fall for him. 2) "Isn't It Romantic" The exclusion of this song wasn't the best decision - the song they use instead is nice, but I just expect to start hearing those lovely strains. All in all, this is a very good movie - one of the things I like best about it is the quietness of it - it doesn't constantly try to bombard us with romantic surprises and such, but it lets the characters get to know one another and lets us get inside their heads. Very good - 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 on a scale of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a perfectly watchable movie. I was generally entertained in a pleasing sort of way for the entire time. I like most romance movies - the more comedy, the better. This movie was less on comedy and more on Cinderella. You know, butler's daughter pines for rich man's (or woman's in this case) son. When shows up dressed to the hilt, predictably, he doesn't even recognize her. Sound familiar?I like all the major characters in the movie, but I have to subtract one point because Harrison Ford was miscast in the role. I just didn't buy him. I thought he performed adequately, but I like him overwhelmingly better in other roles.I also have to take off a point because I never bought the relationship between him and Julia Ormond. The age difference brought back memories of Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, but it was more than that. There was a noticeable lack of chemistry between them, though I have to admit she was very good in her role.The third point I have to take off is because the last 30 minutes had more changes of who was going to end up with whom than 20 drunken sailors in a brothel. The major problem was that at each juncture, we believed that the present scenario was hypothetically possible, but nobody could be turning their affections on and off that often or easily. And, for all of them to do so was actually ridiculous. But, you know...Greg Kinnear and John Wood were also very good. Like I say, if you like these types of movies and you have a couple extra hours, I doubt that you will feel too disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh, a terrible remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't enjoy this movie at all. It was passable, but I still gave it a low rating. Nobody could ever play a roll that Audrey Hepburn originally played as well. I honestly found this version to be very boring. I didn't like the fact that they changed Sabrinas' profession from a cook to a fashion designer. What was the point of that ? She also had a romance in Paris, which never happened in the original. What was the point of that too ? The acting was fine, but the movie is just not that good. I do enjoy Harrison Ford though. A few of my friends prefer the new version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original Billy Wilder version of this movie, so I can't make a comparison, but I didn't go much for this remake. It starts out an enchanting little fantasy, with Sabrina's narration. I was quite engaged for the first 45 minutes or so. Then the movie just drags along. None of the characters seem motivated. Harrison Ford is miscast as a romantic lead. He's good as a wealthy, cold-hearted businessman, but I never sensed the chemistry between him and Julia Ormond. Julia, on the other hand, is very well cast. She lights up the screen with her gorgeous smile. Greg Kinnear is also perfectly cast as Ford's younger brother. This was his first starring role, and it's nice to see his progression from hosting "Talk Soup" to hosting "Later" at 1:35 A.M. to a dashing leading man. Some of the cinematography is wonderful, and this is definitely a great film to look at, but the story is shaky. The film combines elements of farce with corny soap opera romance. And it just doesn't have a natural flow. The dialogue, though witty and enjoyable at first, is stilted and becomes jarring as the film moves along. Maybe the old-time actors can pull it off, but this cast just didn't have its timing right. "Sabrina" is a pleasant romantic comedy that goes on way too long and has that artificial Hollywood feel that may have been pulled off with charm 5 decades ago. This remake lacks that charm. My score: 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

She carried the movie entirely, while Greg Kinnear provided a wonderful foil. However, his about face in the last reel was unbelievable.I cannot see a woman who was treated as the Ormond character was ever forgiving the manipulation that she endured.I did not expect a director of Sidney Pollack's caliber to let the movie slip so badly, as I have high regard for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone give any thought before deciding to make this movie? It almost looks like some kind of obligation was needed to be met.Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear, which are fine actors (although Harrison's role selection needs to be seriously looked at as of late), but they are both just walking through this. The only bright spot is that Julia Ormond looks beautiful. But are we really to believe her character goes to Paris as a mousy, self-conscious, introvert and a short time later comes back as a sophisticated, elegant, confident woman with no progression in this change? I don't think so.This isn't a bad movie, it's just not a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's dangerous to remake anything with Audrey Hepburn because no one can compare to her. This movie is a case in point.Julia Ormond is a good actress but she isn't suited to this role because she has a harder look about her and just doesn't have Audrey's sophisticated delicate sweetness. Few do. These were impossible shoes to fill.Greg Kinnear doesn't have William Holden's devilish charm. That's why he is an excellent supporting actor but not a romantic lead.Harrison Ford is ill at ease in romantic roles. He's reached the Clint Eastwood Robert Redford stage - time to go behind the screen.Don't watch this one just stick to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Gregg Kinnear star in a remake of a 50's movie, originally starring Humphrey Bogart, called Sabrina. I hate to say it but I never saw that movie. But I did see this movie. This is a great movie. It's funny, and definitely romantic. The actors do a fantastic job. Especially Harrison Ford, playing the more likable brother.Harrison ford and Greg Kinnear play two brothers named Linus and David, sons of a tycoon in New York. David is engaged to one of their business partner's daughter(played by Lauren Holly). But he changes his mind when Sabrina(played by Julia Ormond), the daughter of their car driver and an old friend, returns from Paris.When she returns, the two of them plan on meeting up in the solarium. But that leads to an accident involving David. David's brother Linus has always had a crush on her too. So he offers to talk to her after the accident. While David lays injured in bed, Linus starts to hang out with her, and she soon starts to fall for him.Sabrina is a fantastic film. Sydney Pollack did such a great job making this movie. It's a shame he's not alive anymore.Cause he did great films. This was an odd one, and what was he doing in Made of honor? Lord knows. All of the actors do a great job. These are great actors. This is a great film.Sabrina: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing cast, but somehow the movie is just a dud. All of the humor is gone (well, what humor they try to inject is forced and not all funny), and there is just too much TALKING. The characters talk about every little feeling they have, as if the audience couldn't keep up otherwise. It makes this version quite dull.All that said, the lead actors are amazing, despite the awful lines they have to deliver, so it's worth seeing once if you liked the original. Or if you just love Harrison Ford. ;)I must admit that if the script had been better, I think Harrison Ford could have nailed the character of Linus and blown Humphrey Bogart out of the part. There was always something lacking in Bogey's performance in the original; his heart wasn't in it and you could really tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not seeing the original, I can't really say that the old one was better or worse. But, it if it is, the 50's version must be a fine piece of work because this charming adaptation was truly a pleasure to watch. I adored this film about a simple girl in love with the unattainable man who is everything to her. The message in this film is what gets me most and I don't remember the exact words but it was basically saying to be careful with obsessions and that they can be illusions. That's so true. Outside of the movie it seemed to me that Julia Ormond and Greg Kinnear had more chemistry than she and Harrison Ford, but that was just my opinion. I really loved this movie and I agree with the other user comment in saying it is truly a one of the best of the 90's. A real gem amidst many awful movies that came out during the past decade.

		<shortDescription>Sabrina is a charming Cinderella like story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina is a charming Cinderella like story without the wicked step mother, but with a father, the clever chauffeur played by the much loved British actor John Wood (Chocolat, Shadowlands, War Games) I just love John Wood! The story is about two brothers who have really lost common sense. One was too busy being a business tycoon and stepping on everybody in sight to know who he was and to enjoy himself. One must know one's self before he can enjoy who he is. "Linus Larrabee " does not know himself. "Linus" is played by Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Regarding Henry) and is a very masculine looking, brilliant actor that I grew up watching. My husband and I watched him on " Actor's Studio" and he really knows his craft, he explains it so well. The other brother, "David Larrabee ", was too busy living in the state of infatuation to enjoy or even understand true love. "David" is played by cute Greg Kinnear (You've Got Mail, As Good As It Gets) {two movies ranked among my favorites}. I found the movie to have great and very funny lines which I missed when I got the video when it first came out. I was too busy not approving the remake to enjoy the new movie, because I really liked Audrey Hepburn. Now I cannot forget to mentioned the mother, "Maude Larrabee" played by the late Nancy Marchand. I always enjoyed her charming roles, specially in "Lou Grant" I like the music of the film, and "Sabrina " played by Julia Ormond (Smilla's Sense of Snow, First Knight, Legends of the Fall) a very likable character which the only problem I have with is how fast she bloomed. She is a beautiful woman. After I rediscovered the movie, I have watched it three times, and I know it will be among my favorites. Well done Sydney Pollack! He is a great director with a great eyes for beauty!Favorite quotes: Sabrina to Linus: "You are the world's only heart donor!"Linus to Sabrina: "How do you say: I am looking at what I want." Sabrina:" I don't remember." Linus: You convinced me that there were some things missing in my life."Sabrina:" Like what?" Linus" Like a LIFE."Linus" I need her and I don't need anything."Favorite Scenes: Sabrina in the tree branch, Sabrina dressed to kill after a long plane trip from France (I can guarantee that is only in the movies, nobody looks like that after that kind of a trip). Sabrina and Linus biking in Martha's Vineyard.I recommend this movie and it was a special treat to watch it with new eyes. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will go back to reread some of the quality IMDb user comments here. A couple of high level commentators can be viewed---above...Is Mom (1954) or Daughter (1995) "SABRINA" better?While I like Daughter SABRINA a tad better---I love both. There are NO LOSERS in this gentle debate...Both SABRINA versions not only have quality leads---they have great supporting casts. Here, maybe I like 1995 SABRINA a bit more---since the supporting characters are more familiar to me...As I write this, Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee Matriarch) has made yet another one of her dry quips... Angie Dickinson well portrays the emptyheaded once-trophy wife of David's fiancée's equally wealthy family - with Richard Crenna as her husband -And Lauren Holly is the result of the Tyson merger of beauty to brains/wealth - the smart yet beautiful Elisabeth Tyson, MD. - the first sensible female that woman chasing younger brother David has ever fallen for!!!The dialogue in 1995 is silky, gently ironic...and hey...all you would be scriptwriters, movie producers, etc. Study BOTH SABRINAS for how to make quality romantic films. +++++ (NOTE Amazingly, only one (clothed) short pre bedroom scene is in the 1995 version. 99% of this movie succeeds with just great script, production, casting, acting!!! What a novel concept!)Don't waste too much time debating what essentially is personal preference over which wonderful visual desert (Sabrina 1954 or Sabrina 1995) is better....Just see both!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a charming work on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't miss out on this movie because it is a remake of a classic - both the original and this updated version are worth watching, and they should be appreciated independently of each other.This movie is charming and well-acted, and has (obviously) a more modern sensibility and humor to it - though the 10 year gap has dated it somewhat, but I think this only adds to its charm and humor. It is amusingly self-conscious about being a remake, with several small jokes that fans will recognize scattered through the film, and the plot changes that were made for the update were well done, funny, and unpretentious.This movie does not try to replicate a classic so much as translate it into a later time, which only highlights the relevance of the play and the original film. Ford does not try to be Bogart, and Ormond does not try to be Hepburn- very much to their credit. It is a very fresh take, sweet, fun, and definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion, an okay romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before anything else, let me tell say that I don't know the original version from 1954 with Humphrey Bogart. That's why I will not compare them. Instead, I'll just share my opinion about this one to the world.As a movie, this mixes modern elements with nostalgic elements which creates a modern-retro romantic atmosphere. We have fine parties full of rich and luxurious decorations in a huge château; rich people; romantic music; the finest, most expensive and most sophisticated cars (such as a Bentley and a Ferrari). This film also takes us to Paris, the «city of lights» and one of the most romantic cities in the world.At my point of view, this film has very good moments but also lots of cheesy moments (mostly its humor, which is kinda corny). In general, it is a watchable and okay movie, but to be great it needed to be a little better in some things.About the characters, we have the main one - Sabrina (Julia Ormond) who, after spending 2 years in Paris, is seen in a different way by most people. We have a playboy, David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear) and his much older brother Linus Larrabee (Harrison Ford). Ironically and hilariously, Sabrina describes him according to what she heard from other people: «the world's only living heart donor» - LOL!Basically the story is about Sabrina's long-time crush on David Larrabee, but after an accident with glasses, destiny gives Linus and Sabrina a chance to meet each other better. Linus takes advantage of that. His plan is to seduce her, convince her to come with him to various places, come to Paris with him and leave her there. The plan almost works out, but that's when he realizes that he loves her. In the end, they both end up living in Paris and loving each other.Conclusion: this movie is somehow like a return to the old-fashioned fairy tales and a fine choice for those who still believe in love.</fullReview>

It also features Angie Dickinson, Richard Crenna, Nancy Marchand,Lauren Holly and French actress Fanny Ardant.In the 1995 version, the protagonist, Linus Larrabee, is described by Sabrina (quoting what she has heard from others) as "the world's only living heart donor".

We know shooting remake film is not easy, especially some movie and actor or actress were classic. I think Julia Ormond's performance is good but she can't compare Audrey Hepburn is her look. I didn't mean Julia is ugly, she's quite a good look but her shape of face is not graceful, I mean her face is square face. In the beginning, she was long and straight hair and clumsy, I thought it's her best look because she's looked young. But after she was back from Paris, her fashion style looked like 35 or even 40 years old. I don't know if it must be short and curl hair to show fashion style? It's not fit her face. Does straight hair not show fashion style? Dose the fashion designer couldn't tell what hair style fit for different actresses? Audrey Hepburn had a perfect face shape, even she's 30s, like I saw her Charade, she looked like 20s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Romantic Comedy That Stands On Its Own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, having watched it at least 20 times. I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film.Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen.Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition?It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris.Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee.Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fiancée has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward.All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fiancée for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest.Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fiancée promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived.Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved.Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life.Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness.Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved.In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely charming remake that's thoroughly enjoyable and very well made, with wonderful performances and a really neat ending!. All the characters are awesome, and the story is really good, plus Harrison Ford is simply amazing in this!. I have yet to see the original Sabrina, however I plan to in the near future after enjoying this remake very much!, plus I thought Julia Ormond was absolutely wonderful as Sabrina!. One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when David(Greg Kinnear) sits down on the wine glasses he stuck down there, and it was cool how you can see Linus's character transform in the 2nd half as he falls in love with Sabrina!, plus Ford and Julia Ormond had wonderful chemistry together!. All the characters are extremely likable, and even though it runs a tad long at 127 minutes it's never boring!, plus the supporting cast is very good as well!. As far as remakes go you can't do much better then this in my opinion, and I loved the score as well!, plus Julia Ormond's narration at the beginning was really cool!. This is an absolutely charming remake, that's throughly enjoyable and very well made, with wonderful performances and a really neat ending and I say its a must see!. The Direction is great!. Sydney Pollack does a great! job here with very good camera work, and just keeping the film at an engrossing pace. The Acting is fabulous!. Harrison Ford is amazing as always and is amazing here, he has a grumpy sort of character, but you can see his character progress in the 2nd half, and see the changes in him, he also had wonderful chemistry with Julia Ormond, and was as always fun to watch! (Ford Rules!!!!!!!). Julia Ormond is wonderful here as Sabrina, and while I can't say she is better then Hepburn or not because i haven't seen the original, however i did really like her performance here, she was charming, beautiful,and did a perfect job!, she was great. Greg Kinnear is amusing as David, and managed to get some laughs out of of me, he had a weird sort of charm that I just couldn't help but like. Nancy Marchand is fantastic as Linu's and David's mom, I really liked her. John Wood is great as Sabrina's dad and added class. Richard Crenna does what he has to do well as Elizabeth's dad. Angie Dickinson is also good as Elizabrh's mom. Lauren Holly is hot, but didn't really have much to do, she was OK. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I watch the same movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There may be SOME attempts at romance, but....Did I watch the same movie as everyone else? I thought the movie was extremely boring! The whole plot seemed forced, and a number of times the acting by Ormond and Ford seemed off-key.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest film of the 90`s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sabrina was to me the finest film of the 90`s. The players was extremely charming and enjoyable to watch.Julia Ormond gave an outstanding performance and she looked so beautiful. Every scene with Ormond stands to me as memorable because the way she looked was so perfect that she remains the most perfect woman in movie history. Everything from her hair and clothes to her face and smile was heavenly in every way.Harrison Ford also starred and he was absolutely splendid in a great role that was just perfect for him and he delivered a so memorable performance that i appreciate Ford as one the finest actors around. Greg Kinnear gave also much to the charm and comedy of the film.The soundtrack is outstanding, with many incredible fine tunes and songs that matches the beauty of Julia in a perfect way.From the first moment of the film you can see it`s gonna be a great film. It combines comedy and charm with lies and sadness in such a perfect way that I remember this film as a great and memorable one. All these elements made me pick this one out as the 90`s finest movie and everyone must appreciate what Julia Ormond did in Sabrina in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hi. I'm back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dull, lifeless romantic comedy, very bad - in the most Hollywood sense of the word. Well, not much of a comedy in the hands of Pollack's rather reliably incompetent direction. The script is weak, the characterizations confusing and inconsistent, and the humour scarce and unfunny. Pollack found it easier to make the movie soppy rather than funny because it's much easier that way - and more in line with his limited talent. Ford's miscasting becomes very obvious at the latest when he commences his wooing of Ormond - easily the dullest part of the movie, and a long one, too: zero chemistry. Like in the original, the older brother who gets the girl is about 100 years older; also, the brothers seem to be five generations apart: as Bogart should have been Holden's dad, Ford should've been Kinnear's. Apparently, Ford insisted on Pollack directing this, which says a lot about Ford's movie savviness. (One doesn't need the nose of a cat or dog to sniff out a washed-up director.) In fact, why he would even want to play in this remake is beyond me, but a typical example of Ford's 90s fall. I can't remember the last time he's been in a good movie, and even privately he started losing it: he broke his self-imposed "pledge" not to involve himself in politics and has become just another uninformed Hollywood goody-two-shoes liberal. And the less said about his current partner, Calista Flockhart, the better... She symbolizes beauty, elegance, intelligence - and especially health!!Complaints, anyone...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pathetic version of lovely original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the original movie Sabrina is a charming, romantic, and glamorous comedy, this remake was completely inferior in every way. And yes of course, the original is old, does star three legends and is directed by one-but that has nothing to do with its superiority or my opinion. This film is boring and unsympathetic, but do yourself a favor and rent the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Hollywood: Why in the world would you re-make a film that has already proven to be a classic? What makes you think you can recreate anything better than a film that boasted a script by the great Billy Wilder and a cast of Humphrey Bogart, William Holden and the fabulous Audrey Hepburn? Get real!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not the 1954 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps because I grew up with the Bogart/Hepburn version Ford was a disappointment to me. The little tweaks, twists and other changes (electronics vs plastic, photography vs cooking school, etc etc) did not bother me. But the whole ploddingly dark when is this plot going to hit its stride just dragged on forever. By comparison the original screen play was a lark...the upbeat David (William Holden)played beautifully off of Hepburn and Bogart. You could see Bogart soften and begin to fall and the same for Hepburn...and in Hepburn the troubled teen (as that was what she was supposed to be in the film about18/19)coming into her own throughout the film. It was light, breezy and a pure joy to view....I can not say the same for Fords attempt....the only one who seemed to be enjoying themselves was Ormand!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, highly sarcastic and extremely funny tale about true love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never mind the original, this is one of the few cases in which the remake is far superior in every aspect of movie making! Wonderful photography, nice setting, brilliant star performance, twisty plot, well drawn characters and laced with absolutely unsurpassed, heavy sarcasm (Dialogue between the two brothers: "I'm here for mother's birthday party. What d' you get her? A portable fax machine. You sentimental fool!") and very dry humor ("I really like Sabrina, but I'm not going to kiss a billion dollars goodbye because of her, no matter what she's done to her hair!"). Definitely also one of Harrison Ford's best performances. Highly recommendable - I've added the DVD to my home collection !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have seen this movie a hundred times since its release, and it keeps getting better. As a child it sparked the love of Paris i have today, i even lived there for two years! Granted not with Harrison Ford but what can one do? I even thought this was better than the original (oh the blasphemy!) If you haven't seen it i really suggest you do! Not to be missed! 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was such a sweet movie and it really touched me... and I'm not sure why. It was just so simple and well acted. Someone else made the comment that it made them want to see the original. I agreed... even when I had heard someone say that they were "appalled" that they would remake such a classic and that the new film could not touch Audrey Hepburn!I finally saw the original and it was absolutely dismal! I too love Audrey Hepburn and her performance was fabulous, but the original was just awful. The remake, and REWRITE, was so well done and much more believable! I could not understand why Sabrina fell in love with Linus in the Hepburn-Bogart version... but Ormond-Ford!!!... well, it made sense and was so sweet.I strongly recommend this film!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful and delightful. I think it is as good as the original. The only reason the original could be considered better is because it has Audrey Hepburn. I think Harrison Ford is as good as Bogart in the role of Linus. Julia Ormond is equally wonderful as Sabrina. If you like romantic comedies this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to know the old version to appreciate this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. Then again, I love Harrison Ford and have been intrigued with Julia Ormond since I saw her in the TNT TV movie "Young Catherine" (which is another good movie!). I've already seen the first version of Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn, William Holden, and Humphrey Bogart), but unfortunately I saw the newest first then went back and saw the old one. I wish I hadn't, but it did cause me to appreciate the latest version more. I just found there to be more detail and more wit with Ford, Ormond, and Kinnear. If you don't like the good old romantic movies, then don't watch this. Otherwise, check them both out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Cuteness and Sweetness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw the original film. Although, I enjoyed it, I must say that I prefer this version alot better. It's more lighthearted and romantic. Though Audrey Hepburn is a gem (she's better in "My Fair Lady"), Julia Ormond is the essence of Sabrina. As I agree that Humphrey Bogart is good, Harrison Ford is great as Linus, and Greg Kinnear totally outshined William Holden as David. Another thing about the original is that the father disapproved of his sons associating with the chauffeur's daughter. While in the newer version, there isn't a dad, just a mom, Nancy Marchand, and she is a treasure. Who can forget when she and Mack, Linus' secretary, packed his bags (going thru the "shroud of Turin" of his underwear) for Linus to meet up with Sabrina. Priceless! The 2 films matched similarly in many ways, but as I loved the exchange with Linus and Sabrina's dad (with his "I need her, &amp; I don't need anything" speech) when Linus is trying to catch her, it isn't in the original. Even Lauren Holly played a great supporting character while the original Elizabeth is just basic window dressing. And though, I thought Sabrina &amp; Linus would wind up in the house he had her to photograph, their rendezvous in Paris is lovely. :).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the original, and better for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1995 remake of Sabrina is not the original 1954 movie. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. If you accept these facts, you will probably really enjoy this move. You may even prefer it to the original.Julia Ormond is certainly not as intoxicating as Audrey Hepburn, but I believe her Sabrina is more interesting. We get to see Sabrina evolve rather than having it all happen at once. Even more so with Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart/Harrison Ford). Where Bogart's Linus is suave from the start (surprising for a character who has never had time for women), Ford's Linus is more awkward and therefore more believable.Generally, if you're a real classics fan, you'll probably prefer the original. If, on the other hand, you love romantic comedies from all eras, you may just prefer the remake. I did, and I love Audrey Hepburn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sabrina Fair..." what happened to you? You used to be the radiant Audrey Hepburn, lovely and sweet. Alas, Hollywood has this crazy idea that remakes are a good thing, and you have been transformed beyond belief. And whatever happened to the others? Linus is supposed to be gruff. Ford is too cute to be gruff. That's a problem. Lucky David wasn't twisted unrecognizably, though. Greg Kinnear was good, but, again, he's no William Powell. Bottom Line- an average romantc comedy, but the original is FAR better. No, not because it's old, because it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe people can think this is a good movie. It is not only bad but awful. I do not understand how Pollack could do such a thing. And, sorry Julia, but you are too old to play that part. Moreover, Ormond and the other actors play so bad. Throughout the film, I saw cliches, and a too much sweet story. The original was much better. Besides, the original was a good comedy, but we do not know if Pollack's version is a comedy or not.Please, rent the original to understand that Julia Ormond is not as good as Audrey Hepburn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not fashionable to prefer this remake to the original, it is better in virtually every aspect. The characters and their development throughout the plot is much more believably carried out, with much more depth than the 1954. In particular, Harrison Ford is much better than Humphrey Bogart and Julia Ormond definitely holds her own against Audrey Hepburn. The original is flat where the remake has depth and you can sense the changing attitudes of the characters even as they are themselves discovering their new feelings. I definitely recommend this version of the film.</fullReview>
