		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated movies of the past decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Return To Paradise is one of the best films you've never heard of. It was buried in the summer of 1998 to mostly positive reviews and was later unsuccessfully reinvented 9 months later here in the UK on the back of Psycho which also starred Vaughn and Heche. Its been unfairly treated by the now defunct Polygram as it is a quite incredible little drama with some superb performances and some moments of great power. The premise is relatively simple. Three friends on holiday in Malaysia. Two leave. The police arrive and find hash where they were staying. The third is put in jail. Two years later a lawyer finds the two remaining men in New York and tells them that their friend was found guilty of trafficking. They must go back to share the punishment or he will die in 7 days.Its a frightening dilemma and you can't help but ask yourself the same question. Would you go back? If one goes back they go to prison for 6 years. If both go they will have 3 years each. All of the arguments are put forward, making the answer not seem as clear as originally imagined.The timeframe is made even tenser with titles reminding us of how many days are remaining. Vince Vaughn plays our hero who doesn't always act in the morally correct way we expect him to do. He doesn't immediately decide to go back, making us question if we would either. Vaughn gives the finest performance of his career as the not completely likeable 'Sheriff'. Anne Heche plays the increasingly desperate lawyer who will do anything to save her client from execution. And her desperation is made completely believable by Heche's multi-faceted performance.And then Joaquin Phoenix plays the imprisoned Lewis who has little screen time but whenever he's on he totally captivates. His video message to his two friends is heartbreaking. There are numerous twists which serve to further the emotional capital which is placed in the conclusion.And by the time the suspenseful court scene arrives, you will find yourself nervously hoping for a happy ending. Needless to say the film ends with a succession of unspeakably powerful scenes. Its hard to remember a film which I found as moving as this. It serves as a very poignant anti-drugs message. Its impact will stay with you for days, making it really quite unforgettable. Hunt this down. You will be richly rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradise Found: A Lush, Intelligent Character-Driven Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie appeals on many levels... smartly written, with seductive cinematography, strong editing and acting throughout (with forays into brilliant). And, yes, the romantic sub-plot and un-"Hollywood" style ending DO make sense! Read on ... (NO SPOILERS?)Return to Paradise, a beautifully written, crafted and acted film is one of the few DVDs in my collection that I just keep coming back to.The prologue in Malaysia begins during the credits and is worth the watch in itself. It grabs our interest, and establishes the dynamic between these three young men, who are off for a post-college fling before assuming their "real" lives. The music, hand-held camera effects, and MTV-style editing evoke the carelessness of youth, of a young man's idea of "Paradise".Tony (played by David Conrad) is an opaque, friendly, architect/engineer who is Everyman in his pursuit of honor within the bounds of a satisfying, conventional life. Louis (Joachim Phoenix) ? a gentle soul - whose plan is to stay in Southeast Asia and pursue Animal Rights ... and "Sheriff", played by Vince Vaughn - a tough, straight talking hustler from Brooklyn. It is Sheriff's journey that we stay with as the action moves over to America, then back to 'Paradise'. We discover, along with the characters, what has happened to the friends since their idyll on Penang. When we rejoin Sheriff, it is a few years later. He is driving a limo, and living in a seedy NYC apartment, filled with books. He is on a path that stumbles as he irreverently, but wistfully, reaches for inner growth. We know enough about movies to know that SOMEthing interesting is about to happen to this good-looking guy. By the time the story wraps up, the character of Sheriff will have achieved an impressive depth of self-awareness, subtlety and tenderness that is a credit to the delicacy of Vaughn's acting in this piece. Louis and, in his stead, Beth (Anne Heche), believe that greater things lie inside of Sheriff. In the prologue, Sheriff, brash and careless, teeters when Louis asks him (with confidence in Sheriff's core of selflessness) to join a fight to save the orangutan. Much later, faced with a corresponding request from the compelling and volubly erotic character that Heche creates, Sheriff uses his affair with Beth as a catalyst to reach for the nobility in his soul. Things do not turn out as we (or they) expect. Character relationships reshuffle a bit near the end, but rather than being devices to surprise and tweak our emotions, these twists and turns of the plot help ensure that Sheriff's decisions are (as he tells his friend in a poignant jail cell meeting ) his own. Like Tony, Sheriff ultimately makes his choices, not on behalf of his friends ... but for himself.The best thing about Return to Paradise is that there are no bad guys. A life 'hangs in the balance', but the competing forces are, as in the real world, created by the myriad of individuals all acting out their own interests with no real malice, yet perhaps without the purposeful empathy represented by the Louis character. We are absorbed by the compelling interplay between Beth, Sheriff, Tony, the Malaysian officials and MJ Major (the aggressive reporter played by Jada Pinkett-Smith in an acerbic, pivotal, cameo) all the way through to the final, cathartic, conclusion.Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Brokedown Palace should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Return to Paradise is what Brokedown Palace should have been. Joaquin Phoenix, David Conrad and Vince Vaughn are 3 friends on a 5 week holiday in Penang. Joaquin stays behind and the others come home. Forward 2 years later a young lawyer tracks down the other 2 and they find out that Joaquin's character has been in prison for the past 2 years and they have 8 years to decide whether to take their share of the blame.Joaquin Phoenix is the heart and soul of this movie. His performance is so poignant and real, he has truly come a long way since the 80s.Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche are brilliant in their roles especially Anne Heche, she really took her character to another level and it was sometimes heartbreaking as her performance was so real. This is one movie to check out if you haven't seen it. I did not know about this movie until 2 years ago when I saw it on cable and after just watching Brokedown Palace I was skeptical as it was really bad and I was so surprised when I watched Return to Paradise as it wasn't toned down or glossed over and all the principle actors were fantastic. If you haven't seen it you certainly don't know what you're missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting performances; unexpected twists!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This well acted, intense drama is worth seeing on two counts:1) The excellent performances by Lewis (Phoenix) and Beth (Ann Heche) 2) The uncompromising and original plot.Three young men decide to party in Malaysia, leaving one of them, a Greenpeace activist, behind after two years. He is sentenced to hang for a drug charge; only his two friends who have returned to America can save him. Not a car chase in sight, but the tension is high. The unexpected, emotion-filled ending is both gratifying and sad. I recommend this film with eight (8) stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about moral dilemma ? whether or not to give up three, or maybe six, years of life by accepting imprisonment in a Malaysian jail, or continue living in freedom knowing that a friend has died as a result. This point needs to be made up front ? it is not a film about the rights or wrongs of Asian judicial or penal systems, nor is it a film about the morality of drug taking.So we follow the two characters, Sheriff (Vaughn) and Tony (Conrad) who have to make this decision as they go through the decision-making process, prodded in no uncertain manner by their friend's attorney Beth (Heche). This tortuous process is played out against the comparatively comfortable background of their home city, New York. And not only the comforts of home, but also of employment and marriage prospects.The process is played out a little unevenly although given the nature of the decision perhaps this is not surprising. But where it is flawed is the sudden blossoming of romance between Sheriff and Beth. Prior to this there had been no indication of this turn of events, indeed, quite the opposite as the two had regularly fallen out and appeared to have a mutual dislike for each other. Thus there is a feeling of a contrived piece of plotting which, to make matters worse, goes on to form the basis of the end of the movie.Whether or not this is an accurate portrayal of the Malaysian judicial and penal systems seems an irrelevance. On a rather pedantic point where was the US embassy (and State Department) to provide support? It simply is not the case that in circumstances such as these that the lead characters would have been left on their own. That's not to say that the outcome would have been any different but it may well have affected some of the decisions individuals took towards the end. It might also have been an opportunity to add a little more reality and edge to the story, especially if the officials took an approach that put US foreign relations above the interests of its own citizens!This is a movie that makes us think ? and no movie that does that can be written off. And the acting, especially from Heche and Phoenix, is fine. But the plot flaws mean it's a good, rather than a great, film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep thinking movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie makes you think on several levels. First of all, regardless of your stance on drugs, do you have the right to ingest it where they disallow it? It's fine if you are at home in your country, but when you are in a different country with different laws, then shouldn't you comply with those laws, just as you'd expect a guest in your home to respect your house rules? On a different vein, it also makes you wonder how strong your bonds of friendship with your mates are? Are they strong enough to weather 3 years in prison (and Malaysian prisons are not like what you'd find in an American prison)? Are you willing to waste 3 years of a so far successful life so that a friend does not hang? Another point of concern was the sensitivity of people. Even when told of what her actions might imply to the Malaysian judge and what this means for the prisoner, the reporter refuses and goes on to file a scathing report on the Malaysian justice system, and while she gets the credits, the prisoner gets the punishment. If the death penalty is legal in America where the story's from, then why should the use of capital punishment by another country for crimes it hold responsible for social decay and anarchy be objectionable?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're into teenage jock movies or action-packed explosion movies then look away. This is an intelligent drama that will have your mind working without time for a break. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Lewis goes from superb to breathtaking as the movie progresses. A number of twists and turns along the span of the movie makes it hard if not impossible to predict who will decide to do what next. Without wanting to give too much away, the tragic ending is directed without fault, leaving this a gut-wrenching masterpiece which will probably never get the credit it truly deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why didn't this film get any Oscar nominations??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Return to Paradise' is one of the most underrated films of the last few years. It deserved at least three Oscar nominations. Best actress: Anne Heche, Best supporting actor: Joaquin Phoenix and best original score: Mark Mancina. Was it because this wasn't a big studio film that it was robbed of these nominations? After reading other reviews, other people feel the same way. Even some Golden Globe nods would have been warrented.This film wasn't released at the theaters here in Australia and went straight onto video and I understand it was a flop in the states cause most people were busy paying money to see the regular trash that comes out of Hollywood. This is a shame cause I would have made the effort to see it a couple of times at the cinema.Anne Heche (Psycho) gave such an amazing performance in the film (maybe the performance of her career), my heart was aching at the end for her and the rest of the cast including Vince Vaughn (Psycho), David Conrad (Men of Honor), Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator) and Jada Pinket Smith (Scream 2) who you'll hate once the movie's over as she's pretty good as the bitchy/power hungry journalist are all so convincing in their roles.Everyone should have a pretty good idea of what the plot involves but even if it isn't your cup of tea, the film is worth seeing for the performances which unfortunately have pretty much gone unrecognized. Check it out. Score: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Underrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a Fan of Drama/romantic Movies, but This Movie should have been overloaded with awards! smartly written, strong editing and great acting.Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche are brilliant in their roles especially Anne Heche. I was never a fan of Vince Vaughn, but this was a great performance from Him.Anne Heche took her character to another level. Joaquin Phoenix performance is very realistic.One of the strengths of this film are the things in between. Afterwards, you can ask yourself if Beth is an actual Lawyer. Whether the proposal of three years actually has been and not concocted by Beth. And what were the motives of Sheriff. Yet the morally or in love with Beth. The two story lines are beautifully interwoven in each other with surprising twists here and there.The only down point from this movie is that the director misused Heche by not giving her good camera angles and coverage of her expressive face. 'Return to Paradise' is one of the most underrated films ever. It deserved at least two Oscar nominations. Best actress: Anne Heche, Best supporting actor: Joaquin Phoenix Even if you do not like this kind of movie, the movie is worth seeing for the performances which unfortunately have pretty much gone unrecognized. Check it out. Score: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is a poignant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a poignant tale about moral decisions and the value of a single life - testing the ethic fiber of two men. This movie makes you pause and ask yourself if -you- would make the right decision, if -you- were strong enough to make such a sacrifice. The movie doesn't immediately assume that all people are good and morally sound, would give up themselves for the good of another. It introduces the character Sheriff (captivatingly portrayed by Vince Vaughn), a man who doesn't immediately jump at the chance to save a friend. The movie shows a truer side of man that many would prefer to ignore the callous self-serving side that still exists in all people. Sheriff must overcome himself, his own personal flaws to make a decision to give up years of his own life to save another. The man with his head literally on the chopping block, Lewis, is played by Joaquin Phoenix a brilliant actor who has finally had the chance to show his amazing talent. The film is an intense ride that leaves viewers in tears but enlightened. Not a feel-goof film for the faint of heart but an eye-opening lesson for the morally lost. Possibly my all-time favorite film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant (as usual) in Return to Paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joaquin Phoenix should have been nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Lewis in Return to Paradise. How in the world could a performance of that caliber be ignored? The scene where he was being dragged to hang was so real I could barely stand to watch and felt ill when the movie ended. I highly recommend this film and am amazed that it wasn't a huge hit at the box office. All of his past work deserves a second look. I've also recently discovered "Clay Pigeons" which,too, was excellent. Joaquin is destined to be labeled as one of this generations most brilliant actors -- there is absolutely no doubt about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sheriff and Tony are taking a hedonistic holiday in Penang, Malaysia. Hooking up with friend of the Earth, Lewis McBride they have a wonderful time and bonds are well and truly formed. Come the time for Sheriff and Tony to return to America, they leave Lewis their respective blocks of Hasish as gifts. The name Lewis McBride is forgotten by both men until two years later a lawyer turns up in New York to tell them both some startling news. After the boys left Penang, the police searched their beach house and found the Hashish, the volume of which got him arrested for drug trafficking. A crime punishable by death by Malaysian law. In 8 days time, Lewis, who has been locked up in dreadful Penang prison for two years, will be hung unless both the guys go back to Penang and accept their responsibility for the Hashish. An acceptance that will get each of them 3 years prison themselves.Return To Paradise is a remake of a little known and seen French film from Pierre Jolivet called Force majeure. Throwing up a deep moral quandary and no small amount of surprises, it may just be one of the most undervalued films from the 90s. Starring Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Joaquin Phoenix and Jada Pinkett Smith, Jolivet's story gnaws away at the audience as it forces the issue at hand. Namely what would you do in the same situation? To save a friends life are you prepared to spend three years in a notoriously dank and desperate hell hole? Tho the piece is emotionally loaded in favour of doing what most would deem the right thing, the makers sucker us in, only to then steer us in other directions with a triple hander of a finale. There is also the impact of the press here, something that is crucial to the plot, and it's something that thankfully isn't glossed over. This really is a tightly constructed picture.Vaughn {Sheriff} shows some great dramatic chops, it's refreshing to see him away from frat pack comedy shenanigans. Heche {Beth} looks gorgeous and gives her character real depth, while Phoenix as the imprisoned Lewis is heartbreakingly real. Not faring so well is Pinkett Smith as pesky reporter M.J. Major. Tho only a small part, it's really hard to accept her as a tough reporter who can get things done. Worthy of a mention is the cinematography by Reynaldo Villalobos, the shift in tones he uses between Malaysia to America is very smart and forces the issue of two completely different cultures. This is after all not just about a dilemma, it's also about differing laws on different continents. I found this film to be an emotional roller-coaster that stayed with me for some time after. It's hoped that more people will seek it out and get as much emotion and cranial ponderings from it that I most assuredly did. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superbly-splendid, well-crafted and unimaginably touching story of choice, life and sacrifice.A rare gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review ,as the summary suggests,might seem like just another review from a Hollywood buff who just fell in love with a movie,every minute of which he is cherishing.. but I hope this review convinces you to see this movie as soon as your done reading it because,trust me,you will rate it as one of your finest.Joseph Ruben has delivered an Oscar-worthy film which is brilliantly made making you empathize with the characters portrayed in the film.The story revolves around 3 men lewis(jaoquim phoenix),tony(David conrad) and sheriff(vince vaughn) holidaying in Panang,Malaysia where it's all fun with drinks,drugs and women after which lewis stays back to fight for animal rights when tony and sheriff call it a day and head back to their lives in new york.Two years later beth eastern(anne heche) shows up at their doors telling them that lewis has been imprisoned for possession of hash and is awaiting death by the noose but can be saved from being hanged if both of them share the responsibility of the crime with him and spend 3 yrs each together or 6 years if only one of them chooses to go back..The rest of the story revolves around how beth tries to convince the two to "return to paradise" to serve their time fighting their own personal barriers,tony:convincing his lovely fiancé played by vira farmiga to let him go and sheriff:the reluctance to loose 3 years of his life in a third-world prison,while trying to fend off a story-hungry reporter played by jada pinkett.The movie is not as simple as the plot suggests and has a lot of twists making it a gripping story.All the main cast members portrayed their roles with elegance,vaughn and heche in particular,and brought a certain empathy to the screen which is the key ingredient in such a film.This movie is certainly one of the best films I have seen and definitely one of the greatest.I would,without doubt,go with a 10/10.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most overrated movie on IMDB.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The really high quality performance of Joaquin Phoenix couldn't come close to saving this film.The plot was difficult to believe from it's inception, and went rapidly downhill from there. The basic premise is that three friends buy dealer quantities of hash without a hope of smoking it all before they leave Malaysia. They steal a bicycle from a local rental and when the cops show up to question Lewis apparently they do a complete search of his hovel and find the drugs. As with so many things in this film, the reason for a complete grounds search is unclear.After extinguishing all legal avenue's Lewis' sister (played by Anne Heche) is sent to the U.S. by Lewis to get his friends to come back and serve their time in prison in order to get him off death row.For reasons which aren't well explained the friends don't jump at the chance and catch the next flight out. Instead they play hard to get to Lewis' sister, who is implausibly hiding the fact that she is related to Lewis.Confused yet? There's more.While Lewis' sister is hiding her identity, she and Sheriff have an affair. Despite the fact the he has made it clear he isn't going to go back and save her brother we are to believe that she could become interested in him.While that oddness is going on there is a sub-plot of a reporter who wants to run a story about Lewis. Beth says no because that could get Lewis killed. Apparently the Malaysian government would see the story as a slap in the face. Beth again fails to reveal her identity for unknown reasons, but the reporter agrees to wait until after the government deal is made to run the story.Finally, in the middle of the courtroom proceedings in Malaysia word gets out that the story has been printed. The reason for which is yet another unexplained contrivance. The Malaysian judge then decides to go ahead and execute Lewis, but also keep Sheriff in jail for a spell.After all this, Beth's new found and inexplicable love for the man who didn't want to save her brother is unflagging and there is a gut wrenching, er, heart warming scene at the end where they are reunited.In short, I am astounded at how highly the IMDB community as rated this flick.</fullReview>

I thought Vince Vaughn was amazing, you usually associate him in comedy roles and I was really impressed with how good he was in this. Anne Heche was also terrific but what gets me is how wonderful Jaoquin Phoenix is! Every movie he has been in he has given a memorable performance and now only after Walk the Line is he getting the credit he deserves. He is by far way under rated and I am pleased that everyone is finally taking notice on what a phenomenal actor he truly is. I would recommend this movie if for nothing else the superb acting from everyone of the cast members, you won't regret seeing it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heavy-Handed Film Handled Nicely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Return to Paradise" was a 1998 film that was sadly over-turned that it quickly became a forgotten gem, which was quite sad because it was different from the easy-going junk that's been tossed down from us over the recent years. The story was packed with punch and the acting was equally subliminal. The low box office sales for this movie should not come as quite a shocker because it's one of those sporadic movies that refrain from walking out of the theatre lightly and it is a far cry from influx of escapist movies that Hollywood is noted for.Film, much like art represents the way of life, therefore, films based on more serious content should be out more in the open, even more for those who could handle, heavy complex subject matters with dignity and consideration. Three friends (Vince Vaughn, David Conrad and Joaquin Phoenix)take a sabbatical to Malaysia (which contains boozing, drinking and philandering), two return home to New York, while one is left behind as he faces jail time for drug possession the triad used. Not only that, the incarcerated friend is being sentenced to death for his misdemeanor. Feeling that his life is on the line, there is one loophole that could overturn his death penalty. His other three friends must return to Malaysia and serve their prison time for the crime they are personally responsible for. An attorney (played by Anna Heche)persuades the two friends to get them to return and serve their time, even though that's no easy task as neither want to spend years in jail or let alone let his poor friend get hanged.Quite a very touchy subject! But what makes this movie very effective is the execution in how the film was handled. The direction, the performances, the script and the editing was nurtured in a careful and provocative fashion. But the real standout to this recommended film is the moral dilemma that each character is up against succeeds in keeping it real and yet the situation each one faces will not make you envious of them (and that is a good thing too. Who wants to go through what they are up against?)It succeeds in keeping it firm and concrete and never tries to take the easy way out. At the same time it doesn't overwhelm its viewers with becoming preachy or moralistic. The scruples are already there for you and though this movie is a heavy hitter, the viewers feel the metaphoric concrete weight as much as the characters depicted here.Another standout trait "Return to Paradise" offers is that it focuses on are the numerous culture clashing while avoiding any signs of showing and anachronistic traits (like in "Midnight Express" or "The Deer Hunter" among others). It actually succeeds in balancing the story by remaining judicious in every way possible. Sure we have faced many troubled situations where you are caught in an inescapable trap and you cannot get out of it, the film is not very plot oriented, but more leaning towards a debate faced solely on ethics.The acting is very provocative as each character yearns for our sympathy. Joaquin Phoenix shines very nicely as the misfortunate victim who has the most weight placed on him who is also fading out from the exhaustion that was inflicted on him. Anne Heche is wonderful as the attorney who knows her situation is dire and makes the most of time trying to cope with the complicated situation she's facing in this case. The real scene stealer is Vince Vaughn as "Sheriff" and his change from a careless person to a more responsible person is all very real. The characters are all very real people.By the end of the movie, the humanity materializes before our very eyes as Sheriff goes through great lengths by helping out his fallen buddy Lewis (Phoenix), which would expunge all of his other past mistakes and by his helping out his buddy, we see the moral strength Sheriff has deep inside of him."Return to Paradise" stands the test of time as a brilliant movie in all of its hardships and complexities. As a suggestion if you should see another movie, make it lighter movie so that you won't get sadder through every movie you see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been a fan of Mr. Vaughn's work after seeing "A Cool Dry Place", I was very surprised at how his talent was showcased so well in this movie. It is a thought-provoking movie that is also entertaining. The interaction of the characters is the basis on which the story is built and just what it means to "take responsibility" for one's actions.Another aspect of the film that makes it so worthwhile is that you tend to put yourself in the character's shoes and wonder "what would I do?". And the answer is not an easy one. I own most of Mr. Vaughn's movies but I can watch this movie anytime and still get something new from it. The character played by Mr. Phoenix was also captivating. An ideal and tender individual. The chemistry between Ms. Heche and Mr. Vaughn appears to be realistic and believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, but a bit predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three guys meet and become friends while in Malaysia. Two return home, the other stays behind to do work (rescuing wild animals from extinction). When the stay behind gets arrested on drug charges and given a death sentence, his friends must decide whether to return and share the blame (and save their friend's life) or forget about it and stay put.This film really goes after two themes. One, man's search for his inner character and ethical responsibilities that lead him to confront the concept of self sacrifice. And two, not only is man harming nature (in this case by exploiting the animals that our convicted guy is trying to protect) but is also destroying himself by a misguided legal system based on questionable ethics and morals.There is a common bond between the struggle the two American guys have in deciding whether to return to save their friend and in the difficulty the cruel Malaysian judge has in understanding "western" tolerance towards drug offenses.The sad part is that similar stories have indeed happened for *real* and with *worse* endings. The "best" part of the movie was when the poor guy is dragged kicking and screaming to be hung, it was very real, creepy and scared the s**t out of me.

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the most powerful I have ever seen in terms of presenting the issue of what responsibility each of us has for our actions. It poses the question of whether two young men will return to Malaysia to serve prison terms for the hash purchases they made while on vacation. If they fail to act, the idealistic third member of their group will be executed. The performances by Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, and Joaquin Phoenix are superb.An added dimension is a short scene where the Vince Vaughn character asks his father for guidance on what he should do. Others also provide information and influence in shaping the decision on whether he should go back to Malaysia where jail conditions are so harsh his ability to survive a short term prison sentence is problematic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, fantastic performances and distracting message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always appreciated the performances by the three lead actors in this movie (Vaughn, Phoenix &amp; Heche), and this movie just solidified it. It was incredible to see a very honest portrayal of pure human emotions and reactions. The way Sherriff's character was written was brilliant. You go from hating him for being a jerk, to understanding him to loving and crying for him. Or maybe that was just me being a GIRL, lol. At any rate, there's nothing better than when a writer can truly pull at your emotions through little elaboration. Not to much, not too little, but just as right as baby bear's porridge.One review I read of this movie said that there wasn't enough character development. I thought on this and I must disagree. The only way you can say that is if you need every-sing-word to be spoken to get the point. Which, I snobbily say, more than half of America needs to GET and like a movie these days. These actors displayed a great deal of subtlety and power in their performances and more words and scenes would have turned this compelling drama into a horribly depressing and endless "Beyond Rangoon" cliché, minus the lack of culpability of the two girls in that film. This was a situation that has and can happen to American travelers, which is why it touched this jaded and HUGE movie fan so deeply. Realizing that your "inalienable" rights don't count wherever you go. That you have to accept responsibility for your actions in life, however injust they may seem to you, because they do affect others. The M.J. Majors storyline (we...must...get...the...story...told) was incredibly dubious. It seemed to me that part of the agenda of the theme was to reinforce just how detrimental the media can be when they're more concerned about the, achem, 'public's right to know' than those the story involves. It seemed to make the *reporter* out to be the real villain. It could have been a necessary tidbit to the story as a whole, but it stood out to me to be too much a part of the climactic conflict that wasn't truly needed for the climax itself. I'm going to follow the writer nonetheless.</fullReview>

This is not a jolly film , in fact it is quite depressing but for real film buffs it is a movie that should not be missed .Picture the scene, three young men who are all great friends who are travelling in Malaysia.They eventually go thier own seperate ways.2 years later a young lawyer heads for new york to ask two of the men to do something that will destroy thier lives but will ultimatly save another from the death penalty.This delema makes the movie and asks the question of the viewer " would you go to a Malaysian prison for three years to save the life of a friend that you hadnt seen for two years"?. Some scenes are quite distressing and what happens at the end of the film makes you very angry. Top class stuff. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one's for you, Jeremy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend Jeremy just can't believe that I would dare place this film on a list of the all time greats, so I'll try to explain myself.Return to Paradise is, of course, a concept movie. It takes a question and explores the possible answers. The concept being, would you spend years in prison to save a friends life? My own first personal requirement for such a film is that it must explore the possibilities extensively. What are the different actions the character could take and what are the potential results? What Women Want is another concept film that did a pretty good job of exploring possibilities. And it's a pretty good film. Hollow Man is an example of a concept film that does not do a good job of exploring possibilities, and that's the main reason it's a pretty bad film. Return to Paradise not only asks a perplexing question, but it explores the possibilities. It makes us explore the possibilities. Of course everyone has already said this, but it really does make you think. As much as any film I've ever seen. It's status as a great film is mostly achieved right there.Of course, you can take a concept and explore it thoroughly, and it can fail because of a bad script and/or bad acting. The script for this film is not great, but it is good. Yes, there are some holes, like where is the US Embassy when all this is going on? Some understandably criticize the love story between Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn, and I would too if I didn't buy it. Which I do. Besides, it's a FICTIONAL story. Let's allow a few liberties. The acting is first rate. Every character is thoroughly convincing. Vince Vaughn is actually the worst person in this film. And he's the hero. That's pretty remarkable. Even the theoretical villain, the judge, is painted as a good-hearted man with strong beliefs who is just doing his job. And that's another great thing about this film: nothing is black and white. And nothing should be in a film like this.(Spoilers) So what does the hero ultimately do? Predictably, he does the "right" thing (and that's subjective). But unpredictably, he doesn't save the day. Rather, he can't. His friend dies. That's really sad and realistic. But this film is not about the friend, it's about us. In film, and in real life, I'm kind of weird about getting emotional. Incidents, like death of family members, births of children, whatever, don't make me emotional. It's seeing other people get emotional (for real or acting convincingly) that gets to me. In other words, I wouldn't cry at a funeral until and unless I saw someone close to me crying. Then, I'd lose it. In this film, the death of Joaquin Phoenix's character (hard to believe it's the same guy who was so awful in Gladiator) doesn't get to me. It's the convincing emotion of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn in the last scene that's done so well that gets me worked up. They're not over the top or overdramatic; they just seem real. Again, this film is just a great concept that's thoroughly explored and written and acted very well. Can I say all that about 100 films? Barely. And this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradise has never been so great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, this review contains huge spoilers!Never have I been so disappointed with myself, then after watching this movie and realizing what a travesty it is being it took me so long to watch this movie. (Thanks Mike) You know those movies that you see at the video store, the movies that have dumb looking covers and have stupid descriptions. You know the one's, the movies you think would be wasting your time if you were to watch them. Return to paradise is one of those movies, but never consider it a waste of your time to watch.A good friend of mine told me that this movie is just like Brokedown Palace, and knowing how much I loved that movie, he convinced me to rent it and give it a shot. That was some of the best advise he has given me in a long time. Return to Paradise is a truly original story of two men and their dilemma to return to the scene of a crime to stand trial and save a friends life, or remain free and try to live with the guilt of being responsible for their friend's death.Return to Paradise follows the story of three friends who are on vacation on Malaysia. While one of them (Joaquin Phoenix) decides to stay behind to live there, the other two (Vince Vaughn and David Conrad) go back home to the states and create lives for themselves. While the three are vacationing there, they enjoy the fruits of the country, namely the drugs. Two years later we catch up with Vaughn and Conrad who find out, from Anne Heche, that their friend has spent the last two years in prison due to the drugs they had while there. Heche explains to the two that Phoenix is set to be executed unless they decide to go back to Malaysia and due some time in prison doe their crime. I wont go on anymore about the plot, just believe me when I say that it's truly a one of a kind movie.Beautiful performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Vince Vaughn, and Anne Heche add to this perfectly written story. What a long way Vaughn has come since Clay Pigeons, and The Lost World. Of course this is the second movie (both made in the same year) that Vaughn has teamed up with Anne Heche, the other being Psycho (1998). You know I have never been a real fan of Joaquin Phoenix, I mean he was wonderful in Gladiator, for which he should have won the Academy Award (sorry Benicio), but he was magnificent in this movie. He delivers a performance, albeit a rather small part, almost equal to Brad Pitts' in 12 Monkeys (no really). Anne Heche is great as the sister of Phoenix. Someone who searches out Vaughn and David Conrad, to tell them of what has happened back in Malaysia. At first she tells them she is his attorney, but by the end of them movie, we find out she is indeed his sister trying to save his life.While the movie is not exactly like Brokedown Palace, is has somewhat comparable situations and has a similar theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly powerful film, with excellent acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Return to Paradise was a movie that had a great premise. Three young Americans meet in Malaysia and spend a few months partying with rum, local women, and lots of illegal drugs. When the time comes two of the friends return to New York and one stays to help in an environmental project. Two years later a lawyer comes to the men and tells them that the third one had been arrested the day they left for drug possessions, his drugs and the ones the friends left behind, and will be executed in a week if they don't come back. This is a fascinating premise and one that is very tough to think about. Thankfully the writers took this premise and turned it into one of the best recent screenplays. The two friends at home are played by Vince Vaughn (Psycho, Swingers) and David Conrad (The Last Days of Disco, Snow White: A Tale of Terror). The jailed friend is played by Joaquin Phoenix (To Die For, Clay Pigeons). Anne Heche (Six Days, Seven Nights, Donnie Brasco) plays the lawyer who persistently tries to get these men to give up their lives and go back to Malaysia. If one of them returns it's 6 years in prison for the two men, if both return then it's 3 years for all 3 men. The film shows the anguish these men go through very well and shows that it's a very tough decision to make. Another thing I liked about the movie is the way they didn't really condemn the Malaysian government. When the judge makes a speech later in the movie about how our streets are littered with crimes of different nature, I agreed with him. No matter how good the screenplay is, if the actors did a poor job, the movie wouldn't be good, that is not a problem here. Vince Vaughn is excellent in the lead role, I never doubted anything his character did or said because of his performance. Anne Heche is his equal as the lawyer. David Conrad is very good as the other friend. But the movie belongs to Joaquin Phoenix whenever he's on screen, he gives a wrenching performance in only a few scenes that is hard to forget, as the man who has been broken down by the tough prison. The film's ending surprised me and was very powerful. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was 'my' first Vince Vaughn experience and made me a fan of his. I thoroughly enjoyed the chemistry and non-chemistry between he and Ann Heche; Joachim Phoenix was extremely well cast and did a great job. This was a well-written story which has been a favorite of mine since it's release. The roles are thoroughly believable and well-acted; not overdone. Although I thought the character changeover at the end was a bit improbable, it did not at all change affect my affection for this film. A stellar performance from all involved.This movie is #4 on my A list behind Shawshank, Steele Magnolias, Road to Perdition and ranks high among my 'emos' (emotional flicks) I like to cry to on occasion.

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking moral drama. Phoenix is remarkable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 years ago friends Sheriff (Vaughn) and Tony (Conrad) met tree-hugging hippy, Lewis McBride (Phoenix) in Malaysia. They spent the duration of their holiday hanging out doing the usual- girls, drugs and parties. Sheriff and Tony had to leave their friend behind to head back to New York where reality awaited them. And that, so they thought, was the end of that. Fast forward into the present and Sheriff is approached by Beth Eastern (Heche), Lewis's lawyer. Turns out that when Sheriff and Tony left Malaysia the bungalow they'd been staying in with Lewis was raided by the police and they found 400 grams of hash. In Malaysia, if someone is found with more than 100 grams they are not only jailed for trafficking, but hung. And that is exactly Lewis's fate in 8 days unless Sheriff and Tony return to Malaysia to take responsibility for their share of the drugs and consequently do 3 years each in Penang jail. If only one of them returns, then he has to do both sentences adding up to 6 years. If neither returns, then Lewis would have taken a 2 year rap for them, and will die.Thus is the moral dilemma that will have you asking yourself 'what would i do if i was in the same position?'.Vince Vaughn is a fairly wooden actor. Sometimes it seems he is reading his lines from a cue-card. Anne Heche is fine in the role as persistent lawyer... what really doesn't work is the love affair between her and Vaughn. The added romance seems clumsy in this story, as though it was thrown in as an after-thought in case the major plot-line gets too heavy. But honestly, if worked on a little more, the major moral dilemma would have made a totally adequate film. And if Joaquin Phoenix had been given more screen time, this would have been a fantastic film. Phoenix, as always, is just remarkable. Playing a slightly maddened, mumbling wreck of a character, he delivers and absolutely heart-wrenching performance and is the film's stand-out actor.Honestly, if the moral dilemma of staying and letting a man die, or leaving and throwing your own life away was the only focus in this film, and if Joaquin Phoenix had been given a juicer role with more scenes... well, it would have been a much more worthy film. Cut out the Vaughn/Heche love story, because there is clearly no chemistry between the Vaughn giant and pixie Heche. Give Phoenix a bigger wing-span and you have yourself a fantastic film.Unfortunately the actual end result is lacking in many departments.However, Phoenix is masterful- one of the best actors of my generation. Watch the film for his performance alone, you will be left speechless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, But Not the Real Malaysia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a fairly good movie, exploring a moral choice: would you give up your own comfort to share in the punishment for something you did years earlier, or would you just let a friend take the rap? Unfortunately, however, the movie paints an erroneous picture of Malaysia. The film opens with the friends taking in Malaysia's "cheap drink, loose women and easy access to drugs." Nothing could be further from the truth. Alcohol is extremely expensive in Malaysia, the women are very conservative and buying drugs would be impossible.As a predominately Muslim country, alcohol, sex and drugs are taboo. Malaysians do like to have fun, but without getting too wild - - similar to conservative Christian denominations in the U.S. In fact, the government of Malaysia would not allow the studio to film in the country, because of the morally corrupt image that the story puts forth. Instead, it was filmed in Thailand, as can be seen from the Thai store signs, non-Malaysian cars and the fact that Anne Heche's taxi cab is always driving on the wrong side of the street.Enjoy the story, but do not get the idea that Malaysia is a free-love, drug-happy society. As the judge says, during the trial, "We are strict in our drug laws. As a result, our people enjoy life, are happy and are drug free. In your country (United States), however, there is crime in the streets and many people have their lives ruined by drugs. That's why death by hanging is the penalty for possessing more than minute quantities of drugs." One more thing: In Malaysia, if you are caught with small amounts of drugs, you are not put in jail. Instead, they put you through a well-run treatment program to help you stay drug-free. Large quantities, as is stamped on your visa, is considered trafficking and carries the penalty of death by hanging. In the U.S., with our prisons bursting at the seams from drug convictions, we are still unable to bring our own drug problem under control. Maybe we could learn something from Malaysia!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix saved this movie for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Return to paradise is a film that's greatest merit is Joaquin Phoenix and Anne Heche who plays a woman desperate to save his life. This film from the director of Dreamscape( a sleeper sci-fi horror film from the 80's) is a morality tale that I think is a no brainer for anyone with a conscience. Vince Vaughn plays man who is nothing short of a total jerk. The story starts with three friends hanging out being yankee party animals. Doing drugs exploiting woman, well all but Joaquin's character who just wants to get stoned and save monkeys from extinction. Vaughn and the other dude leave to go back to being typical Americans and leave a bag of hash with Joaquin.Vaughn's character goes back to America and lives worthless life unaware that the hash he left was enough to get Lewis(Phoenix) a death sentence. His only hope is for his two friends to return and do there share of the time in jail. The whole reason the police come to bust Phoenix is because Vaughn was too lazy to walk back a bike they had borrowed and wrecked. The owner of the bike sent the police.So basically Phoenix faces death and his two friends can save his life by doing their time. The story centers around this moral dilemma. The fact that Vince Vaughn's character who caused the whole situation is even unsure to me proves what a asshole he is.This is a early performance for Phoenix to show off that some of the brilliant and natural acting talent his brother River had runs in the family. It is the most powerful aspect of he film for me.********* major Spoilers*********Anne Hece does turns in a powerful performance as well ,but her falling in love with sheriff when she does is plain stupid. To me it seems like an excuse for sex scenes. To have nudity or something. How much more powerful would have been if there love was not expressed until he was already in prison through the gate. The plot holes are bigger than the hash stash in the film.**************************A film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent treatment of an interesting premise gets destroyed by a ridiculous love interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started out very promisingly- the central moral dilemma is interesting, and the acting and directing were quite good. (Although people have been saying that Joaquin Phoenix "steals the movie", and he was very good, keep in mind he's only onscreen for 10-15 minutes or so out of the entire movie.)However, as the flick goes on, it seems to forget where it's going and presents the viewer with what is probably the most ridiculous and unbelievable tossed-in Hollywood romance I've ever seen. (And this has nothing to do with Anne Heche's real-life orientation- her acting is just fine in this.) I was stunned at what this movie expected me to buy. And at the end, the romance completely takes over the story, as though Phoenix's character was a side plot all along. I was nauseated by the last scene in the movie, where Heche's character goes completely off the deep end of credibility.Not to mention Vince Vaughn's character- (is he typecast as "the self-centered jerk" or what? I guess depending on your opinion of Norman Bates. . .) he tries his best, but I found myself asking "why" after practically every line his character spoke. What were his motivations? What causes his journey from who he is at the beginning to who he is at the end of the movie (besides the desire to bang Anne Heche)? That said, the movie probably could have survived the questionable development of this character aside from the relationship which develops with Anne Heche.Usually thrown-in extraneous romances are just distracting. This one actively works to destroy an otherwise good movie. Yes, it's *that bad*. 20 minutes of truly absurd material ruin the other 90.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Return to Paradise (1998): Dir: Joseph Ruben / Cast: Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Joaquin Phoenix, Jada Pinkett, David Conrad: Three friends travel to Malaysia and experiment with drugs. Two of them return to New York while the other remains. Two years later they are given word that their friend was caught with drugs and will be hanged in eight days unless they return and accept responsibility with a three year sentence. Directed by Joseph Ruben who brings conviction to the material as well as request viewers to think. This is a big step for a guy who made the laughable Money Train. Vince Vaughn brings soul seeking desperation. Anne Heche is persistent with a secret of her own. One issue that distracts is the romance that develops between Vaughn and Heche, which is standard and unnecessary. Joaquin Phoenix is convincing as a guy who has suffered too long. David Conrad plays the third guy who will be reluctant to make the return especially when family factors in. Jada Pinkett on the other hand displays the media's greed to the point where she is unlikeable. She plays a journalist out for herself and her action bare consequences to innocent people. This is hardly entertaining but its message is driving and final. Beautiful photography highlights a place of overwhelming beauty where three guys find a private paradise turn into their own private hell. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While far from a perfect film, Return to Paradise does raise some interesting moral questions. That is a good and all too rare thing in current cinema. Two friends must decide wether or not to go back to Malaysia to face a drug rap. If they don't, then a third will hang. If only one friend goes back, they'll both so six years in prison. If both return, then the sentence will be reduced to 3 years each. The dilemma is made all the more poignant by the fact that they were not friends of long standing, but rather met on this vacation they all took at the same time.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie a little while ago for no other reason then the fact that it just happened to be on the TV. However, I watched it, and watched it right to the end.It's about three friends who go to Malaysia where they get high on drugs alot. Two of the friends then return back home while the third friend, Lewis, remains in Malaysia where he is arrested for drug possession. The other two must then make the decision of whether or not to go back and help him.The plot does not sound that interesting but the performances are enough to kep you watching.Vince Vaughn is great as the friend who struggles with his decisions and Anne Heche is great as the sister of Lewis, who tries to pursuade Vaughn to help her brother.The best perfomance comes from Joaquin Phoenix as Lewis. His character has the most changes throughout the movie and Joaquin plays the transitions perfectly. I cried a few times during this movie and each time it was because of Joaquin's character.I would recommed this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic movie!!!!When I rented this movie, I was expecting a good movie. I got a great movie. This film was everything a good movie should be. It was emotionally charged and wonderfully acted.Return to Paradise centers around three friends, Sheriff(Vaughn), Tony(Conrad) and Lewis(Pheonix) who spend a few weeks together in Malaysia. Here, they buy cheap hashish but buy far too much. When Lewis decides to stay and go to Borneo, Sheriff throws the remaining hash into the trash outside the place where the three stayed. Sheriff and Tony return to New York and leave Lewis in Malaysia. Two years later, a lawyer named Beth Eastern(Heche) confronts Sheriff telling him that the day he and Tony left Lewis was arrested for possession and has spent the last two years in a Penang prison. The problem is that because of the enormous amount of hash, the police believed that Lewis was dealing. This means a death sentence. However, if Sheriff and Tony return to Malaysia and state that they also bear the responsibility, Lewis will not be hanged and the two men will have to spend three years in prison, six years if only one returns.This movie is a moral dilemma and it found me asking myself is I would return and spend three years of my life in prison to save another's life. This movie would not have been so powerful if the acting was not superb. And that it was! Fantastic acting. Pheonix was absolutely incredible playing the beaten Lewis and Heche (who I don't normally like) was fantastic. The actor who I was blown away by was actually Vince Vaughn. I had not seen Vaughn in anything but comedies or thrillers in which he played the villain. However, here he plays the hero. He carries this film with a sincerity and emotion. I loved him!!!!!!!!!!

		<fullReview>I caught this late on Channel4 and apart from an obviously mediocre production (it looks marginally better than a TV Movie) I was interested to see just how it would all work out. No real surprises along the way - a very formula driven movie in that it plugs all the right heart strings and very little else.Heche is good, but a pity I kept expecting her to 'squeak' (Ally McBeal has a lot to answer for) but Vince Vaughn and David Conrad both come over as a bit plastic (not helped by their roles) while Joaquin Phoenix treads on that fine line between truly looking haunted and horrifyingly melodramatic.Anyhow, none of the 'problems' hold the story back and even though it's a rather ambivalent ending (almost cheery) you can't help feeling like the Director missed the whole point.It's a 7, not something to watch repeatedly, but easy enough to get into and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Teens' Thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film after some convincing from my aunt when I was 14. It didn't look like anything special, maybe a standard 'Though-Provoking-Movie-Of-The-Week' kind of deal. Then I watched it. I was blown away, the cast in top notch, Vince Vaughn has his sly, reptilian charm down to a hilt, and it works; Anne Heche is wholly believable as New Yorks 'most persistant' lawyer; but it is Joaquin Phoenix (River's younger brother) who steals the movie. Although he takes up only a small time on screen, you feel his cold, and taste his pain. It is the kind of performance only a truly great young actor can achieve. The film does become cliché towards the middle, and lags near the end, but the climax will leave you breathless, and the film will live stick on you, long after the Return To Paradise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go into the plot of this movie but found it extraordinary in that it investigated ideas and the best and worst of human nature.Spoiler -I found this movie affirming in many ways - the ability that we, as human beings have, to change and grow better. We must believe that we have this ability or what's the point? Also, being a devoted sister to younger brothers, the brother-sister bond was truly touching - even more so than the bonds of friendship and romantic love portrayed in the film. Investigation of sibling love is much rarer than friendship or romantic love.Other movies that touch this subject are You Can Depend on Me, and of course Rain Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Film With Excellent Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, though it did not receive outstanding reviews from critics, is beautiful and a must-see for anyone who has ever faced a moral dilemma. I will not bother with a summary of the movie's plotline, except to say that it concerns the choice that two friends must make about whether or not to risk their own lives to save that of a friend. However, this film is not about the decision the men (Vince Vaughn, David Conrad) make, it is about the motivation that leads them to choose a path. While some people consider the introduction of a romantic sub-plot storyline to be futile and silly, it really shows the audience why some people make certain decisions. With Anne Heche's entrance into Vaughn's life, we are made to understand why he does what he does. This film, though it is about love and friendship, is not "sappy" or melodramatic. It is honest and beautiful, and the performances are hauntingly real. Heche is natural and understated, Vaughn is straightforward and truthful, and Joaquin Phoenix is amazing - and downright disturbing - as the friend whose life is at risk. His screen time is limited, but his performance leaves, as his character is meant to, a shocking impact on the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an interesting plot with a real moral dilemna. I changed my mind frequently as to wonder what the two friends would do. I was suspicious about Anne Heche being the lawyer because she took such a personal interest in her client. When she slept with the one, I thought it was very unprofessional. However, she was right about not printing the story until after the trial. The ending had such a twist. Just when you thought that all would be resolved, a judge's decision changed everything. I guess this movie should send a strong message to anyone who chooses to use drugs in a foreign country, especially one with Muslim religion. I felt very sorry for the one imprisoned for getting caught with hash. He acted the part very well as he began losing his mind. This film really held my interest until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie. It manages the hard task to entertain you AND to make you think. I really love that kind of movie. It has an excellent script and just really wonderful performances. All the actors are great, especially the 2 leads Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn. I think they both have a huge career in front of them and are some of the best actors of their generation. Vince did a great job portraying a man who has to make the probably most important decision of his life. Is he man enough to spend 3 years in such a terrible prison to save the life of his friend? Anne Heche is just as excellent as a woman who is desperated to save the life of Joaquin Phoenix who also delivers a great performance. I think Anne Heche is incredibly talented. The performances by David Conrad and Jada Pinkett were also very good. The movie has beautiful scenes of Malaysia in the beginning but it also shows the other side of this "paradise". The scenes are shot very beautiful, also in New York. This is a movie that really makes you think and I can highly recommend it. Don't worry, it won't make you fall asleep just because it's demanding. I rate it a strong 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling take on the classic Prisoner's Dilemma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Return to Paradise" presents the kind of moral dilemma that might be presented in hypothetical form in an ethics class. Would you go to prison in another country for years, in order to save a friend from death, if you weren't being forced to? The problem for the characters in this film, of course, is that the question is not hypothetical, and that makes the answer all the more impossible. The movie opens in Panang, Malaysia, where 3 friends, Sheriff (Vince Vaughn), Tony (David Conrad) and Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) are enjoying a lengthy stay overseas, viewing all their activities through a casual, day to day haze of drugs. "We've got it all here," Sheriff says, describing the warm ocean water as "God's own bathtub." Eventually, months later, Tony and Sheriff decide to head back stateside to pick up where they left off. Lewis, however, remains behind, planning to join an effort to free apes from captivity. Through a series of events, Lewis is arrested for drug possession after police discover him with 100 kilos of hashish that the 3 men had purchased. He is charged with drug trafficking, a capital crime in Malaysia, and is sentenced to death by hanging. After two years in prison his last appeal has just been rejected and he is within a week of his sentence being carried out. The other two men were unaware of this, but Lewis's attorney, Beth (Anne Heche) approaches the men with the news of Lewis's situation. She has forged a deal with the Malaysian authorities: if at least one of the two others will return with her to Malaysia and accept their share of ownership of the hashish, Lewis will not have to die. The prison term for both men returning would be three years. If only one returns, he will have to serve six. Both men react with predictable astonishment and some resentment at being forced to make such a choice. It is Sheriff in particular who has the hardest time with it. At first, Tony is willing to go back if Sheriff does, but the question is whether Sheriff can be compelled to return. He feels, not unreasonably, that their crime was a small one and that this degree of punishment is not warranted.  But Lewis's crime is no greater, and he will die for it if neither of them returns. "I feel guilty even asking you to do this," he says in a videotaped statement. Certainly he doesn't deserve to die. But whether or not either or both of the men can rise to the occasion is something the film explores in depth. The movie doesn't break it into simple issues of morality, but looks deeper than that. What about the health and welfare of the one(s) who chose to return? Can they handle themselves in a Third World prison system? What about Tony's fiance and the fact that she'll have to wait for him, essentially putting her on life on hold as well? Although Vaughn and Conrad play the men with the impossible decision to make, Heche is the one whose performance carries the film. She doggedly appeals to both men's sense of morality, and there is a possibility that she may go too far sometimes in her methods. The film doesn't paint her as a heroine but as a woman willing to do almost anything to save Lewis's life, and perhaps will cross lines even she can't fully appreciate. Eventually, when an attraction develops between her and Sheriff, she is able to stay her course and not back down in the face of love from what she feels very strongly to be right. In the midst of it all, a journalist determined to get the story has it explained to her by Heche why each picture and article extolling the injustices of the Malaysian court system would be "a death warrant", as tilting favor even a little way against the Malaysian standpoint would provoke swift and dangerous action by the government. Is the Malaysian position in this just? We're left to decide that for ourselves. It would be easy to view their laws against drugs as extreme, but as a Malaysian judge points out, their streets are clean, and their youth protected. He fails to understand, he says, why American drug laws are so lenient as to be virtually ineffective in stemming the influx of narcotics. Looking at the face of addiction and the widespread criminal activity inspired by it in the U.S. today, it is hard to argue with him. The ideal solution might lie somewhere in between, but if so, nobody seems to have found it yet. The movie is determined to be evenhanded in its position on all of this, and firmly leaves the audience to decide what is right. This leaves us in suspense about exactly what choices the characters will make, and what the end result will be. Movies like this can be a real treat because of how they force you to think about the issues they present, and in the end, if given the decision that Tony and Sheriff had to make, I can honestly say I would not have an answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all...I loved this film. Let's cut right to what this movie is about...three guys meet while touring Malaysia and begin hanging out with one another, taking in all the sites of the country and partying throughout. This is one of those great films that will take the audience on an emotional and thinking rollercoaster, but then leave them hanging in mid-air (kind of like that one that broke down at Great America last year). These three guys bond while having fun, but two have to get back to their lives in the United States while the third is going off to help out in the country-side and save endangered animals. Due to some childish behavior on their parts, the local police confront one of the guys (after two have already left the country) about his role in one of their childish antics. Unfortunately, the one left behind ends up being arrested for drug possession because one of the guys threw away his left-over drugs in his garbage can. The amount of drugs was significant enough to make the police believe he was dealing, which is a capital offense in Malaysia. After numerous appeals, the guy left behind faces the death penalty, but can have that reduced if the other two return and take responsibility for their roles. This means the other two will serve at leat 3-6 years in a Malaysian prison. Without saying any more, imagine yourself trying to decide...do you leave your life now, go back and end up in prison to "possibly" save the life of someone you met for a brief time or stay where you are and let another human being die as a result of your behavior. The emotions run high in this film and the audience member actually feels confronted by such a scenario by asking themselves, "what would I do". Bottom line...it may not last long in the theaters, but see it on video then...it is a truly great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that asks some tough questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers: What would you do? That is what this movie asks? What would you do if you were faced with the same situation? You and two of your friends are all responsible for crimes ( as rudimentary and silly as they may seem to you ) that were committed in a foreign country. But only one person has stayed behind to face the charges. You are safe at home in your comfy western civilization. Two years passes and you find out that if you don't go back and take your share of the blame, which in this case is three years of a prison sentence, then your friend dies. That is a tough situation to be in. And what makes it so tough is, as Westerners we have our pre-conceived notions of what a third world country's prison is like. We get visions of Rambo-like confinement where torture and brutality is a daily regimen. That may be true and it may be a fallacy but to voluntarily give up three years of your life for a friend's is hard enough in itself, but to go to a place like Malaysia is even harder. You cut off your life, you cut off your loved ones and you are basically ostracized from society when you do so. Will you be the same when you come back, will you be able to function, will you survive the ordeal? There would be a plethora of questions swimming through your mind as you weigh this difficult decision. Since seeing this film, me and a few of my closer friends have had in depth conversations about the movie. And the general opinion is that we could only go back if it was a best friend. And as selfish and nasty as that sounds, I believe it to be an honest assessment. Giving up three years of your life to any prison would be hard, but to go to a third world country is unthinkable.Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche and Joaquin Phoenix give outstanding performances. In order for a film like this to work you have to believe in the characters before you and they do a terrific job of potraying the seemingly selfish lowlife, the lawyer who desperately wants to save her client and the guy who got busted and is now rotting in a prison all alone ( respectively ). I have always been fascinated with Heche's work. She is one of the most natural actors around and every role, every scene that she is in is strengthened by her presence. In this one, she is Beth. She makes us feel the desperation that she feels. When you look into her face and her eyes, you can feel her passion and her fire. She never wants to give up and will fight until the very end to see that her client is free. She is the perfect choice to play this role and I think the academy missed the boat on this one when they forgot to include her in the nominations for best actress. Return to Paradise made me angry. Maybe it is a fictious story but it is one that could be true. From the media interfering where it shouldn't be to the unscrupulous judge that has no mercy, to a failed justice system that has to take action just to prove itself to the mighty Americans, it boils your blood. But it is also an uplifting one and it restores faith in humanity, at least for a few minutes when someone does the right thing, even if it turns out to be a mistake. Return To Paradise is a gut wrenching film and it is a brilliant one at that. The performances are top notch as is the direction and the cinematography. When the film ends you will be yearning for more. It is one of those films that I could have sat through for another hour. It is that gripping. It's too bad this film was passed over in its theatrical realease because it is one that everyone should see at least once. It is a tough subject matter that doesn't end traditionally, but sometimes realism is nice instead of watching Cinderalla in every film. This is not a fairy tale. This is probably the way things would be in real life. And I applaud the film for it's position. Hollywood is nice in the summer time, but this is not a summer movie. It is a film that should make you aske yourself a lot of questions, and sometimes you may not like the answer. After all, you can lie to your friends, but you can never lie to yourself. So again, when this film is through, ask yourself the question again, what would you do. Because no matter how cleverly you sneak up on a mirror, your reflection always looks you straight in the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While sitting around the house today I popped in this video courtesy of the local Blockbuster.The film is "Return to Paradise' starring Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn. The film is about three friends vacationing in Malaysia where the are involved in generally messing around including the indulging in liberal amounts of hashish consumption. On the last day of the vacation one of the three men decides to stay on for a while longer.Two years pass and the three men have limited if any contact between them. Eventually the most hardened of the three men, portrayed by Vaughn, is working as a limo driver and has his car hired by a female lawyer (Heche) who explains to him the fate of the member of their group who stayed behind.On the day the other two left Malaysia the police come to the place where they were staying to inquire about a missing bicycle the three men had rented. Naturally, what they found instead was the stash of narcotics. The law in Malysia says that anyone found with more than a specified amount of drugs in their possession, will be charged with intent to deal. The penalty for dealing is death and now the friend who initially stayed behind is scheduled to be hanged in eight days unless the other two return to Malaysia and own up to their responsibility.What ensues is a very moving and sometimes gut-wrenching examination of what it means to deal with the unforeseen consequences of human misbehavior with courage. The point seems clear: Even when we think we are only doing something only a wee bit wrong, the outcome can be dreadful beyond what we imagine.In a culture that consistently winks at wrong doing the story of "Return to Paradise" seems ominous. If, consequences for wrongdoing are so unpredictable on an individual level, what lies ahead for us on a cultural and national level?I believe the film's story does offer an answer. The only answer to these questions that has ever borne up under scrutiny. That is to simply face the consequences of misdeeds with courage and hope for mercy.I am certain that there are many in a our ruthlessly pragmatic time who would demand to know what good it would do to return to Malaysia to try to save a friend's life, or for that matter, to make any sacrifice for moral principle. In the end, the answer to that objection is not quantifiable, does not run in the easily demarcated lines of whether or not the desired outcome is achieved. The answer is simply that some actions make us into better people and some actions make us worse, that right action forms in us a kind of character that makes life meaningful in spite of circumstance."Return to Paradise" does not gloss over any of these issues. In a time of high budget teenage horror flicks and Titanic sized romantic sentimentality, it is easy to understand how a film like "Return to Paradise" could easily get lost. Its honest examination of the human heart and its depiction of moral triumph make it a welcome contribution to the world of contemporary film.</fullReview>

Not for a second is she believable.Anne Heche does her best and is good despite the silly character. And Joaquin Phoenix is compelling. But the script comes out of some dopey Hollywood cookie-cutter.

		<fullReview>I liked this movie because it was a very quiet, character developing drama. You get the sense from watching it that you are seeing something different for a change. Anne Heche, Vince Vaughn, and Joaquin Phoenix are all excellent and hold the movie together despite some flaws. The film is just as much about the evolving of character and relationships as the social and ethical issues it attempts to raise. I'm sure some people will find it slow especially all the scenes with Beth &amp; Sheriff, but they were quite interesting to me. I felt like I was actually watching two people say what they really meant and express how they really felt instead of actors who have memorized their lines really well.Although the plot twists are somewhat predictable, it is still intriguing to watch the drama unfold. After viewing it I felt it was more a love story than anything else and was thoroughly convinced about the relationship between Beth &amp; Sheriff. I would definitely rate this above overrated, hyped-up, Hollywood fluff movies such as this year's Oscar winner, Shakespeare in Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The paradise in this movie is one in which a man and a woman discover true love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Return to Paradise, but this movie is only secondarily about Lewis or attempts to save him from death in a Malaysian prison. This movie is first and foremost a love story--one which unfolds around the characters of Beth and Sheriff. Lewis is important as his plight serves as a catalyst--it brings Beth and Sheriff together and, over time, forces them to change. The final sequence confirms their achievement: each advances toward the camera, each is dressed in off-white, each looms into a close up. Beth looks up and to her right; Sheriff, walking with understanding and confidence, moves to his left. The cinematography suggests the fusion of their images, their personas, their "marriage." This marriage is supported by the symbolism of the rain and the tenor of the music as the film ends. The drenching rain suggests that vestiges of their former selves are being washed away and the fecundity of their union in the future. The music, a blend of contemplation and triumph, shifts toward the triumphant end of the melodic spectrum as the film comes to a close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A morality play with heart and brain that asks its audience to apply the same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Return to Paradise" is written by Bruce Robinson and Wesley Strick (adapted from `Force Majeure,' a 1989 French film with Alan Bates and Kristin Scott Thomas among others, and about which I know nothing else.) Three guys in their early twenties blow off a few weeks in Malaysia with smokable drugs, girls, booze, and surf. Their holiday comes to an end, and two of them, "Sheriff" (an ironic moniker derived from his surname, Volgecheref) and Tony go back to New York to reenter their lives. The third, Lewis, plans to leave for Borneo the following day to help keep orangutans safe from humans. Lewis is a prince. Not so, "Sheriff", who won't join Lewis in this new adventure because, so he is fond of saying, doesn't have it in him to do something so noble. We just know this attitude will come back to haunt him, and so it does.The remainder of the movie relentlessly puts a question to "Sheriff" and Tony. They are made to confront every manner of moral obligation on the one hand, and rationalization on the other, to save their buddy and their skins. The filmmakers do not digress with the sadistic milieu of a Midnight Express."Return to Paradise", which has the makings of a great play, finds enough work for itself examining an internal struggle that should make even the most calloused jock in the audience sweat.Director Joseph Ruben suspensefully follows the thread of this morality tale while adding layers of meaning and interest. For example, the look of the film reflects the internal struggle shared by `Sheriff' and Tony, contrasting travel poster perfect Malaysia with brief scenes of Lewis's imprisonment, while Pinang's inhospitable street scenes have their counterpart with those of NYC -- bleak, though congested."Sheriff" seems to be treading water on this planet, and Heche's character seems so determined to persuade him to find his humanity before he loses himself altogether, we can't help wondering if there is going to be something other than passionate dialectic between these two. Let me assure you that "Return to Paradise" will take turns guiding and surprising its audience.Anne Heche's nuanced performance as Beth, Lewis' persistent advocate, follows every doubt, rationalization, and pledge of her adversaries like a mirror, reflecting back to them in the sharpest focus imaginable their moral dilemma. We feel Beth's presence at all times, even when she is not on screen, so penetrating is Heche's searching mind and heart. For those who have been complaining about the lack of good roles for women in cinema these days, this one does its part to redress that injustice; and Anne Heche, one of the most interesting actors in film today, serves it very well indeed.Vince Vaughan's performance lets us in at once on the complexities of his character. `Sheriff' avoids intimacy and obligations, but is willing to put himself in physical danger when his buddies are threatened by street thugs. There is a short scene with him and his father which in just a few lines gives us a fairly good idea of how `Sheriff' comes by his inability to make commitments. I felt Vaughn's performance to be more convincing in his off-putting moments than in his attempts at closeness, but perhaps this is as it should be, since intimacy is such a radical concept for his character.David Conrad as Tony and Vera Farmiga as his fiancée are both excellent. Tony's subtle vacillations do not escape Beth's watchful eye; and Farmiga's one serious scene, is very telling about women who have to wait for their men while they do what they must in the name of honor. (Remember how Grace Kelly dealt with Gary Cooper's decision in "High Noon"!) Joaquin Phoenix (brother of River, and inexplicably overlooked for an Oscar nomination in "To Die For") is also very good as Lewis, whose descent into religiosity is as poignant as it is frightening. There is also a subplot, spearheaded by Jada Pinkett as a reporter, which righteously hangs in effigy a self-righteous media."Return to Paradise" is one of this summer's better movies; but keep in mind, it is only a little less grim than "Dead Man Walking"; only its ironic title might suggest otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was completely amazing. The moral dilemma that Tony and Sherriff face is indeed a tough one. I began thinking if i would go back myself,... a question that i do not know the answer too,.. as Vaughns character puts it in the movie (the bar scene where the girl throws the beer on him) you have to be in the situation to really know how you'd react. But it's something to think about. Jaoquin Pheonix was amazing as Lewis. I cried three times throughout the movie. When Sherriff watched the video tape, when sherriff visited lewis' cell, and when Lewis faced his doom. Pheonix was so good in it as he always is. His portrayal of Lewis deserves an Oscar Nod. Vaughn was also very good in it and I am definitely a fan now. Heche was quite good also. I thought that the relationship that developed between Sherriff and Beth was actually played quite well. Anyone (and you know who you are) who makes snide remarks about Heche's sexuality is certainly NOT being objective. She's an actress and her characters are NOT her and do NOT have her personality. Don't be superficial like that. It's obvious and definitely NOT very becoming. The movie was amazing. WOW pretty much sums it up.</fullReview>

To me, it was just as wrenching as "Saving Private Ryan" in spite of the fact, or perhaps *because* of the fact that it's on a smaller human scale. It also has interesting ethical issues that you'll be pondering for days. It's wrenching, unsentimental, and honest, and the prison scenes are almost unwatchable for their brutality. There's not a lot of the usual Hollywood whitewash here other than a not too annoying love story. Good performances all around. Loved it loved it loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Return To Paradise" is a moral drama about two friends forced to choose between serving time in a Malaysian prison or remaining free in America and allowing a third friend, convicted under Malays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Return To Paradise" is not a garden variety drama. It poses a complex dilemma faced by two men, both of whom suddenly find out they have the power to save a life, but only if they agree to put their lives on hold and accept incarceration in a Malaysian prison.In Malaysia, where convicted drug dealers face death by hanging, three men enjoy a holiday of drugs and sex. After two of the three friends go back the United States, the third man--a Greenpeace activist who stayed behind- -is arrested with drugs bought by all three. Because of the quantity of drugs, the man, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is convicted under Malaysia's tough anti-drug dealer law and sentenced to death.Two years later, "Beth," a lawyer played by Anne Heche, appears in New York with bewildering news: if the two friends, played by Vince Vaughn and David Conrad, agree to return to Malaysia and admit their responsibility in the crime, Phoenix's character will not be hanged.The characters of "Sheriff" and "Beth" are expertly portrayed by Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. Vaughn's character must make a credible transformation from a "careless cynic" to a figure of courage, while Heche 's character makes a choice that a lesser actress might not have pulled off. David Conrad is compelling as "Tony," whose position is further complicated by plans to marry. The star of the film, however, is Joaquin Phoenix as the condemned prisoner, "Lewis." Ultimately, it is "Lewis" who seals the picture start to finish. Phoenix's performance brings a startling and poignant clarity to the film's unexpected and intense ending.</fullReview>

Nevertheless, the movie keeps you compelled to know what will happen next so it's never really a bore. The sex scenes are mild and almost unnecessary. Personally, a better, longer sex scene would have been more suitable than the sporadic stuff (bordering on pointless) we find here.

		<fullReview>When seeing this movie I started to wonder how many movies of this type already have been made. I couldn't give you the exact number, but I sure can remember several of them. I sometimes even think there is only one major script for all these movies. All they do is change a line here and there and use some new actors to keep it a bit interesting.This time it's about three young Americans called Lewis, Sheriff and Tony, who have met each other in Malaysia. They stay together the entire summer, dividing their time between women, alcohol and drugs... When the summer is over, Tony and Sheriff go back to New York, but Lewis decides to go to Borneo to help save the orangutan. But before he even got the chance to leave, he is arrested for possession of the drugs that have been left over and he's sentenced to death because he's considered to be trafficking. The only way to save him is when Tony and Sheriff go back to Malaysia to spend three years in jail or six years, when only one of them goes. Lewis lawyer does everything to persuade them, but will it be enough to convince them to give up three years of their lives?As I already said earlier in this review, there seems to be only one major script for this kind of movies. They all look a bit the same and they all seem to try to warn us that drugs are bad and even worse when you are caught with them in some Third-World country where the prisons are awful and death imminent. We all know that already by now, so why should you give this one a try then? Well, it has to be said, it's one of the finer examples of the genre and it never feels like the average TV-movie about this subject. It's a good movie with some good acting and with a story that isn't too predictable. That's why I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always believed Joaquin Phoenix can act, but his peformance in "Return to Paradise" totally blew me away. His Lewis will tear at your heart and squeeze tears out of stone. He wasn't over the top, not in my opinion anyway; he was brilliant, and that doesn't even cut it.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON: To the film itself. It was progressing really well, until that ridiculous romance between Sheriff and Anne Heche's character. How more Hollywood can we get here? In the end, Sheriff's reason for going back seemed to change from saving his friend's life to saving a spot in his love interest's heart for him, hence completely defeating the whole purpose of this movie. And another thing I found disturbing about it is the portrayal of the Malaysian prison and their justice system. I'm not Malaysian, but they're my neighbour, and I don't think a Malaysian judge will hang an innocent man just because some idiotic reporter went back on her words and published an article in the American newspaper critisizing the Malaysian law (or whatever) system.Despite that, this movie will make you think. Vince Vaughn was believable as Sheriff, and Anne Heche commanded for attention as, um, i forgot her character's name. But like I've said before, the real gem is truly Joaquin Phoenix. See it for him, he'll dazzle you and blow your mind away.</fullReview>

This is most clearly revealed when "Tony" learns "Beth" (Anne Heche)'s secret in Malaysia and suddenly loses the ethical uprightness he exhibited earlier in the film. Throw in malevolent Deus Ex Machinas like a nasty (and apparently editorially unrestrained) newspaper writer and Anne Heche's slips of the tongue in Malaysia, and you get all of the movie's necessary plot twists.Furthermore, the romance that emerges between Vaughn and Heche has less electricity than a pet rock, and Heche's character seems more attracted to the newspaper reporter she is supposed to loathe. On the other hand, Joaquin Phoenix gives a stunning performance as the "one left behind" in a third world prison.Overall the movie's characters stumble (and sometimes fall) through a mediocre script presenting a trying ethical dilemma which, in all actuality, is not a dilemma at all since we can see from the first scenes of the movie that Vaughn's character will "go back". Most of the movie is just a tedious exercise in getting him there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful film despite being slower than it should have been and with one major flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sheriff, Lewis and Tony are Americans sharing a long break together in Malaysia, where they are able to relax and enjoy the many vices on offer there. After some time both Sheriff and Tony return to the US leaving Lewis behind. Two years later both men are in their jobs in New York when they are visited by a lawyer, Beth Eastern. She tells them that Lewis was found with drugs, their drugs, and the quantity involved means he will be tried for trafficking and is due to hang in 5 days. However if one or both of the men return and claim responsibility then the charge will be reduced and the jail time shared.Sold on the question `what would you do', this film is actually better than the marketing line made it sound. I am able to answer that question without watching this film. I watched the film as I wanted to see what the characters would do and I wanted to see them dig deep within themselves for the answer. As such the film delivered on the most part ? although I did find the first half to be unnecessarily slow. The though process is good to watch and the addition of the media (for example) helps to widen the story. The romantic addition was unwelcome as it didn't really help the film other than to give it that dimension alone. The conclusion in Malaysia is good and quite moving, although I would have liked more detail and exploration of the consequences. As it was the ending was a little too tidy considering the moral complexities the film had been trying to reach for the most part.The film is helped enormously by a couple of good performances. Vaughn is good here and gives the most complex of the characters ? although I'm not saying this is a good thing as the romantic element didn't totally work for me. More subtle is the work by Conrad, whose character (for reasons I can't say without spoiling) most likely represents the majority of us were we in this situation. Phoenix has a small role in terms of screen time but he delivers an emotional performance and easily did his bit in a short time. Heche is good but is lumbered with this romantic element that never really felt like it fitted in. Pinkett-Smith's character was interesting and it was a shame that the film couldn't follow her strand further at the end ? I wanted to know what happened to her as well.Overall this is not a perfect film as it's plot struggles a little bit when it moves away from the intriguing central question. The conclusion is good but the film's two halves both hinge on a romantic twist that I found to be a little too `dropped in' for my liking and it seemed that it cheapened the film - after all that moral complexity it falls back on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Return to Paradise" is a movie that makes you think about what you would have done if you were in the same situation as Sheriff and Tony. (They have to choose between three to six years in a Malaysian prison or watching a friend hang.) Of course, it's impossible to answer until you have to make that kind of choice, but you will have some interesting discussions with your friends about it, I guarantee you.So, the film... It's a good film; it's interesting, sad, heartrending and upsetting. The acting is mostly brilliant, I'm thinking about the very talented Joaquin Phoenix in particular. "Return to Paradise" is not a masterpiece, some plot developments are totally unnecessary and they really irritated me, sadly that destroyed much of the experience of watching this film. I have to say though, that I did like it very much and even though I do not "highly" recommend it, I do recommend it to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "Return To Paradise" was like watching a pitch meeting gone terribly wrong. I could almost hear the writers unveiling the story before a disinterested studio exec...Writers: "Three guys are on vacation in Malaysia. Two of them go home, the third - some sort of Greenpeace kid sticking around to save the endangered whatever - gets stuck with everyone's hash. One thing leads to another, Greenpeace Guy goes to jail and he's going to be executed for trafficking if the other two don't come back and take responsibility for possession."Studio Exec (Yawn; Beat): "Does it have to be Malaysia?"From there, things get ridiculous. Greenpeace Guy's lawyer (Anne Heche) comes to New York and falls in love with her client's most unlikeable, loathsome, arrogant friend (Vince Vaughn). BUT WAIT....He's not really anyone's friend. He's just some self-serving creep. But that's okay because she's not really anyone's lawyer, she's Greenpeace Guy's SISTER (collective gasp). And she's just using Self-Serving Guy to save her brother, Greenpeace Guy. BUT WAIT...She's not really using anyone. They're really in love. And Self-Serving Guy isn't going back to Malaysia (Did it have to be Malaysia?) to save Greenpeace Guy. He's going back to show Greenpeace Guy's sister how self-serving he really isn't. BUT WAIT...There's another guy. Equal parts success and conscience. Everything Self-Serving Guy isn't. By the end, he becomes everything Self-Serving Guy was, but isn't anymore. We're not really sure how this happens, it just does. But it's not really important, because when it's all said and done, he's only there to make Vince Vaughn's character look good after the movie exhausted all of whatever energy it may have had making him look bad. Still with me? I didn't think so."Return to Paradise" lacks depth, feeling, direction, conviction, characters, story, cinematography, performances and a decent score. If you want to watch unlikeable characters wandering aimlessly through the greatest crisis of their miserable little lives and then stop on a dime and contradict everything we've come to know about them for the sake of a plot twist, you should enjoy this movie.If you'd rather see believable characters that you can actually care about in a similar predicament without a lame love story and a couple of bogus sex scenes, go rent "Midnight Express", directed by Alan Parker, written by Oliver Stone. Unlike "Return to Paradise", "Midnight Express" is based on a true story and made by expert filmmakers. They understood their story, their characters, and the reasons for making that film. "Return to Paradise" serves as the 90's counterpart to its infinitely better predecessor, like "Independence Day" to "The Day The Earth Stood Still", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", and every other film it ripped off and misunderstood. It's just another sad example of the truly God-awful state of moviemaking in this day and age.(Zero Stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was super good, I love movies that challenge you and this was totally thought provoking, forcing you to ask the question, what would I do? of course you like to think you'd do the right thing but when it came right down to it could you give up 3 years of your life for someone you barely know? Someone you spent a few weeks with 2 years ago on vacation? An excellent premise especially if you've ever spent any time backpacking. Following three friends who meet while travelling in Malaysia and spend several weeks partying together, using drugs (hash) in a casual way. Two of the guys return to the States (Vince Vaughn &amp; David Conrad) leaving Joaquin Phoenix behind to continue on with his travels.Two years later, we join Vaughn &amp; Conrad back in the states, everybody has gotten on with their lives. Out of the blue a persistent and determined lawyer turns up (Anne Heche) informing them that Joaquin's character has in fact been imprisoned for the past 2 years after being arrested for the possession of (their) hash. Enough of it to see him executed under Malaysian law (in just 8 days) unless they return and take their share of the blame, which would mean serving 3 years if they both return or 6 each.This story never went where I expected it too, romance, suspense will they-won't they? With fantastic performances form everyone. Vince Vaughn was a big surprise here, he does a great job but Joaquin Phoenix... just blew me away, his final scene will haunt me for a long time. 3/10/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great moral conundrum and message, but too contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Return to Paradise" (1998) is about three Americans in Malaysia. Two of them are friends from New York City (Vincent Vaughn and David Conrad) and the other they meet there, an environmental-hippie type (Joaquin Phoenix). The three have a great time partying together and then the two from New York go back to the grind in the USA. Two years later they find out that their friend in Malaysia has been in prison for having too much hashish, which the three purchased together. Due to the country's severe drug laws, those considered traffickers are put to death and, unfortunately, the hippie possessed beyond the limit. He'll hang in eight days unless the other two go back and they'll all get 3 years in prison; if only one goes back it's 6 years each. Will they go back? That's the set-up of the film and it's not a spoiler since this all unfolds in the first 20 minutes, which means that most of the rest of the movie takes place in New York and focuses on whether or not the other two will go back and save their friend. Keep in mind that this was a dude they met in Malaysia so it's not like they were bosom buddies from their youth or anything.The trailer of "Return to Paradise" miss-advertised the film as a thriller largely taking place in exotic SE Asia, but that's not the case. This is a drama that involves a moral conundrum, a Christ figure and possible redemption. The story concentrates on Vaughn and Anne Heche, the latter as the lawyer of the hippie who tries to convince the other two to go back to save their friend. Complicating the situation even further is the fact that there are no legal documents involved since Malaysia is a third world country and, as such, there's no guarantee that the two will "only" get three years. And what about the other potential negative possibilities, like never making it out of the hellhole alive? This is a top of the line film and the producers went all-out to serve up a quality picture; for instance, the Malaysian prison scenes are very convincing. Also, the actors are great across the board and Vaughn proves that he can nail a dramatic role. Moreover the moral is to die for, no pun intended. Unfortunately the actors are strapped to the contrivances of the plot and I had a hard time seeing them as real people in a real situation. In other words, it seemed like the characters do this-or-that merely because the screenplay says he or she is supposed to do this-or-that at that moment. And so I was never really able to embrace them as real people, but rather as puppets manipulated by the script. Still, it's not bad and it's worth catching if you like the actors and the story trips your trigger.The film runs 111 minutes and was shot in New York City, Thailand, New Jersey, Philadelphia and China.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

After two years of imprisonment, the other two who left him behind are told by intense female (lawyer), their old buddy's getting the death penalty if they don't return in about a week--- the other two must serve three years each in prison to save his life. If only one dude returns,then the one who has a conscience &amp; submits to authority, gets six years, whilst the dude who originally got busted still gets to live..

		<shortDescription>See this for Vaughn, not Phoenix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie the other night on A&amp;E and while Joaquin Phoenix's character isn't one of the main ones, it is the most pivotal. I think Phoenix has definite bankable talent as an actor - no argument here. But he also seems to have a habit of overkill, especially in emotional roles. And with this movie, it's a big problem, as the logic and cohesion of the overall plot hinges on the believability, authenticness and sympatheticness of Phoenix's character. It's a fine line for any actor to walk in such a pithy yet demanding role, and apparently, Phoenix wasn't quite up to the challenge.The problems with this movie don't all fall on Phoenix's performance, even though they inevitably to lead back to it. It certainly didn't help that the movie's plot was quite conflicted and its tone and mood throughout was unfocused and inconsistent - at times the movie wanted to be a wrenching human drama set in the compelling context of cultural clashes and impersonal legalities; at other times a morality tale about present attitudes toward drugs; still yet, at other times, an existential angstfest of the main trio of characters played by Heche,Vaughn and Phoenix. Also, if this wasn't bad enough, the plot twistrevealed by Heche's character in the third act strikes me as coming ina little too late, and thus feels like a last minute rewrite thansomething the movie was building up too. It's a big revelation, but its poor timing makes the movie feel more disjointed.But back to the problems with Phoenix... By and large, I found the casting didn't quite gel: Vince Vaughn was at most times very good, but Anne Heche was barely effectual, Jada Pinkett Smith entirely irritating, and want's-his-name as Tony barely on screen enough to go beyond one dimensional functionality. But it is Phoenix's performance that stuck out like a sore thumb. In the beginning he was more a grating, anemic wuss with a dumb smile more than the kind of nature loving, otherworldly-minded idealist that the character Lewis McBride was intended to be. I couldn't feel a lot aside from mild annoyance bordering on indifference for him at first. So when Heche turns up in New York begging for two other characters to make great sacrifices for his life, I found myself a tad incredulous that anyone, particularly such morally undecided characters like Sheriff or Tony, could be so inspired by the guy. A little fond of him, maybe, and saddened that he was awaiting execution, surely - that would be the least you could expect from any decent human being. Yet the movie stresses how self-serving and cynical Sheriff is and how unreliable Tony is, so the viewer's left clutching for reasons why either would comply with Heche's astonishing request, especially since, by midway into the movie, Lewis alone just doesn't seem enough.There's three things that worked for me in this movie, however. The first was Vaughn's convincing portrayal of Sheriff as a cynical, half-self-aware New Yorker who would have never entertained the idea of being self-sacrificing unless it was in someway a real escape from the things that had made him cynical in the first place. The second was the matter of the stolen bike, that made Sheriff's sense of accountability and conflicted conscience more real and more believable. The third was the video of Lewis - the acting by Phoenix here is his best in the movie by far.These three element set up the two best scenes of the movies, both that made the movie worth it for me and both that succeed thanks to Vaughn and despite Phoenix. The first takes place in the court, where Sheriff returns by his own volition and addresses the judge with earnest contrition and a new found sense of accountability, while Lewis writhes and whimpers like a slug in salt on the defendant stand. The lines for Sheriff here are the best writing in the entire movie, as it's at once succinct, genuine, and revealing all at the right time. The second scene is when Lewis is dragged off for execution: here, despite Phoenix's hyperdramatic portrayal of Lewis as someone who's just been savagely tortured and then abruptly told he'll about to be killed, instead of someone who's had a reasonable period of time for reflection and consul so to come to terms with his fate, Vaughn shines as a Sheriff who's at last overcome his cynicism so to reach out to his doomed friend and be there for him in his last minutes despite knowing the futility of the situation. All in all, these two scenes are worth it if you're interested in seeing how much promise Vaughn has for playing complex and demanding lead roles with even-handedness and authenticness. But unfortunately, Vaughn's high points cast unflattering light upon the rest of movie and cast, and in particular Phoenix, who should've taken a few cues from Vaughn for his own performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie wasn't exactly wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie drew me into it about fifteen minutes into the movie. After I found out the main plot I wanted to see how it would end. The ending was totally unexpected and it was incredibly sad. I personally didn't like the ending. It just didn't seem like that should be how it ends. The story built up these marvelous characters and then suddenly those characters crash and burn. Since the characters are what made the movie, and all the actors/actresses were wonderful, the ending shouldn't have went the way it did. But Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely marvelous. He did an outstanding job. He was the best actor in this entire movie. No one could have done it better than he did. Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn also did well. The acting is what made the movie interesting. Anne Heche showed great emotion in the movie and looked so natural that it was actually believable. Vince Vaughn made his character so realistic.He made me actually believe his character's morals. The plot could have used a bit more worked and the directing was a bit terrible. There were some variable in the story that seemed very stupid to me. This movie overall was kind of good, but not exactly wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly intense drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Return to Paradise is probably the most intense drama that I've ever seen. Three friends, Danny, Lewis, and Tony, travel to Malaysia for a vacation, taking a trip that will change all of their lives forever. When one of them decides to stay there at the end of the trip to help the wildlife, it starts a chain reaction that brings the other two back to Malaysia hoping to save their friend's life. There is a curious subplot here involving the all too common thought among Americans that we are so high on the international food chain that we can simply leave the country and then all laws do not apply to us. As is made very clear to these three friends, even the most foreign of foreign countries have their own laws, and even the great United States cannot always help you when you break them. The year after Return to Paradise was released, there was another film released called Brokedown Palace that borrowed so heavily from it that it was almost a remake with females. But even though that film made every possible effort to capture the intensity and power of Return to Paradise, it just could not achieve the same effect. This is not only because Brokedown Palace was released after Return to Paradise or even because it is such a rehash of the same idea, but simply because Return to Paradise is one of those movies that has such a powerful effect that any succeeding film that approaches the same idea cannot re-create the same experience.There is an amazing atmosphere that permeates the entire film, from the beginning part with the three friends' vacation in Malaysia to the scenes in New York. Downtown New York was presented just as well as the Malaysian prison, making each of them that much more effective as far as communicating the horrific experience that Lewis McBride (yet another brilliant but traditionally unenviable role played by Joaquin Phoenix) suffers through for two years before Sherriff and Tony learn what has happened and are suddenly faced with a decision that will change their lives forever.(spoilers) One of the many things that is truly admirable about Return to Paradise is the ending. Rather than trying vainly and failing spectacularly to force a smile onto unhappy material (as was the case in Brokedown Palace), we see an east Asian country stand up for its laws and enforce them in their own way. This film delivers a powerful message that the United States is not all-powerful. We cannot simply travel to a distant country and think that we can do whatever we want because we're out of America and clearly this country where no one even speaks English can have their own rules much less be able to enforce them. Lewis suffered a horrible fate, which most people in America would think was extremely harsh for the relatively harmless crime they had committed, but Malaysia has their own beliefs about that crime, their own punishment for it, and their own reasons for not relenting simply because this was an American kid.Of course, they're never going to achieve a successful democracy over there in Malaysia if they keep killing off their potheads. Who would be president??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not the sort of question that comes up often for most of us. You have a choice: go back to an idyllic land and 'fess up to your part of a crime, resigning yourself to years in a third-world prison, or you stay at home, ensuring that your buddy in that faraway land will be hanged shortly. What do you do, what do you do?It's that dilemma that haunts two young men as they try to decide where their loyalties lie - to themselves or to their friend's life. Since it's unlikely anyone watching this movie has been in this situation before, we can only empathize with their plight. Heck, I have no idea what I'd do if I had to make that decision. The thing is, that decision takes up about 75% of the film's run time. Only some very strong performances (by Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche) keep the pace from becoming leaden. The movie spends virtually no time showing how disgusting and sickening the prisons in this land are; the atmosphere resembles a mystery more than anything else. Will the two young men go back to paradise? For my money, the movie just spent too much time in the U.S. and not enough time overseas. Other than that, it was enjoyable, with a heartfelt ending.</fullReview>

A remake of the French 1989 film FORCE MAJEURE, it poses some interesting challenges to the characters and to the audience.However, the main story turns into soap opera because the plot is wrapped in a typically Hollywood contrived melodrama with tacked on sex scenes which, though tame, have nothing to do with the plot or the characters in any real way. The romance detracts from the bigger issues in the film -- ethical choice and the dangers of drug use.

It examines the faith and sympathy of a single loved one stranded in turmoil, and the sacrificial ending gives out the real truth for choosing one way over another. Yet, that one scene alone doesn't always render the movie harmless. What hurts RETURN TO PARADISE is the way it presents in a soap opera style. There's plenty of talk and useless lovemaking, making me wonder what kind of stirring impact the entire movie has in mind. Anne Heche proves that there's always a leading lady to hang around in Hollywood films, and here, she appears to be stealing time. Not surprisingly, it does offer some will and testament of conflicting battles between good and evil in a progressively modern state. More storytelling and less strays would have made this one better.</fullReview>

The thought of saving a friend's live by sacrificing a part of your own is a good idea for a film. But, the story is somewhat strange. I find the fact that they can share a sentence unrealistic and far-fetched (maybe it is possible in Malaysia...). Seeing that this is the basis of this movie, I find the entire film a bit hard to believe. Part of this lacking is saved by the good acting (with a five star performance by Phoenix) and the portrayal of the characters and their relationship with each other. Also interesting is the way in which the different persons react to the problem. I still can't decide whether I would react like Tony or Sheriff...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie for the first time on TV, on a premium channel, so it was uncut. What I find compelleling is the reallity of the film, which could easily be a documentary, as we all know about the circumstance of US citizens coming up against foreign penal systems and court systems. I was reminded of Midnight Express, a true story.What I do not like is the tendancy to minimalize the crime that was committed. We should not make heroes out of people who buy drugs in foreign countries. There is an worn out cliche, "when in Rome, so as the Roman's do". The USA constantly issues advisories about these third world countries, and warns all Americans that the US and its embassies cannot assist you if you commit a crime. I have travelled frequently to Mexico &amp; other South American countries, and I am painfully aware of this at all times. You are not in your country, so follow the rules. Remember that idiot Michael Fay?Anne Heche was wonderful as the sister and lawyer of the condemed. But once again, the underlying issue was all to clear to me - 3 college aged kids go to a country with known severe anti drug policies, and proceed without any regard for local law, because the movie like so many others, tries to assert that only people who use drugs are enlightened, and the straight are the fools. That to me was the most nauseating aspect of this movie. Drug users may have their reasons,but if you need it that badly, do it in your home in the US. At least if you get caught, you won't get caned or executed, or both. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Outstanding Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This did come out before that Claire Danes movie, right? One point for originality. Actually this is based on another movie or so we're told at the beginning. Two things I found to be unfortunate: 1. Phoenix has very minimal screen time but is excellent when he's on 2. Vaugn doesn't ever get to cut loose and be crazy(Swingers, Clay Pigeons) and isn't that why we like him? This is more of a psychological and moral dilemma for two guys considering to return to Malaysia and save a friend's life. Heche is good. Nothing bad but not exceptionally good. Worth a rental if these actors are appealing to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>troubling story !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why American movie makers seem always very eager to present `injustice' in other countries! Not only they do exaggerate in showing an `inhuman' and brutal way of treatment they also try to demonstrate a status of hate and chaos!! That is simply NOT TRUE!The truth is that -especially- Americans are treated very well in foreign countries and for political reasons even better than the local people!! I don't think also that people who don't respect human rights and international law are in the position to criticise other!!I don't want to make a political theme out of this film but this film -especially because of the great dramatic performance- just serve clichés, spread hate and a sense of insecurity! The American characters are showed very passionate, fervent and morally invulnerable (the good guys); all the others are -of coarse- the bad ones with exactly the opposite qualities. Such films suggest that there is no justice or human rights outside the US, what is absolutely silly and incredible. Actually I don't believe that the human rights are better served in the USA than in many other `third-world' countries!!That's why I hate all these films that try to tell such kind of stories and unfortunately I can't simply separate the story from the performance - which is really very impressing and convincing- but that is the main problem. When the performance is well done then the story seems to be more credible respectively and one more prejudice is again being served.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return to Paradise movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie and it made me realize that Americans aren't looked up to with awe and wonder anymore like in past years. The "I'm an American" doesn't wash anymore, especially when drugs are concerned. Like the kid who was imprisoned in Turkey years ago and managed to escape. And the woman who got 33 years in Thailand back in 1980 who only had to deliver a package of some drug and get the next flight home and she would have gotten $50,000 if my memory serves me right. It doesn't pay to break the law in another country obviously, especially if you're American. Those judges aren't very sympathetic as shown in this movie. Their version of justice is far different than ours. I did not like the character of Jada Pinkett, the nosy reporter, who I think was outright responsible for the hanging. The movie should have included a scene where Anne Heche goes back to N.Y. and kills her or at the very least gives her the beating of her life, I mean a serious beating that would have left her brain damaged. She would have deserved it. Except for that missing part it was a pretty good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've finished it today and I thought it was a bad film,but I agreed that people shouldn't play around too much. Three guys in the movie did well ! They held drugs and one was under arrested. If the story has a good happy ending,that'd be better ! A newspaper released a deadly new about the local government about punishing too bad caused somebody cannot go away from it.Someone died shortly! What a disgusting !However,I believe at least you can find a better advantage on this movie : People should be honest for what they did !I took a main lesson today ! Whatever the film is bad, the movie is still good to learn ! If you anyone who don't like to watch upset movies,don't watch it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie while looking for movies with Joaquin Phoenix in them. At first I thought this could be another made-for-TV movies, but the mention of Malaysia made me look up.The actors are good, with them acting out their roles very well. I thought more exposure should be given to the circumstances of Lewis in prison, the initial trial, and some scenes of him being taken to prison. As the story unfold, I understood that the movie is not so much about Lewis, but more of the inter-play of emotions of Sheriff and Tony, as well as the effort of Beth to convince them to return to Malaysia, to save the life of Lewis.Very straight forward story line, with a little twist towards the end. Overall a good lesson for the young and reckless about the consequence of taking it easy with drugs, especially in a foreign country.No justice done about the conditions in Malaysia, however. The opening scenes are done in Thailand, with bits done with Malaysian actors. The prison looks real shabby, broken down and filthy. The prison guards and the Ministry of Interior would be up for prosecution here in Malaysia if they let the conditions to be that bad.First of all, the guards do speak English, most Malaysians do. The court scene were done in Malay because that's the standard procedure. If the person on trial does not understand Malay, an interpreter would be provided.Secondly, the legal system here would allow appeals and stay of execution if there are new evidence produced. If this is real, Lewis' case would probably be thrown on technical grounds, as there are doubt that the drugs are not entirely his, and not within his control.Treatment of prisoners in Malaysia is far better than that of the common citizen sometimes. A person facing death penalty would be in a special cell, given the best treatment to ensure their calm state of mind. Regular service by the prison priest would be done to help the prisoner come to terms with the inevitable, and to counsel the prisoner. Hanging would NEVER be done in the open, prisoners would be given time to pray, say their goodbyes, meet relatives or friends in a calm manner. Malaysian prison guards are trained to ensure the welfare of the prisoners, prisons well lighted, and clean.I'm sure that if the producers approached the Ministry officials with the proper storyline and intentions, the government would be glad to help get them. For all you know, they may even get some funding for promoting Malaysia from the government.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the tremendously horrific Glitter and Cruel Intentions, this movie has proved already to be the most incalculable waste of my time. Of course, when I add the 16 minutes of commercial break to the 111-minute run time, I can get a ballpark figure of lost opportunity. But what about the time it takes me to stew now that it's over? To write this scathing review? To detail why this loss of time can bring a person to suicide? Please, if you don't kill Joaquin's character, at least remove my feeding tube.The plot. No. I don't even have the energy for this. Besides, the real problem lies in the "brilliant acting", the "exceptional character depth", the "honest conveying of emotions". Joaquin. You're the shining exception. As usual, you channeled your life's tragedy into a brilliant performance, most notably in the video from the prison cell. Unfortunately, you were a minor character, and therefore I had to sit through this tragedy of a film for just the occasional treat. I'm sorry. Honestly, it wasn't worth it.Anne Heche. I hate you. You cannot act. You had absolutely no emotions and appeared to be reading from cue cards. Thank god for the debilitating mental illness that knocked you out of the movie industry for good.Vince. What can I say? You disappointed. I have extremely high expectations of you, and you usually impress. Clearly, you are naturally vindictive, twisted, self-righteous, self-loathing, self-deprecating...in the most beautiful of ways, of course. This time, though, your nature just didn't come through. Actually, you bored me to tears. Don't do it again. But I know it was Anne's fault. I forgive you.Jada Pinkett Smith. What a waste of your time. What a waste of my time. The guy who plays Tony. There is a reason nobody knows your name. I almost forgot to even mention you in this review. Yes, you are utterly forgettable. Please take you one-dimensional portrayals elsewhere.The girl who plays Tony's girlfriend. You are nobody, but you can act. Thank you kindly. I'm sorry Hollywood hasn't been so kind.Enough time has been wasted on this. I shall not carry on. You will undoubtedly not heed my warning and watch this movie anyway. Afterwards, you will feel a deep regret. But don't be too harsh on yourself. Channel it towards Anne. She deserves it for RUINING this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film about friendship, character, and inner peace. The title is a beautiful irony to the story it tells. Like a newspaper story given life, it delivers a believable portrayal of the struggles people cope with in the face of adversity and the conflict between self-preservation and humanity. The story goes straight to the point like a knife to the heart because it is true and real and depressing.Cliché as it is, traveling is not about the destination, but about the journey. Through this hour or so journey, I find that I cry, I pray that it isn't a true story, and am glad I am human.Good to watch. 8/ 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts fast, ends up in the toilet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Return to Paradise is one of the worst kind of movies. The kind that start great, grab your interest, show promise, then, slowly at first, and then faster and faster as the movie moves on, plummet past mediocrity and end in the toilet. This movie starts great, an intriguing scenario: One man is held in an Indonesian prison for the crimes of three men. If at least one of the other two do not return and do a jail term of at least 3 years, he will be put to death. Will they go back to a 3rd world prison to save their friend's life? They have only 8 days to decide. An interesting ethical dilemma, yes? Yes.In fact, the movie does a good job of making you care. The set up is great. You see the two characters current life situations, what they would be leaving behind and what they would be agreeing to endure. It makes you think about what you would do. Unfortunately, that's more thinking than the writers did for the rest of the script. The plot is predictable. Without giving the plot away, I'll just say that the two characters faced with the decision to go or stay do exactly what you know they're going to do the first time you meet them. That's OK, it's a movie convention. What you're looking for is an interesting playing out of the obvious. That's not what you get. You do get some confusion, however. For example, the main relationship in this film, why are they sleeping together? The girl sees no redeeming qualities in the guy, the guy knows he's being manipulated - so let's get it on? Then we're supposed to believe they're in love? Come on. And to top it off, the hero in the story makes his decision based not on a great moral epiphany, but based on this unbelievable relationship. The people I watched this movie with groaned out loud at several points during the second half of the movie. The kind of groan that says, "Give me a break, I'm supposed to believe this?" Don't believe it, and don't see this movie if you can help it. A bad movie that's bad from beginning to end is bad enough, one that pretends to be intelligent and then lets you down in the end is even worse. (5 stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of _RtP_ is excellent, but it got into the mud at some point in its development.Much of the film's failure rests on, yet again, REDUCED CHARACTERS. We watch our Innocent Childlike Victim take the blame for his Aloof Friends comprised of an unfeeling Don Juan and an unfeeling Man With A Future. Desperate (blonde) Victim's Sister and Hungry (black female) Reporter arrive in order to push the plot ahead. All, save Mr. Innocent, are stylishly dressed urbanites. Setting is a Faceless Asian Country Highly Critical of America.Throw in two absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and far too much will-he-won't-he back-and-forth 'suspense' and we got a movie, baby! (The twist at the ending, too, feels Test Audience Approved.) Had _RtP_ been done by a daring director, a hard-boiled writer, and more serious actors, what a film this could have been. As it stands, even the dumb mood music gets in the way. Three out of ten for yet another good idea shot to bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Morality Tale to Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Malaysia, three men have fun fornicating with local women, drinking booze and smoking hashish. When their extended vacation ends, limo driver Vince Vaughn (as John "Sheriff" Volgecherev) and architect David Conrad (as Tony Croft) return to New York. Environmentally conscious Joaquin Phoenix (as Lewis "Lew" McBride) decides to stay and work with endangered orangutans. Two years later, Mr. Vaughn is approached by attractive blonde lawyer Anne Heche (as Beth McBride). She tells Vaughn that, after he left Malaysia, local police arrested Mr. Phoenix for drug possession...Phoenix has spent two years in prison and will be hanged in eight days. However, if Vaughn returns to serve his "share" of the time, Phoenix will be permitted to live. Also, if Ms. Heche can get both Vaughn and Mr. Conrad to return to Malaysia and serve time in prison, they can split the six year sentence; then, each man is expected to serve three years. Since Phoenix has already served two years, perhaps the Vaughn and Conrad should also serve two...Of course, this is an absurd scenario. By offering this deal, the Malaysian authorities have acknowledged Phoenix is not solely responsible for the crime (or a drug "dealer"). They accept the three men were partners; apparently; they only question whether or not Phoenix's friends will appear in court. When considering their options, Vaughn and Conrad should have decided to immediately involve US diplomats and officials in this blatantly dubious proposal...Since we're expected to buy the premise, we are watching to see whether Vaughn and Conrad accept their responsibility. Phoenix has a fun role for an actor, act like a stoner and become slightly unhinged in prison. Conrad gets to telegraph inner conflicts, but he and Phoenix are not the focus. Vaughn is really the leading player, with Heche his co-star. They and director Joseph Ruben do all right with the material they are given, but there is no great moral anguish on display. Unfortunately, there is a shift from "morality tale" to "love story" - not unexpected, but it becomes too dominant.***** Return to Paradise (8/10/98) Joseph Ruben ~ Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Joaquin Phoenix, David Conrad</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that actually makes you not root for the good guys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say that this movie could have been very good. The movie's premise surprisingly wasn't bad! But then like so many movies that start off with good ideas--IT ALL WENT TO HELL! Below are the following reasons why...1. The script was horrible! Half-way through the movie I was convinced that they had changed writers (which they probably did). I can literally count the movie's good (and that's being nice)lines using just one hand.2. The characters were so unlikable! The lawyer was honestly one of the worst lawyers I have seen in a film to date. She had no idea how to handle her case. If she had been a responsible person she would have given it to someone with more experience. But she wasn't. Instead she continued to mess things up not just for her client, oh no, but for almost EVERYONE around her! And her client, played by an amazing actor who has shined in so many films, barely lit up the screen. This of course leaves me to my next point...3. Character development, which was just awful! Phoenix was barely given any screen time. Why?!!! He was by far the most talented actor in the cast! And with such little screen time, I didn't get a chance to really care about his character. As for the other characters, I guess if you consider drinking beer and whining character development, then they were completely developed! Well, those were my reasons, hope they helped!</fullReview>

Why do people think we can't get the emotional content of the film at the end, without a wash of violins?In my mind I fantasized about that dick weed judge taking a trip to New York and running into Vince Vaughn, and Vaughn dishes out a little Brooklyn alley justice ... Oh, and Vaughn's speech to the lawyer at the end didn't ring true. He was way too saintly. I little fear about the reality of his situation would have been more honest ...</fullReview>

It has no morale meaning, but nonetheless, the name genius would not be an exaggeration when talking about the director's film-making skills. The meat-head bloke was a great actor, as was the elf chick who should have been in Lord of the Rings. We feel delighted that the bloke who decided to help his friend got locked up, and got rewarded by seeing his friend die. Shouts out to the female journalist who broke the story, shouts out to all the news corporations of he world. It is up there with the classics, like Top Gun, and other moral dramas.
