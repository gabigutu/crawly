		<shortDescription>A Remake of a Film that Never Needed to be Remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one wants to remake a movie, the best option is probably to choose and original that was good, but not a great classic. Clearly, any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger, but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one's film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of 'Planet of the Apes' is one of cinema's great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story, it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties- the fear of nuclear war, race relations- and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature, the relationship between religion and science, Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton's part to try and remake it. The main concept of Tim Burton's film is basically similar to Franklin Schaffner's. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. Humans exist on this planet, but they are regarded as an inferior species, despised and exploited by the apes. There is, however, an important difference. In the original film, the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. Although they have only attained a pre-industrial level of civilization (they have firearms, but no power-driven machinery, and no means of transport other than the horse or horse-drawn vehicles), they are a far more advanced species than the planet's human inhabitants, who lack the powers of speech and reason and live an animal-like existence. In Burton's remake, humans and apes have similar powers of speech and intellect; it is only the apes' greater physical strength that enables them to dominate the planet and to treat the humans as slaves. It was this ironic role-reversal, with apes behaving like men and men behaving like beasts, that gave Schaffner's film its satirical power. That film was advertised with the slogan 'Somewhere in the Universe, there must be something better than man!', and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man. Their law against killing others of their kind, for example, is much more strictly observed than our commandment that 'Thou shalt do no murder'. There is no sense that the apes are bad and the humans good. Even Dr Zaius, the orang-utan politician, is not a wicked individual; by the standards of his society he is an honourable and decent one. His weakness is that of excessive intellectual conservatism and unwillingness to accept opinions that do not fit in with his preconceived world view. (In this respect the apes are very human indeed). Burton's film takes a less subtle moral line. It is a straightforward story of a fight for freedom. The villains are most of the apes, especially the fanatical, human-hating General Thade. The heroes are Captain Davidson, the astronaut from Earth, the planet's human population who long for freedom from the domination of the apes, and a few liberal, pro-human apes, especially Ari, the daughter of an ape senator. The apes are more aggressive and more obviously animals than in the original film; they still frequently move on all fours and emit fierce shrieks whenever angry or excited. There are some things about this film that are good, especially the ape make-up which is, for the most part, more convincing than in the original film and allows the actors more scope to show emotion. (I say 'for the most part' because Ari looks far less simian than do most of the other apes- Tim Burton obviously felt that the audience would be more likely to accept her as a sympathetic character if she looked half-human). The actors playing apes actually seem more convincing than those playing humans. Tim Roth is good as the militaristic Thade, as is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ari. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, is not an actor of the same caliber as Charlton Heston, who played the equivalent role in the original film, and Estella Warren has little to do other than look glamorous. (Heston has a cameo role as an ape in Burton's film, and even gets to repeat his famous line 'Damn you all to hell'). Overall, however, the film is a disappointment when compared to the original, a simple science-fiction adventure story as opposed to an intelligent and philosophical look at complex issues. It tried to copy the device of a surprise ending but failed. Schaffner's famous final twist is shocking, but makes perfect sense in the context of what has gone before. Burton's makes no sense whatsoever.Tim Burton can be a director of great originality, but with 'Planet of the Apes' he fell into the standard Hollywood trap of trying to copy what had already been done and remaking a film that never needed to be remade. It was good to see him return to form with the brilliant 'Big Fish', one of the best films of last year. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of Shallowness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank you Hollywood. Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. This movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot. Please Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.Oh yeah, the ending did not make ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.* out of **** stars, mainly for the visuals</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As shallow as the water he crashlands in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Tim Burton's excellent Sleepy Hollow, and superlative Ed Wood, I was expecting much more of a character driven movie, with the characterization and spiritual philosopies that elevated the original movie out of the pure science fiction genre and into a cerebral adventure film with acutely observed social comments.Unfortunately, the film suffers from poor script and direction right from the minute the astronaut crashlands.They knew from the outset that they would never produce an ending to rival the original, and any cinema-goer in their right minds would never expect one. But they could have at least got the beginning right. Neither Mark Wahlberg's character nor the tension is ever developed, so when he is confronted by the apes: we feel nothing.The humans, though they have the benefit of increased intelligence and speech, are poorly utilized. And Kris Kristofferson is criminally wasted.The make-up and effects are, as you would expect, fantastic. However, despite improved flexibility in the make-up, there is little warmth in either the performances or direction that made millions of kids go ape-nuts in the seventies. Bonham-Carter's Ari, whilst convincing, is not a patch on Kim Hunter's Zira. Roth's quite brilliant performance as Thade virtually carries this film and makes it the one reason to stick with it to the end.Did I say end? Well, the less said about that the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marky Mark's Planet Of The Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers Galore!Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh, that's right, some idiot already did that - I rest my case.Movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he's not that smart from the outset. Marky Mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees.The perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship a-bustle with genetic experiments on apes. Must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it.Marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci-fi cinema - the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the space station's mind-boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep-space rescue mission into a worm-hole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.Before anyone can say `Pointless Remake' Marky has surfed the worm-hole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.Surprise! It's APES doing the chasing - or at least, it *would* have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTY-THREE YEARS AGO.Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing *his* lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka irritating chimp activist), at a loss without a Shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes `re-imagining': `The Apes Of Roth'. While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as Chimpanzee Thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: Thade is mad when we first meet him... and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end. Nice twist.The original POTA (1968) featured a leading character, Charlton Heston's Taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets - yet as that film progressed, Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth - as their sole champion! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed. Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Mark's Leo? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there's lots of running.The slogans cry: Take Back The Planet .but it's the APES' planet. In this movie, humans and apes crash-landed here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators, simply because they're there. `Taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, `A planet where men evolved from APES??!!' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he WAS Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations: how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot command respect? Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanity's icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant. In the original film, the apes deem Taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity. That irony again.It was apt that a man who elevated scene-chewing to an acting technique - Heston - should play the father of this film's primo scene-chewer, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's ape-dad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the HUMANS this time, `Damn them! Damn them all to hell!'The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky an ass-beating lesson, a pod descends from on high with Marky's chimpnaut in it. Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, `Let's teach these monkeys about evolution.' Firstly, they're not monkeys, you ape! Secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution.Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren's half-nekkid role was actually integral to the plot (be still my pants.).No matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating, `It's a madhouse! A MADHOUSE!!...'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Apes Lite"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's new "Planet of the Apes" is actually a remake--excuse me, a "re-imagining"--of the first TWO movies of the old series. Its occasional paraphrasing of lines from the original movie (devoid of any meaningful context), and its cameos by members of the original cast (Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison), only underscore that this new version isn't what the original was, i.e., an original. Mark Wahlberg, as Our Hero, has none of the cynical, edgy complexity of Heston's Taylor, and is in fact the sort of can-do flyboy Taylor found laughable. Much as I adore Helena Bonham Carter, her turn as Ari, a sultry, sexy, meddling, annoying human-rights activist, is ultimately tiresome, and absolutely incomparable to Kim Hunter's brave, brilliant, impish Zira of the old series. The role is also a criminal waste of Bonham Carter's beauty, hidden as it is behind a bizarre makeup that looks neither ape nor human. Rick Baker's highly-touted ape makeups (which I've enjoyed since the days of "Schlock" and "Kentucky Fried Movie") are highly uneven here. Tim Roth's villainous Thade has the best, with most of the rest being just adequate and no particular improvement over John Chambers' work in the original. And the socko ending (keep reading; I won't spoil it for you) is simply tacked on: unlike the jolting end of the original, it neither ties together nor arises from the movie's earlier action in a way that Explains Everything. Instead, it begs so many questions (mainly "How the heck did THAT happen?") that it seems engineered (or contrived) solely to set the stage for more sequels. All told, this is "Apes Lite," a comic-bookish caricature of the original, made for the short-attention-span crowd. It made me want to do something I hadn't done in ages: fire up the VCR and roll the original again. It's typical of the 1968 movie's gritty, clever irony that the first word of dialogue uttered by an ape--his entire line, in fact--is "Smile."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the spring of 2001 audiences seemed eager to see Tim Burton's retelling of the 1968 classic, "Planet of the Apes." By the summer of 2001 it seemed to be the movie everybody loved to hate. Were the criticisms fair? Not if you ask me.2001's Planet of the Apes' biggest downfall, in my opinion, is unfortunately also it's biggest strength. Unlike many remakes which often end up as nothing more than weaker rehashes of their predecessor's this version of 'Apes' dared to be different. The plot has been stripped down to its bare bones and then rebuilt into something completely new. This is refreshing, if you ask me. Especially when rewatching it now, because just a few short years after this film came out we launched into sort of a remake renaissance, where half the tent pole films that come out every year are the same lesser rehashes that I spoke of a second ago. This film does take a moment here and there to wink at the '68 original, but Burton and his merry band of screenwriters has created a world completely original...it could be watched next to any entry of that original series as a wholey different film.This is also the film's biggest flaw though, or at least financially speaking, because the original 'Apes' franchise has a cult following behind it that could almost rival that of Star Wars or Star Trek. The core audience for this film really only wanted to see their favourite story told with modern day effects and makeup. I don't think we needed that, but I'm not sure how many would agree with me.Now, if you want to compare the two films plots and decide which one is stronger that's a whole other debate. But I don't think that's fair, that's why I champion it for taking such a different approach. I don't think this movie should be compared to any other movie and with that mindset a much better appreciation can be found. To put it bluntly, this movie ain't bad...in fact it's actually pretty good.I won't deconstruct the plot for you...if you're interested enough to be reading this you probably at least know the jist of it anyway. But it's a solid and interesting plot that sets up a very fun and entertaining action adventure flick. Visually its in many ways a departure from typical Burton fair but his stamp is definitely evident in its art direction, and the atmosphere he creates in this jungle/desert/urban/high tech universe is really something to behold. The apes are not only impressive in terms of makeup but they are also creatively impressive from the choices of the species to match personalities, the incredible costumes and simply perfect performances by a cast who act through all that latex. And while I'm praising I'll also throw up a shout out for Danny Elfman's great score, which just might be one of his best.The only caveat I'll lay on the movie is that the twist ending, obviously conceived to rival the famous twist of the original, kind of falls flat. BUT...considering how many instalments the original franchise had I have no doubt that the producers had hoped to make a sequel had this film been more financially successful, and had that sequel been made maybe we would've learned the story behind this twist and all would've been forgiven.It's a little too late to say, 'long story short,' but I will anyway. Give this movie a fair shot. It may not be without its flaws but how many movies are? Try not to compare it to the original, just watch it with a bowl of popcorn and have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton is no good as a gun-for-hire director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it's seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better. This "re-imagining" of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.There were problems in basic plot development. The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. Even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston's Taylor as being different from the other humans. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. They are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can't do. It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson (Wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. This was poor character development. (Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). Wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.Creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: Ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in The Green Mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. But the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon's rocket: jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. Secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.In the original film, the various "human" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief ("I never knew an ape I didn't like." "Human see, human do!"). Here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st Century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.Nothing made me cringe more than the "V-Ger from Star Trek" moment near the end of the film. First of all, the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form. Secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. This moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.Things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. Back in the '60s and '70s, they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. I'm thinking of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. However, this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. In a contemporary setting, you'd have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it's "science fiction" you don't have to!Overall, Burton's most disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apes for dummies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen. He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the 1960's America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike his dark look). However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.The acting is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.Then there is Tim Roth. His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time. Additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.This film is a great disappointment. It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it a 3/10. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10. However the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is. Of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest disappointment of 2001!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awhile back, I commented on the original 'Planet of the Apes' film prior to seeing this remake at the cinemas. When I saw the original, I was fully expecting the remake to kick some serious butt, and be far superior to the 1960s version. Why? Better visual effects being 2001 and all, one of my favorite actors in Tim Roth starring in it, and a great director named Tim Burton. Nothing could surely go wrong with Burton in the director's chair. Granted, I was never a huge fan of the POTA films, but seeing the potential here for a remake or revision by Burton made my mouth water. Then, in 2001, I got advance tickets and I began to watch one of the most anticipated movies for that year...I left the cinema very disappointed! Disappointment can cloud criticism though, and sometimes makes you bitter towards a movie and not see the positives. So I tried to look at the good. The make-up was excellent, but inconsistent in parts, but I still feel that area should have been nominated for an Oscar. Okay, that's good! Tim Roth was amazing in his performance but his character was not that great and seriously lacked depth. Helena Bonham Carter was also fairly decent in this film. And, finally some of the cinematography was fairly nice. What really let the remake of 'Planet of the Apes' down, was by in large, Tim Burton. This is, without a doubt, his worst film that I've seen! I cannot really compliment the direction of this movie, as it seemed self-aware and indulgent in being the "remake". The script was awful, as well as the integration of one-liners from the original films to this new one. I groaned completely during Heston's cameo, particularly due the referrals to the original film. The remake should have been a film in its own right, and should have focused on creating a compelling story and universe, instead of opting for lame jokes revolving around Charlton Heston in ape make-up as Thade's father. The hero of the new film in Mark Whalberg was one-note, but he was given such a boring character who just went through the motions. Going to take a risk- check, gets sucked through a new dimension- check, captured by Apes- check, escape- check and so on and so on. I never felt anything for his character at all, and that was partly his performance and partly the woeful script/direction. Estella Warren was awful, and Kris Kristofferson played the obligatory predictable role of the her father. Michael Clarke Duncan suited his part, but never became a well established character, and Paul Giamatti was okay as Limbo, but was obviously the comic relief. I also did not like the art direction was the Ape City, and found the original far more convincing in look and as a story.While, General Thade was certainly a memorable chimp because of Roth's performance, it's a shame the character was wasted in an extremely formulaic and cliche story! 'Planet of the Apes' (2001) is nowhere near the worst film of 2001, it certainly was the most disappointing for me, considering the potential it had with the dynamic vision of Tim Burton and the modern visual f/x to create a film that stands out in its own right. It's just a pity Tim Burton chose to make a Hollywoodized self-aware gimmicky version that ends up being significantly inferior to the original film, instead of on par with it! And yes, Burton's 'Mars Attacks' is also better than his remake here! 'Planet of the Apes' gets a reluctant pass for Tim Roth's performance, the superb make-up and the decent cinematography, however that still doesn't save it from silly mediocrity.**? out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWFUL!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why can't we all get along?" the Rodney King ape asks. Maybe it's because Hollywood insists on doing awful re-makes of classic movies! There is NOTHING worth seeing in this film (except, maybe, Charlton Heston's cameo). The remake is cliché-ridden, wholly predictable, and the ending makes no sense whatsoever . Why would anyone even THINK of tampering with a work of art like the original version of the Planet of the Apes? Avoid this travesty of a movie and rent the video of the 1968 classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape from the Boulle planet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually,this film is sometimes a splendor;the light falls on a crepuscular world.The Apes' town is quite scary particularly when you see it from a distance ,as it stands out against an ominous sky.In the very beginning,the cast and credits are also successful,with an adequate martial music.The first third has some funny,parodic and sometimes politically incorrect lines.In the second third,the movie begins to lose steam,although the discovery in the wrecked spaceship is a rather good idea. But that's not all good news.First of all,the hero lacks charisma and the apes and their sensational make-up simply overwhelm him and drown him out.On the contrary,majestic Charlton Heston,even when he was in chains,displayed a Shakespearian grandeur in the first version.The last third consists in battles,a "second coming" and the "astonishing" ending without which..that would not be "planet of the apes".Actually,the new ending was borrowed from Pierre Boulle 's novel,but not without adding a mathematically unlikelihood which will give you headaches if you begin to think too hard:the least they can do:Everything ,even the proper nouns from the French writer's book have been removed,even if some characters recall some of the Boulle/Shaffner version.Shaffner had contented himself with changing the astronauts' name(eg:Ulysse Mérou=Taylor) Hats off to Helena Bonham-Carter who brings warmth and emotion in a rather vapid cast:in a part close to that of Kim Hunter/Zira,she really asserts her distinctive identity. Tim Roth is effective as well,but his part is less so.David Warner and Kris Kristofferson are wasted.As a tribute to Shaffner(?)both Linda Harrison (an unidentified woman captured with Leo) and Charlton Heston (moaning his curse,which is,admittedly,funny)appear unbilled.Tim Burton might be a director to remember.Although he has not made a genuine masterpiece yet,his filmography is already rich:"Sleepy hollow","Edward Scissorhands ,the marvelous "Ed Wood" (Martin Landau is unforgettable).But redoing "planet of the apes " was a hard task.Shaffner's movie followed a progression,it moved slowly,from the long introduction showing the three astronauts making their way across desolate landscapes to the stunning final shots with Heston and Harrison 's roaming down by the sea.Remember how long it took Taylor to convince Zira he was a thinking man!Here it seems natural to Ari almost as soon as she sees him,that Leo is no dumb idiot animal.And that's the last straw,even Tim Roth (some kind of cross between Shaffner's Cornelius and a pulp fiction baddie)pretty damn quickly believes too that that human is too clever for his own sake.Tim Burton's so-so remake epitomizes the dearth of good scripts.Pierre Boulle's book is a golden mine and one could have written a coherent story out of it,different from that of the first version.Why not,for instance,introduce the two "astronauts" whose scenes open and close it,and turn Leo's adventures into a flashback?What about showing the love between the hero and the woman-animal ?And the son they had?And the menace this son represented for the simian race? All these ideas were left over by Shaffner's script writers and could have built a strong new tale.The main flaw lies in the human beings:here,they speak -English!- ,they can reason,they can swim (!),they are (except for bubble head Warren)clever,so why the hell did the apes tame them?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sorry excuse for the Planet of the Apes title. It doesn't make you think, it doesn't hold your, but it does re-affirm the belief that Marky Mark is one of the worst actors in Hollywood.The movie starts out with Marky Mark and his funky bunch floating around in space for no apparent reason. They use monkeys as subjects for experiments and also send them out in pods (very similar to Kubrick's in 2001, in fact their whole space station looks the same, more to come on that...) to do experiments. Well they find some weird force field stuff and send a monkey out. What else happens but they lose communication. Well Marky Mark, being the animal lover that he is, goes out and tries to save his monkey friend. But, alas, he is sucked through the force-field-black-hole-blah-blah and crash lands on a strange planet. He lands in the midst of a human round up where the apes are getting the humans to sell in the slave market.The main symbolism in this movie is racism. Unlike the first movie, the people in this movie can talk. After the apes catch the humans, they sort them out in groups of male and female. Hmm, sounds like a Nazi concentration camp to me. The apes don't notice that Marky Mark is wearing a weird space outfit and everyone else is wearing rags made from animal skin.Marky Mark realizes that apes don't like humans too much so he tries to escape. He is helped by an "human-lover" Ari to escape the city.SPOILER ALERT: They get out of the city and Marky Mark finds his old ship via GPS or something. He then realizes that the ship has been there for thousands of years and figures out he traveled through time. The movie never tries to make you think it is earth though. It's just some weird planet. You also find out all the monkeys they had on-board, all CHIMPS, are the apes now on that planet. Pretty hard to believe considering there are all types of great apes: gorilla, chimp and orangutan. Anyway, they have a battle with the apes (hmmm, reminds me of....SPARTACUS, another Kubrick film). The humans win and Marky Mark leaves, without saying a word the entire last 10 minutes of the film, not even to the very hot Estella Warren who looks very good in her costume. He goes through the portal...blah blah....lands on earth.blah blah but is greeted by a monkey statue at the Lincoln memorial. (He crash landed right on the steps, don't ya know) and the movie ends. blah. The first movie had a good surprise ending, leaving us realizing that man destroyed themselves as a result of their violence. This movie doesn't explain why apes and humans have changed places except with some stupid blurb by Charleton Heston explaining that man is violent, blah blah, that is why they cannot regaion control, blah blah. It's a case of "always has, always will be" or "segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forver" blah blah. Stupid movie. blah.</fullReview>

It feels so "tacked on". And what a stroke of luck he managed to crash land right there too, we might have had to sit through another 20 mins of this rubbish if he didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie with great potential was ruined by the ending and lack of development of characters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is not as bad as a lot of the reviews make it out to be. Second, it didn't bore me and I was actually pretty content with the film until the last 10 min.SPOILER**** When the chimp landed on the planet during the "big final battle" I just knew that this film was spiraling down, and in my opinion it did.Mostly everyone knows the story of this movie regardless if they've seen it or not. It's about a human pilot Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) who crash lands on a planet ruled by apes a few thousand years in the future and tries to escape because the living conditions of humans there are very poor due to the tyranny of the apes. This simple plot I think would have made for a good movie. Also, I'd like to mention that I haven't seen the original Planet of the Apes so I'm making no comparison. However, what ruined this movie was the fact that there were too many plot holes. A big part about enjoying a movie is to understand the story and when a movie is presented with a plot-holed story-line, you'll be spending a lot of time wondering instead of letting yourself enjoy the film.Anyway, the plot summary seems very simple, yet the movie is cluttered with so many different things going on. This proves to be a big obstacle for portraying the development of the characters. This was unfortunate because I believed that the characters were worth relating to, especially Daena (Estella Warren). Actually, now that I think of it, she had about 5 lines in the film, other than that all she had to do was pose, and by the time of her last scene, I still didn't know her name.Another thing that bothered me about the film was the somewhat love-triangle between Leo, Ari, and Daena. Throughout the movie, it was so obvious that a romance between Leo and Daena would've worked well, but they didn't even have a conversation together. As for putting Ari in this equation it was just a bad idea because why would Leo even give Ari a second thought as a love interest when he has the HUMAN Daena right in front of him. It was clear from the beginning that Daena was smitten with Leo, yet he doesn't even notice because he's too busy with trying to get off the planet which is understandable, but I think it would have been good for the film if Leo and Daena had connected emotionally. First of all, Estella Warren who I think has enormous potential would have had a better role. She could have been sort of the woman behind the great man, helping him believe in himself and just being there for him. They really wasted the character of Daena in my opinion. It's also unfair for others to criticize Estella Warren's acting, I mean how much better could she have been with the script she was given?Thade, annoyed me after a while because he sneered and growled too much. However, overall I didn't think Tim Roth did such a bad job.I've mentioned how Daena's character was wasted, well actually all the human characters weren't much for the plot. Karubi, Daena's father had absolutely no relevence to the film. Birn (Luke Eberl the boy) was a waste of screen space, and then they try to make him important during the end of the film, but that falls through because his character didn't develop just like everyone else.SPOILER*** Attar's (Michael Clarke Duncan) conversion at the end of the film was also unbelievable. It's also hard to believe that when Thade gets stuck in the ship and starts shooting off his gun, that he didn't get hit at all even though there were like 7 bullets ricocheing off the tiny room at the same time.Finally, the ending. A movie's ending can make it or break it. This movie's ending broke it. It left far too many questions unanswered, but not only that, it didn't make any sense AT ALL! I have a feeling that the movie makers only put this ending in so that people will hear through word of mouth about this twist ending and make them want to see it. It's nothing but a money making sham which unfortunately is working. It leaves room for so many different types of sequels, what bothers me is that it doesn't seem to leave room for most of the characters to return for the sequel (eg. Daena, Ari...).Well, this movie was a feast for the eyes, it's visually a masterpiece, but unfortunately visuals aren't enough to make a great movie, a story and characters one can relate to are still the key and unfortunately this movie lacked this. It's definitely a movie worth a look at, just not at the price of today's cinema admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am the first to say, its only a movie don't try and analyze it like a Shakespeare play. But with the blatant holes in the script, I walked out of the movie shaking my head. How could a director of Tim Burton's character make this version of Planet of the Apes with a script that made Lost in Space (TV Series) look good.I could probably ignored some lapses of common sense in a movie but when the whole premise of the story has so many gaping chasms you cannot ignore them. The effects were good, but I would wait until they had a movie double with Battlefield Earth. That way you can feel really ripped off.Spoilers don't read on unless you really want to see this movie. When you see a movie the last thing I hate thinking is how silly, why did the hero do that. Example, After he escapes the ape city then he gets his survival kit from his ship rather than when he first crashed. The Holes - If they descended from the original space station and the only animals they had on board were chimpanzees. Where did the horses, gorilla's, orangutans &amp; parrots come from? The worm hole? It was so convenient. I can imagine the scriptwriter, William Broyles saying to himself, "gee I have painted myself into a corner here, I'll just use the worm hole, nobody knows how they work". And worse of all he did it a couple of times. Very weak writing, with no understanding of plausible continuity.Finally I could see why they were training chimps to fly the Pods (That incidentally can reach speeds 6 times that of light. (Saturn to Earth in under 30 seconds). Because lets faced it, at least the chimp could land the thing; Wahlenberg had two goes and crashed both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget 'Pearl Harbor,' the biggest movie of the year is here!!This is a credit to the fun of film-making. Burton keeps the viewer nailed down and anxious to see what lies ahead.Tim Roth could very well be in award-contention for his no-holds-barred representation of a human-hater. His speech, walk, even his eye movements completely transform him into a vicious ape. Hats off to an actor of his caliber. Wahlberg is good, as well. He is the typical 'boy-next door' American whom is smart enough to not ask questions while he secretly plans his escape. Kristofferson's cameo is nearly non-existant, however. Development of the human tribes and their ways of life would be interesing to learn of, but action wins over plot thickness. Estella Warren is simply eye-candy, while Bonham Carter is the lead female with a brain to match.The film is fast paced, and at a few moments seemed to be out of control. Not Burton's best work personally, but working with an ensemble of terrific makeup artists, photograhphers, and Elfman (with a terrific score), it is tied together nicely.</fullReview>

They are very odd culture of the monkeys. They are good a color!!! I see the costumes are beautiful too!!! It's gone in film! For the actors and the actresses, Mark is cool. to play the perfect role of Leo. He is a good actor. For Tim Roth, it is played a good role of malicious!!! It's excel!!! For Helena, it is actress a little as in the film Club Fight. For Michael Clarke Duncan, it is the role of large gorilla!! It gives me fear. The others of the monkeys are differences the characters in the village. They are special culture.I believe that Burton is a good spirit! Congratulated!!!Finally, I'm talking about my comments of costumes and decoration and actors and actresses. I hope which the film is still a sequel film of planet of the apes in Washington D.C. with the director Tim Burton and the actor Mark.</fullReview>

Burton delivers his usual chuzpah in his own dark and twisted way, and his long time friend, Danny Elfman delivers one of his best scores ever.

The audience I saw it with about 40 minutes into the movie were just making jokes the rest of the time. This was a full audience on opening night that was excited to see it. Just pathetic. Right before the Deus Ex Machina happened , a person said " This better not be...(what it was)" and the crowd started just groaning in pain when it happened.

		<fullReview>What do you get if you take a lousy screenplay, add some miscast actors, and top it off with state of the art special effects? Easy: a bad movie that makes millions of dollars. This movie was awful, no two ways about it. I have the utmost respect for Tim Burton, but that doesn't mean he's incapable of making an absolute garbage film, which is what he did here. The screenplay had all the depth of a fourth grader's story contest submission, stooping so far as to have a character say (and I'm not making this up) "Can't we all just get along?" I swear, Paul Giamatti's bad comic relief character was pulled from a thrown-out Disney script. This movie was cliched at its best, at its worst it was painfully stupid. I can't say more without spoiling the ending, but know this: When you're sitting in the theater thinking "Oh sweet jesus don't let that be the way they're gonna end it," stand up and leave, because the ending you dread is the one you get. As long as movies like this keep making money, they'll keep making movies like this, and that's a damned shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Wahlberg is a disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this was going to be a bad movie. I loved the original so any attempt to top it was, in my perspective, bound to fail. And surely, it did.This is one misconceived film, and has nothing in the form of pace, believability or lovable characters. The ending (here we go again) is glued on for no apparent reason, other than trying to be true to the novel on which the film is based. The plot is more or less non-existent. And why is it that these "wild" humans, are running around with nicely combed and washed hair, and look like a million? A film such as this, has got to be more dirty. We're talking about a planet ruled by monkeys damn it! And when humans can talk and communicate with the apes the analogy to our own world is lost, along with any reason as to why Mark Wahlberg would make a difference.Speaking of; one of the main reason for the failure is Mark Wahlberg. I havent seen an actor do such a bad job in....well, ever actually. He has got the face of a robot, and less talent than one. And why does he make such a big difference in this world? He has got no charisma, he displays no leadership, he has trouble raising his voice, he delivers all of his lines with the same tone of voice and is generally as inspiring as a taxaccountant. Why are we led to believe that he could lead a rebellion against monkey-tyrrany?Without a doubt Tim Burtons worst film. Avoid!4/10 for good makeup and nice FX's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am a very big Tim Burton fan. I could go on forever about how much I love his films, but this is about PLANET OF THE APES and not Burton's career. The original PLANET OF THE APES movie is a favorite of mine. I have loved it since I first saw it as a child. And I could never realize why so many of my friends would laugh at me. No one ever understood the film. Well, none of my childhood friends. When I first read that Tim Burton was selected to direct the new APES film I was a little confused. He is a brilliant director, but an APES film? A number of months later I saw the theatrical trailer and was very impressed. Well, not entirely. I have a very strong hatred for Mark Wahlberg. Other than his casting, the film looked good. When I saw the film summer of 2001, I was utterly disappointed. If any of you have seen the movie, you know what I am talking about. I think the main problem with the movie was the script. And that brings my attention to a possible problem with Tim Burton. Visually, he is amazing but his taste in scripts or screenplays is lacking. Hell, maybe he decided to do the movie before reading the script. That would probably explain a lot. This was the first Tim Burton movie that I not only did not like, but rather hated. The movie is incredibly slow, boring, and very expensive. However, visually (if you were to watch the movie with no volume) the film is great. With the exception of a few action sequences. For some reason every other action sequence or so by Burton is terribly filmed. I thought he did a wonderful job with the action in his previous film SLEEPY HOLLOW, but the climatic battle in PLANET OF THE APES has some horrible shots. On the other hand of course it had some beautiful and provocative scenes too. One in particular is of the chimp Tim Roth running on all fours towards a fleeing Mark Wahlberg into the old space ship. And also the shots of the Ape infantry charging on the frontline on all fours was incredibly brilliant and scary. As I stated earlier, great film visually and Burton is amazing but the dialogue and script for this movie are horrible. In conclusion, I'd give this film a D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow and illogical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, the first Planet of the Apes (PotA) was unique and interesting in its time. But, it surely was not worthy of a remake, revisioning, or regurgitation.What is most disturbing about this movie is how slow and illogical it is. It plods along through scenes with very little energy. I kept thinking about how hot everybody must have been in those monkey outfits. There are points where Mark Walburg does the most illogical and pointless things. For example - why doesn't he ever talk! I mean if strange animals were locking me up AND they happened to also speak my language, I would make every effort to reason with them. But Mark just stands there .... duhhhh. When he finally gets a gun - which could flatten the apes does he protect it with his life - heck no. Another ape grabs it from him and breaks it.And the woman with the overly red pouty lips. What the hell was she doing there other than looking pretty? Her role has no purpose whatsoever other than somebody who can receive the animalistic affections of Mark.This is a pathetically bad movie. Worse than I even expected. I had real high hopes for this before it came out. I was really looking forward to seeing it. All I can say is I am happy I waited until it came out on video. I would have been really p***ed to have spent $10.00 to see this piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixed Bag, but Ultimately a Decent Addition to the Apes Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YEAR: 2001 DIRECTOR: Tim Burton COUNTRY: USA RUNTIME: 119 minutesTHE PLOT: An astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) crashlands on a planet ruled by apes where humans are considered animals and slaves, even though they are intelligent and can speak. The astronaut soon leads the humans to revolt.I don't think there's any question that Tim Burton really knows how to make a film look great. And so it is with this remake of "Planet of the Apes." The locations, sets, ape make-up, costumes, cast, score (Danny Elfman) and direction are all outstanding. Just as good as the original film and, in many cases, even better. Unfortunately, the overall results are a mixed bag.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The biggest problem with this remake is that there is no build-up of mystery. Wahlberg crashlands to the planet very early on in the story, just like in the original film. Unfortunately, as soon as he lands he's IMMEDIATELY thrust into the ape/human conflict, captured and taken to the ape city. This flashes by so quickly that the viewer could easily MISS IT ALL if s/he got up for a few minutes to get something from the kitchen!! The original took its time in this matter; Taylor (Heston) and his fellow astronauts obviously crashland in the middle of nowhere and explore the planet for a long period of time before eventually encountering the inhabitants of the planet. It's all very mysterious, and there's a lot of build-up to the ape revelation.It's also highly unbelievable that Wahlberg would crashland right into the midst of the human/ape conflict. The planet is the size of Earth, so what are the chances that he'd land right in the middle of the fray? I suppose Burton and the writers didn't want the film to bog down once Wahlberg crashlands, but couldn't they have at least given us FIVE MINUTES of exploration time, giving the impression that Wahlberg searches for a fairly long period of time before encountering the humans and apes? As it's presented it's simply too unbelievable.This is a major misstep; and because it happens so early in the film it strongly tempts most intelligent viewers (who naturally MUST have some reasonable amount of believability to enjoy sci-fi) to lose faith in the picture and tune out or, at least, become excessively critical of the remainder of the film.Another problem with the picture is that I just simply failed to really get caught up in the characters and their story. There needed to be more character-defining dialogue. A well written script causes the viewer to be CAPTIVATED by the storyline. Well, I never fully got captivated.These factors explain why I was severely let down when first viewing the film at the theater in 2001.WHAT WORKS: Seeing the film again recently, I was braced for these flaws and willing to suspend disbelief to (try to) enjoy the story. I now conclude that there are numerous worthwhile qualities to the remake.For one thing, although Mark Wahlberg is no Charleton Heston (Taylor was Heston's greatest role and performance IMHO), I think he does a great job as the protagonist. Helena Bonham Carter is also fabulous in the Zira-like role of Ari; she really brings Ari to life and makes her unique. And as beautiful as Linda Harrison was as Nova, Estella Warren pretty much blows her out of the water in the counterpart role of Daena. Unfortunately her character is shallow and we never get a satisfyingly good look at Estelle in all her voluptuous glory. But, no matter, what we DO see is breathtaking.Tim Roth is utterly evil as the villainous Thade. This is very much in contrast to Dr. Zaius in the original, who was actually a very noble character. Lastly, the giant Michael Clarke Duncan is magnificent as the gorilla general, Thade's "friend."As to be expected, the ape make-up is WAY better than the original, even though I still love the job they did in the earlier film. The ape characters don't only look more like highly evolved apes compared to the original, they walk, talk, howl, grunt, jump, fight and climb more like real apes.The ape city sets are fabulous too, albeit a bit too dark for my tastes. I find this unbelievable and verging on cartooney. I know Burton is into Goth and therefore prefers dark lighting, but it would be nice to actually SEE the wonderful sets made for the film (or perhaps he doesn't want the viewer to get too good a look and see how artificial they really are? I don't know, I'm just guessing).I also liked all the homages to the original film -- the various lines, Linda Harrison, Charleton Heston as Thade's dying father, etc.Although numerous people had a problem with the ending, I think they did a good job. How else better to end it? Notice how the camera mysteriously shoots from behind the "Lincoln Memorial" just like the original does with the Statue of Liberty.FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite a couple major flaws there's a lot to appreciate in Burton's remake. It's not as good as the original or "Beneath," but it's, at least, on a par with "Escape." And it's certainly better than "Conquest" and, especially, "Battle."The bottom line is that Tim Burton's remake of "Planet of the Apes" is a worthwhile addition to your apes film collection. For serious "Apes" fans it's even mandatory because, even though -- OVERALL -- it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original (or "Beneath"), it has numerous singular aspects that surpass it.GRADE: C+ or B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, one of the central plot elements of the original was that the humans couldn't speak. The second I realized that element of the plot had been changed, I knew it was going to be a pretty rough ride. The capper comes when Marky Mark climbs into a space vehicle which has apparently been sitting out in the desert for hundreds or thousands of years. He tears a six inch layer of dust and crud from the front of a computer console, which, miraculously, still works perfectly. Puh-leeze. The ending was senseless and idiotic, it quite frankly insulted my intelligence, as did the entire film, for that matter. I absolutely hated this movie, I had high expectations going in and felt ripped off after sitting through this weak effort.</fullReview>

This was below the quality of ANY of the original sequels, or even the horrid series. It was awful, tedious, ugly, and disgusting.Who ever told Mark Wahlberg that he is an actor?This is just a continuation of a Hollywood trend, and I can't wait until it's over. Create trashy versions of classic movies, then market the hell out of them so people buy. My local rental place has a whole rack full of this movie, and only two or three copies of good movies.Don't actually rent this movie, wait until it's on broadcast TV then watch it just to laugh at how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start off with what was good about this movie. It did have a fair amount of humor, both intentional and otherwise, and can be tolerated for that. However, the good can't hold a candle to the bad, so here goes:SPOILER WARNING!!!The set and clothing design is a mishmash of pieces from all over the world, with a few trendy designs straight from Paris fashion tossed in. The result is a schizophrenic collage rather than a common look.(Greek/Roman style armor on the bad guy, Hindu/Buddhist religious instruments, etc.)The humans talk.The main human is a very hot fashion model who somehow keeps her perfect hair despite being raised as a savage. Wait a minute that happened in the first movie, never mind.The apes aren't apes, they're funny looking people, which Tim Burton plays up in endless cameos.The time travel (and finale) of the story makes no sense, and doesn't even try to.Nuclear fuel cells don't last forever, and neither do computers buried in a few thousand years worth of dried mud.The bad guy WWWAAAAYYYYY overdoes it. The rolling eyes and leering stance gets old quick. Take some decaff there, chump.Helena Bonham Carter as a human rights activist is little more than a thinly disguised modern liberal. Michael Clarke Duncan is a nice guy but he can't act worth a flip.Basically this movie made me feel most of the time like I was watching a comic book, with none of the introspection and drama of the original.</fullReview>

There is simply nothing here-- no characters worth watching, no plot worth following, no steel cables wherewith to suspend our disbelief. A suggestion to the crop of producers and directors currently engaged in picking over the cadavers of the 1960s and 1970s: how's about you guys come up with something *new* instead of leeching off the success of works far better than yours? If you're thinking of renting this, see if you can find a tape of MST3K's "Time of the Apes." You'll have a better time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's worst, by a long shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Tim Burton. I like where he's coming from, and he shares much of the same taste as me: a liking for the offbeat, the Gothic, a love for the Hammer horrors of old. But his films are a mixed bag and for every great one (MARS ATTACKS, ED WOOD) there are ones that leave me ice cold (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, ALICE IN WONDERLAND).My favourite Burton film is SWEENEY TODD, so it may be that I get on better with the ones aimed at adults rather than kids. Sadly, his PLANET OF THE APES remake is aimed purely at kids, and in fact there's no material that ever goes above the intellectual level of your average 4 year old. And if ever there was a film that didn't need remaking, it was PLANET OF THE APES! Everything goes wrong with this picture, and I mean everything. The muddled, dumb-ass script which never goes beyond characters running from A to B, then B to C, and so on for what feels like hours and hours. The ridiculous-looking apes, never menacing for a second and looking more dated now than the ones from the original back in the '60s. Burton's clear disinterest in the material, as evinced by his mundane direction. Wahlberg's embarrassingly wooden performance, or Bonham Carter's embarrassingly mannered one.It's all a great shame, in that it wastes money and the talents of lots of interesting supporting cast members whose skills could have been put towards something more genuine and original. Instead this is one of the worst films I've witnessed in a while, a truly abominable production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looks like a bunch of hack writers took a dump on a screenplay, and then Tim Burton filmed it. You can't call this intelligent sci-fi, it is too generic and moronic for that. The ending is clearly trying to one-up the ending in the original film, but it makes absolutely no sense. At least the ending in the original film A) Explained the history of the planet and B) Left you with a powerful message. This "remake" is a waste of time for everyone involved, and a waste of money for anyone who shelled out $8 to see it.Don't get me wrong. I like Tim Burton. But since ED WOOD, he hasn't made a decent film. He's lost his touch big time, and this film is the prime example. Mark Wahlberg has been good in other movies, but here he is a joke. And that Estella Warren chick -- How does she get acting jobs? The special effects weren't bad but this film has no style, no substance, only flash and glitter and some bad dialogue. This is not a movie anyone will remember fondly twenty years from now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Elfman oompahs and we are off! Lots of jumping and screeching later we are released, and nothing whatever sticks.Here's the thing: Burton is an art director, not a `real' director. He can create a `feel' when he's cooking. Forget the story, the actors altogether. That feel can stick. The less he has to work with, the better he seems to do. Here, he has a lot and delivers... almost nothing. No real notion of an alternative world, certainly not `dark' as his publicity machine would have it. And that's despite the costumes.Two interesting actors though. Ms Carter has a lovely face, which really can work against her. In `Merlin,' she had a few scenes with `ugly' prosthetics, and her character came alive for those few moments. Here, she gets to act without the burden of her physical instrument. She's pretty intelligent, and it is interesting to see what she's worked out with her sort of face puppet.Quit different is Tim Roth. he has always been a full body actor in the tradition of grand theater. He's ask to snarl a lot. Subtract that out, and you see his own solution. Guildenstern writ large.Bad news when the film is so lacking, one spends ones time figuring out just what the actor is thinking under all that rubber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plan?te Des Singes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Revisiting this film 13 years later makes me wonder why I hated it. I found this in MovieBox on my i-Pad. Loaded it up, fired up AirServer and streamed it into my main Media PC, then I sat back and got absorbed by this story like I never have been.And I actually enjoyed it - I first saw this when it came out, thinking it was a pompous bloated misrepresentation of the original. Mainly I hated Mark "Stumbling Rock Star" Wahlberg- But since then I have seen him in a few roles that suited him, especially his character from "The Departed".So I think that is what I had to get past, my initial distaste for an actor I didn't know. I don't know why I didn't like him, I just wasn't familiar with him.Compared to other Tim Burton films, this one keeps the Camp level down compared to "Sleepy Hollow" or "Mars Attacks" - He returns to the Grimness of "Batman". Burton approaches this as pure Science Fiction and treats it with more respect than "Mars Attacks". In fact, compared to Mars Attacks, this is a serious movie.In 1963 Pierre Boulle, author of "Bridge on the River Kwai" wrote a book called "La Plan?te Des singes" aka "Monkey Planet", which is told 3rd- person to a kinky space-faring couple who find a manuscript in a bottle floating in space. That story was the basis for the 1968 film and some of the events in the sequels. One of the aspects of Space Travel used in that 1963 novel was the prospect of Time Dilation, in which time moves more rapidly on Earth than it does for Travelers moving at relativistic speeds. This was used heavily in this film as Wahlberg's monkey's pod gets sucked into a Wormhole and the Ship he is on starts seeing transmissions from all times instantaneously. But we see later that it is just not the "Time Barrier" that gets crossed, some heavy Alternate Realities are taking place.This 2001 film returns to some of the original aspects of the book, in that respect, it is not as grim an ending as the 1968 version- So the whole surprise ending of the Heston version is missing- However, the ending of this film is based on the ending of the book.As far as the "Planet of the Apes" in this film, it looks good, the CGI is great and does not look phony, and Tim Roth is one nasty piece of work. The "Nova" character is played by Lisa Marie but not as a Major Character, in fact they made Nova a Chimp in this one. The Hero's Squeeze is played by Estelle Warren, "Daena". The Ape Prosthetics are very well made and it is difficult to see Helena Bonham-Carter as a Chimp or Michael Clarke Duncan as an Ape. But Tim Roth's "Thade" is a piece of slimy business and perfect casting. Not to mention Charleton Heston's Final Cameo and statement that denounces his own beloved NRA.We have no modern day Rod Serlings to write scripts, but I think this script has given several nods to his work.I think this is one of those films like "Bringing up Baby" that is appreciated more and more years after it's release, as Bringing up Baby is considered to be the classic example of slapstick comedy, this film will have a place in the Film Vaults- Visually it is astounding, it's not at all like any of Tim Burton's other work of the time. Maybe this is why it did not go over that well, just like 2001's "Evolution" with David Duchovny, which also was not appreciated that year, but today has been picking up fans who realize just how funny it really is.Ultimately, time is the final judge, not box office figures or the ratings of Websites that no longer exist. Nor does it matter that 1,350 bad reviews of this were posted on IMDb, many of those made by one person. As far as this movie goes, it is worth it to go back and revisit. But when it comes to "Planet of the Apes" versus "The Phantom Menace" I choose BOTH versions of Planet of the Apes. I can find all kinds of good reasons why this is a much better movie than all three Star Wars prequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Planet of the Apes is a deserving classic with basis in creative spins on theories of evolution and de-evolution.It was a perfect blend of science and fiction that captivated the imagination of audiences, who left the theater with a feeling of awe and wonder that few films manage to inspire.Millions of minds were seeded with a lifetime of ideas and questions of our existence, just as well as they were served pure entertainment in an exciting space-adventure with talking monkeys.33 years and several sequels later the world is still fascinated enough to give Tim Burton a chance at diluting the original concept, and what a job he did.Words fail when trying to describe the shallowness suffered when two hours of a viewers life are lost to this stupidity.The deepest thought presented is that apes playing cards would have four sleeves to cheat with instead of two.If going by the assumption that the true level of a director can be judged by their worst efforts, it can only be determined that Tim Burton is a huge hack.How fitting that it was he who made the movie about Ed Wood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton is a favorite director of mine. So I went into this film expecting great things. I have to give this version points for make up and set design. But what it really needed was a better script, and an ending that makes sense.Minor spoiler ahead.Don't rent this expecting even a close copy of the original movie - no Dr. Zaus, no Statue of Liberty ending. And yes, there are a few jumps in logic. I'm still trying to figure how the burnt out remain of a space ship magically turn into a plasma cannon. Or how a tiny one man spaceship can travel from beyond Jupiter to Earth in about 30 seconds.Oh yes, Charlton Heston as an ape who fears human weapons. Ho Hum.And the ending? Don't get me started. My guess is the screenwriter wanted something as dramatic as the Statue of Liberty ending, but couldn't because it's clear from the start that this isn't Earth. So the ending doesn't make any sense. It's almost laughable.Tim Burton said in an interview that there will be no sequel. I hope he sticks to his word.My advise, rent the original and the sequels. They're much more fun.</fullReview>

First of all, the acting was so bad that they seemed to have rushed the shooting of the film. The makeup? not all that. I thought the female apes didnt even look like apes. Helena Bonham Carter was supposed to look attractive, but The art Director should have done a better job. I enjoyed one thing about this movie, and that was the performance of Tim Roth as General Thade. I give this movie 1 star because of his role and Charlton Heston playing the dying father of Thade was a nice touch, but overall this movie stunk. Dont purchase it, instead buy the original movie if your not a planet of the apes fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has excelled with delightfully quirky camp films, such as 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure', off the beaten track comedies like 'Beetlejuice' and wonderful children's claymation flicks such as 'A Nightmare Before Christmas'. His first foray into the big time, 'Batman', continued to show Burton's very unique perspective within his movie making idiom. I'm sad to report that his latest film, 'Planet of the Apes', has betrayed all that Burton has ever worked for.Apes doesn't work on so many levels that after having watched it I felt emotionally drained and devoid of the usual enthusiasm I have felt after watching Burton's other films. It's really ironic that the movie doesn't work considering that the make-up and costumes are unbelievably well-wrought, the acting is pleasing (particularly Bonham-Carter and Roth...but a special pan should be included for Markie-Marks' drab work), the special effects are visually appealing and the score is typically excellent Elfman fare. But the sum of the parts do not equal a comprehensively satisfying whole in this case, as the boring and typically Hollywood script seems to tie the actors and the director down tightly within the formulaic mold.I suppose this is why I'm so disappointed with Burton. He seems to have accepted the fact that he is now an ensconced member of the big-budget Hollywood blockbuster milieu, which also means he has become willing to compromise his art. Will this big bomb of a movie lead to more big-budget crud from Burton, or will he come back with something new, wonderful and most importantly independent in nature? Perhaps he'll take the big bucks he earned as director on Apes and put it into a meaningful project...how redeeming that would be. Please consider returning to your roots, Tim...and reject 'Planet of the Apes II'!</fullReview>

The ending did not at all fit with the rest of the story, and now begs the question, "how could that have happened?" I tried to give this movie some seriousness--I tried to think of ways to explain the ending, but they all have Saturn-sized holes in them. Oh, well.

I really wanted to reserve judgement on what I THOUGHT would be a better movie than what I was presented with. The problem is the Apes. Word to the Production, the Apes become TOO HUMAN and that is only ONE of MANY flaws. Damn Boring ridiculous plot! exceptionally boring! if you want that level of reality than for goodness sake have a F****** Story to tell!Tom:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No offense to you Planet of the Apes fans, but I expected a little more out of this one. If your going to remake a movie, then you need to attempt to make it even better then the original. Mark Wahlberg is a very talented actor, but was not the best to play the character he played in the movie. I thought this one along with Ishtar was probably one of the most un-necessary movies in film history. I mean c'mon, that's like making a Problem Child 3!</fullReview>

I have to say the make-up effects were pretty good.-Except Helena who really does look like Michael Jackson. I have to say the feeling of physically powerful apes came over very well. Acting was so-so. But I really missed a good battle scene. I thought the included scene was pretty short and pathetic. And then, like a lot before me have said...The ending....What ??? How ???

		<shortDescription>A visually spectacular action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I love this movie and cannot understand why so many other people disliked it. I respect the original for what it was but this version directed by Tim Burton is visually spectacular and exceeds expectations.Nobody creates a fanciful world like Burton can and there is no better duo than Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. The costumes for the apes are incredible with intricate details that look very realistic. The sheer enormity of the sets makes you realise how much energy and passion went into creating this film.I love all the action, and the special effects still seem remarkable even after more than 10 years has past. Sometimes people can't move past the original but if you have never seen the 1968 version then I think you will enjoy this movie. Also it is perfect to watch again now that the new planet of the apes movie series has started to be released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's rendition about known story of an astronaut crashes on a far planet and finds a simian civilization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inferior remake from first and best of the primates series ; despite time passed the original energy remains and resulted to be an agreeable fantasy ; however this re-imagination of the tale looks more to the original novel by Pierre Boulle , titled ¨Monkey planet¨, that it does to 1968 Franklyn J. Schaffner rendition . It deals with an Air Force astronaut , Captain Leo Davison ( Mark Wahlberg) crashes lands on a mysterious planet where evolved, talking apes dominant a race of primitive humans . As he encounters a culture where the simians rule over humans . Later on , he discovers humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts . Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum . He escapes , being accompanied by a gorgeous native (Estella Warren) and with the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari (Helna Boham Carter) and a small band of human rebels (Eric Avari , Kris Kristofferson) . Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Simian Army led by brutal General Thade (Tim Roth) and his most brave commandant Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) . Now humans and simians are on to reach a dark secret within the Forbidden Zone .This is a retelling from classic and energetic science-fiction movie with metaphysical significance and reflexion about origin of human being, though also packs action, adventures , intrigue , satisfying brisk pace and entertainment . This known story provides full of sour and intelligent references to first adaptation but doesn't have its sense of political commentary , neither sociological implications . The picture delivers enough energy and results to be a passable flick full of action , battles and suspense ; however it is light-years ahead of original . Mark Wahlberg as an action man takes the Charlton Heston character but without his charisma , neither impressive screen presence . Tim Roth stands out as a furious militarist with loathing for all human beings . Helena Bonham Carter excels as a clever as well as sensitive simian . Remaining cast formed by enjoyable players playing as Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice . Superb makeup courtesy of Rick Baker creates realistic pseudo-simians of Paul Giamatti , Michael Clarke Duncan , David Warner , Chris Ellis , Lisa Marie , Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, and even Charlton Heston who appears as an old primate , a feeling homage to classic flick in which gave one of his more plausible acting . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and colorful cinematography by Philippe Rousselot . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Danny Elffman , it's full of fury and sound .The motion picture was professionally directed by Tim Burton , using a great visual sense but with no originality . Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are the followings : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" (1970) by Ted Post with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series , such as 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes' (73, J.Lee Thompson) . And recently , ¨Rise of the Planet of the Apes¨ (2011) by Rupert Wyatt with James Franco , John Lightow , Freida Pinto , Andy Serkis and preparing ¨Dawn of the Planet of Apes¨ (2013-2014) by Matt Reeves with Judy Greer , Gary Oldman , Keri Russell and Jason Clarke .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent enough remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes starts in the near future of 2029 where Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is stationed on the Oberon orbiting a distant planet, a huge space station where Leo looks after the genetically altered Apes who perform test flights. The Oberon detects an electromagnetic storm &amp; sends a Chimp out in a space pod to collect data but the Oberon loses contact with the pod &amp; Leo pilots a pod himself to go after it, Leo also flies into the electro magnetic &amp; travels far into the future where he crash lands on the planet only to find that talking human like Apes are the dominant species &amp; rule the planet while any humans are treated like animals &amp; enslaved. Leo is captured &amp; manages to convince human sympathiser Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) to help him escape, however the evil General Thade (Tim Roth) hates all humans &amp; wants to kill them all &amp; after learning of Leo's origins h sets out to hunt down &amp; kill him before he leads a human uprising against the Apes...Directed by Tim Burton this big budget remake of the sci-fi classic Planet of the Apes (1968) completes my Planet of the Apes double bill today, I watched the original &amp; then less than an hour later I watched this remake which I believe Burton actually described as a re-imagining rather than a straight remake &amp; I have to say I enjoyed both films, sure the original is maybe the slightly more intelligent &amp; better film overall but this remake is none to shabby despite a more shallow script &amp; a baffling twist ending. I mean I think the ending is supposed to evoke memories of the original classic Statue of Liberty twist ending by again including a instantly recognisable world renowned iconic monument but no matter how many times you think about it or how many explanations you can come up with it doesn't make a blind bit of sense &amp; will leave most of us scratching our heads in confusion. Again based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle this remake follows the original's basic first half premise fairly closely, astronaut crash lands on a planet where traditional roles are reversed as Apes are the dominant species &amp; man considered the mere animal before all sorts of religious &amp; moral issues raise their heads, this doesn't have the biting satire of the original &amp; the moralist is kept to a minimum &amp; dumbed down somewhat but at least it's still there in some form. The second half of the two films is where they differ the most with a huge battle between Apes &amp; humans here &amp; an A to B trek across the forbidden zone, there's a bit of comedy relief here as well while the main villains are different as the original it was a superstitious scientist &amp; here it's a power mad General warmonger. The general idea that all Apes are afraid of water is also a stretch &amp; the way our heroes escape hundreds of Apes is to simply cross a stream since they can't follow. The ending is also different with a definite answer to the origin of the Apes &amp; their history. This remake places heavier emphasis on action &amp; adventure than the original too which is fine I suppose as it's nicely done.Like the original 1968 version the make-up effects are outstanding here, even better in fact with some fantastic Ape make-up that just looks so realistic &amp; utterly convincing as you can even make out details of the actors face beneath the mask's. The CGI computer effects are alright, there are one or two dodgy ones but nothing too major. The fights &amp; action scenes are cool with particular detail given to the Apes like mannerism &amp; movements which look great on screen, unlike the original the Apes here actually act like Apes as the swing in trees, leap high in the air, write with their feet &amp; run on all fours into battle. The tone of the film is also darker than the original with creepy jungles &amp; dark Ape cities.With a supposed $100,000,000 budget (almost twenty times that of the original made just over thirty years previous) this looks great as it should with great effects, sets &amp; production values. The acting is good although Walhberg is given virtually nothing to do while Tim Roth makes for a good bad guy &amp; original star Charlton Heston has a cameo as Roth's father. Kris Kristofferson has a small role as does David Warner.Planet of the Apes is a decent enough remake to a classic sci-fi film, having seen both in the space of a few hours I can honestly say I liked both of them &amp; while seeing similarities between them I could also see differences too. Maybe not as good a film as the original but this is still a worthwhile watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen the original, I was forced to judge this movie on its basic credibility alone. I get the feeling that being attached to the star of its namesake is why it saw theatrical release at all. This thing was mind-numbing. The characters made no sense, the plot was inane, and the science was terrible. You can only watch so many scenes of monkeys jumping on each other and pounding. That's basically the whole film, briefly interrupted by scenes of Mark Wahlberg trying to look heroic. The special effects are pretty good, but that's like wrapping up feces in a pretty gift box.

It made so little sense that I threw the DVD into space, hoping that it would travel through time a few times, and give me an idea of what happened in the film.Unfortunately I doubt there is any logical reason as to why the earth became controlled by Apes.I was never quite sure what year he was in, or what planet he was on, so I assumed -at first- that the ending made sense. Of course this later obviously became disproven. All in all there was no need for:Most of the ApesMost of the HumansThe ending</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened to catch "Planet of the Apes" on PPV last night. I was quite excited because I had missed my chance at the box office. Boy am I glad I didn't waste my money buying a ticket. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no plot, no character motivation, no life, no story thru-line to carry the picture and the ending is so bad, it reeks of a low-budget, straight-to-video, sci-fi flick. I am a HUGE fan of Tim Burton and I think he is one of the most brilliant directors Hollywood has to offer. In fact, "Sleepy Hollow", in my opinion, is his best film to date. But POTA is a film that could best be described as never-should've-happened. Why does Hollywood see the need to remake classic, highly rated films and turn them into pure trash? This is one film that should NOT have been remade or reimagined or whatever you wish to call it. Why can't Hollywood remake films that were terrible when they were FIRST released instead of doing things the other way around??? The screenplay for this film is drenched with cheesy dialogue. (In one scene, David Warner tells his daughter, Helena Bohnam Carter to wash her hands before dinner after she has been touching humans!!!) The writers saw fit to throw every kind of silly convention of humor that one could relate to humans and apes at the screen and expected us to eat it up. This is one viewer who wishes he could make the writers eat their own words!!! Save you money and rent something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone care to tell me where they got the horses from? Were there horses on the ship when it crashed? Were there gorillas? Hmm, I don't seem to remember them being there... Not that gorillas could leap 30 feet into the air anyway. And someone find me that computer - it can tell what the year is even through a time-warp!So we go through this horrid excuse for a movie not really ever knowing the names of more than maybe 3 characters - I managed to pick up 2. And to boot, Estella Warren has like 10 lines in the movie - she's basically Darth Maul all over again, but with a supermodel body instead of a lightsaber. Character development, which is crucial to any good story, is completely lacking - some characters sort of get a real cheesy and formulaic revelation near the end, but the hero and antagonist stay the exact same throughout the whole movie.Sure, everyone's saying "well, they were up against a lot when they decided to re-make an old classic," which is true, but they didn't make a good movie - they just took the standard sci-fi / horror / action movie plotline and put apes in the place of villans. It's a formula and it's really really sad, and regardless of what movie they're trying to remake, going with the standard formula will satisfy the masses, but it won't ever be a "good" movie.</fullReview>

I don't know what Burton was trying to do with Walhberg and Carter, that subplot was really stupid specially when Walhberg has Warren right in front of him. Remember Walhberg is supposed to like human women since he is from earth and he does have regular woman choices not just monkeys.

It's hard to say if it was better, I'd say, they are almost on different grounds, due to the Special FX we had in the 60's and the stuff we got now. So that changes a lot, but it's not just the FX, the story is great, it keeps you guessing, and near the end, you just..don't know what to expect, I didn't and I read about the ending on the net anyway. This was defiantly a "Re-Imagining" not a "Re-make" This is so different than the first. In fact, I don't even know what the heck the ending was about, was it earth, was it another planet...I swear, you think about the ending to this movie for more than 5 minutes, your head will explode. But all I can say is, this movie rocks, great acting, awesome story, sweet plot, I'm just stoked for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 POTA in-depth Review!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people think that the original 1967 Planet of the Apes is a classic and a master piece. Sure its one heck of a film especially back in the day when it was made. It had great costumes and makeup with great music by Jerry Goldsmith and a tremendous shocking end. This Planet of the Apes has awesome costumes and very realistic makeup and/or masks. The music is outstanding by Danny Elfman and the 2001 version has even a more shocking end. It seems to Me many people are against or hate this POTA. I really don't know why, it has such an interesting cast and they play their parts very well and sure it may not be director Tim Burton's darkest film but in My opinion it is one heck of movie! The way I see the film it has a lot of emotion and all of the characters are so likable. I'll try to explain this as best as I can about Helena Bonham Carter is a very good looking woman and her character Ari is beautiful. I know she is under tons of makeup and looks very realistic as an ape but whenever she is on screen I can't help but think how neat she is with her voice and personality. Tim Roth's Thade is an awesome character and his character deserves a lot more credit. Roth's performance is truly menacing. Charlton Heston put on another solid performance as Thade's father. Another thing that gets into this movie so much is the music. Each scene is so great with the fantastic score! Below is in My opinions an in-depth look at most of the characters that is in the 2001 Planet of the Apes!-------------Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo Davidson - Leo Davidson, after the incident of going after Pericles he is stranded on another world thanks to a magnetic storm. The planet he lands on has unbelievable talking apes. He is prisoner but after Ari frees him he gets to know her and her mentor, Krull and some other humans. He joins these two different factions of intelligent species and travels to the forbidden area Calima! Leo is out for himself and to go back home as soon as he can!Tim Roth as General Thade - The great General Thade, a mighty warrior who is afraid of nothing. His mean voice sends shivers down his soldiers back and he hates humans to death!Thade and Ari were once in a relationship but now Ari has other things to do. He loves his father Zaius very much and he is very saddened about his father's illness. Helena Bonham Carter as Ari - She is a beautiful ape and very intelligent as well. She helps Leo escape. She is through with Thade and even though she has feelings for Leo even though he is human. She loves Krull as he is her mentor and in fact he is with Ari all the way with her,Leo,and other escapees from the city.Michael Clarke Duncan as Colonel Attar - The huge Attar is a force to reckon with! He is General Thade's great warrior and best friend. He is a very religious and serious ape.Paul Giamatti as Limbo - The always funny Limbo loves to smell and look good. The human keeper if you will takes his job seriously but when he is forced to follow the escapees his life turns around. Estella Warren as Daena - One of the many prisoners in Ape City,Daena wants out just as much as everyone else but when she meets up with Leo and escapes with the group she has feelings for him but much like he does for Ari he doesn't think much of it. She loves her father Karubi very much and she is shocked and very sad about his death.Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull - The massive Krull was one of the greatest warriors and a brave leader. He is the mentor of Ari and he is one of the apes who is in the escaped group. His favorite weapons are swords and handles them excellently!David Warner as Senator Sandar - Ari's father, Senator Sandar let Thade have control. He is an ape that believes in manners such as washing hands. He tries not to get on Thade's case and he loves his daughter Ari.Kris Kristofferson as Karubi - The father of Daena,Karubi loves his daughter very much. He is a brave human man but his death in a fight against Attar didn't last long and he never knew what hit him from behind which it was General Thade.Thade's sword decapitated him.Erick Avari as Tival - The male house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Luke Eberl as Birn - A stubborn teenager, Birn is a brave young man.Evan Dexter Parke as Gunnar - Another escaped male human. He too is brave.Glenn Shadix as Senator Nado - The great senator Nado. He loves his job and his mate!Freda Foh Shen as Bon - The female house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Chris Ellis as Lt. General Karl Vasich - Leader of the Oberon.When the magnetic storm caused malfuctions in the ship a video image played on the monitor. Little does he know that what he just saw was himself in the future!Anne Ramsay as Lt. Col. Grace Alexander - She really cared for the modern day apes in the Oberon.Lisa Marie as Nova - Senator Nado's mate. She is very attractive for an ape and she is always worried about her looks.Linda Harrison as Woman in Cart - Could it be possible that this woman was on another planet at another time or in another lifetime? Could it be that she is reincarnated?Charlton Heston as Zaius,Thade's Father - Thade's father is very ill. Before he passes he wants to make sure to tell and show his son the shocking truth about humans.---------------I just like how everything is in the film. The ending may have been rushed and not make sense to others because it really had several endings but Burton could only pick one. In fact you can also tell as great as the music is if you listen closely some of the tracks are alternatives than the released music on the CD. Also a short time before the final release of the film the producers wanted the movie to be more epic than it was and they wanted it to be like or more like Gladiator and back to the music they wanted the composer Danny Elfman to change the music. I thought it was silly for the movie makers to do that and I am glad it came out the way it did even if the ending is sad and is a mistake or an error. I hope you have enjoyed this in-depth look at Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. Like I said I love the 2001 version!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton adds his original vision to Planet of the Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was blown away with how well Burton adapted this movie. I guess adapted isn't even the right word. He basically re-worked the whole thing. The main ideas and some of the most important visuals are there, but the story is quite different. Planet of the Apes has gone from a hokey cult movie to an amazing science fiction vision of the future. But it's not only the effects and costuming that are much better. Burton has created a chilling yet realistic version of what apes might evolve to. The way they move, their facial expressions, the behavior. Everything is really well thought out. I don't know what others were expecting, but I though this movie really delivered great acting, great effects, and a nice story adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton and the Apes--the commentary and documentaries were excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just love movies that have director commentaries and this one certainly didn't disappoint. Apparently, Burton decided to do this commentary at the very last minute, and, have no doubt, the spontaneous accounts from the fevered mind of Tim Burton are something to behold. It truly gives you an idea of the intricacies that went into crafting each scene of this visual feast.Some highlights from the commentary include Burton talking about what it was like to work with real apes. He said, 'you get this weird vibe from having a relationship with apes. There's a definite connection between humans and apes but its weird, so primal, and so shocking.' Burton's comments reminded me of what Michael Aped, director of Gorilla's in the Mist, had said about working with apes. He said there were many times when he thought there was a real person staring at him and when he turned to see who it was, it had been an ape. He said the experience was eerie, yet fascinating.Burton also talked a lot about this idea of his version of Planet of the Apes being a circular thing. About everything coming back to the beginning or the middle or something. I couldn't quite understand fully what he was talking about, however, it reminded me of Joni Mitchell's Circle of Life song. Oh well,...a creative mind like Tim Burtons is not to be completely understood, only enjoyed.Anyway, the movie is great and Tim Burton's commentary makes the DVD spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marky Mark's Low Riser Ape Extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Seriously, it has some good aspects. I liked Roth's Thade, the man may be a midget but he is an excellent actor. Please, watch Little Odessa where he dominates other greats like Schell and Redgrave. Here, other than Giamatti, he is on his own. His performance is why I own this movie, reluctantly I might add. Carter tries, not all of her scenes are bad, she has a few that are dreadful. The two leads, Marky Mark and Deer in the Headlights lady are painful. The other major problem is misanthropy so dark it makes Kubrick look like Roddenberry's Star Trek. Yes, we expect Thade to hate humans but how about Marky? "We do a lot worse to our own species." Yes, all through the movie Marky's low risers are telling us what pieces of crap we all are and how we are the worst thing since Velveeta Cheese. Please, Heston, in a cameo as Thade's pop chimes in with 1968's refrain: "Their ingenuity is equaled only by their cruelty, damn them all to hell." All through the movie, Apes and humans alike, including our putative protagonist are giving an interminable seminar on how badly humans suck. Look, when I think it is too misanthropic, you are in real trouble. The point is, how does this work? Humans are dog poop, now, please root for this group of humans? See, this creates some thematic problems, I was cheering for Thade and he's supposed to be the villain; I wasn't the only one either. Then, there is the matter of the last half hour which seems to have been written by someone just mastering a flush toilet. Yes, the engine fires, blows them two stories in the air then runs out of fuel. Why? They wake up, Thade is about to demonstrate what we all knew about the inside of Marky's skull and we get a painful Deus Ex Machina moment, bringing the battle to a screeching halt. They think it is Simos and begin worshiping him, we know it is the direction impaired chimp from the beginning. Small pockets goes into the smashed ship where Thade whales on him, fights with Marky demonstrating he needs gun training (Note to fans of Dawn). Yes, you really cannot just pick those up and be a SEAL, believe it or not. The narrative here is so bizarre, incoherent and disjointed. The battle comes to a screeching halt for the ape deity, not really, then Thade gets locked in a closet. I never minded the Twilight Zone ending if we had a proper lead in to it. The twenty minutes before the ending, that's the problem. When I saw this in a theater, people were laughing when the monkey landed, including a couple of loud,"OMG, give me a freaking break." See, it is such a painful contrivance rivaling Logan's Run, with Logan melting down the computer with an inconsistency in his testimony. Yes, Warner and Heston were good as was Duncan but all these are tiny roles. When Thade isn't on the screen you are left with Marky and his inflection-less, bored reading. His tone shows no more modulation when he is facing death then when he is speaking conversationally. Hey, this isn't the first movie he wiped out; check out, The Corrupter or The Happening, he did serious damage there also. I own the movie for Roth's Thade and Giamatti's corrupt human seller both are good performances. The misanthropy is so bleak here that it makes identification with our human protagonists utterly impossible. The seminar goes the length of the movie often from our supposed hero. See, if you tell me what pieces of crap people are, and, let me check, you are a human, I lose interest and identify with Thade. As bad as the movie is, it could be salvaged. Just rewrite it, dump the non stop crapping on humans, jettison Marky, and fix the last half hour, please. If you are a Roth fan, buy the movie he gives a great performance that is the sole reason I own this movie. If you hate Roth, as I see here, some think he is a midget, well, he is a good acting midget; if not, do not buy the movie, you will hate it. On the whole, though I own all the Ape movies, this one was a difficult purchase. You better really like The Planet Of The Apes' movies. The misanthropy, the bad acting and the excruciating last half hour made this movie sink like an anvil at the box office. Burton was all set to remake the whole series, this took care of that. For all its many flaws, a couple of the original series, especially Battle, were worse. He does have his underwear pulled up here, that's a start. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake, but it could have done much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2001 remake of the original 1968 classic, "PLANET of the APES" is directed by Tim Burton and starring Mark Wahlberg as the lead character and since I'm only doing three of the PLANET of the APES film reviews, I decided to start off with this one.The sixth film produced in the Planet of the Apes franchise, it was loosely adapted from Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel of the same name and the 1968 film version. It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion. The film also stars Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella WarrenDevelopment for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised.The story is a little confusing, but it is easy to look at for me, but for everyone else, a lot of people and critics and also fans of the franchise hates this story and the ending. The ending is just confusing also, but it's easy to overlook these two major flaws.The music by Danny Elfman is just awesome and the song that plays during the end credits titled, "Rule the Planet Remix" is awesome, mixed by Paul Oakenfold and composed by Danny Elfman. The rest of the music including the opening theme music is just spectacular and the film does wonders with the music.The visual effects and makeup is just spectacular also, but Rick Baker did the prosthetic make-up effects for the apes and it is a blessing of him. The visuals are a little cheesy, but works for this type of movie.The acting, is just good and bad. The only credit that will be given to is Mark Wahlberg, his performance as the lead was amazing. Helena Bonham Carter, Estella Warren and Michael Clarke Duncan puts on really good performances as well, but they can get way too over-the- top in some of the scenes. Paul Giamatti is hilarious and he does an amazing job. Luke Eberl and Erick Avari is in the film, too, but they're performances were a little confusing. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dad. Tim Roth plays the villain, Thade and he is okay, but even then, he is over-the-top as well.Overall, with the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, it's not a bad re-imagining, but it could have done much better than this. I like and hate this remake of the 1968 original classic.Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I wanted to like this movie because I was such a fan of the original 1968 sci-fi classic I just couldn't. This was bad on so many levels that even the updated special effects and makeup couldn't save it. Charlton Heston's cameo was probably the best part "damn them all to hell!" So what we have here is Tim Burton reimagining the classic story with mixed results. It is visually stunning and Mark Wahlberg does the best he can as Astronaut Leo Davidson, who takes an abrupt detour while on a routine reconnaissance mission in 2029, landing him on a strange planet where talking apes rule with an iron fist over a race of primitive humans.Helena Bonham Carter plays the sympathetic chimpanzee activist in this version with Tim Roth as General Thade, the leader of the gorilla army. A lotta horses in this movie and a dumb, drawn out final battle. All this did was make me want to watch the original again.08.13</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The script kills the whole thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I recently started to get into the Planet Of The Apes series, I liked Dawn and the original but I didn't really like the second one mainly because of the ending. I decided "Okay if by this point the series was just going to keep doing this I'll be safe and go to the Tim Burton remake" and... while it's not an entirely bad movie it leaves a lot to be desired.So basically the movie is about how Mark Whalberg plays an astronaut that decides to travel into the unknown to save their test chimpanzee and he crash-lands on a planet... I'm not going to tell you what he finds there because it's in the title. Treated a little more like a slave then the "He's an animal" thing the original was going for, he - along with an ape named Ari, a few more humans and Ari's... bodyguard or something. They decide to fight for their own share of the world rather then being slaves.Now my biggest problem with the movie is that the movie makes things obvious from the get-go. I mean Tim Roth plays the bad guy and I swear, he delivers all his lines as a snarling, angry, obviously evil bad guy. I don't see how that character in the Ape world or otherwise could have gotten a position of authority. And with Ari, instead of in the original (I'm not comparing... well, I am - I'm just citing a movie that does this better) of "Wait a minute these humans might not be what we thought" it's obvious from the start with almost every second line being that.Another complaint I have is the pacing. It just goes slow and all over the place. I wouldn't mind if there was something to ground in it like in the original with the discussion of evolution vs faith but there's barely that in it either. It goes on for an hour and fifty four minutes but I feel that there isn't enough in what's going on to keep me interested in the plot or characters and a little too much to be explained.And the icing on the cake is the ending. It's trying to top Rod Serling in a twist ending, which may not have been easy to top but where Whalberg ends up is an Earth that is overrun by monkeys where everything else is the same. Okay, SUPPOSE if you are to tell me that he ends up in an alternate world where this happens then this scene is not foreshadowed. It's like "Bang! Monkey planet" which warrants nothing on first viewing other then saying it makes no sense. Which if they didn't consider the alternate world possibility, it doesn't.Okay, I'm going to say it. I LOVE the visuals of this movie. The make-up is done by Rick Baker, so you know the Apes are going to look fantastic. It actually overshadows the Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes effects. I could rave on about this make-up for literally days on end. Add to the fact that you have Tim Burton, arguably one of the directors with more visually appealing movies then on a strictly visual term, it's probably one of the better movies of the 2000's, As I said - only on a strictly visual term.So while there is a lot to harp on about this movie. It isn't entirely awful. I think this movie should have been great. Just seeing some of the sets and make-up made me know that there was a lot of time and effort put into this but I just think that it should have had a much stronger script before release, maybe if they did that then we would have probably had a movie that would be considered a great sci-fi classic alongside the original. But sadly, we have this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing effort to relaunch good series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has made quite a lot of good movies, but none of them would ever give you the idea he would be the director best suited to direct a "Planet of the Apes"-remake. His style of filmmaking pretty much couldn't be further from what was needed here.The film abandons just about every detail from Pierre Boulle's original book. At the start of the movie, Wahlberg's character, Davidson, is working on a space station, and he is involved with experiments with primates. While the back-story behind this seems interesting, you don't get to know much about it because not long into the movie, one of the chimpanzee's from the station disappears with his spacecraft, Davidson follows and ends up on the eponymous planet. Unlike in the original movie, here all humans have the ability to speak and are completely civilized. Since the apes are in that sense not dominant over the humans, that removes a lot of the suspense present in the original movie. The humans still are slaves though, but Davidson escapes with a female slave and convinces a female ape to sort of join their cause. Two apes, military commanders, start chasing after them and we get to see some uninteresting chase scenes. The Ape City also looks badly compared to the one from the original. Later, scenes take place at Davidson's old space station, which crash landed at the planet hundreds of years before he did. The apes apparently created some kind of temple there. Eventually, there is a battle between the humans and the hostile apes.Now, I've heard people say they were interested in seeing this movie because of a cameo by Charlton Heston, but his appearance is so short and since he is unrecognizable I would hardly say it would be worth sitting through this movie just for that.This movie is also infamous for the horrible ending, which deserves a special mention of its own. They must have worked really hard to make the last scene especially as bad as possible, in the vain hope they would get to make a sequel to tie up the infinite number of loose ends they created in this.Fortunately, the series got a proper reboot with "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" in 2011. Do yourself a favor and watch that one instead of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the nigh overwhelmingly negative reaction to this "reboot," there ARE a number of positives: Wahlberg doesn't do a bad job, all told- it's just that the WRITING is so bad that it makes him LOOK worse than he is. Tim Roth steals the show as the psychotic Thade, Charlton Heston's cameo is still worth the price of admission (a rental?), and the Ape Lincoln ending is STILL funny, after all these years. Carter's makeup, however, DOES look like- as more than one reviewer has put it- the late Michael Jackson. Paul Giamatti is great in a supporting role as a slaver and the late Michael Duncan makes the most impressive gorilla since James Gregory as General Ursus in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. The Rick Baker makeup is (of course) the Highlight of the show and underscores the problem I have with cgi (no matter HOW competently executed it might be): cgi removes the ACTOR from the equation. From the beginning, it's been the makeup- and the ACTORS BEHIND THAT MAKEUP- that made these movies worth seeing. (Of course, the philosophy didn't hurt one bit, but most of that was abandoned this time around.) The music was another plus that's often overlooked (at least, the martial music that opens the movie). Humor supplants horror this time around, but it's the overall weakness of the writing that makes this one not quite the classic it should've been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The nature of the animal within us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the old classic starring Charlton Heston, though as happens with a lot of remakes these days, while following the theme, the plot works out differently. In the original film, Charlton Heston travels to the Andromeda Galaxy and when he returns 2000 years in the future, he discovers that he has landed on a planet that is ruled by apes. It is only by the end of the film that he discovers that it is Earth. This film had the memorable lines of 'take your stinking paws off me you damned dirty ape', and 'You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!' This version doesn't end as dramatically as the original (he returns to Earth to discover that the Earth that he knew was gone and is populated by apes) and the first line spoken by an ape to a human (instead of the other way around as in the original movie) is 'Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!'. Further, the film begins in a space station orbiting Saturn where they are investigating a magnetic vortex and the hero lands up on the planet of the apes when he travels through the vortex and lands up a thousand years in the future.I have probably given away a bit too much of the movie, but considering that it involves time travel, and also involves changes to the time stream (such as the space station entering the vortex and arriving at the planet centuries before our hero) I am at a loss to see how 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (which I have not seen at the time of this writing) could possibly be a prequel to this movie. Somebody has suggested that it involves the scene at the end, however it is clear from the inscription behind the statue that Thade, the bad guy in this film, somehow came to earth prior to our hero and upset the order, so we have another time travel dilemma. It is quite clever how Tim Burton constructed this movie since it is its own sequel and prequel (though we do not know how Thade managed to get off of the planet of the apes and to earth).Like the original film, the apes are an advanced iron age culture similar to Rome, and they borrow the title of senator, and also have their weapons and armour similar to that of the Romans. However a major difference is that the humans can speak in this film (though as slaves they are forbidden). However, that is likely to be because in the original, the action occurs after two thousand years had passed, whereas the action in this movie only occurred centuries (though it appears that the genetic manipulation of the apes on the space station had quickened the apes rate of evolution).There is a subtle dig at religion in this film. The apes have a religion and they worship the first ape who had created them, and believe that he left and will return. However, an ape does come from the sky at the end of the film, and it turns out that it is the ape that our hero had originally gone out to find. I guess the suggestion is that while our religion may have some truth to it, in reality it is simply a load of myth that is manipulated by the power brokers to create the world that they want and to force the population to submit to their will. Well, all I can say to that is that we live in a pluralistic society, and the times when one denomination would call the shots in any one country (or region) are long gone, at least in our Western Society. These days, if we don't like what our church is teaching us we can simply walk out and find one that we do like. Some say that is good, others say that is bad, however as far as I'm concerned, the bible is legit and I shall continue to believe it.The other interesting thing that I noticed is the idea of the animalistic nature of us humans. The idea is that despite all of the trappings of civilisation that we surround ourselves with, in our hearts we are still barbarians. While the apes have rising to become dominant, reducing the humans to the status of animals (much in the same what that certain races of humans were relegated to the status of animals in the past), in many cases they are still beasts. While they can talk and reasons, their behaviour suggests that they are still little more than animals. In a way this aspects reflects us as humans because despite the fact that we are able to put somebody on the moon, we still behave in a way that would make an onlooker believe that we are mindless animals driven only by lust and desire.</fullReview>

I'm not good at judging effects, but I found everything quite believable. On top of it, I loved the atmospheres created (mostly because it is a Tim Burton movie but with less of his usual style).The actors were incredible and sincerely, it was an awesome movie. I liked the plot, the actors, the directing and I think this movie is way underrated since it's being compared to the original which I heard is not even close to this plot.

And why can't the man land a pod right once when the monkey does it so easily! Never send a man to do a monkey's job! The movie's quality allows me to poke fun at its weak spots, the make-up is pretty good, and the ideas not so bad. It's funny that they managed to have the two major gorillas be played by ethnic minorities: The loyal African american colonel Michael Clarke Duncan and the loyal Asian servant Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa.</fullReview>

It wasn't just the laughable performances (Roth - how do you manage to act that badly when you're wearing a plastic monkey mask?) and the pitiful script - even the direction was risible.

		<fullReview>Although I am a fan of the original, I went into this movie with few expectations sinse I had already accepted that it was trying to be a Summer Blockbuster and not a well-made story that really made you think like the original did.However what I wasn't prepared for was how simply BAD it was. Not only was the plot nonsensical most of the time but when you could understand it you didn't want to; it was one of the most convoluted and childish storylines I've ever had the displeasure of watching.The ending helped the movie slightly despite it clearly being "tacked on". However this isn't saying much because by this time most people have given up hope of it turning into even a decent movie and are happy to just sit back and watch the intense action and super-weirdness that the ending provides.The whole movie can be summed up as a waste of potential. It wasted one of the best franshises out there. It wasted one of the most "talented" directors out there, Tim Burton. It wasted some of the best actors out there, Helena Bonham Carter and ol' reliable Marky Mark. It even wasted its cameos of original "Planet of the Ape" actors with crappy parts. And most importantly it also wasted moviegoers time.To sum it all up: don't see this movie unless you're amongst people who wouldn't mind you throwing popcorn and yelling obsenities at the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Planet of the Apes' is one those movies in which you can virtually see the downward slope from beginning to end. After a supremely evocative score by Danny Elfman, an introduction that grabs the audience, masterful atmospheric cinematography and a presentation of the premise that maintains our interest, the movie goes downhill. Essentially, the second part of the movie is little more than a cat and mouse story and does not match the expectations set up in the first part The movie has some great make-up effects, and the special effects in which the apes jump or throw others up in the air are very entertaining to watch. It seems that Tim Burton has a `signature' special effect in each of his movies: In `Sleepy Hollow' it was the decapitations, and in `Batman', the flying sequences over Gotham City. I heard many voice comments that they were disappointed by the movie. I believe that's partly because of a mismatch between its main body and the ending: up to the ending, the movie treats the subject matter as a science fiction story with only a touch of social commentary, whereas the ending is very much in the spirit of Pierre Boulle's biting social satire. If the two elements had been better integrated, the ending might not have seemed as abrupt. The movie does deserve credit in that it did not attempt to replicate the well-known ending of the original story, but find its own twist. Nevertheless, as a social fable it is weaker than the original. I still recommend this movie because, despite the drop in the second half, it is entertaining and the cinematography and special effects are well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I WANT MY TIM BURTON BACK!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The man who directed this soulless and totally unnecessary new version of Planet of the Apes cannot be the same man I have been adoring for the last 15 years. Where is the man who gave us wonderful and entirely unique movie experiences such as Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow? My theory is that he desperately wanted that his films make money again after the not-too-enthusiastically-received likes of Ed Wood and Mars Attacks, (how else can you explain his fruitless endeavour to resurrect the Superman franchise?) and after the relative success of Sleepy Hollow, he managed to gain access to Fox's resurrection of the Planet of the Apes franchise. However, I think that the studio interfered heavily with this "reimagining" of their beloved franchise and prevented him from making a usual Tim Burton film. The result is a terribly ordinary action adventure which is also an insult to the tradition of pessimistic sci-fi films that the original was so proudly part of. I cannot believe that my favourite director has his name stamped on this. I feel really deserted and I'm sure there are many Burton fans out there who feel the same way as I do. I WANT MY TIM BURTON BACK!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Mark Wahlberg: this honestly could have been a chance for him to extend upon steadily improving performances in the past few years, but the fault is not his. Equally, I imagine the screenwriters probably did an admirable job with their story. But any hope of a performance by Wahlberg, as anything more than a stereotyped dosage of testosterone, was trashed. It's really a pity. And to think that Tim Burton's name is attached to this film leaves me reeling... Having seen so many of his films and his genius revealed, I cannot help but believe this latest project suffered nuclear fall-out. Just think back: "Sleepy Hollow", "Nightmare Before Christmas", "Edward Scissorhands", and so many more: I could just keep writing... They were all fabulous.The most to be said for the end-product is that it allows Wahlberg to be likeable. Tim Roth, on the other hand, comes off so badly that he reminds me of Gary Oldman (whose talent, by the way, is huge and underutilised...) with too much make-up and a bad hangover. Only Helena Bonham-Carter and the special effects (read: Tim Burton) make this film worth seeing. Bonham-Carter is not only likeable, but believable, convincing, and showing real talent despite the obvious handicap of the costume. She really does deserve high marks here, but I don't think the voting public will take the end-product of this film seriously. Again, what a shame... The Marketing Gurus and Editors really need to be strung-up for hacking to bits what could have been fabulous.Entertainment value. Go see it for the special effects and noted items above. Recommend letters of condolence for Wahlberg and Burton; I am ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN this project could have been saved. Rating based on sentimentality = 3 stars (on 5).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most horrible movies I have seen in a very long time. From the very beginning of the film, it is obvious that Planet of the Apes is just another costly bloated piece of trash that Hollywood has been quite adept at producing in recent times (Phantom Menace anyone?). Tim Burton's stamp is all over this movie. However, his style (along with Danny Elfman's great music) hardly make up for one of the silliest and emptiest scripts ever. How in the world did it take 3 people to write the cliched dialogue and come up with the completely improbable scenes that saturate this movie? Everyone screams, "Wow, the special effects were awesome!" The special effects were great, but special effects do not a movie make (Phantom Menace anyone, again?). To make things worse, the ending of the movie was so open that you can see at least nine sequels coming out of it. I sincerely hope that the makers of this film will reconsider making any more movies like this one, and I hope Tim Burton will go back to making better films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the Planet of the Apes was okay. I feel the movie was not well-written. The characters are way too underdeveloped (especially Wahlberg's). The movie does have a great sense of artistic direction (the scenery, make-up and props are very enticing and alluring). However, I feel the movie moved at a way too easy by-the-numbers pace. There was never any real drama or suspense invested into the script. The interaction between the characters is often stale and almost wishing to be something more redeeming. Another aspect that really confused me was regarding the humans on the ape planet. These humans were obviously able to speak, thus they were intelligent. So, why were these humans unable to have formed a much stronger resistance to the apes? (In the original Planet of the Apes movie, the native humans were more underdeveloped like cavemen who still could not speak.) The ending of the 2001 remake was too weak and only guarantees us the possiblity that someone else might provide us with another sequel.My advice: catch this movie on cable and don't bother to rent or buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have just watched this and am completely unmoved.I am a big fan of some of Tim Burton's work. I was never that big a fan of the original movie, finding it a goofy B movie that has seen its reputation grow in recent years much like the band Kiss. So I did have some hope that, despite the mixed reviews, I might come down on the positive side.Early on, I sort of liked it. I liked the way the apes acted more like apes in their movement and mannerisms, but soon I felt that it was becoming unnecessary comic relief - sort of like bad old movies poking fun at racial stereotypes. And yes, Wahlberg is a failure in the lead role. He seems curiously detached and his performance just sucks energy out of the movie.But Estella Warren is the tip-off here. We have a supermodel in a skimpy outfit who serves no purpose in the film other than someone/thing to look at. Why is she here? I am convinced more than ever that this element, as well as others, ended up there as a result of market research and studio demands as opposed to anything resembling "artistic vision" by the director.From there, I can only think that we are starting to witness the downfall of Burton. Much as Coppola went from "The Conversation" and "Apocalypse Now" to "Jack" (not that I mean to say that Burton's aspirations were ever the equal of the messages that Coppola conveyed in his best work). Any pretense of Burton as an artist or visionary is gone with this film. He might as well direct Lethal Weapon 5 next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The planet of unoriginality (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that this "re-imagining" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. Specially when taken into consideration that this is a Tim Burton film. He is defenetly one of the most original and, might I say, cool directors Hollywood has produced.I am personally a great fan of his work, but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick, The Planet of the Apes. I really enjoyed the original film. When it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70's science fiction film, but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong. It had indeed a clear cut message. An obvious anti-war message. Fear of the cold war, where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film-makers. Those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic. Although, the new film, the "re-making" or whatever, leaves us with nothing. No message, no ideals behind it. It is just another money-minded summer blockbuster.Visually Tim Burton does not let you down. The dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific.Obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film. There has to be an exciting plot or storyline. In this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out. The script is very lame and it is full of gaps. It looks like this film had been written in a big hurry. The explanation for why the apes where there, and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script-writers ignorance.It raised a lot of questions, which had no reasonable answers to.For example; Why did the apes speak English?, why were there other ape-species than chimps on the planet (given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash-landed on the planet) Where the hell did all of those humans come from? How were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years. (I mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!)And finally, the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb. It was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end, then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending. The ending also raises a lot of questions, which I KNOW, don´t have intelligent answears. Did Theid learn to work the space ship?, which was power-less, and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand?, and, what did he do, breed with all the women? And lets say that that would happen, I higly doubt that history would stay the same, like Washington would be built exactly like it is today! (I mean wouln't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?)Well, just to say something posative about the film. Some of the cast was great. Helen Bonham Carter's character was interesting and well-acted, as for Tim Roth as Theid. He was very good, a little exaturated at some points of the film. Michael Clark Duncan was also fine. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not much of an actor, and plays here a very macho colour-less character. Very unbielevable and is nothing compared to Hestons character in the original. And the main female character had no reason or place in the film. She was just casted for the looks. Hardly said a word throughout the entire film.Well, I think that in the future when people think about the Planet of the apes, they will think about the original one. The latest will soon be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment, especially in light of the budget provided, the technical resources available, and the talent assembled. Isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief. POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains. The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimp, the worthlessness of the humans' lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt), the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable. Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down. Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being. Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy. Tim Burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. Let them walk. Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001. I'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent. It could have been a new franchise, and a wonderful new step for imagination. Another opportunity lost.</fullReview>

Here he had a chance to re-create a whole planet and my response was a huge yawn. The movie's not all that good either. It's not sure what it wants to be at times - a run-of-the-mill action flick (With cliched dialogue); a remake of the original; even an English bedroom farce (when Marky Mark &amp; Friends escape they HAVE to run through the bedrooms of each important ape in the city, apparently). It also criminally mis-uses Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth. In the end, the whole thing ends like an episode of "Sliders".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally weak redo leaving behind all the important plot elements of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Redoing a well-known, landmark movie is always, one would imagine, a challenge. Where the original depended so heavily on a surprise ending for its overall impact, the task is heightened to daunting. One would say, perhaps, even impossible.Tim Burton -- whose directing credits include films such as Batman, Beetlejuice and Nightmare Before Christmas -- was always going to produce the goods when it came to dark sets, evil villians and eye-popping special effects. So while he doesn't disappoint there, that alone is not enough.The major problem with this film is the atrocious plot, which is so unlike the original this film can hardly be termed a remake. The screenwriters have changed just about all the important plot elements, characters and events. This perhaps was a necessity, and possibly the only way to approach this task, but it is at the same time unfortunate. Everything in the film seems like an "alternative", an idea that may have been dropped in favour of the real thing the first time around.The film suffers from a profound lack of character development, and a 'flatness' of emotion which alienates the audience. Where a Jurassic Park or Star Wars Episode I focus on the special effects to the detriment of character and plot, this film takes this error to its extreme. We are, it seems, to marvel at the special effects so much as be entirely satisfied without any other elements. So much time onscreen is dedicated to celebrating the visuals of the world that Burton has created that we have no opportunity to understand it on any other level. One feels that large chunks of this film were cut and that a Director's Cut is inevitable. Perhaps that will provide the meat that this so desperately needs.To be fair to Burton, he worked with the screenplay he was given, and it is in this that most of the problem lies. The performances are generally good -- although Wahlberg is terrible as the hero -- and Tim Roth is excellent. Perhaps like Batman, Roth is this film's Nicholson, and makes the film worthwhile on his own.And then there's that ending. While I won't describe it for fear of robbing you of the small thrill that it provides, I will say that it is the most tangential and irrelevant ending imaginable. It literally appears to belong to a different film altogether, and is really a trite and blithe attempt to stun the audience the way the first film did. It is remarkable that any experienced director or writer could believe that simply tacking on a disconnected idea at the end of a film could provide any shock whatsoever. The result is a "Huh?" where there should be a "Wow!".Overall, Planet of the Apes fails in so many ways that remove the special effects and fine actors and a major flop would emerge. The film will no doubt be broadly watched and enjoyed for it's visual elements, but does seem to offer this lesson to all screenwriters and studios out there: if you can't think of how to possibly remake a film, and you're wracking your brains and have to think really, really hard, then please, just don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen Planet of the Apes 2001 I decided to rent the original series (not having seen them since the age of eight). I suppose I should thank Tim Burton for that.Burton has produced a standard "good versus bad" action flick, with special effects and stunts succeeding each other rapidly (presumably to distract from the lack of dialogue or characterisation). It is a shame on at least two counts: one would expect more of Tim Burton (this is a film Emmerich would make); more importantly it lacks the ambiguity and moral challenges of the original series. General Thade is wicked and our hero (whose name I fail to remember) is resourceful, brave and no doubt washes behind his ears.As I say, stunts, special effects, make up, the occasional twist. Like anyone of a dozen films every summer. Get the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glorious make-up and costumes, a fine, ferocious performance from Tim Roth as Thade, the Ape general, some dark moody sets (Tim Burton repeats his Batman effort) and occasional good lines do not save this movie from being generally boring and predictable ? and the ending is inappropriate.WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD. At the end of the 1968 original, astronaut Charlton Heston, having crashed on the Planet of the Apes after a long space journey and having escaped from its inhabitants, the partly civilised Apes, wanders along a beach and discovers lying in the sand the head from the Statue of Liberty. He realises that he had crashed back on Earth, where the human race had managed to nearly wipe themselves out with a nuclear war, thus setting the stage for the rise of the Apes. The sight of the statute was one of the most chilling moments I have experienced in the cinema.At the end of this version, Marky the astronaut, after sorting out the politics of the neo-medieval ape-human divide, flies off from the planet into the electro-magnetic storm nearby to try to get back to Earth. His instruments show him going back in time, and he crash-lands in a familiar looking Washington, DC, right outside the Lincoln Memorial. The only trouble is, Lincoln seems to have turned into Tim Roth. . Marky's instruments must have been wrong. The only possible explanation is we have gone into the future again. It seems that the Apes have triumphed over humanity despite Marky's efforts ? but so what? Evolutionary biologists point out that no dominant species has ever produced its successor. Our successors may well be descended from apes, dolphins, or even cockroaches (if we ever do have a nuclear holocaust). In short, there was no punch in the punch-line. In a few billion years' time the Earth is going to go up in flames when the sun explodes; the apes, or cockroaches are welcome to it.I quite liked Helena Bonham-Carter as the kind-hearted liberal-minded ape Ari. While you should never confuse the background of actors with their roles there is something cosmically appropriate in the casting.

		<shortDescription>the apes lose the plot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just returned from the cinema, having looked forward to this film as Tim Burton is god and I have always liked the original film.However, what started as quite an enjoyable sci fi romp quickly degraded into a godawful mess. We were expected to believe in the characters and actually feel for them, but how could we when we barely knew their names? When discussing the film with my friend afterwards we were referring to "blonde slave girl" and "helena bonham carter" and "that guy from the green mile". but that wasn't the only problem with the film. The script was full of so many plot holes that by the time the end rolled around you were scratching your head and wondering if they were going to explain it. they didn't. and then the ending... well, when trying to fit it in with the context of the preceding story it smacks more of an opening for the sequel... will marky mark escape from the planet of the apes, tune in same time next week! oh, tim, tim tim... i still believe in you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a couple of good things to say here. The makeup is, of course, amazing. Rick Baker deserves awards galore for his work on this film. General Thade is probably the best villain I've seen on screen since Darth Maul, but being probably the worst movie of the year, likely no credit will be given. The dialog is insipid, the acting is grade school and the action never gains momentum. What a waste of a premise. No scathing social commentary, no clever nods to the original (only a few stolen lines), no real development of any kind. Save your time and see something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Reimagining: The Major Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like almost every viewer of the latest "Planet of the Apes" who has chosen to comment on the film, I too have been disappointed by the latest version, seeing how it falls short of the freshness that Tim Burton brought to many of his films. In some respects though, I am not as harsh in my criticism as others.It is naive to compare Burton's latest film to his more offbeat successes like "Ed Woods," "Edward Scissorhands," and "The Nightmare Before Christmas". Those were personal projects, conceived and driven by him, not projects like the "Batman" films which were studio-driven and intended, first and foremost, as money machines. As such, it was highly unlikely that he would have been allowed a great deal of license. (Remember the fate of his planned version of "Superman" with Nicholas Cage? I'm sure Burton does.)However, Burton *can* be faulted in two places. First, the one point in the story where originality and daring might have played a role was in the Leo/Ari/Daena relationship. I wouldn't call it a love triangle--even though it was promoted as such--since Wahlberg's Leo never registers any particular emotion towards either female. Part of this must be attributed to the script which doesn't give him any lines or action to suggest attraction towards either Bonham-Carter's Ari or Estella Warren's Daena (though that a more resourceful actor could have communicated something nonverbally).Despite having Bonham-Carter display obvious interest in Wahlberg, Burton fails to follow through by having his Leo reciprocate (or at least display ambivalence about a female chimp flirting with him).The studio's reported objections to a graphic love scene are not surprising. What *is* strange is why Burton introduced the idea and then failed to develop it. Certainly a skillful director can explore the idea of such an unusual relationship without resorting to explicit sex; but Burton just teases us with the idea and then drops it.Equally disappointing is the ending. While I will not divulge it, I think it is enough to say that it has no meaningful connection to what precedes it. A "problematic" ending of a film at least allows workable interpretations. Burton's ending does not. A *major* flaw in any sort of story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had a lot going for it... but ultimately failed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film (takes a while to come out in Ireland).. and while the special effects were generally excellent, the film was extremely unconvincing.possible SPOILERS to follow:From a technical viewpoint there were many weaknesses, the number of apes in the army? In the initial marching scene there were tens of thousands, which then became about 50 in the all-out melee in front of calima. The fuel cell is another contentious point (one was full and it only managed a light fricassee of the apes... how did the ship move with only 3 of them?). I can forgive a few inconsistencies, but eventually they add up, and I'm left with the feeling that the makers just didn't care. I did feel that the movement of the apes was done very well, the slightly sideways walk, and the many gestures, sniffs and twitches were excellent.In the acting front, Tim Roth was excellently psycopathic... but ALL the time. There was no break even when talking to his father which gave the character a very 2-Dimensional, overly aggressive feeling. The romantic feelings of Helena Bonham-Carter towards our dashing hero was puzzling... surely monkeys find us as sexually attractive as we find them?Estella Warrens part was almost painful, her short dress and revealing top, coupled with very few lines made her simply a female to ogle. The film then attempts to strap on a romantic involvement with Mark Wahlberg at the end? Is there something we've missed? or is he simply regretting not having sex with her.The end, without saying what it was, was overly depressing, and pretty much expected.. what did he think? That going back into a highly unstable random time-jumping storm would bring him home? Oh well...I had high hopes for planet of the apes before I saw the ads (Tim Burton has produced many excellent films).. but I was disappointed with some glaring goofs, some fairly weak plot elements and some confusing characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dark and too many unanswered quetions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton rally can pick them can't he? Having already had to take one of the most popular comic book characters to the big screen in Batman, he then had to recreate the legend of Sleepy Hollow, before turning his eye to one of cinema's all-time classics in Planet of the Apes.Mark Wahlberg was cast in the role of main human (likened to Charlton Heston's in the original) whereas Britain's Helena Bonham-Carter was given a chance to rip up the bodices and put on the make up to become an ape along with Tim Roth and Michael Clarke-Duncan.After being dragged through a wormhole in the middle of an electrical storm, Captain Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) crash lands on a remote planet where humans are the slaves and apes rule. A sympathetic primate named Ari (Bonham-Carter) is against the suffering inflicted on humans by apes however and helps Leo along with the other human slaves escape. Eager not to let their capture get away, the ape army led by Thade (Tim Roth) and Colonel Attar (Clarke-Duncan) give pursuit as Leo frantically heads back to his ship.With so much to live up to in following the original, Tim Burton was always going to struggle to win over fans of the first. His work is as usual, dark and mysterious with most of the action taking place at night. Although adding to the planet's mystique, Burton's style does also often make it difficult to actually figure out what's going on. His re-worked ending is intriguing yet leaves many questions unanswered, with few of the plot lines coming together to complete the picture; this despite the fact that barely an hour of story has been stretched out to fill nearly two.The scenes of violence toward the end are well choreographed, but are also disturbing with all-too-lifelike apes and humans literally beating the life out of each other. It's partly from this though where the one saving grace liesThe quality of the make up work is excellent as Tim Roth, Michael Clarke-Duncan and Helena Bonham-Carter, amongst others, are transformed into perfect ape-creatures. As was shown with Godzilla however, special effects are nothing compared to solid story and the writers fail to offer anything new that can match let alone eclipse the original.Planet of the Apes 2001 is by no means a bad film, but with so much to hype and expectation to live up to it was always going to fall short. It's worth seeing for the make up jobs alone, but if you a real treat then rent the original.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Movie Lacks Innovation, Is Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has proven to be a director with vision. Many of his previous movies broke new ground artistically, like Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood. They were wildly imaginative, visually intriguing and entertaining. That is why I was so excited to learn that Burton was directing Planet of the Apes. I expected him to take the classic Apes from the 60's and give it his own Burtonesque twist. I expected ingenuity and to be immersed into a weird futuristic ape world. What I got was a modern-day Hollywood formula movie. It is as if all the creativity and intrigue of the original had been beaten out of the film.You know the story. An astronaut crash-lands onto a strange planet ruled by primates. Humans are on the planet too, but the humans are considered `animals' and are treated as slave labor. The biggest problem with Planet of the Apes (2001) is that it is simply not captivating. There is no discernable plot, except that the astronaut wants to get back to his mother ship, and the apes want to make him their slave (or kill him.) And while other `slice of life' films may not need a plot to succeed, sci-fi epics do. There is nothing compelling here to move the action and characters (and us) forward. The result is . . . boredom. Burton's job at a minimum with this film was to entertain us. He fell far short.Mark Wahlberg plays astronaut Captain Leo Davidson in a performance that is largely inconsequential. Helena Bonham Carter is Ari, a female ape (and unspoken love interest) who cares about the plight of the humans. Carter's performance is measured and effective. Tim Roth portrays Thade, the leader of the ape army. Roth is a fine actor whose performance here is at times captivating, and at other times one-dimensional. The actors who play the humans, Kris Kristofferson and Estella Warren, are almost as unimportant as Wahlberg. I liked the original movie better when the humans just grunted. Also, Charleston Heston even shows up in disguise to waste away a scene with us.To be fair, the makeup and special effects in Planet of the Apes are well done. The costumes and sets are all good, if not too dark (but the art direction is disappointing when compared with Burton's previous works). The music, by Danny Elfman, is great, if not distracting.The film's final scene, which I will not give away, has been deemed by some as clever or cool. I think not. Imagine if you will, what closing visual would be as evocative as the Statue of Liberty scene in the original movie? I guarantee that if you allow your mind to wander, you will guess it. That's not innovation, that's more of the same from Hollywood. What happened Tim?</fullReview>

The characters are all one-dimensional, their actions implausible, the attempts at humour feeble. The whole Ape culture/religion is a sad mush of Ancient Rome and Early Christianity. And the ending, people were raving about it, but it's a complete letdown, kind of: 'Oh, we gotta go out with a bang, like in the Original. But it has to be a different bang....Mmmh, don't have any ideas...Oh, let's just do this OK, won't spoil.

		<shortDescription>bad, bad, bad. Wasted opportunity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have two huge quibbles with the movie, both of which represent giant lost opportunities where the movie could have been actually interesting:1) the original movie featured humans who were somewhat devolved from the human race as we know it now. Incapable of organized rebellion. Thus it made more sense to have a strange space man come down and be seen as truly 'different' from the others.In this new version the humans, as we see them, don't seem particularly stupid, just overpowered. For Markie Mark's character to be singled out as somehow 'different' doesn't make any sense whatsoever, because the other humans speak, reason, communicate, and organize without any difficulty.A shame, then, that this version lost the whole idea of the space man leading a race of humanoids who appeared normal yet were somewhat strange and incapable. The only disadvantage humans seemed to have in this movie was some lack of muscle strength - and only barely.2) The portrayal of 'stranger in a strange land' is always very compelling. The audience puts themselves in the stranger's shoes and thinks, how would I react? What would I do? Would I stand up and say "hey, I'm not a normal human like these others, can I talk to someone in charge here?" Would we lie in wait to suss out the situation before 'taking sides'? Would we ask questions of our fellow captives? There are any number of things we would do or contemplate.However this movie just charges through that whole stage of the story and explores none of these possibilities. The moment he (literally) hits the ground, Markie Mark assumes the role of 'one of the hunted humans' and never makes any attempt whatsoever to say, "hey, wait a second, can someone explain what's happening here? because I have an interesting story to tell. Hey apes, i may be smarter than you assume."Lost opportunities, both.Plus the movie expropriates so many 'catch phrases' of American race relations dialogue as to be nauseating ("Can't we all just get along?" "Separate but equal" etc. etc.) Talk about bonking us over the head.And the ending is as preposterous as everyone says.Pretty costumes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When did Tim Burton switch places with Steven Spielberg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having seen the original Planet of the Apes, I'm sure I missed out on something here. But since I believe that movies should always try to appeal to the general audience, I still went and rated this movie.I honestly found myself wondering who exactly directed this movie; I walked out of the theater convinced I had just seen a Steven Spielberg movie. Then I started looking at the poster more closely. Waaaait a minute... I thought there used to be a difference there!Planet of the Apes (2001) is a bona fide Steven Spielberg movie; a sci-fi-ish epic with a strong, direct and clear moral message. It's typical of Spielberg that his movies always thrust his moral messages right in your face. I have never enjoyed this directness, which is an enduring feature of political movies (yes, Spielberg's movies are political). See Godard's Tout Va Bien for a spoof of them, and spot all the similarities to Spielberg.Like I said, Steven Spielberg's way of presenting things has always been repulsive to me, and I was shocked to witness it in Tim Burton's movie! The "educational" approach made the characters invariably black &amp; white and very one-dimensional. Every character had one mood which they maintained throughout the movie. I was especially struck by Mark Wahlberg's role; he delivered monologues on human history with less emotion than Schwarzenegger in T2, and I used to think that was hard to beat! Arnold was playing a robot, though, so he's excused, but what does that tell you about Mark Wahlberg?For people accustomed to Hollywood, this movie probably has its kicks. Personally, I found Braveheart of the Apes (oops, I mean Planet) enjoyable, but definitely not quality cinema. Oh, and Mr. Spielberg? Can we have Tim Burton back, please?</fullReview>

It made no sense. Until then it was an entertaining film. Visually amazing, the make up superb and Carter and Roth gave excellent performances. The story just never sparkled, however. This may be connected to the fact that Walberg doesn't have much screen presence. Comparing to Heston for a second (not just to compare to the original, but also to compare to a great leading actor), he commanded the screen, made you care what was happening and drew you into the film. Marky Mark may know how to model underwear, but a great actor he aint. There is something about him that made me just not care.At the end of the day, unless you've something new to say on the subject, someway to improve it beyond dated makeup, remakes are just pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's indicative of today's Hollywood machine, that a great story, with real bite, and genuine originality, can be so mercilessly reduced to just another action blockbuster. It's also very depressing to realise that the director responsible was once a 'maverick', with a unique take on his usual subjects, with a propensity to stay away from the commercial, and eke out the esoteric.Tim Burton's re-imagining required little imagination at all. Comparison with the original 1968 film is, obviously, unavoidable, which is as it should be. Because only with this comparison can you see what a major disappointment this version is. Practically all essence of the themes of evolution, religion, the questions of the way we treat our planet, and the way we treat each other (which are probably more pertinent in this age of genetic modification and cloning etc) are either ignored or dealt with swiftly to bring on the next set piece. Charlton Heston's spaceman has to deal with an inability to communicate with both the apes and the humans (through his lack of speech and their lack of understanding) making him an outsider from both species. We go through that wonder and frustration with him. In Burton's film there are no such devices, we are simply given the 'us and them' option, and all philosophising is glossed over in order to accommodate the next chase. Which is what this movie ultimately turns into..one chase after another. The original's council meeting is replaced with a flippant, and jokey dinner party scene. And, tellingly, there are no allusions to human experiments, instead it appears that humans are good enough as slaves and not much else. One of the many lasting images from the 1968 version is Heston's discovery of his lobotomised co-astronaut. It makes no sense that humans who can communicate with one another, and who outnumber the apes by four to one are not the ruling species. Just one of the holes in a weak and dumbed down plot.Much has been made of the ending, but here, at least, Burton has the sense to at least try something unexpected. Once again, however, he has fluffed it in order to quicken the pace. The apes seem incredibly open to the suggestion that the humans were there first, just as Leo gets over the shock of talking apes rather swiftly so, too, do these apes have an unlikely ability to accept Leo's 'understanding' and explanation of 'Calima'. Heston finding the doll in the cave at the denouement of the first movie is a revelatory moment for both audience and ape - nothing in the remake surprises us much.If you can forget the original (or if you haven't seen it), and if you can bypass the dire script, there are things to enjoy here. Although the first half is far too set bound (with some unimaginative CGI), the climactic battle scenes are very well realised. So, too, are the apes themselves, with some incredible make-up effects, and physically engaging performances (mainly by the extras!). Tim Roth injects the much needed energy in a scene-chewing, but also scene-stealing turn as General Thade, arguably the highlight of the whole picture, and Charlton Heston's cameo is good fun, the only glimpse of any humour and irony in the movie. Paul Giamati's slave trader is simply embarrassing.Major disappointment all round.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it was visually stunning, and the costume work was spectacular. Still, this movie not only violated real-world logic, it violated its own created logic, thus making it one of the messiest, frustrating movies I have seen, ever. Mark Wahlberg was brilliant in Boogies Nights and Three Kings, but here he is unspectacular. There is never any reason given why he stands out among all other humans as being special, though the story depends on Ms. Carter's interest in him. He wears a white shirt, that is all. Otherwise he is quiet, and does nothing out of the ordinary until later in the movie. Roth's Thade also takes an interest in Wahlberg's character, but again, without reason or logic.I believe Thade was the worst villian, ever. He had no logical reason for wanting to wipe out the humans. And this is where the story really breaks down. The motivation is gone. The apes have achieved supremacy, but yet there is still a need to kill all humans, who live like wild animals, and are thus harmless to the much more powerful and advanced apes. Apes who ride horses (which the movie refuses to explain why they are on this planet, though it explains the origin of the Apes and Humans). The logic comes to a complete break down when Thade's general turns on him, for no reason. He has not seen anything to warrant his turn-around, and this unexpected and unlikely twist further diminishes the story.I thought I was going to vomit and retch, I desperately tried to plead with this movie to make more sense, that if you set up a fantasy world, you must abide by the rules of that world. But it did not, and it caused my head to explode in complete pain.I give it a 3 out of 10, for costumes alone. Those Apes looked realistic (save their body-size), and the Roman-theme was a nice touch, albeit Gladitor-esque.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a HUGE Tim Burton fan, the only two films I don't *love* of his are Ed Wood and Beetlejuice, sadly, Planet of the Apes was very close to falling into this category also.There were a lot of things going for the film which were realised at times, the feel of the planet is great, the acting is generally top-notch, the soundtrack is fantastic and the ending - although unfathomable - was atleast unexpected, and that's good in a strange way.Where it failed was in the HUGE plots holes and convenient devices used to drive along the story. All the plot-holes have been mentioned elsewhere in this review section, suffice it to say, there is little ways of getting around most of them. They just don't make sense ! - and the chimp saving the day was a very poor way to end it.The actual plot runs thin half-way through the movie and the final battle was rather anti-climatic I thought. I will go and see a sequel if there is one, but with a lot less excitement than I had for this film.I can't say it wasn't good, because I never looked at my watch during the cinema, but it wasn't the best BLOCKBUSTER SUMMER movie of the year (that was Jurassic Park 3 and earlier Bridget Jones and Hannibal), but it was entertaining enough. Sadly I will always feel the *most* apt word for the movie is "Disappointing".Yd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take 1 part Apes, 1 part Beneath &amp; 1 part Battle. Mix. Flush down toilet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&gt;&lt;SPOILERS AHEAD&gt;&lt; How disappointing this is. No memorable characterization. No wit. No one to identify with or care about. No satire. No acting of any consequence. No opportunity to pause and look around and take in the culture, scenery or costumes. Kristoferson, Markham and Bonham Carter(playing Michael Jackson)all have thankless roles that are mere shadows of their 1968 counterparts. Tim Burton ruins another project with great potential. He's getting like Spielberg, so full of himself that he's forgotten his craft. The good stuff: The ending almost saves the film. This is taken from the original book. I won't spoil it, but it's worth the wait. Tim Roth and Michael Duncan make the most of their underwritten roles. A nice cameo occurs half way through in Roth's father. The slave-trader, the kid and the bald servant are very good, too bad I have no idea who their characters were. There was an interesting twist to the final third of the film. I still have no idea whether he went to Earth the first time or if he's on our Earth at the end. We'll have to wait for the sure to come sequel. RATING: 6 out of 10. For a comparison, rent the 1968 original. This is a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton can do much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film on preview night over in the UK. Had missed much of the hype, though with it being Tim Burton, I looked forward to it. I cannot say that i was hugely disapointed, and certainly I cannot agree with much of the over-reaction of many of the reviews - it is neither wholly awful, nor is it wholly wonderful.However, leaving the cinema, i had an rather strange feeling that I, or maybe the film/Burton had missed the point of it somewhere along the line. (I suspect it may have been the former rather than the latter,.. but i`m not so sure...) The film looked sumptious, of course. The make up, and sets have to be seen at the cinema to fully appreciate the workmanship and realism with which it is presented etc. This was ofcourse enjoyable, as indeed you would expect in return for its budget. And yet, I was still left wondering what was the point of making it - to improve it or the idea, to make a straight forward blockbusting action film - i suspect not. I had a sense that Tim Burton had a strong mental picture of what he wanted, but was unable to reproduce it on film, and in trying to capture it, lost it completely.Tim Burton seems to have great warmth for the original film - there are many references to the original film (some i missed, some i got), but he does not seem to have felt an equal warmth for his own film. Much of what i have been so impressed with his previous films (with the exception of Mars Attack )- the gothic, dark and eccentric caricuturations( if there is such a word !) of, I suspect his own childhood, (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and to some extent Sleepy Hollow) and the warmth in which presents them is oddly lacking here. Only in moments do you glimpse this, and sadly for the main part of the film you are unable to distinguish the films director from that of any other director- and this is a shame, he can and has done better. He calls this film an re-imagining of the original film rather than a re-make - I am hopeful that his imagination is more fertile, and i suspect that we may see a return to his more original storytelling soon.The acting is also worth noting. Much of the this is mainstream with the majority of the cast resorting to walking around bow legged (and with ill fitting underwear no doubt) to suggest a ape like gait. Mark Wahlberg doesnt seem completely at ease with leading a film yet - either that or he isnt quite the finished article. Helen Bonham Carter plays her part well, but it is Tim Roth who steals the show, with a very powerful and eye catching performance - though, it seems to me, he stole his performance ( or copied, or was inspired ) from Michael Ironside who, bar the make-up, snarls and grunts his way round every part i have seen him do in exactly the same way - I thought it was him for large parts of the film !Dont be completely put off by this review, as this is, of course only my opinion - dont wait till it comes round on video - give it a chance and with luck you will enjoy it 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well what to say. I was eagerly awaiting the release of this movie, i was so excited about seeing it and i went to the 1st screening this morning. what a waste of money, dont get me wrong the special effects were amazing rick baker deserves an oscar for his outstanding work. the plot was a total joke, very poorly written and the acting wasnt up to scratch either apart from one person. Tim Roth was amazing, absolutely brilliant as the most evil looking ape i have ever seen. the guy deserves an award , should give him the most evil looking thing on screen award (lol).. wark walhberg does his best bless him but overacts a badly written script. helena bonham carter was fairly impressive as human lover ari but lacked a certain something.. and the ending, oh my god, what an absolute pile of crap, i came out of the movie laughing at its sheer pathetic attempt at bringing an exciting twist, but people give me a break, now the ending to the original was brilliant finding the statue of liberty but this was dire. as brilliant as tim burton is i am not attacking his vision in any way, but this is possibly the worst movie he has ever made. i was hugely disappointed by it and would say this, go and see it for the effects which at times can be quite scary, but i guarantee 2 things, you will come out laughing and you will never want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Burton's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is missing the comedy and the edge of Tim Burton's other films. Though stranded on a strange world, Leo Davidson lacks the outsider quality of other Burton heroes like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, or Lydia Deitz (Beetlejuice). Similarly the comedy seems wedged in, rather than forming an integral part of the story, as it does in the likes of Mars Attacks or Ed Wood.It is really only the performance of Tim Roth that redeems this picture. He has never really had a reputation for being a physical actor but here he shows himself to be up with the Oldmans and the Nicholsons. It would have been good to see someone more animated than Mark Wahlberg in the Davidson role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Would Dr. Zaius Say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Tim Burton was going to "re-imagine" the original "Planet of the Apes" (which is a much nicer word than "re-hash"), my question was, "Why?" Now I've seen it, and I still don't know. When you remake a movie, it will inevitably invite comparison with the original. You need to bring something new, interesting, and different to it, and most importantly, it helps to know what that something is. And that is the chief weakness of the new "Apes".The original movie had weirdness and originality, plus satiric bite and subtext out the wazoo. The apes in Burton's movie behave more like real apes, which is neat, but part of the original's charm was that its human-ish apes lent it a surreal "Twilight Zone" quality, no surprise given the involvement of Rod Serling. Plus the original had that ending, which has become a classic cinematic moment. The new "Apes" obviously lacks that dramatic punch, and the makers were wise to alter its premise accordingly. But to what? The new movie works best as a comic takeoff on the genre (since the original spawned four sequels and an armada of imitators). It's fun to spot all the references in this movie, both to the "Planet of the Apes" series and to other cultural icons. But the movie fails to keep the satiric edge through the second reel until the bravura, witty finale (which suggests that any sequel might be funnier and better than this one). Otherwise we get a lot of ho-hum posturing and a surprisingly yawn-inducing battle scene. The movie also leaps over gaps in the plot like a steroid-crazed chimpanzee. As an example, the hero is confronted by an army of human refugees who have come from all the land to "see the human who defies the apes." That's impressive communication: he'd only escaped the night before.The story is weak and wandering, and the cast isn't up to the task of buoying it. This is especially true in the pivotal lead character. Charlton Heston's performance in the original was hammy (but admit it now; we love Charlton BECAUSE he's hammy), but his character had fire and emotion. You could identify with him because he was trapped in an insane situation, and his fear, confusion and rage were palpable to you. Mark Wahlberg in the new one barely registers. Wahlberg is not a bad actor, but neither is he a lead actor. He is subtle, and best when playing quiet supporting characters to more vibrant leads, like in "Three Kings" or "The Corruptor". He also has a flair for deadpan satire (he was the best thing in the misfired "The Big Hit"). But this is a role that requires less subtlety and more big expressiveness. Wahlberg comes across not as an ordinary man trapped in a bizarre nightmare out of time, but just befuddled, like a commuter that has gotten off at the wrong stop. And, just before the big battle, he gives what has to be the least inspiring speech-to-the-troops in film history. If Marky Mark had been at Valley Forge, we'd all be mailing our tax returns to London.Heston, incidentally, crops up in an in-jokey cameo as the wizened old leader of the apes. He shows his son Thade (Tim Roth) an ancient pistol which he says is proof of the ingenuity and wickedness of humanity, in one swoop spoofing both his role in the original and his day job as NRA President. Between this and playing a gun-toting nut job in "Town and Country", Heston seems intent on retiring the Good Sport Award for this year.It happens that all the good performances in this movie are among the apes (hmm, maybe they ARE superior). Roth is magnetic as the power-mad, swaggering Thade, and kudos also to Michael Clarke Duncan as his adjutant, with a booming voice that was made to say things like, "Bow your heads!" Estella Warren is very cute in buckskin, but contributes little else to this movie (this is not all her fault; for an ostensible love interest, her character is woefully underwritten).The movie is not all bad; I'd certainly say it's worth seeing. It has visual flair, there are a lot of funny lines and moments, and the ending is inspired; but as comedy it's too dull, as drama too flat, as allegory too unworkable to rise above the ordinary. In the "Apes" ouevre, I'd place it above "Escape From..." and "Battle For...", but that's below the level of ringing endorsement.And if you do see it, one last thing to ponder: Where the hell did the horses come from???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The `reimagined' version of this story pays due homage to the 1968 classic (at the time of its release the biggest sci-fi film yet made) while retaining Burton's unique flavor and comic book atmosphere. But comparing this to the original is like comparing Li'l Debbie snacks to Hostess-a little more style but a lot less tasty saturated fat. Wahlberg stars as Air Force cadet Leo Davidson, stranded on a strange planet after flying recklessly into a cosmic anomaly (I believe the proper sci-fi CYA term is `a rift in the space-time continuum'). After Davidson finds the planet ruled by simians who keep humans as slaves he escapes from their clutches, finds a few sympathetic monkeys, and sets off across the country to find his ship and get back home. The group runs into a little trouble finding any crewmates, but what they do find is the truth behind the planet's origins in a finale not nearly as fun or coherent as the original film's surprise ending.Putting plot issues aside for a moment, what you'll like about the film are the ape actors. Tim Roth hams it up wonderfully as the ruthless ape leader Thade, even if his performance leans a little too heavily on the snarl and glare department. Helena Bonham Carter is bewitching as Ari, an upper-class liberal ape who even manages to flirt convincingly with Davidson on their journey together. Paul Giamatti is actually funny as the orangutan slave-trader Limbo, rather than the usual obnoxious comic relief fare. And Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are excellent as Attar and Krull, two old war comrades who have now found themselves on opposite sides of the battlefield. Unfortunately, the human counterparts in the film are much less impressive. Kris Kristofferson steps in and out, stopping briefly to perhaps pick up his paycheck. Estella Warren may as well not be there at all as her role seems to be defined as merely a pretty face among monkeys. But the most disappointing role by far is Wahlberg's, who in the past has been at least charming, but remains wooden throughout this feature. For someone billed as the hero it's a bit off-putting that his entire focus remains on getting back to earth-in the end he spends about two minutes being noble before blundering off into the weakest `shock ending' I've seen in a film since Fight Club.But even with feeble lead performances and plot holes bigger than a baboons hot red ass we still get a few kicks out of the story. Burton also isn't afraid to pull a couple of one-liners coupled with a Charlton Heston cameo that will set fans of the original laughing out loud in the theater. And while POTA 2001 is not going to impress any die-hard fans of the first version, this might not be a problem-chances are, many of the young audiences watching today (sadly) never got around to seeing the forerunner for comparison.</fullReview>

Why no fish in the swamp where the shuttle crashed? Why no bugs? Why no birds? Did I miss something? Do I need to see this movie again? I have also always wondered what would happen if you set an ape on fire and blasted him a hundred feet in the air. Now I know that "nothing" happens. ------------ W H A T E V E R!

The makeup was truly fantastic, and the action choreographed well. As a standalone movie, it would have been alright, but unfortunately, it has a legacy to live up to. The second reason for the high score was the sexy, sensuous presence of Estella Warren.

		<fullReview>Sure, this new adaptation of Pierre Boule's classic novel Planet of The Apes isn't a wonderful exploration of human behavior or something like that, but that is not it's target. Instead it tries to be an incredibly entertaining summer movie, while still being intelligent and retaining Burton's gorgeous visual style. And with that in mind, it fully accomplishes its goals. First of all, the soundtrack, made by long-time Burton collaborator Danny Elfman is up to the composer's high standards. The brutal percussion-based sounds of his score fit the movie perfectly. The story is very satisfying and the ending is excellent. Touches of clever humor add to the script. But, of course, what steals the show is Burton's gift for creating memorable images and his army of apes, led by General Thade, a memorable character played to perfection by Tim Roth. For this movie, Burton often leaves his trademark dark and blue colors, but the movie still has his wonderful touch. As for the apes, they are very impressive. The cast is good, without having very hard jobs to do, but as I said earlier, Roth shines. So, this may not be Tim Burton's best movie, but it is the perfect summer entertainment, offered to you by one of history's greatest directors.85%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton and the Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the original film of the same title and it's numerous sequels, you have to ask the question, did the world really need another version? Even with the advancements in technology and special effects since Charlton Heston first landed on the planet, it's kind of like an aging actor getting yet another face-lift; it looks good but it just can't recapture that original beauty, no matter how good the surgeon is. And `Planet of the Apes' couldn't have had a better man to hold the scalpel, but even director Tim Burton couldn't make this one any more than what it is, an imaginative adventure story that basically just puts a new face on something tried and true. It looks great, and the atmosphere Burton created fairly crackles; but as a story, we've been there, done that, and even with a slightly different twist at the end, this one simply does not have much to add, with the exception that the apes really look good. But does being able to showcase make-up and F/X wizards justify resurrecting this one? I guess the bottom line is, this movie's going to make a killing at the box office.  It all begins on a space station where some highly advanced chimps are being trained to go into space and do amazing things. One of those in charge of these wannabe astronauts is Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), and when his special ward, Pericles, is launched and lost in a huge electrical storm, Leo jumps into a space capsule and takes it upon himself to go where no man has gone before. He quickly gets swallowed up by the storm himself, and after some exceptionally good visual effects, he not only gets spewed out onto an unknown planet, but he's some four to five hundred years into the future. He emerges from his landing with nary a scratch, but after barely having enough time to catch his breath or get his bearings, he finds himself caught up in the middle of some kind of hunt, and the prey happens to be humans. And it's then, of course, that he discovers that something is terribly wrong here. Apes are the hunters, and they seem to be in charge of everything. He readily discerns that there doesn't seem to be much percentage in attempting a parley at this juncture, intelligent as the marauding primates appear to be, so he opts for that which is often the better part of valor: He runs. And the adventure begins in earnest. If this movie had to be made (which obviously, it did) at least the right man ended up in the director's chair, because Burton has a way creating a look and a mood that suits this kind of material perfectly, just as he did with `Batman,' `Sleepy Hollow' and `Edward Scissorhands' (just to name a few). But there just isn't that much story here. It's an incredible journey, to be sure, but it's just not fresh enough to maintain interest for very long, even as good as it looks and exciting as it gets. And, whereas the original had something of a message about the miasmatic direction society was headed, about the only message here is the one that can be found in the `Cha-ching!' of the cash register. As the hero of the tale, Wahlberg comports himself well enough, but in all fairness, this wasn't a role that required much emoting. Basically, if he could run well and look alternately confused and determined, the part was his. He did and it was. And to his credit, he did it very well. Character development was unnecessary for the purposes of this film, so with Leo, what you see is what you get. No surprises, and you never really get to know much about who this guy is or what makes him tick-- but it doesn't make any difference. He's the hero, he cares about his chimp, and that's all you have to know. Helena Bonham Carter does a terrific job as Ari, the Ape who champions the cause of the humans, in whom she sees a value beyond the level of degradation to which her peers have consigned them. Of all of those in the cast, she actually manages to do some acting, and she does it exceptionally well, expressing herself much better than what anyone would have the right to expect here, especially taking the cumbersome make-up into consideration. You cannot help, however, getting a sense that this is what it would have been like had Merchant/Ivory made `Gorillas In the Mist.' As General Thade, the ruthless military leader of the apes, Tim Roth adds a villain to his resume that is quite unlike any he's played before and, like Bonham Carter, actually gives a remarkable and agile performance, all things considered. The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Attar), Kris Kristofferson (Karubi), Estella Warren (Daena), Paul Giamatti (providing some comic relief as Limbo, the slave trader),Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Krull) and features a clever cameo by Charlton Heston. Taken at face value for the action/adventure film it is, `Planet of the Apes' is entertaining, but lacks the substance of the original and may be disappointing to anyone hoping for anything more than a visually engaging foray into a kind of twilight zone of the new millennium. For what it is, it's well made and delivered; it just seems that the talent involved with this project could have been better served elsewhere. I rate this one 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of "Fistful of dollars" using Klingons?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Roth's "original" villian seems to stem from the touchy-feely evil Ramon/Indio villain in "Fistful of dollars/Few dollars more" spaghetti westerns (titles which sum up what this remake is all about). The bonanza of great effects make for great entertainment but the lack of a visionary story make this a one-dimensional kid's movie which won't stick in the brain for adults. There is no "discussion" on the moral/philosphical place of man in the universe: in the original book/movie, our hero is clearly divided since he neither fits in with the future's primitive humans nor the apes. This version is just another uncompelling "Us vs. Them," and the war-like gorillas sound and look like Klingons in "Star Trek." Speaking of gorillas, whom did they evolve from since there were originally only chimps? Where do they live, since there are too many for that hilltown? Where did the modern-speaking humans come from if the caucasian astronauts all died? Why does the blonde babe keep ducking out of scenes - does she have a bladder like a thimble? And are we on earth in the far future or far past? Or another dimension? This last plot problem ruins the great visual ending (try as it might to be like the book's end). The soundtrack also doesn't credit it's inspiration to the better original. For those who absurdly claim we need remakes because kids won't watch the originals, it was we kids who loved the original enough to generate 4 sequels, a live-action and animated TV series, lunch boxes, etc. and inspire Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great looking film. Great acting, particulalry Tom Roth and Helena Bonham-Carter. Ape movements and portraying them as a culture used to moving in all three dimensions is excellent, well thought out. Great use of cameos and dialogue from first films. But...Estelle Warren has a pointless role and is completly wooden. The plot peters out into cliches on top of cliches as soon as they arrive at the final destination. Brave but idiot child doing something idiotic, so hero has to rescue him - even has the old weekly serial device of the danger being right on top of him them shifting to not being nearly so close once the situation is resolved. Gimmick to resolve the major conflict is unconvincing, no explanation of why secondary protagonist should drop all his objections and want to live in harmony with species he has despised all his life. Hero doesn't even make a case to him as to why he should do so. Doing for mere appearance of an apparent saviour is incredible. Using small pod to traverse god knows how many universes and our solar system to get home requires too much suspension of disbelief. Ending is just silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great effects but misses the point of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This slick version fleshes out the brutal details of the original but lacks its memorable storyline, social commentary, vision and beautiful original soundtrack. The metaphoric value of the book/original film are lost by the fact that humans here can already speak - english as usual -so the only superiority the apes have is physical. In fact, since all the humans were killed on the space station, who were all those long-haired Harley Biker dudes (the "humans") descended from? Without the constant philosophical criticism of man's evil nature(throw in guilt and original sin too, what the heck), it turns into Humans versus hairy Roman empire-Mafiosa-Nazi-etc.-type aliens (Tim Roth is a composite of many movie evil archetypes). It looks like they borrowed the plot twists and F/X from the new "Lost in Space" movie, but that movie didn't really have to compete with the original series. The ending is reminiscent of the book BUT doesn't make sense in terms of time travel in our universe, so if he went back in time in an alternate universe, all quantum universes being equal, then it's just a coincidence he returns to an ape-ruled earth (rather than an INEVITABILITY which was THE POINT in the book/original film). To put it another way, if Burton's movie came first, noone would be inspired to remake it 30 years. Great effects, costumes and menacing apes but very uninspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton can usually make us feel. He gives us foreshadowing, atmosphere, and a sense of reality.He did none of those with this movie.I wanted to like this film; I really did. In fact, most of the movie was enjoyable. I found that the apes moved realistically, or at least as one would expect, Tim Roth was a good villain - if more than a bit flat - and that the religious element was delicate but not underdeveloped.However, at about thirty-forty minutes from the end of the film, things fell apart.Characters show up for no reason; we are spoon-fed that which the viewer can already deduce; romance is conjured out of nowhere. Tim Burton could have made this a satire, but instead he made it an action movie that pales in comparison with even a Steven Seagal vehicle.There is no atmosphere, soul, or logic to the film. If you liked Burton's other movies, by all means do not see this one.And wow, the ending. I overheard someone mention Rod Serling's name on the way out. I can tell you, if I had known who said that, I would have looked at him and told him that Twilight Zone endings were foreshadowed, consistent, and above all else, MADE SENSE. The movie doesn't even play properly within the logic it sets up for itself.I went into this with higher expectations than I should have. If you see it, don't make the same mistake I did.</fullReview>

If Tim Roth and Heston hadn't shown up, the party would have been unbearable. The story is weak, the characters are undeveloped and the situations are premature the majority of the time. I couldn't believe how bad this movie was (I'm rambling, I know, but I am really disenchanted). In my opinion, it seemed as though Burton had a vision that did not pan out.

		<fullReview>Yet another Hollywood attempt at cashing in on a proven franchise, Tim Burton's supposed "re-imagining" of the 1968 sci-fi classic Planet of the Apes is a dreadfully dull, meandering affair, which consistently fails to engage the viewer on any meaningful level. Sure, it tries to live up to the lofty social-political commentary of the original, but here there's nothing to back it up-- the plot is shallow, the dialogue lame and the characters are so underdeveloped we can hardly recall their names.For example, near the end of the film, a human boy stands up to his ape oppressors in what I assume was meant to be a moving moment. But it has little impact because the character has never been properly introduced; the scene is the first in which he figures prominently. Similarly, two Ape generals square off at one point in what is clearly intended as a battle between two giants. But the set-up for their feud is so scant (the bland line of dialogue inserted earlier in the film) that the pay-off is virtually non-existent. They fight, one wins...whoopee.Characters like these appear throughout the film. The lead female human seems to exist solely for her cleavage; Kris Kirstofferson appears as a human male who does almost nothing and who, like his counterparts mentioned above, engages in a Big Moment that fails to have any impact. It's hard to feel bad for human slaves who are this dull. As for the apes, they're so one-dimensional they're better described as types than as actual characters. Most notably, there's the evil general (played with wonderful vitriol by Tim Roth), who seems to simply hate all humans, period. His behavior is entirely one-note: he stomps about, growls and acts viciously at every opportunity, and almost always without sufficient motivation. As a villain he's about as interesting as Skeletor was in the old He-Man cartoon. Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's character, an ape with a soft spot for humans, is little more than a caricature of good will.Finally, the lead character, played by Mark Wahlberg, walks through the film in an apparent daze. Never does he seem amazed by this monkey planet he's landed on, nor does he appear distraught by the predicament in which he's found himself. Charlton Heston's lead character in the original POTA film may have been over-the-top in places, but he at least struck the right notes of paranoia, amazement and outrage. By comparison, Wahlberg seems drugged; and this is a problem because we're supposed to be seeing this world, at least in part, through his eyes. Recall the introductory portions of the original POTA, in which the team of wayward astronauts slowly makes their way into Ape territory. Their journey becomes stranger and stranger as they encounter human skins, a tribe of primitive humanoids, and finally the fully-clothed warrior apes. Never does this new film approach this level of horror and amazement. Instead, its protagonist runs through its world like a blip in a video game. And that's a shame.On the good side, Rick Baker's makeup is, on the whole, extraordinary; Danny Elfman's score is rich and bombastic; and the physicality of the ape characters' performances are fun in that they are much more simian in nature than those featured in the 1968 original. But even fans of Tim Burton will have a hard time finding his personal stamp on this film.And what of the surprise ending? It's there, and it's fun. But it feels tacked on and most viewers will probably figure it out a minute or so before it actually happens.If you really want to enjoy this movie, go buy the action figures. That's the point, right?</fullReview>

This is not the case, for this is a prequel of the movie escape from the planet of the apes. The movie was to imply that the apes came from human activity, and the ending was a possibility for a new movie. The sequence of the movies are, planet of the apes (2001), escape from the planet of the apes, conquest of the planet of the apes, battle for the planet of the apes, planet of the apes (1968), and beneath the planet of the apes. The new movie rise of the planet of the apes is just a new way of showing how the world resulted to the scene of the planet of the apes (1968).

		<fullReview>Never mind about a "plot" for this thing. This film is Tim Burton's ultimate disaster, an abomination of a re-imagining that should never have been made. Burton hasn't got a clue as to what made the original Apes Franchise so appealing and timeless to its legion of loyal supporters. I know that as a lifelong fan I had waited nearly thirty years for Twentieth Century Fox to green light another Apes project, and my hopes were high because I had liked Burton's dark and dreary BATMAN. But - as some behind the scenes footage would prove - Tim just thought of this whole undertaking as a goof and a joke, as he would break out into laughter after yelling "Cut!" while trying to maintain a straight face. Indeed, there is an over-use of comedy a-plenty in APES 2001, which appears to take precedence over everything else compelling, and it just made me sick. There are some perfunctory elements from the original 1968 classic tossed in which come off as an obligatory bone to throw fans: idiotic turns of iconic phrases, such as "Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty Human!!", and even a non-credited (thank God) cameo by Charlton Heston himself in ape makeup as he parodies his own persona with a mighty "Damn Them All To HELL!!" yell. The human characters in this version can speak but are completely undeveloped; even Linda Harrison's mute 'Nova' in the first two original APES movies had managed to make her someone we could relate to and care for! Oh, and I forgot about Marky Mark Wahlberg in the part of the lead astronaut who lands on this dopey planet ... the less said about him here, the better.Many people are completely confused by the ending of Burton's picture (so was Burton, if you hear him stammering and trying to make sense of it himself on the DVD commentary). I get it all right myself, but it was just badly realized. Within the whole movie you get the feeling that there is no story attempt, or that maybe a lot of things were edited and then just haphazardly reconstructed. But the main insult is that The Planet of the Apes is not about a bunch of silly monkeys in clothes bouncing all over the walls and shrieking and hollering. That misses the entire point of the message behind the series. However, as vomit-able and insulting as Burton's pile of gorilla manure may be, there are a merciful few things which prevent it from being totally unwatchable: For starters, Tim Roth makes a delicious villain as the evil chimpanzee Thade. Paul Giamatti's comical orangutan character Limbo is spirited, but overstays his welcome and would have been tolerable in small doses. I must respect Rick Baker's new apes makeups to some extent, even though I don't think they can best John Chamber's original 1960's designs. Whatever compliments I'd give to the makeups are only with respect to the male apes; the females are very badly realized... Helena Bonham Carter's female chimpanzee here is just terrible ... she looks more like Paula Abdul rather than an ape. Fox would fare better with its second stab at a reboot ten years later. But Tim Burton really dropped the ball for this instantly forgettable travesty. He did it -- he cut out its brain, that bloody baboon! * out of ****</fullReview>

It is also hugely entertaining in terms of plot, script, balanced story structure and cinematography. A possible reason why the average gun loving movie goer (brainwashed by a war mongering mainstream not-so-thought-out point of view) would not appreciate Tim Burton's vision is the Director's anti-war sentiment that carries a subtle under-tone of acceptance throughout the film. The movie is great-looking. Rick Baker's makeup is convincing even in the extreme closeups, and his apes sparkle with personality and presence. The sets and locations give us a proper sense of alien awe. Tim Burton made a film that's respectful to the original, and respectable in itself. Easily a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B Movie Story Unconvicing Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair I watched this movie before I watched the original story. This movie is convincing mostly because of the story line. It sounds like tall tales. In other words, not convincing as the original Planet of the Apes which do deserve an 8. This one is one of those movie I won't recommend my friends to watch except for the beginning ape chase scenes. The story falls on a couple of things that makes it difficult to accept. Time traveling through the future in an electrical storm in space seems too far fetched compared to the original movie, which traveled near light speed. The fact that the space station had a couple of "space pod" and Standard Operating Procedures, it's unlikely that any space station would be traveling around chasing space pods lost in electrical storms. Space stations' aren't built for chasing or rescue missions. They could have sent a couple of space pods, with a chimp is more plausible. The fact that humans became a slave, and yet they can speak English and talk, makes it unconvincing compared to the original movie which they aren't able to talk as the Apes are convinced that humans are unintelligent. The original movie the Apes assume humans to be stupid since they can't communicate is a more convincing story. The ending of the movie, I believe spoiled the movie completely and this is where the scoring is bad. In any good movie there are three things that's is key to scoring. The plausibility of the story, the beginning movie to pull us into the story, the ending that wraps up the entire move is the most important. The story fails on plausibility as mentioned here. Why are humans too passive is unconvincing. The fact that humans in this movie has no capacity to use weapons and being unorganized is very unconvincing. Humans are well known to be organized in times like these. The ending is really hard to rationalized into the story and no plausibility at all. It creates a Pandora's box. So if I were a movie producer and I was to do something different, time traveling through a wormhole, a black hole is more convincing, if we want to add to the old original story. The fact that a small space pod to travel long distance is unconvincing also even with all the technology in this movie. A human slavery is only possible through greater limitations of freedom as in concentration camps conditions is more convincing I believe, or the fact that the humans brains were "neutered" into stupidity, as in the removal of frontal lobe is another possibility. The fact that human slave they became a butler and a maid is an unintentional comedy and too unbelievable. The fact that they put humans in wood cage and to assume humans are too stupid to find a way to break those bamboo wood sounds unrealistic. Humans intelligence couldn't be that stupid given a slight 2000 years or more of evolution. I can continue to criticized this movie because of it's many mistake. In my opinion the movie compares slightly better than Snakes on the Plane movie. You can make another Planet of the Apes...if the story line is a plausible one, I believe and make some of the fixes mentioned here. As you noticed directors in general ignore good story writing but in animations where changes are very difficult and costly, a good story is much more possible. This is why Pixar Studios and Disney have such an impressive list of classic movies in spite of the fat that its a cartoon. While story writing can be written on the fly, it is this reason why Xanadu flopped, or in more recent one Disaster Movie was a complete flopped. The movie was made before the story and they had no idea as to the title of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I even start with this one? I saw the original Planet of the Apes a long time ago on TV but I do not remember much about it to be honest. I saw this DVD on sale in the local DVD store for ?2.50 - so I bought it. First mistake. Let me start with the director / plot. Tim Burton is a hot and cold director for me - I loved Scissorhands but not Batman. He's a gifted individual for sure but not everyone's cup of tea. Certainly not mine. However, he must have been on some sort of sedative when he decided to do this movie. The script was poor to say the least - which could have been written by a team of monkeys - such are the glaring inconsistencies and holes in it. I read somewhere that Wahlberg agreed to do this within 5 minutes of meeting Burton. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he never read the script because if he had - then I don't think he'd be so ready to sign on. The sets on this film looked just like they are - i.e. sets. Never was I ever convinced I was on a space station or in a spaceship or in an Ape city. Everything looked like it was made of cardboard and plastic and inside a huge hangar. I was extremely disappointed with Burton here as he has gone out of his way in the past for visually fantastic creations - here it is just lazy. Some of the cuts in the "action" scenes were laughable. Wahlberg supposedly gets thrown a distance of 30 to 40 feet in one scene and lands on the ground with a thud. The cut to him landing looks like he just jumped two feet onto the sand. Poor editing and no excuse for a director this experienced. Now the cast. Wahlberg - I must admit that he is a likable guy in movies normally and gets by. He always seems like a guy out of his depth though and someone punching above his weight. His brother Donnie is the more talented actor of the two - but because of Marky Mark's physique and modelling background, he gets the better gigs. Here though, he carries about as much dramatic weight as a wet rag. He whispers his lines without any tension or pathos - so much so that we as an audience do not care what happens to him. As I was watching, his character made no connection with me at all. He goes out in a pod in space, he crashes, he gets captured - and all the while I don't really care. Some of this is obviously script-related, but Marky has to take some of the blame too. Personally, I don't think he was ready to lead a movie at this stage of his career. He doesn't have an ounce of charisma. Roth - A talented actor normally - reduced to looking like "Teen Wolf" here and snarling in almost every scene to an off-screen object whilst close to the camera. He chews the scenery but underneath all that make-up he must have been so embarrassed. I was embarrassed watching him for God's sake so I cannot imagine how he felt. Bonham-Carter - The best of a bad lot to be fair. But she looked scarily like Michael Jackson that it put me off each time I laid eyes on her. But I thought she did the best she could with what she had. Warren - her part was just pure eye candy. Her character had no relevance to anything. Kristofferson - barely spoke and killed off early. Lucky him. Giamatti - unrecognisable under the make-up. Comic relief part only that wasn't even very funny.What's left to criticise here? It is not the worst film in the world - but it is not far off it. The ending just beggars belief. You will find yourself shouting the word "What???" at the screen on at least 5 occasions in the last 10 minutes - at plot contrivances that are so absurd, you'd wonder did ANYONE read the script before shooting began.A dead-in-the-water movie that in all honesty I would recommend only to my sworn enemy.3/10 - and the 3 is just for Estella Warren's lips alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton slips on a banana peel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether one is a fan of Tim Burton or not, it's undeniable he has a gift for creating atmospheric, unique movies... with some exceptions, like this one.An unworthy remake of the sci-fi classic with Charlton Heston (who has a cameo here), the film follows astronaut Leo (Mark Wahlberg), who ends up on a planet where intelligent monkeys are the dominant race and humans their servants. Leo escapes captivity and leads mankind against evil chimpanzee general Thade (Tim Roth) and his army.The moment local humans opened their mouths to speak, I knew this was doomed. Not that a remake should fanatically mimic everything about the original (for example, Van Sant made a carbon copy of Psycho and the result was absurd): I'd argue some departures are necessary, otherwise why bother? But there are changes and changes. Humans being mute and beast-like was the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY. In this remake they behave like normal human beings - it's as if a kid saw the original and grasped just the basic premise of "a planet with talking apes", with the meditation on humanity and religious fanaticism whooshing over his head.Roth, an actor who can play effectively both nice and despicable individuals, is in full villain mode and chews scenery with glee. Helena Bonham-Carter also has fun as Ari. Wahlberg is bland as the insipid Leo; much like Brad Pitt, Wahlberg is a fine character actor whose talent appears to melt whenever he plays a conventional lead. Other cast members don't have much to do, their performances overshadowed by their costumes (and, in case of statuesque former swimmer Estella Warren, by her lack thereof). Make-up by Rick Backer is exceptional, the only real achievement of the movie.The ending is terrible. First, a simian deus-ex-machina (now that's a satisfying climax!). And then, a final twist which does not and will never make *any* sense. What a sad, desperate attempt to find something as shocking as the original's brilliant twist.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't express how much I cannot stand Tim Burton's style. In fact the only film that I enjoy of his is when he actually deviates from his usual style(Ed Wood). The irony lies in the fact that the film is about arguably the worst director of all time. He totally crapped up what could have been a great Batman movie and did the same thing with Planet of the Apes. The plot was such a snorer as it trudges along in a uneven pace. It leaves me to wonder,did he ended it so crappy as to not want to make a sequel? I anticipated the release of this film for so long and when I threw away my eight dollars and fifty cents to see it on opening night i wanted to send my bill to Burton. GOD!! WHAT A STINKER THIS MOVIE WAS!!! Roth was good though, as always. Wahlberg, not so impressive. Will somebody retire Tim Burton? please?! I once read an interview with Kevin Smith, an independent film maker, and the interviewer commented that Tim Burton stated that he had never read a comic book to which Smith replied, "Well, that explains Batman."</fullReview>

This is a typical reaction of moviegoers who are kinda uptight about certain films, mainly those who deal with humanistic philosophy of good and evil, like Lords of the ring, Star Wars or the Star Trek series. Probably Dungeon and dragon players too. Kinda nerd? I thought the movie was okay, not great but Burton did a good job considering he was touching sacred material (a cult film, woooow!). And I especially like the ending which was like a finger (guess which one!) pointed at those freaks who like to have an ending that answers all questions for them and let them think they are intelligent.

		<shortDescription>Why are sequels rarely as good as the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was contemplating that question after watching remakes of The Time Machine and Planet of the Apes. The answer of course is that people always do remakes of good movies. They really should be doing remakes of bad movies, they are ones that need it.And there is no better example of the above then The Planet of the Apes, a movie that is such a pale imitation of the original that I was angry at myself for paying $4 to see it.Tim Burton is a very good director, I'm usually a fan of his work. But, with this movie he seems to have gotten so caught up with turning actors into monkeys that he lost sight everything else. The movie has great makeup, but no soul. It just reeks of being a directors vanity project. This movie far surpasses the original in it presentation of the monkey planet, i.e. make-up, effects, acting, yet is less believeable.Burton also seems to have been so consumed with his monkey cast, he forgot his humans. It can not go unmentioned how insipid Mark Wahlberg is movie. A potted plant would have held my attention as much as he did.And finally, nothing illustrates the futility of trying to remake this movie then the "surprise ending". Obviously, he couldn't do the same ending as the original, it wouldn't be a surprise. So it became necessary to come up with something totally different, but would still have the power and impact of the original. Well, I guess they couldn't think anything so they decided to go with nonsensical instead. Yes folks, the big surprise is that the movie's ending MAKE NO SENSE!!! None, zero, zippo.</fullReview>

The first Apes movie spawned 4 sequels that got worse with every film, If this one is followed by one or more sequels I really hope these sequels can beat the sequels to the original ones.

		<fullReview>Ah, Planet of the Apes. Sniff it all you want; it smells enough like a case of the remake to fall in line with this summer's sequel monotony, but upon closer inspection, it's clear that this is a chimp of a decidedly different breed.Director Tim Burton reinvents the aesthetic and tonal gestalt of the 1968 classic without ditching the original's thematic underpinnings, creating a world that is both visually fascinating and painstakingly complete.When Air Force pilot Leo Davidson, (Mark Walberg), leaves his space station in search of a test chimp deployed to survey a magnetic storm, things go awry, leading to a crash-landing on a planet where humans are enslaved by a breed of apes that are uniquely advanced, cognizant and cultured. But their refinement is little more than a thin veneer hiding their aggressive animal drives, which can lead them to the brutal treatment of their captured humans. Leo, who isn't acclimated to the Apes' tyranny, revolts against them and becomes a heroic figure and leader to the enslaved humans who know little else than the servitude and submission they have faced since birth. Helena Bonham Carter (you know, from Fight Club) plays Ari, an ape with compassion towards humans, while Tim Roth brilliantly portrays Thade, a snarling, aggressive (really pretty damn scary) ape general, who wishes to see his planet cured of humans, and his fellow apes cured of their human-derivative tendencies.Under the façade of a fast-paced sci-fi/action blockbuster lays an entirely different animal. On the most primitive level, Apes is gargantuan, pounding its fists with energy and a capacity to amaze that makes this film monumentally entertaining. But like the skillfully crafted latex ape masks through which the actors' subtle, universal, seasoned human facial expressions are transmitted, Apes breathes life of its own beneath the glaze of action. Burton paints a textured portrayal of man's struggle against subjugation, with settings and characters that are unearthly, yet dually dark, gritty and present. The director ditched the early-proposed ideas of digitally animated apes or live apes with computer-generated mouths, enlisting A-list actors instead to give each ape a uniquely human core.Perhaps the real feat here is that Burton was able to make these apes so utterly creepy and animalistic (much more so than their original counterparts) yet still found a way to maintain their human characteristics. Roth and Bonham Carter learned an entire behavioral language for their roles, complete with loping, off-kilter strides and dexterous, long-armed gesticulations. It takes a while to get a grasp of the full complexity of their movements, but once the language is understood, you quickly see how the ape dispositions intensify the actors' capacity for human emotional expression.Other apes include Limbo, a pandering human-slave dealer played by Paul Giamatti, and Attar, Thade's loyal silverback, played by Michael Clarke Duncan (who incidentally, is perhaps the only Ape actor that sounds as though he's using his normal voice). Charleton Heston makes a cameo, donning full ape regalia to play Thade's dying father, and Lisa Marie Pressley appears briefly as a snooty socialite chimp.On the human side, two words: Estella Warren. She says close to nothing (perhaps a throwback to the mute humans in the original, perhaps not). With a character that grows envious of the affection formed between Walberg and Bonham Carter (yes, a man and a chimp) Warren is left to primarily convey her dissatisfaction through looks and body language. And looks plus body are a definite can-do on Warren's checklist. Things seems a little exploitative at times; her garb is close to non-existent, and the camera, perhaps a bit too kind, but Warren certainly helps heighten the degree to which this film is visually fascinating. Unfortunately, it isn't all bananas and cream pie. The Apes script incorporates a few narrative devices that are just too convenient, such as the illogically timed event that causes the wrap-up to the climatic battle scene. Although the majority of dialogue in the film runs smoothly, certain characters (take for instance, the shifty-eyed comic relief, Limbo) are developed in a stagnant and predictable way. Walberg's pre-battle scene speech, despite its relative brevity, is still a little laughable. The re-vamped surprise ending is creatively done, carrying certain light-heartedness to it, but the film leaves things too easily opened ended. However, with a sequel planned 'open-ended' is something that was planned.Ultimately, Burton's overall design is so meticulous and aesthetically comprehensive and his ape characters, so believable and culturally complete that you can't help but be lured into his stunning visual world, which seems (if not only momentarily) to take precedence over other concerns. You haven't seen anything quite like this. The film may have aped the original, but it stands on its own two feet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot from this movie as the original had a major influence on me and is a genuine Science Fiction classic. I enjoyed this re-imagining but it was just okay - not great. The acting was mediocre - the sets and special effects were good and the make-up was of course spectacular.What really lets it down is the plot. For example, in the original film the human slaves couldn't speak, reinforcing the fact that the apes saw them as savages. When Taylor (Charlton Heston) spoke, it was a potent weapon against the apes' prejudice - the fact that he had language and thus cognitive abilities shook their entire belief system. In this movie the humans are chatting away normally which lessens the importance of Davidson's (Mark Whalberg) arrival.And could somebody please tell me what the point of the blond woman was? Sure she is beautiful, but her character just felt tacked onto the plot to provide some eye candy.I found the ending to be a big let down - again it was clumsily stuck into the film to provide that twist in the tail. It just didn't feel like it was part of the story, but more of an afterthought.Despite my criticism, I enjoyed the movie. There's some great action scenes and hey - it's Planet of the Apes! There's nothing horribly bad about it - it just doesn't live up to the wonderful original.Rent this one or wait for it to be on TV.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find a lot of movies require a second glance to see exactly what you make of them. Summer blockbusters in particular, with their expansive special effects and distracting explosions; often have to be watched at least twice in order to get a clear view.When I first saw Tim Burton's "reimagining" of Planet of the Apes ("Reimagining"? Reimagining it as what? A pile of cack?) I was reasonably dumbstruck by the scale and spectacle as to be uncertain exactly what I thought. I had it pegged down as sort-of average, with the possibility of it either being very good in its own right or a soulless, braindead money-maker. Sadly, seen again, it's the latter. By far.Watching it again on video doesn't help either. When a film is so heavily reliant on the big screen then this says a lot about its content. Without the panoramic views, we're forced to concentrate on plot, dialogue and characterisation. Which is unfortunate as there isn't one, it's rubbish, and there isn't any.There are good points: the opening space scenes are beautifully realised, shot with a cinematic grace, and not just computer generated FX thrown in your face. Also, credit must actually be given to the twist ending, which, while it may seem contrived, does credit the audience with some intelligence (the only part of the movie to do so) and is far more faithful to the source novel than any of the 60s/70s Apes movies. And there's also the scary bit that they ripped off from Jaws.Screenwriter Mark Rosenthal pointed out the redundant subtext of the original by noting "Today, I think we're living in the famous saying, 'The world will end not with a bang, but with a whimper.'" However, it's unpleasantly ironic to note that since the release of this movie the prospect of nuclear destruction is again a possibility, and the 1968 picture has once again become as relevant as it ever was. Even without this it took pot shots at racism and famine. Burton's view sees it take on only the novel's Gulliver's Travels-style ape/human reversal, with the odd religious musing and little else. So because it has less to say, it's forced to expand those issues, and basically beat you over the head with them for two hours. Every single line Helena Bonham Carter has is a corny platitude, while I almost heaved my guts at the moment where Wahlberg claims "sometimes even a few can make a difference", to the tune of a full-blown orchestra. Yes, the dialogue is the weakest element all right, and while the originals could be a little hammy, this one makes them look like Shakespeare. There's not one exchange approaching a genuine conversation throughout, and the trademark warmth and charm of the original is blown wide apart by a breakneck pace and one-dimensional caricatures. There's no time to react to anything, yet despite the pace, I also found myself looking at my watch several times in boredom.One bit of merchandise I got my hands on was "Leo's Logbook", a child-orientated intro to the series with lots of glossy photos. A short affair with just a few words here and there, it lasted less than 30 pages, though told me more about the characters and their backgrounds than the film itself did. Surely that's wrong somehow? In the 1968 film we learn that Charlton Heston's Taylor has both liberal values and is embittered, both within the first five minutes. These contrasting character traits forge three-dimensionality, yet we never get to know or care about Wahlberg's desperately underwritten Leo. Little is known about him from the movie, he's just a bland nobody with a bizarre chimp fetish and nothing else. Maybe it's that he's too young, too "pop" to really work in the expected way. Yet look at how we're supposed to believe that Carter's chimp wants a romantic involvement with Wahlberg, and that the Nova replacement is jealous... yet neither of them have exchanged more than a few words with him the whole time. Bonham-Carter (is it just me or does she remind you of Lisa Minelli?) seems ten times more irritating than I remembered, and the sexy but dull Estella Warren fails to make an impact also. I won't even mention the comedy Orang-U-Tang (the "comedy" tag a misnomer, of course) or the obligatory irritating brat.What's worse, rather than condemning humanity as the original franchise did, this movie seems to exonerate it. No longer are they the mute ancestors of their own destruction, but ? in a very Hollywood decision ? the all-speaking, innocent victims of fate. That the apes are reworked as mediaeval, right-wing sadists is also a character-lessening development, and makes Bonham-Carter's role as the sole liberal even more unlikely. Warren heads the batch of human slaves, proving that even in the wild there's still room for lipstick and mascara, if not Imac.And what of Tim Roth? Roth's a good actor, and his performance cannot be faulted. But, sadly, the character is one note throughout. Whether he's holding his dying father's hand or just having dinner, he spends the entire time angry. That's right... he keeps going ape-sh*t! Even when he meets the chimp prophet, he smacks it across some caves. Maybe that's why he's so tense all the time... he needed to spank his monkey! Tee-hee! It's violent, too. I'm not against violence, but this is just ugly, repetitive violence. Violence that only exists because there's nothing else to fill the film. I didn't remember it being so brash before, either: it seems less a coherent story, more one never-ending cacophony of noise.Two quotes from screenwriter Rosenthal, talking to magazine SFX: "the thing was given its start date and its release date before the director thought he was conceptually there; before the script was ready." "the post production on this is probably three times faster than it should have been. I think that making a film at this speeds mean that there is no time for reflection." Doesn't that say it all? Tim Burton is said to be a huge fan of the Apes movies. Maybe that's why he made this: so that Battle no longer carries the title of worst Planet of the Apes movie. If that's the case then it's a job well done. 4/10.</fullReview>

I can't imagine that Tim Burton was proud when he presented this turd to his executives for their first screening.But I did notice a few things:Marky Mark and Denise Richards must've went to the same drama club.A few under-nourished humans can put off battalions worth of Apes.Marky Mark is "special" - special because he had different clothes!An obligitory kiss with blondie - WHERE THERE NEVER WAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS PERSONALITY_LESS ENHANCED-LIPPED BIMBO.There was no tension ever in this movie. I remember the original keeping me on the edge of my seat and hating the bad guys - Here there weren't any real characters - EVERY ONE WAS A CLICHE!Some of the long range scenes looked like the actors re-used the cheesy ape suit from Octopussy (or Trading Places)!I could go on - but why waste time on this. I am looking for the next American Beauty. Will I find it in Ghost World?Save your money on this beastie - 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie of the Year Winner!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly the most unrealistic movie ever created. They abandoned the original story which is ok, if you have a replacement story. There are no 'shocks', like "the human spoke!". All the humans speak. They speak better than the apes! Yet, they are 'not intelligent'? Mark Wahlberg crashes on this planet and never once shows shock. Apes are are in control? Ok, go with the flow. The original had a nuclear war throw the apes into control. What put them in control here? Beats me. All those scientists on a science station couldn't keep control? They couldn't keep the education level up? Their computer seemed to work still. They couldn't use that? Where did the horses come from? They were on a science space station? For what purpose?These are the types of questions I kept asking myself. The answer to these questions? A script writer who lacks imagination. That's what "re-imaging" means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great film done by Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I too thought it wasn't going to be all that great a few months ago but when I saw more previews of it and tv spots I began to think it might be good after all. So I finally see it and when I came out of the theater I was very surprised about the ending it made me wonder like most people, but I won't say any more don't want to spoil it. Tim burton has done again just like with all of his other movies he has made in the past this one i think tops them all in my opinion his movies are in a eyecandy way oh and don't let me forget about the great Danny Elfman his music it so great I bought the soundtrack the next day, but I must say it's better then the original I mean Rick Baker did such a fantastic job on the make-up you would sometimes forget that those are actors up their with all this make-up on. I know that some people wouldn't agree but i hope that there is another Planet of The Apes so to speak sequel I would only see it only if Tim Burton direct's it. Well I must give this movie a 10/10 it's by far the best movie I've seen all summer long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There should be a prequel, not a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet" was, until the last 5 minutes of it, a great movie. The apes look very realistic thanks to Rick Baker's make-up design, which definitely is Oscar worthy. The actors playing the apes were superb, I almost forgot that there were humans under all that make-up, while the human actors almost took away from the movie. *SPOILER* The time travel story line is what really hooked me onto this movie. The twist of Leo being indirectly responsible for the apes creation and domination over humans yet also being directly responsible for getting apes and humans to live in peace is genius. I'm very curious as to how exactly the apes got smarter and stronger. Instead of a sequel from the absolutely awful ending, I think there should instead be a prequel, something like "Before the Planet of the Apes". I heard the rumor that 5 endings were shot for this film but both why Tim Burton chose this ending makes no sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not The Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, as a fan of the original POTA i found this movie to be EXCELLENT!!! I grow tired of hearing all the comparisons to the original. The worst complaint is that the film was not Satirical enough. This is a new movie. A satirical version of this movie already exists. Why would Tim Burton want to do another satirical version??? He wouldn't, that would be redoing a movie. This is a re-imagining! Perhaps this is why tim burton decided to create a more literal interpretation of the subject matter. And in so doing takes nothing away from the original and actually amplifies the sentiment of the original while actually maintaining a social message! It may have be in a different area and more straight forward but it still echoes the sentiment of the original. As for the complaints that the film makes no sense, it makes perfect sense. One gets the sense that much of what happened will be explained later, in a sequel. I could think of several explanations of various plot "holes" and inconsistencies. It just depends on what they have in mind. Just remember how much was left out of the original POTA. To watch that film alone without all the sequels prompts many questions. Also, I thought the small homages to the original were brilliant and fun. And, The Special effects were astounding. The makeup alone is completely worth seeing. It really saddens me to see such a backlash against this film. I left the theater actually feeling like this film stands right in line with the rest of the Apes films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tired of hearing all the complaints about this film. Burton's Planet Of The Apes reprise is ambitious, and ambitious undertakings are always subject to harsh criticisms by the unenlightened masses.Credit must be given to Tim Burton even if alone for coaxing out the single decent performance of Marky Mark's overabundant career.Superior performance by Helena Bonham Carter. Worth seeing again and again. The characters of Ari and her loyal companion the former general remain with you long after the film ends. As do many of the ancillary characters.Rough transitions between model shots and CGI can be excused due to the studios refusal to grant director Tim Burton further time.5 endings were shot and until postproduction concluded last week, just three days before release, no one was sure which Burton was electing to use. This DVD should be good. Burton is a masterful director. Here is a prayer for sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What have you done, Mr. Burton?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my friends I went to see the movie with, asked me, at the very beginning of this new version, if it had any resemblance to the original. He hadn't seen it. It was right at the time the starship of the movie's hero landed in the strange land. And I told him that yes, more or less, at this point, the movies were pretty much the same. Right there and then, similarities just vanished. The starship of this new version landed, and then the new version began to orbit around the old one, as tough admiring its excellency, but never getting into its atmosphere. The thing is that this new movie remind me of the old one over and over again, not because the latter is revived, but because its essence completely absent, and I missed it. Where the original gave us a science fiction story with RATIONAL twists of imagination, the new one develops as a succession of events that happen just because somebody said so. And when things happen just because they have to, the wonder of science fiction disappears, and we are left with a boring movie. And I heard about the `surprise' ending before I saw the movie. It is surprising, all right, but for the wrong reasons. Just when you think that nothing could be worse, well, it does. At this point, the new version just decides to give up the orbiting and finally heads for the space of oblivion. This ending leaves interrogations, not about the argument, but more like `What was Tim Burton trying to accomplish with that?'. I admire the fact that Tim Burton wanted to do something different, not just copying the original version. I mean, he dared to go against the odds and try and build something new inspired by a true classic. But as expected, he has only shown, once again, that you better don't mess with classics of that caliber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes (2001)This movie was terrific and had non-stop action from beginning to end. The scenery was very beautiful, the photography...breathtaking; the lush forest, the expansive wasteland, the dark brutish city.Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is a flyer for the Air Force on a floating base in space itching to fly out of there into the deep and do his job. But instead they send the genetically altered monkeys, just like canaries into a mine.Well Leo's furry fellow astronaut is in trouble out in space and Leo goes out there to bring him and the flying pod back in an unauthorized rescue mission. And as you can probably guess, from there things take an unexpected turn. Crashing into a simian world Leo has to fight the persistent General Thade (Tim Roth) and his army of apes. General Thade has a merciless hatred for humans which is boundless and unexplained. And so the story flows from one battle scene to another.The story is simple and therefore easy to understand; the battle for survival. The battle for freedom from slavery. The battle for dignity and self determination.The fantastically twisted ending leaves an opening for a sequel. Usually it disappointments me when a movie leaves too many loose ends for the purpose of creating a sequel; but this is not the case here. This movie and it's story is over and leaves an opening for (I hope) another exciting movie.`SweetVenom' Bob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Something to Go Ape Over!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, I couldn't resist the bad pun. Ah... finally, this summer there is a true summer movie, featuring not only the big budget, cool special effects and the action, but also a seasonable plot and acting to rake in tons of teenagers' (as well as their parents') summer-job money.While I don't know/care to discuss the budget, it certainly went to good use. The make-up effects are amazing (the make-up in the original was just as amazing when it was released, but look how far make-up artistry has come!); the big action scenes near the end featuring flank after flank of the ape army are truly a sight to behold. Unlike in the original series, there are multiple species of ape on this planet, including chimpanzees, gorillas, and even a few orangutans. All look amazingly realistic, physically way more intimidating than any "human" character could ever hope to be. It must have been a nightmare for the actors under the makeup though.Besides, looking fantastic, the apes actually act like apes! It's just so interesting and exciting to see an ape character such as General Thade yelling at someone in English, then jumping and climbing around, screeching in anger. Next to that, it's really not possible for the human actors to contend at all... I mean they're not bad, but they are easily overshadowed by the apes, especially the soldiers, who not only look menacing, but through their harsh tones of voice and shrill screeches, are menacing. It's too easy to forget that there were originally people underneath all those apes. Along with their appearance and manner, the apes' society is also interesting. There is an ape religion, with the belief in a soul (and subsequent belief that the human "animals" don't have souls). Other aspects of their society mentioned in the film include inter-special marriage (e.g. a chimp and an orangutan), a senatorial government, and humans, depending on age, sold as pets or slaves; there are even "human rights" activists. While it may not offer as much social commentary as the original series, it's still enthralling enough, and it's great that the writers decided to offer details on the ape's religion, which is also a vital part of the plot near the end. The only complaint I could offer about the society portrayed is that, like the original film series and unlike the book, the apes don't use vehicles.The unfortunate thing about summer films is that they usually end up sucking a few years later, as they are based solely on the special effects. Tim Burton and crew have broken that mold with Planet of the Apes, which holds through all the way to the twist/ending (which is different from the original, and, though definitely an unexpected surprise, just a little bit of a let down). See it for the special effects, and see it again for the intricacies of the ape society, religion and plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...it's not as terrible as "Sleepy Hollow", but it's pretty darn bad. The only "saving" grace is pretty design and excellent ape make-up. But there is nothing else - not a damn thing else - to applaud about it. I like action and sci-fi movies as much as anyone - and I don't expect them to be "Citizen Kane." I do expect to care a *little* bit about the characters - this is really just the minimum for buying into a film's world. Unfortunately, this movie only has one performance that even qualifies (Helena, naturally) - and it can't make up for a blank "hero" and a toilet-paper-ready "script." The "surprise ending shocker" is stupid because there is no explanation for it at all to be found anywhere on this planet or another. Twists are great, but they should at least appeal to logic a little bit - and not be just completely inexplicable. If you think this movie is a ten, really, you should see more movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie, though not burtons best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok let me say this outright. The people who were expecting the original planet of the apes are idiots. The original, though it had its strong points dragged on to long. The extended walking in the desert scenes were just silly. And for all these people are hanging onto, it is still just a B-movie. Tim Burtons version, which is exactly that, is tim burtons version. It is pretty silly to compare it because the whole entire movie was reworked. But people forget the whole entire original book was reworked to have some commentary on racism and nuclear war in the original movie. But back to the point. I went in this movie expecting burton to deviate, even hoping. That is exactly what happened, burton reworked everything. Thank GOD. (no offense, but the original is a pretensious, seriously flawed, sixties, B Sci Fi movie, that has alot of inconsistancies to it, but it is probably the funniest movies I know of, because of all those reasons) Let me put it this way, this is a film that burton did for fincial reasons, mainly to fund his pet projects(Ed Wood the most notable). I was not expecting greatness, i was not expecting this to be sleepy hollow or ed wood. I was expecting this to be a b-movie. The acting was bad, but who cares, all acting in action movies is bad, the exception being batman, where jack nickolson brought it to a whole new level. That and i did not think burton wanted good acting, or he would have cast his regulars. Tim burton saw this movie as an opportunity to indulge in the b-movie genre, and make a bundle(which he will). It was not supposed to be high art, just a fun sci-fi movie, and it would be foolish to expect anything else.Visually the movie is not so trademarky burton, but his touch is there. Yeah some of the battle scenes are silly, and in fact there are alot of inconsistancies. But who cares. The movie moved along very well, though a bit to fast at times. The movie alone is worth seeing for the charlton heston apperance, which is possibly, and probably intentionally on burtons part, the funniest scene in the movie. So go see it, but do not expect a masterpiece, or a loyal remake of the original(which never was a masterpiece).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luckily for everyone Planet of the Apes didn't follow Tomb Raider and the many other summer movies into the major disappointment catagory. Simply put, the latest from Tim Burton is exciting, perfectly paced, and a hoot! Rick Baker's makeup is the most convincing makeup work ever to grace the screen. The performances by those wearing it is phenomenal. Tim Roth may be one of the most engaging FX aided villains ever as General Thade. The story isn't too complicated, nor is it nonexistant as we have come to expect from this summer's crop. It lacks the predictability that makes so many FX laden movies fall on their face. This is a movie that will be mixed with critics, mixed with fans of the original (this strays a lot from the classic's elements), extremely popular with young audiences, and worth everyone's dollar at the box office. Only gripe is the casting of Mark Wahlberg. He can usually turn in an engaging performance, but he's no Charlton Heston. The ending is a mind blower, but teeters on a little too confusing. Yet, you will leave the theater wishing the sequel came out tomorrow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For any sci-fi fan, it will be hard to resist watching this movie. The original Planet of the Apes (POTA) opened the door to this new world and made it interesting and believable.This movie is very different than the original. About halfway though, it is clear this movie is going in a different direction. Basically, a astronaut crash lands on planet populated by apes (the dominant species) and humans (the ones who exist in the wild, and as slaves). Soon after he is captured, he picks up the homing beacon to a rescue ship... and the story progresses from there.That's a pretty great setup, and the story progresses in a totally different direction than the original. I really appreciated that because it made the movie all the more interesting.The special effects were one of the big treats of this movie. Not only do we get scenes with the spacecraft, space station, etc. at the beginning (unlike the original), but the character makeup of the apes was fantastic. The variety of body builds, faces, personalities, etc. was very entertaining to watch. Somehow they made Helena Bonham Carter look "sexy" as a young animal rights activist/chimpanzee... and Tim Roth look more threatening and aggressive than just about any character I've seen in the movies. Brilliant work.The ape habitats were also kind of cool. If you want to know what an ape kitchen, dining room, bedroom, etc. looks like, you'll get a peek in side some of them in this movie.All the thematic hallmarks of the original are present (role-reversal, overt prejudice and cruelty, fight for equal-rights). While they are probably not as impactive as they were given how times have change, they still deliver a sting about who unpleasant such a society is.While I wouldn't say this is as strong a movie as the original, it is still a fun movie see and worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even farther from the original concept than the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert I read "Planet of the Apes" by the French novelist Pierre Boulle as a young teenager in the early sixties, having no idea that a film based on the book with Charlton Heston (whom I have never liked as an actor) would be released a few years later. I bought if off a drugstore book rack because the title was interesting and I was crazy about science fiction. I was somewhat disappointed when the book turned out to be more an allegory on the human condition than hard sci-fi.In the book, two space travelers, one male, one female, discover a canister drifting in space. Inside it is a manuscript which, conveniently enough, they can read. The unnamed author of the manuscript tells his story: He is an extreme misanthrope, so disillusioned with the human race and man's inhumanity to man that he builds a spaceship and, along with two or three other men (no women), he travels at relativistic speeds (hence there is time dilation amounting to centuries or millennia) to another solar system, where they find an earthlike planet. It is, you guessed it, the Planet of the Apes. The apes have an advanced civilization and the humans are the oppressed animals. The humans are mute and naked and really do live like animals. The ape civilization consists of the three ape races: The chimpanzees are the scientists and the engineers, the gorillas are the military and laborers, and the orangutans are the philosophers and statesmen. He is separated from his companions, captured and paired for mating with a woman, whom he names Nova. The senior member of his crew, a scientist, is eventually rediscovered, but the scientist has regressed to a subintelligent level by having to live as a human. (His degeneration was not the result of brain surgery, as in the 1968 film, which was a big goof anyway, because the man's operation was on the right, whereas in the normal human brain, language function is in the left hemisphere.) The protagonist learns the language of the apes and becomes a celebrity among them. With this new life comes disturbing revelations: The apes behave much more like 'animals' than they would like to believe of themselves, and he discovers old documents that reveal that on this world, as on his own, the humans were originally the superior race. Their downfall came when they began to perform experiments in intelligence amplification on apes. The enhanced apes overthrew and subjugated the humans. The protagonist is appalled by the discovery that the apes can be as degenerate, corrupt and "inhumane" as humans. At the same time, his position is increasingly jeopardized as the apes' distrust of him grows, along with their fear of him as a potential leader of a resurgent human race. I don't recall whether he escapes and finds his old ship, or manages to build a new one, but he leaves the Planet of the Apes with Nova, who is now pregnant with his child and learning to speak, and travels back to Earth (more time dilation), or what he thinks is Earth, only to discover that it is now also a Planet of the Apes. Here the manuscript breaks off, and the two space travelers ponder its meaning, whereupon it is revealed that they are---surprise!---apes as well.You can see how far the original film departed from the novel, and threw in a lot of hokey nonsense as well. Yet it retained some of the flavor, essential ideas and philosophy of the book. The new Planet of the Apes has not even done that much. It is a tame (no pun intended), essentially mindless exercise in special effects. Why did they even bother?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do they bother to remake good movies?I had hoped that because the technology is so much better than it was in the 60s, that we would see the FX simply enhance an already great movie. Nope.Instead, we saw mediocre special effects and make-up trying to hold together a mere shadow of the original story.The entire beauty of the Original POTA can be summed up like this: Taylor is a human on a planet that for some reason is run by apes and humans are slaves. He longs to leave the planet and get back HOME to Earth. The shocker at the end of the movie is that he already IS home.The new Apes could not hope to compete with that and, given that so many people already know the ending, tried very hard to end with an equal, if different, shock. It didn't work.One thing about the ending (no spoiler here): you either loved it, or you hated it. I hated it. There has been so much discussion about whether or not it made sense...all I can say is that if you have to argue about it, then it wasn't clear enough. I think the movie would have been much more entertaining if the story line brought you to the ending, (like the original did), instead of throwing it at you from out of nowhere.I'm glad I saw it. Once. I'm also glad I rented it on DVD instead of paying theater prices to see it.And I'm thinking of buying the originals...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty critics!' Director Tim Burton's update of Planet of the Apes is here. Is it as good as the 1968 version? Is Charlton Heston likely to support gun control laws? No, of course not. But, that's hardly the point.A clever screenplay by Rod Serling, engaging performances and John Chambers' groundbreaking make-up - the original Apes is a sci-fi classic. However, Director Franklin Schaffner's visualization of writer Pierre Boulle's source material works on levels beyond simple aesthetics.In the late sixties, society takes a stumble. Civil unrest, Vietnam and the counter-culture - wow, man . . . the times, they are changing.Enter a film about a white, male astronaut (Heston). Marooned on a strange planet, Col. Taylor is not a happy man. In fact, he spends much of his time criticizing the arrogance of mankind. This guy makes the rock band Radiohead seem upbeat and optimistic.He encounters a group of primal, uncivilized humans. However, much to Taylor's astonishment, talking apes are the dominant species on this world. Confronted with a new social order, Heston yells, : `It's a madhouse, a madhouse.'In one of cinema's most brilliant twist-endings, Taylor learns that he is not far from home. Furthermore, man's own worst enemy is himself.Timing is everything . . . The first P.O.T.A finds an audience because it explores themes pertinent to a volatile era of activism and transformation. The movie casts a long shadow.The 1968 film is iconic. It transcends the medium and holds a place in our pop culture collective. Burton can't remake the original and hope for the same level of success.The filmmaker (Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow)understands that point. So, he doesn't try. Instead, Burton and company re-invent Apes from a different perspective.This time around, Mark Wahlberg crashes on an ape-ruled planet. Faster than Curious George can get into trouble, a primate patrol captures the new arrival. After being sold into slavery, he befriends a left-leaning, pro-human chimpanzee played by Helena Bonham Carter. Along with a group of fugitive homosapiens, Wahlberg's band must elude the tyrannical military leader, Thade (Tim Roth) and flee to safety.Burton's Apes has a quirky tone. The movie isn't as substantial as the earlier incarnation - but, it is entertaining. Take a cameo by Heston. As Roth's dying father, he playfully re-visits dialogue from the first film. Given Heston's political convictions, his anti-gun rant is deliciously ironic. Remember, he's the guy who defiantly announces before National Rifle Association meetings: `You can have my gun, when you pry it from my cold, dead paws.' Calm down, Moses.Make-up specialist, Rick Baker, supplies the latex for the simian characters. This guy has more Oscars than ?NSYNC has bad songs for good reason. Baker gives each ape its own incredibly detailed look. In a distinguished career, this film is his best work.Still, even more impressive are the actors within the monkey suits. The way Bonham Carter, Roth and their fellow contemporaries totally transform themselves with body movements, ticks and facial expressions is outstanding.Burton gleefully turns his primates loose - letting them bound across the screen, arms flailing and voices screeching. These factors give Planet of the Apes a manic energy.Although, the movie suffers when the action shifts to the human contingent. Wahlberg is acceptable as the lead. He is distant. Still, his spaceman realizes the absurdity of his situation and just wants out. Wahlberg's detachment is an interesting counterpoint to the ape's dynamism. However, the emerging star's dour delivery does overstay its welcome by the third act.The remaining humans are sadly underdeveloped. They are bland and boring. I've seen more exciting people at Republican nominating conventions.Burton ends the film with an obligatory surprise finale. The closer is hysterical. It is more abstract than the original's final scene. But, if you take the time to piece it together, the conclusion makes perfect sense.What else could Burton do? Audience expectations are high for a shocking last act. At least he answers the call with good-natured playfulness.The new Planet of the Apes is a mixed bag. It's inventive and exciting -humorous, not campy. No, it's not the 1968 version. Who cares? Burton's movie stands on its own merits. Still, Apes is lacking in just enough areas to hold it back. Oh, well - better luck in the sequel.This film is a six out of ten.</fullReview>

And many of the jokes about the ape/human role reversal are pretty funny. Thats about it.The negative...everything else. Poor plot. Character development is pathetic. We are supposed to care about these people (beyond Wahlberg?). I actually found many of the apes more likable than the humans...at least we got to know them. There are so many plot holes its not funny - they have already been mentioned numerous times prior. And finally, the ending is COMPLETELY idiotic.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite some unbelievable pod landings, "Planet of the Apes" a movie that attracted negative reviews at the time was one that is my personal favorites. A decade later I decided to pop the movie in and give it another go. Yep, I still feel the same! Love the movie, love the makeup and costuming, love the themes discussed and by all means, love the cliff hanger Tim Burton uses in the end. I have all kinds of love for this movie. Seems like Tim Burton had a vision of more movies in the Ape regime; sadly for some of us it just did not see its way through due to the entire mixed acceptance back in 2001. Tim Burton as all you readers are aware is quite unorthodox and eccentric in his directorial choices. For those of you who are not as familiar as some of us, he gave us "Alice In Wonderland" , "Sweeney Todd", "Corpse Bride", "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" "Sleepy Hallow" &amp; "Edward Scissor Hands" to name a few. If you are a reader who follows movies not by trailer but by director, 8 out of 10 have watched all of the above. "Planet of the Apes" with comparison to Burton's style is quite different. It's a Sci Fi that discuss themes of Animal Cruelty, Humans vs Nature and also if you want to be scoffer who hates this movie, a remake of classic Sci Fi from 1968. I respect classics, however what if I can watch it done slightly better. The costuming and make up is brilliant in comparison to the classic. However my intention is not to compare this with the reputed classic. 5 Stars and a round of applause for the magnificent work put in by the team with the makeup and costuming. For a movie made a decade ago this is brilliant, I have watched movies done in the past 2 years that can't even hold a candle to this effort. There is a lot of emotion that is required to be conveyed, which was a vital element to carry out the emotional wave. Giving the extra advantage of excellent facial movement makes it so realistic, never would I have for a moment felt, it is false and it is just a movie. I was right there in the middle of it all. Thumbs up yet again! As much as I respect Mark Wahlbergs performance, I have to side with Tim Roth on this one. Bold performance! The ferocity, the valor, the true determination to make every human suffer he nailed it all. Tim Roth although under so much of makeup, has his presence; he is just scared to look at. He is the meanest Ape I have seen so far. Helena Bonham Carter, who later marries director Burton in real life, was convincing and also was the vital link that ties human affection and animal cruelty on a broader perspective. Personally though I felt that Carter has so much more potential is capable of contributing more. (But wait! Am I comparing her to who she has become before she became?)We do not realize what it is like to be caged, or to be treated as pets or even as beasts, but seems like there is much to fathom from this, animals feel as much as we do. These are lessons for some of us who beat our pets up, or for those who don't leave a clean bowl of water for your dog every day. Doesn't look too great when the tables are turned does it? Also we humans don't realize that once done, certain things can never be undone (You have to watch the movie till the end to understand this). Wahlberg clearly states in the movie that we humans hurt each other way more than we hurt animals on his home planet? Have you ever stopped to think how true that it is? With such beautiful themes that are very well deeply hidden it disheartens me that this movie never got the place it rightfully still deserves. A decade is a long time, but the copies are still out there. I am pretty certain that most of the younger generations never have seen this one; just like back in 2001 I had never seen the 1968 classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK...maybe Hollywood doesn't produce movies with deeper meanings any more. *sigh*The original "Planet of the Apes" tried to incorporate some social criticism in the story. Things like 'beware of the bomb' and 'where is this technological World coming to?'. At the time, space-faring people were very much on everyones mind and PotA was part of what people were interested in.Nowadays things are a little different. The cold war and the nuclear threat are all but forgotten and people travelling into space are only of interest to some people at NASA and a group of Trekkies. When this movie was announced I was very interested in the way this remake would re-actualize this movie.Let's be short about this: They didn't.Not only didn't they translate the original into something current audiences would relate to, they also used some lines without giving it any relevance to the rest of the new story. At some point General Thade is warned about the dangers of humans...about their inherent violent nature and such. In the original this was caused by the key-event responsible for apes-taking-over, namely the nuclear war. In this new remake this warning has NO basis in the story at all! The opposite is true.The 2 endings to the story are even more unlikely and illogical. I'll not spoil things any further by describing them, but I was appalled at the complete senselessness of it all.My final feelings were: "No way!" and "Who cares?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Testing an experimental space capsule, Leo Davidson is sucked into a worm-hole of sorts and becomes lost in space, crashing onto an unidentified planet and unable to contact his mother ship he is captured by apes, who have control over the human population. Davidson plans to lead a rebellion and prevent the war hungry apes from wiping out the human population.In the summer of 2001 many films were released that were heavily hyped and were meant to be fantastic. The vast majority of them were poor ? even without the disappointment from the hyping, they were still poor. The remake of Planet of the Apes stands out as one of the biggest letdowns to me. The plot has been changed slightly but the bones of it remains the same. However we have already seen the monkey/human role reversal done before and that isn't gone into in very much detail here, opting instead for more action and drama.The main changes are superficial ? the monkey makeup is better of course and the gorillas move very fast and with the agility you'd expect from them rather than moving like humans. However this a great film does not make and all it served to do was to remind me how much better the original was. Wahlberg is OK in the lead and Roth is fantastically nasty but other than that the casting is either OK or just poor. Duncan is OK, Carter is iffy and comic relief Giamitti is misfiring the whole way. Heston's cameo is good and is actually quite funny but stands out a lot more than I suspect it was meant to.Overall this is hugely disappointing and will likely not spawn a sequel that relates directly to this film (if at all). If you have to watch one movie that has humans being ruled over by monkeys then I suggest the original is a much better option. Oh, and don't get me started on the ending! It would be powerful if it made ANY sense at all, again, it just made me think how good the original was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Concerning the "Planet of the Apes" (2001). First, let us pretend there is no other "Planet of the Apes" movie (1968). To do otherwise would invite comparisons and I want to minimize my negative review. My thoughts/summary on Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" remake is as follows:The "hero" (Wahlberg), a highly trained and professional astronaut, blatantly disobeys his commanding officer to rescue a space monkey. After being sucked into a convenient local time warp that just happens to appear outside the space station. The hero crashes his tiny space pod on some strange planet, without getting a scratch on him. He gets out and immediately runs into some oppressed humans being chased by leaping killer apes. The hero becomes a slave, escapes, and finds his pretty space station has crashed on the planet and all of his friends are dead. The hero realizes that he is on earth and thousands of years in the future. With a look of "shock"(or lack of), the hero says "oh no, it's not possible." Then the hero, using some old rusty technology and an expected plot twist, holds back an army of apes, stops the fighting, and brings peace, love, and harmony between humans and apes. The hero then hops into his sub-compact space pod and takes off for his own time period (going from Saturn to Earth in thirty seconds) only to crash land again on a planet and discovers the big surprise ending which leaves one bewildered. Watch the movie and see what I mean.In the background of this riveting tale is Helena Bonham Carter, playing a sympathetic, human loving, but annoying representative of the ape equivalent ASPCA/PETA. Tim Roth plays the ultra-violent, bellicose villain Thade, who flies/jumps through the air with the greatest of ease (Short of having a cape with an "S"). The other characters are little more than window dressing for the hero/villain/heroine triangle. Overall, a simplistic movie with great special effects. IMHO, the movie should have explained more about Thad's genetic killer ape ancestry, ape/human history, man's technological failures. There should have been believable spaceships and space suits. Also, the movie devoted too much time to the cute and funny bits of ape society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this inept script could have ever been produced withoutthe name of Tim Burton behind it. Science fiction aficionadosshould take note that, unlike the original PLANET OF THE APES,this non-remake makes no effort to lay any kind of logicalconnection between the different time frames alluded to in the plot.If you have ever seen any time travel films before, even mediocreones, you will have come to expect some logical inconsistencies(reflecting that time travel is theoretically impossible in the firstplace), but Burton seems intent on simply giving the finger to anysemblance of logic here. If you haven't seen the film yet, you haveprobably been told to expect a surprise ending; I would tell you toexpect a surprisingly stupid ending that is surprisingly insulting tothe audience's intelligence.Burton's fondness for dark sets is apparent here, but instead ofthe decadent, wildly overgrown urban landscape of his GothamCity, all you get here is sensory deprivation and an urge to nod offduring one of the film's frequent and lengthy periods of inactivity.The ape makeup, which was groundbreaking at the time of theoriginal film, has not really improved much. Some of it is quitegood (Tim Roth as Thade), but it is otherwise uneven, as is theacting.Burton makes much of the difference in strength and agilitybetween apes and humans, but the way he shows this is not byendowing the apes with natural animal-like grace, but by loadingthem onto hidden catapults and launching them into the scene. It'slaughable.The DVD has a few extras, including commentary by Tim Burtonand Danny Elfman, but I got the best laugh from the cast biosection, which gives page after page of gushing plaudits forBurton's untalented girlfriend, Lisa Marie, who is alleged to haveappeared in the film. Darned if I could find her though. Jeez, what_won't_ Burton stoop to to keep his bed warm!Rating: 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton Made Me Vomit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes (2001)" has soared its way all the way to the number one movie in the country (USA), which does not surprise me. I don't know why all the movies I happen to despise became huge successful films. Probably because the general person now-a-days is just looking for visuals, special effects, and action sequences.What happened to plot? I suppose it's dead. If you even remotely liked the original "Planet of the Apes (1968)", then don't see this mockery. It was definitely up there with, "Hannibal" as one of my most hated films.Even the score of "The Planet of the Apes (2001)" is repetitive, slow, and unoriginal - admittedly similar to the film's plot. The only surprise I found in this movie was Tim Burton's cunning idea of putting a frame of Hitler in the start of the film. The background for the frame or two of Der Fuhrer was some kind of nonsensical sci-fi blur that couldn't even logically happen in a galaxy far, far away let alone our own. However, don't worry Burton even hinted bestiality in this film (Not a surprise, I suspected it). I know that's horrible, but it's worth a good laugh... at how bad this movie was.Tim Burton: Does this movie even smell of his style? No. This movie doesn't have anything that would make me remotely think Tim Burton directed it. It has none of his early style and ideal that made his earlier work appealing and launched him into the mainstream. If you think you like Tim Burton's work and this movie's got to be good because he directed it, think again. If you liked his earlier work like, "Edward Scissorhands," an excellent film in my mind: Don't go see his remake of Planet of the Apes. It will make you nauseous and annoyed.This film eliminates most of the great ideas of its original, which inspired so much wonderment, joy, and captivation, i.e. In Burton's version every single human can talk. The ending is all wrong, distorted, and makes literally no sense. All of the appeal of the original is casted away. Even the acting in this remake is quite dull.I need to warn you again, if you liked the original Planet of the Apes, or Tim Burton's early work, this movie will make you sigh - big time. This movie is even a disgrace to the Sci-Fi genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After walking out of 'Batman and Robin' a broken man, I consoled myself with this one nugget of comfort: "Blockbusters cannot sink any lower". How wrong I was. With 'Planet of the Apes' Mr T. Burton has produced a movie which is absolutely devoid of characterisation and totally lacking in wit or imagination. The plot holes are so gargantuan that one fears the bored looking cast members may tumble into them never to return. Even Burton's visual panache, the saving grace in such uninvolving one joke efforts as 'Mars attacks', is utterly absent here. This looks exactly like what it is: slapdash, cynical filmmaking of the highest (or lowest) order.Do yourself a favour and go back and revel in the wonderfully unnerving atmosphere of the original. Or better yet watch 'Beetlejuice' and marvel at a talent gone badly, badly awry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This refers to the TV version in a 2.5 hr slot, so I may have missed some scenes.If you want a faithful updating of the original you'll be disappointed. On its own, however, this is a pretty good sci-fi action film complete with a little character development (for those who need that).In my opinion this movie did parallel the original in terms of certain basic plot points (sorry, no spoilers), but I think the parallels can get lost in the translation/interpretation.What I didn't like was that I had to be prepared for the ending by those who had the DVD commentary; we're supposed to leave the movie in a state of "Huh?", and we're supposed to assume a certain event took place which is just barely eluded to at the very end.Besides being rude, this may or may not set things up for a sequel. The original movies managed to create a final "setting-up" for a perfect cycling in time. Maybe we didn't get a perfect happy ending, but we left satisfied about the reasons behind the first movie's social setting.I believe that a sequel has to be made to explain *clearly* why the movie ended as it did. I think there's too much arrogance behind the current ending; someone is ignoring the population of viewers who aren't well versed in sci-fi versions of warps, portals, etc.Hint: When Thade finds himself in what looks like a control room pay attention to what he sees. And remember that he's no idiot. That may help at the end.And enjoy the movie for itself; try not to compare it to the original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had high hopes because all the prior movies entertained and gave us something we never seen before. We even got twists and turns and when it was over, we felt we got our moneys worth. In this movie of the same subject, they broke the cardinal rule. They made or make the audience have to work out the movie instead of the movie entertaining them. Now there are some movies that risk this and leave you in an okay state from their efforts. However, if the work to be done is too complex, far out, too detailed and involves much explanation, then it wasn't a movie at all but instead a homework assignment. We become the movie and finish the tale to keep ourselves content and to have a sense of closure. There are some good scenes, acting, and high hopes here and there. But when you expect the paying audience to have to explain a movie so they can understand what they just saw? This is not the best approach and you can forget about a comeback experience. In other words, once is enough. If one likes the Planet of the Apes world, the novel it is based on and the stars like Wahlberg, by all means see the movie.

		<fullReview>In this remake by Tim Burton (who had not the desired creative liberty), the focus is not so much on the story but more on the visuals, what makes this, basically, an action movie.Plot: the beginning resembles the 1968 movie with some added prelude scenes. A test-monkey in a shuttle from a space-lab enters a space- time rift and the scientist in charge follows him, crashing on a planet where the dominant species are intelligent apes that enslave humans; the scientist is captured but manages to free himself and from here on out the movie is escape-pursuit action until the climatic final confrontation, with some stops here and there to add short dialogues that add nothing to the story. The final sequence divides opinions, being ambiguous and leaving questions unanswered, promising a sequel that never happened.As incredible as it may seem, the 'apes' act way better then the humans. If you've already seen the 1968 and 70's installments, don't expect to find some social message in this remake. This is a pure entertaining action flick, and a decent one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In another ape universe far far away...sorry, I just hadda do it! Anyway, this reawakening of the ape universe something was left behind...like an amazing, coherent story that grabs every fiber of your being. Sure, it had the obligatory special effects that permeate todays theater world, but it also bears little resemblance to the original for which it was named. Yes, I am essentially a purist so for me if you find an equation that works don't mess with it! At least not much...this version simply did not have any of the magic, the wonder that was in every minute of the 1968 masterpiece. It felt like a pasted together puzzle of several story lines. Chimps are taught to fly souped up space pods for exploration, space storm captures pod with chimp inside, "handler" goes frantic and takes another pod to rescue chimp and gets sucked in to a space warp. OK, that's story one. Story two: chimp handler exits space warp and lands hard on "Earth", only to run into a Super chimp raiding party hunting humans as pets and workers...OK OK, so that is a sorta direct clone of the original. But the remaining 90% of the film is a third story of the handler being befriended by a "cute" female chimp who sympathizes, then she helps him free the oppressed humans. They fight a mini-war with thousands of war apes led by a deranged chimp general, and at the last second we have "missing chimp" arrive in his pod and all the warring apes bow down to "missing chimp" who just happens to resemble their God ape from antiquity...well, that takes you up to the last five minutes of the flick, which turns into a misguided attempt at irony. Not amazing, not incredible, certainly stressful to watch in its entirety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style in spades, weak in story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's remake of the classic 1968 film of the same name and in many ways the film that shows both his strengths and flaws as a filmmaker. Many have praised its visuals while also condemning its confusing story, weak characters and an ending so baffling and weird that the film would instantly jump a couple of ranks if you left it out.And yeah, there's a lot of truth to that. The visuals are great, which has always been Burton's main forte. The ape costumes are still amazingly beautiful, the set and background designs are innovative and filled with small details. The colours are great, the cinematography is nice and it's an all-around good visual experience. Plus, some of the characters are nice. Mark Wahlberg as the main character is pretty bland, as he usually is, but he's a decent actor in his own way, so I guess we could have had worse. I especially like Helena Bonham Carter as Ari, our proxy for Zira from the original film. Easily the character with the most charisma in the film.But yeah, then the flaws. The story is pretty weak. At times it simply copies the plot of the original film to the nth degree, while at the same time making lame jokes at its expense. And at times it does not do that it veers into directions all its own, none of them making much sense or serving the overall story. The third act, when we learn all the secrets behind the world, is especially weak and will leave you at least somewhat disappointed.And then there's the final twist ending that tries to up the ante from the original film. but with none of its shock value or finesse. It's simply moronic.There is value in this film. If you haven't seen the original film, you'll probably like this one fine. It's not a very clever piece of science fiction, but it's not insultingly stupid either ? aside from the ending ? and the visuals are good enough to warrant a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Planet Of The Apes is loosely based of the 1968 science fiction film of the same title that stars Charlton Heston and the 1963 French novel of the same title by Pierre Boulle.It stars Mark Wahlberg together with Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Clarke Duncan,Paul Giamatti,Estella Warren and Tim Burton,who also happens to be the film's director. The year was 2029.It involves a story of an astronaut named Leo Davidson whose spaceship crash-lands on a planet that are inhabited by apes who apparently have evolved to acquire human-like attributes like culture and intelligence.It was worth noticing that the apes have built a society and have treated humans as slaves.With the aid of Ari,Leo starts a revolution to overthrow the apes.The humans win and managed to overthrow the apes.It concludes when Leo going to the spaceship and traveling back in time and landing at Washington D.C. particularly at Lincoln Memorial wherein he witnesses a statue of General Thade instead of the late President and surprisingly a group of police,fire fighters and news reporters surrounding him. Aside from the improvement of the characters' make-up particularly the apes and the use of computers for special effects,the remake definitely is inferior compared to the original in many aspects of the film.The themes it covered was more about fight for freedom and rebellion rather than issues concerning the world today which the original covered such as the world's environment,possibility of a nuclear war and slavery.With it,it only fell trap into becoming just another Hollywood action flick instead of a film that is trying to convey an important message.Finally,the conclusion will only bring confusion as it was nowhere indicated in the story that its possibility would happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried watching this film probably about five years ago and gave up the effort about half way through. Figuring I might have been having a bad day I decided to give it a try again. I'm glad I did because there was actually some thought provoking stuff here just as you had in the original film, with ideas explored concerning racial/species intolerance, animal rights, and the concept of equality in general. Some of it was presented in clichéd dialog, which I agree can be a turn off, but if you listen attentively, a lot of it is applicable to the present day. One of the most insightful was the observation that "The human problem cannot be solved by simply throwing money at it".There's an idea that occurred to me while watching the picture I haven't seen expressed anywhere else and it has to do with the names of the principal characters. The anagram of each name has a connotation that intrinsically describes the nature of that character. For example, take General Thade. An anagram of Thade would be Death, and he was certainly the personification of violent, deadly hatred toward humans. Others I came up with include: Semos = Moses, the mythical ape who was considered the savior of his race, having insured the place of apes above humans in a 'Promised Land' of sorts.Ari = Air, as in having an ethereal quality required to bridge an understanding between the apes and human inhabitants of the planet.Even the name of Mark Wahlberg's character has a Biblical reference if you will. Davidson = David's Son, or Son of David, a name often associated with Jesus Christ who was descended from the Family of David. I haven't read the Pierre Boulle novel on which the film was based, so I don't know if these were names he gave his characters, but if this word play regarding the characters is merely coincidental, the odds I think would be astronomical.Anyway, that's what I thought about while watching the picture. And what is good science fiction if not making you think about what you're watching and/or reading? Beyond that, there's no question the time/space implications of the story lend themselves to serious head scratching. Upon first seeing the ruins of the Oberon space station, the representation called to mind the spires on the crown of the Statue of Liberty which signaled an obvious swipe from the original movie. But then we got to the crux of the Calima business, and I thought that was done pretty cleverly.So all in all, I thought the film makers did a decent job here in re-imagining the original screenplay, while offering food for thought in any number of areas touched upon in the script. Probably more so than even the awkward ending with the Thade Memorial, my biggest question was why Captain Davidson left Pericles behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why the complaints?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope that those who complained about this movie changed their minds after watching Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and all the movies that might follow.The reason i pointed this out is because Tim Burton's effort is the only movie in the franchise that has a decent script, at time almost at Shakespearean heights. In addition to that, the actors played the apes in realistic costumes. Prior to this movie the costumes were funny, to say the least, and the 2011 prequel used CGI.Personally, this movie was a huge improvement, because the only thing worth mentioning in the old movies has been the scene with Charlton Heston confronted with the Statue of Liberty protruding from the sand. The 2011 and 2014 prequels were visually better but scripts were poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake, but it could have done much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2001 remake of the original 1968 classic, "PLANET of the APES" is directed by Tim Burton and starring Mark Wahlberg as the lead character and since I'm only doing three of the PLANET of the APES film reviews, I decided to start off with this one.The sixth film produced in the Planet of the Apes franchise, it was loosely adapted from Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel of the same name and the 1968 film version. It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.The film also stars Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren Development for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised.The story is a little confusing, but it is easy to look at for me, but for everyone else, a lot of people and critics and also fans of the franchise hates this story and the ending. The ending is just confusing also, but it's easy to overlook these two major flaws.The music by Danny Elfman is just awesome and the song that plays during the end credits titled, "Rule the Planet Remix" is awesome, mixed by Paul Oakenfold and composed by Danny Elfman. The rest of the music including the opening theme music is just spectacular and the film does wonders with the music.The visual effects and makeup is just spectacular also, but Rick Baker did the prosthetic make-up effects for the apes and it is a blessing of him. The visuals are a little cheesy, but works for this type of movie.The acting, is just good and bad. The only credit that will be given to is Mark Wahlberg, his performance as the lead was amazing. Helena Bonham Carter, Estella Warren and Michael Clarke Duncan puts on really good performances as well, but they can get way too over-the- top in some of the scenes. Paul Giamatti is hilarious and he does an amazing job. Luke Eberl and Erick Avari is in the film, too, but they're performances were a little confusing. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dad. Tim Roth plays the villain, Thade and he is okay, but even then, he is over-the-top as well.Overall, with the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, it's not a bad re-imagining, but it could have done much better than this. I like and hate this remake of the 1968 original classic.Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2029, USAF astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is training chimps to fly spacecrafts on a space station. They encounter an anomaly and send a chimp. The chimp's pod disappears. Davidson disobeys orders and flies off after him. Both pods are taken by the anomaly. Davidson lands in a strange land where a human tribe is hunted by intelligent apes. He is captured along with Daena (Estella Warren) and Karubi (Kris Kristofferson). General Thade (Tim Roth) is gorilla military leader. Limbo (Paul Giamatti) is the human trader. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) is a pro-human chimp.It's got great ape style. The human in this version can still speak English. The story doesn't have the simple symmetry of the original. It is an inferior movie. There are interesting additions like Thade opening up Davidson's mouth to ask if there is a soul in there. It's got some B-movie goodness until the nonsense of the final ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes (2001): Dir: Tim Burton / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti: Pointless remake about a dominating factor higher than man. This planet is dominated by advanced apes who conquer human tress passers. Mark Wahlberg leads a team in space and they send a chimpanzee into orbit. After crash landing they are enslaved by ape warriors. Ending is a laughable mess that makes one wonder whether Tim Burton is losing his touch. This is not the superb work he demonstrated with Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. Wahlberg delivers one of his worst performances as this space captain thrust into a constant ass kicking by apes. Helena Bonham Carter plays a female ape who has compassion on him. Unfortunately that compassion boarders heavily on bestiality. It is disturbing watching these two ogle each other. Tim Roth plays a heavy tempered ape who just wants to use Wahlberg as a trampoline. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a humungous warrior ape because this is what we all call type casting. Paul Giamatti plays an orangutan meant for comic effect but the joke is on him. The makeup effects and visual elements are about the only aspect worth going ape over. Hints of bestiality are totally disgusting but the screenplay is totally monkey brained and without the complexity of the original. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a bad film but not as awful as its reputation would suggest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me of the brilliant "Not the Nine O'Clock News" skit "Nice Video, Shame About the Song", though that isn't a perfect analogy since Danny Elfman's score is one of the best things about the film! The make-up and the set design - particularly Ape City and the ruins of the Oberon - are fantastic but it has a host of other problems. Compared with the 1968 classic (my sixth favourite film of all time), the social commentary is very diluted and not particularly well done even when they bother trying to do it. In his review at the time, Roger Ebert said that, "Intellectually, it's science fiction for junior high school boys." I was 14 in 2001 and I loved it then so I think that he was onto something. He was also right when he said that in ten years time, people would still be watching the original film in preference to this one.Mark Wahlberg is no Charlton Heston and Leo Davidson expresses little to no emotion throughout the film. He's a cardboard cutout, really. He lands on a planet of apes and his reaction is basically "Hmm..." I had the same problem with most of the human characters. Daena's characterisation consists mainly of giving our hero doe-eyed looks, though the conflict with Ari has the (mostly unrealised) potential to be interesting. None of the other human characters add anything to the plot with the possible exception of Erick Avari's character Tival providing a contrast between the "wild" humans and the "housebroken" ones. They focused too much attention on giving the apes personalities, mistakenly thinking that the audience would be interested in the humans for the sole reason that they were humans.Among the apes, the best actors - almost wrote "beast actors" by mistake! - are Helena Bonham Carter as the principled human rights activist Ari and David Warner as her well-intentioned but weak willed father Senator Sandar, who appears in all of two scenes. Paul Giamatti has some good lines and is quite funny as the orangutan slave trader Limbo but, again, the character doesn't add much to the film. The usually very reliable Tim Roth is a too over the top and not all that creepy or frightening as General Thade. I think that his second-in- command Attar, played very well by Michael Clarke Duncan, would have made for a much more frightening villain. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was good but not great as Krull. Like Warner, Glenn Shadix only appeared in two scenes but managed to make more of an impression than any of the human characters and quite a few of the ape ones as Senator Nado. My favourite scene in the film was definitely Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as Thade's dying father Zaius, who is reminiscent of the character of the same name from the original film. It's quite interesting that the only ape on the planet with a gun was played by the President of the NRA! I highly doubt that Heston, then in his late 70s, would have been willing to do an entire film in that make-up but he'd have made a better villain than Thade as well. I also really liked Linda Harrison's appropriately silent cameo as the woman in the cart when Leo enters Ape City.The film was co-written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, who previously performed the same duty on the much more stupid "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace" and the excellent "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" (in which the always brilliant David Warner also appeared in a fairly small role as a liberal, sympathetic politician). The script seems like a first draft rather than a finished product. It's mostly uninspired but there are a few little things that I liked in the script such as the occasional good line, the electromagnetic storm / temporal anomaly relaying all Earth broadcasts from across time to the Oberon, the origin of the ape civilisation, the apes' creation myth and Pericles' return. Oh, and I have to admit that I love, love, love the nutty ending, which is more or less the same as in the original novel. Part of me wishes that there had been a sequel to see how they would have followed up on it! One thing that I really hated though was Leo and Ari's romantic subplot because of, you know, the whole bestiality thing. As for the action scenes, they are decent as opposed to fantastic, with one or two minor exceptions.Overall, this is quite a bad film but I don't think that it's as awful as its reputation would suggest. It's one of the only films that I enjoyed as a young child or in my early teens that I dislike now. In spite of everything, however, I still retain a certain level of fondness for it as it introduced me to the original film series, which is second only to the "Back to the Future" trilogy as my favourite film series of all time. Plus, 2001/2002 wasn't the happiest time in my life and watching it over and over again helped me forget my troubles for two hours at a time. Objectively speaking though, Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter's relationship and collaboration in almost all of his later, better films are probably the best things to come out of the film.</fullReview>

I could see further ways that it could have ended but never understood why they didn't involve the guys in the beginning. You know those guys with the shirts? Why didn't the director make us follow those guys instead of the monkeys? I can't understand the way the formated the movie to make us disoriented from reality-view, really annoying.

This addition does not ruin the series at all it just adds on a slightly prettier addition to the wonderfully awful movies we have always enjoyed.

		<shortDescription>One of the good remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many remakes suck, and are worse than the original. This is not one of them.Whether it's the music, the effects, the sets, the costumes and makeup, the story, or even the cast, this film is superior to the original in almost every way. Indeed, there are only two problems I have with the film, and they're familiar problems other people have with it. I just don't think they sink the film. (1) Where did the horses come from? The film should have answered that. (2) The ending is both unnecessary and tough to explain. For me, the film ends when the craft launches back into space.Instead of being a laughable moralization about war, dependent on ridiculously fast human-controlled speeds to get there, this is a more stripped down story about what happens when the descendants of your pets evolve capabilities similar to your own, while you're tossed about by an unknown space phenomenon. It's more watchable, and more believable.That said, while I prefer this over the original, I don't prefer it so much as to give it a different rating. Both films deserve 7/10. They are good, but not great.With the original film, it does share the flaw of failing to understand how evolution works. There is not a single "direction" for evolution, and not all species, or offspring within a species, will follow the same path. I do not buy either film's claim that non-human apes all somehow gain the ability to speak English at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie begins like "Batman": visual mysterious credits on a great musical theme from Danny, who shows his versatility with loud, brutal drums that match well bestiality.Unfortunately, the quality degrades quickly: there's a big lack of original story as it's only running, hiding, battling. Worst, this world is built on the absurd idea of having the apes learning language as they can eat bananas. The interesting moments of comparing human to slaves, of discovering a world fit to apes are just outlined. The production is cheap, the image is blurry and the cast is a big disappointment: Wahlberg does his macho type as usual, Warren is totally transparent, Carter begins her boring relationship with Tim. Roth is the only character that makes efforts to act actually like a ape.The end is a good surprise but it's too little, too late and above all it shows an entire movie behind: as some wrote on the board, during the absurd fast return trip of Whalberg, we must understand that Thades uses the second time-pod to get back on earth before Walhberg. It sounds like a good sequel much better than this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am the first to say, its only a movie don't try and analyze it like a Shakespeare play. But with the blatant holes in the script, I walked out of the movie shaking my head. How could a director of Tim Burton's character make this version of Planet of the Apes with a script that made Lost in Space (TV Series) look good.I could probably ignored some lapses of common sense in a movie but when the whole premise of the story has so many gaping chasms you cannot ignore them. The effects were good, but I would wait until they had a movie double with Battlefield Earth. That way you can feel really ripped off.Spoilers don't read on unless you really want to see this movie. When you see a movie the last thing I hate thinking is how silly, why did the hero do that. Example, After he escapes the ape city then he gets his survival kit from his ship rather than when he first crashed. The Holes - If they descended from the original space station and the only animals they had on board were chimpanzees. Where did the horses, gorilla's, orangutans &amp; parrots come from? The worm hole? It was so convenient. I can imagine the scriptwriter, William Broyles saying to himself, "gee I have painted myself into a corner here, I'll just use the worm hole, nobody knows how they work". And worse of all he did it a couple of times. Very weak writing, with no understanding of plausible continuity.Finally I could see why they were training chimps to fly the Pods (That incidentally can reach speeds 6 times that of light. (Saturn to Earth in under 30 seconds). Because lets faced it, at least the chimp could land the thing; Wahlenberg had two goes and crashed both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must thoroughly disagree with others who didn't like this one. Except about the fantastic overall look and special effects, far above the original -- after all, special effects and make-up have come a long way since 1968.It is not a copy of the original. It gives a nod to the original in several places, rather obviously, and with a bit of whimsical tongue-in-cheek; apparently Charlton Heston agreed, and I trust I need not elaborate.I actually rate this one as a 9.5, and would have gone to ten, but for the unclear ending; they were obviously looking for something that would have the impact of the Statue of Liberty showing up, half buried, as we saw in the first film; this one falls a bit short in that regard, and while I could "figure it out," it should have been more simple and obvious. It wasn't.Helena Bonham Carter pretty much walks away with this one, as she makes about the cutest chimp anyone can imagine. Again, I trust I need not elaborate; just why Our Hero would leave this world, I dunno. The two finest babes on the planet both wanted him. Guess humans aren't really all that smart, after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will give this movie some credit; it's not just a remake, which is probably the best thing it has going for it While the make-up is great, the film ends up being too serious to be campy, too silly to be taken seriously, and there are more loose ends than an unraveled sweater. (Which are sure to be tied up by the obviously sequel that the end sets up) Mark Walberg's tries to find his monkey and lands on a planet where Monkeys are superior and humans are the lesser primate. The make-up is astounding, and Mark proves to be a pretty good no-brain action star. Tim Roths is a pretty good monkey-gone-bad, but as I said before, this movies too silly to be taken seriously and his intense performance is kind of lost.After it's revealed how the monkeys got the way they were, (and why their English was so good) the plot just get's silly and builds up too a fairly laughable ending. The blond girl, Estelle, isn't bad as far as models-turned-actresses go, but her character serves no purpose other than to give 14 year old boys something to look at. Plus, even with more makeup than the cast of Cats used for 20 years, the best apes-actor is still the real thing, Mark's chimp Pericles, who gives a better performance than half his human-cousins.It's not a bad movie, it's a style-over-substance movie, but then again, so's most everything else that's at the theater. But underneath the latex it's just a campy monkey movie destined for cult stardom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton starts a bad trend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Tim Burton's 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, my first thought was of how it was totally different from the classic 1968 original. Other than a smattering of obvious character similarities, the ONLY similarity to that film that this remake has is that apes rule and humans are enslaved. Yet, while the original film's social commentary was enlightening and provocative, this remake's social commentary is done on a much more superficial, generic, flimsy level. It is nothing more than a "summer action movie", with no substance to speak of.Burton's basic premise is completely different from the original. Mark Wahlberg stars as astronaut Leo Davidson, who in the year 2029 defies orders and leaves his space station to save his test pilot chimpanzee, whose space pod gets lost in a cosmic storm. Davidson himself gets lost in the storm and ends up on a planet ruled by apes, gets captured, is enslaved, and embarks on a rescue attempt with several humans in order to find a way to get back home. The usually reliable Tim Roth plays General Thade, military leader of the apes and the great Helena Bonham Carter plays Ari, a scientist and "humanitarian", who hates the enslavement of humans. Ari joins Davidson in the rescue, which includes humans Karubi (played by the iconic Kris Kristofferson) and Daena (Estella Warren in an extremely bland and annoying performance).I find this remake to overall be very cheesy and one-dimensional. The only character that has any depth is the ape Ari (superbly played by Bonham Carter), faithfully playing homage to Kim Hunter's memorable Zira character from the 1968 movie, while sporting a unique portrayal of her own. Carter is such a great actress that she manages to overcome the flimsy material, but unfortunately, the other lead actors Wahlberg and Roth are failed by a by-the-numbers script. Wahlberg's Davidson isn't remotely compelling and doesn't have the stature of Charlton Heston's iconic astronaut Taylor from the 1968 film, who spoke for ALL humans! Davidson is rather uninspiring and selfish throughout the movie. And Roth's Thade is simply evil without any complexity.The worst character is Warren's Daena. It really doesn't help the film that Davidson is stuck with such a bland, blonde bimbo for the bulk of the it! Daena is obviously SUPPOSED TO BE like Linda Harrison's enchanting, beautiful Nova character from the 1968 movie, but I don't even think Warren is very attractive, much less enchanting. Harrison evoked more feeling and spoke to the viewer through pure emotion and expression than Warren did with TONS of dialog! But the biggest culprit as to why Burton's remake is a failure is that the premise and plot is utterly absurd. I know it's science fiction, but too many things in this movie just don't make any sense, especially the ending, which is ludicrous. Also, the movie has an obligatory, "summer blockbuster movie" comedy element that is rather unsettling, as if Burton isn't even taking the film seriously. The dialog is generally silly, including borrowing a famous, powerful line from the 1968 film and turning it into a joke. The ape planet settings looks very cheesy and fake, like a costume drama. The climax is the typical summer action fare.Unfortunately for Burton, this remake was really the beginning of his downfall as a director (discounting Mars Attacks, as he rebounded successfully after that one and I honestly only ever saw that movie once, recalling it so bad that I vowed never to watch it again!), as virtually every film he did after and including "Planet of the Apes" was a remake of a prior classic film, and so far, NONE of them have been well-received or successful. And it all started with this turd!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" is a sci-fi film that was released to theaters in 2001. The film is directed by Tim Burton, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Estella Warren, and includes a cameo appearance by Charlton Heston, star of the original "Planet of the Apes" from 1968. The film also includes a wonderful soundtrack by the talented Danny Elfman. The film has Tim Burton's thumbprint all over it with all the themes Burton typically uses in his films. Tim Burton insists that the film is not a remake, and has it's own original story. All the film does is use the same premise that the original "Planet of the Apes" did.THE STORY -It is the year 2029. A young man named Leo Davidson works on a United States Air Force space station called the Oberon. When a mission in space goes wrong, he crashes on a strange planet and finds himself in a world where intelligent and English-speaking humanoid Apes rule the world, and human beings are kept as slaves. The relationship between the two groups is very similar to the early relationship between White-Americans and Native-Americans and White-Americans and African-Americans. HOW THIS FILM COMPARES TO THE ORIGINAL "PLANET OF THE APES" FILMS -The original "Planet of the Apes" and the sequels that followed were full of political and social parables that both mirrored and responded to the many conflicts that were taking place in the United States of America during the years those films were released. What makes the 2001 "Planet of the Apes" reboot different then the original films are that the makers of the reboot took out the politics that was in the original series, and gave the audience a standard sci-fi action film of good vs. evil. The reboot does have an anti-racism theme, as well as a point that protests against general cruelty, but the reboot is fairly uncontroversial on the political level, not rocking the boat and not really challenging the mind that much. I also felt the original series had no villains or heroes - Just characters doing what they thought was right. Those films were not about telling you how to think. They were about telling you to think for yourself. The reboot however is very one-sided, and gives you the viewer a clear idea of who you're suppose to cheer for, and who you're suppose to be against. WHO I THINK WILL ENJOY THIS FILM - Kids. Boys for sure. The novelty of talking apes, the realistic make-up on the actors and actresses's playing the parts of the Apes, and the action/adventure theme of the film will appeal to them. There is mild cursing, some violence, and a few scary scenes, but nothing too bad I don't think. The one scene that really sticks out the most to me that may scare younger viewers is a scene where the lead character discovers two dead bodies of Apes, but that was the extent of horror I saw in the film. A parent may need to consider watching the film first to decide. But I think boys 10 and up will be able to handle it, and I think this is one of those films that would serve as a great attention-getter for parents to use on their son(s) to watch while they do chores.People with a thing for Mark Wahlberg will enjoy the film I think as well, and people looking for solid and fun entertainment that doesn't make you think too much will also enjoy it. WHO I THINK WILL NOT ENJOY THIS FILM - Because the film is a straight-up good vs. evil film, some people may find the film to be too cliché for them. Most hardcore fans of the original, and just remake/reboot haters in general may not enjoy it because they won't be able to stop comparing it to the older films. And movie elitists won't be able to take a film about talking apes seriously, and will perceive it as a kid's film. MY THOUGHTS - I enjoyed this film, but it took a few times to get to that point. :) I really desired to enjoy the film because I loved the original series so much, but I had to stop comparing it to the older "Apes" films. The original "Planet of the Apes" is a classic, and very hard to beat. It's best to judge the reboot as it's own film. What also helped me enjoy the reboot more is I read the book that the film was based on, and was able to appreciate the film more since the book went into greater detail and explained what the character's thoughts and feelings were. Visually, this film is beautiful. It plays a big part in why I liked it. It also has several "nods" to the original Ape series. I loved the soundtrack by Danny Elfman as well. I felt his music summed up the emotions that many of the characters were feeling. All and all, the film is just a fun roller coaster kind of a film. What it lacks in some emotions, and deep thoughts, it makes up for with the visual effects, and serves as a great and fun summer blockbuster/popcorn and soda/live-action comic book/time-filler film that I think is entertaining enough and will keep you entertained. Fully accept it for what it is, and if you can appreciate awesome visual effects and make-up in movies, you're in for a ride, and you'll have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton does 'oddballs in outfits' better than most, not this time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not this tale of a time-traveling astronaut faced with a civilisation ruled by super-evolved apes in an alternate universe is director Tim Burton's most straightforward film yet.Leo Davidson's (Mark Wahlberg) love for his monkey impels him to pursue it through a space anomaly that propels him forward thousands of years. Leo finds himself on a new planet inhabited by various types of monkeys, all highly evolved and English speaking, which is a plus? But they aren't alone on the planet. The jungles and remote areas around the monkey settlements are rife with humans, some more opinionated monkeys say 'infested'. Almost immediately upon landing on this new planet Leo is captured and bundled in with various other newly nabbed humans to be taken to Monktropolis (not really but it should've been) to be onsold to others.This is where Leo learns of the basic role reversal that this particular 'planet of the apes' experiences. The undisputed rulers of the land are all hairy and like bananas. Depending on their background or upbringing they all deem the humans as potential equals (best case scenario), slaves and house help (middling) or vermin to be exterminated (worst case).The obvious parallels between the current human / animal relationship is constantly and often clumsily highlighted, leading to 127 too many 'tee-hee, they're just like us' moments.After introducing the few main monkey characters including ruthless army leader Colonel Thade (Tim Roth), a slave trading orang-utan played by Paul Giamatti and his human friendly daughter Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), Davidson and a few humans escape from captivity and with Ari in tow head to the badlands, hoping to find answers to questions that needn't be asked.The last hour or so in this uneven two hour monkey-fest descends into a straight up actioner, and not necessarily a good one, the 'twist' ending straight up sucks and is likely the reason that a sequel wasn't even considered, and Burton shows that as a story-teller he does great visuals. Speaking of visuals, the sets are all immaculate and lush, the monkey makeup is for the most part excellent ? especially Tim Roth ? and the costumes are all well made, the CGI was wisely limited given the limitations of the time and doesn't stand out too much for the wrong reasons.But all the above merely makes Planet of the Apes an immaculately presented, well acted confusing and frustrating effort. After taking so long to ensure that Thade is the bad guy he is never called upon to do much with all his pent up rage and evil, and just why a monkey driven civilisation is such a bad thing is never addressed.After all, lying around scratching yourself and eating is hardly the worst way to go is it? Final Rating ? 6.5 / 10. A couple of decent scenes and some creative visuals can't overcome a bland and often lost plot. Tim Burton does 'oddballs in outfits' better than most, not this time?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to the original Planet of the Apes, this remake by Tim Burton is OK. I don't like the fact that this movie had the sound of bones breaking apart constantly. Also the ending was completely different, compared to the original. Also the setting of what happened to the astronaut that landed on the planet of the apes, was totally different! Tim Burton did an OK job creating this remake, but did things a little differently. He even named the astronaut differently. If you hate remakes that don't follow the story that well, don't see this. Also Tim Burton made the astronaut do something dumb. He did a really bad deed and that's what made the planet of the apes. It was his fault. Otherwise this was a good movie. I still think Tim Burton still could've done a better job though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with many films is that when they have been remade from an original title is that people expect it to live up to the previous film and also to be based on the original. This is not the case with this film on any of the above points. Tim Burton did an excellent job creating a unique film which is not like the predecessor and also to make use of the acting talents among the cast.The main star of the show of course is Mark Wahlberg takes on the role of Captain Leo Davidson and portrays the role excellently. His interaction with the apes and humans takes on interesting twists as the story progresses but he gives a solid performance and his unusual but interesting relationship with Ari who is played by the very talented Helena Bonham Carter who always gives a very credible performance is very intriguing. Ari who is of a important family ( the daughter of a senator ) is what can be described as an idealist which is a minority within the Ape culture within the film. She reaches out to the humans and in peticular Wahlberg as he is dragged into this conflict which he does not really want to be a part of.The supporting cast within the film are excellent and Tim Roth who plays General Thade does what can only be described as an excellent and versatile performance. Displaying constant anger towards humanity only to be further angered with the predicament of his father. A lot was weighed on Thade within the film due to his family being ancestors of the first ape on the planet ( Seamus ). His trusty friend and deputy Michael Clarke Duncan is very well known for the role he played in the Green Mile showed just how good of an actor he is in this film due to the fact that he had to portray a range of emotions while obviously being made up into an ape costume which would of taken a substantial amount of time. He is his trusted friend but being a devout follower of the faith within the Ape community which in the end gives him a massive decision to make. Estella Warren who plays Daena who is a human 'rebel' in the film has a major part to play in the film and appeals to Wahlbergs human side constantly while obviously having confused feelings for him.Throughout the film apes are closely linked to ourselves and on several occasions their are very clever pieces of writing to alert us to the common links between ourselves and apes. Also I believe the film is used to have a sharp dig at some of the aspects of our society. Also with unique ' Ape' humour and their take on human traditions and games is excellent to see what an ape society could be like if Apes ever evolved.In all this film is not like the original and viewers should not compare it to it. This film in its own right is a solid watchable film which has a bit of everything an all round fan of films would like. Drama, suspense, action, slight romance, comedy and above all putting the thought into our heads of ' What would it really be like if Apes had a society or planet.' Well I asked myself that and it scared the hell out of me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great make up but emotionless and uninspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 3002 an astronaut crash lands on an alien planet. This world is ruled by talking apes who treat human beings as slaves and the astronaut must find a way to escape the monkey madness and mayhem.Remake, re-imagination whatever you'd like to label it as, Planet of the Apes (2001) is inferior to the original 1968 film and as a standalone piece of entertainment in almost every way.That said, the make up is excellent, Tim Roth as Thade is fantastic, Colleen Atwood costumes are notable and Danny Elfman's thumping score is an achievement. The spaceship sets and on the location night scenes have a unique atmosphere and edge about them. Even Mark Wahlberg tries his best to handle the half-baked script and there are a few welcomed cameos from some of the original cast. On the flip side there's some choppy editing, an uneven story, the ape city and the sandy finale are emotionless and uninspiring. Slipped in is some unnecessary humour, usually supplied by Paul Giamatti (aptly named Limbo) and you never feel any danger or threat from the apes apart from Thade. Also, there's no likable characters to really root for. Nothing can save nominated director and visionary Tim Burton's incarnation of Apes.The fist ten minutes and the last two are probably the most attention-grabbing of this version but with an estimated budget $100,000,000 there's no excuse for the travesty in between.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A forest planet for apes DOES make more sense than a sandy desert world, tho this is one of the few tweaks to the original that qualifies as any sort of improvement.Putting the "origin" story in the hands of goth cartoonatic Tim Burton is almost as misplaced an idea as it was to have Rod "Twilight Zone" Serling script the original version (very few of Serling's ideas, words, and social commentary actually made it onto the screen, despite him usually being cited as "screenwriter").Perhaps this franchise should instead be restarted with a do-over, as in the second Hulk movie that attempted to cleanse the public's palate of Eric Bana(l) ? how cool would it be to see Remake of the Apes by Terry Gilliam and the crew behind Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth? Ooooh, or now that Sam Raimi is off Spidey Four?.</fullReview>

Your answer will be greatly appreciated. The movie is overall good for a fiction but I think can be made with a fantastic story in sequels. I do not think this is a remake of the 69 movie.

Mark Wahlberg looks lost in the lead. He lacks Charlton Heston's personality and intensity. The fight scenes are incoherent but slick. The final battle's resolution feels like a cheat. To make matters worse, there's an unnecessary epilogue which left me shaking my head. This is probably a case of being too clever by half. The film is better avoided.

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first good comment for a film is great make-up, then you know your in trouble. The Planet of the Apes remake is no where need as good as the original film. It was filmed by Tim Burton, but he really was just a gun-for-hire, a film that was not made with his usual Gothic style.Planet of the Apes is set in 2029, and focuses on Leo (Mark Walberg), a US air force pilot based on a space station. On the station the air force use apes to help do tasks and pilot small pods. A wormhole opens and one of the apes is sent to investigate. When it seems that the chimpanzee was in trouble Leo follows the apes through the wormhole. After going through it Leo crash-lands in a strange jungle and encounters humanized-apes. He is captured with other humans and sold to slavery. Leo is brought by a human-sympathiser, Ari (Helena Botham Carter), and with other humans escape from the city. This leads to them getting chased by the ape army, led by General Thade (Tim Roth).As I say, the make-up by Rick Baker was very good and truly Oscar-worthy. The special-effects were good, and there was some good action scenes. However the film was lackluster and really a by-the-numbers affair. There was a poor script with this film, and the story telling was nothing like the original film. There was nothing deep about this film and just shows apes as evil and humans as good. In the original film humans were neutral and all except Charlton Heston were mute whilst the apes were more of a mixed-bag. The original Planet of the Apes was seen at time as a satire, for example the backwards issue of not teaching the theory of evolution. In this film the idea of religion was decent, but could have been more. The remake was really just a chase movie. The acting for the apes was good and well casted. Helena Botham Carter is always good and Tim Roth loved playing the evil general. Michael Clarke Duncan was also decent in it. However, the human actors were not so well-developed and this film was not Walberg's finest hour. I also didn't like Paul Giamatti as an Oranga-tan slave trader, he was only in the film to add comic relief. The other major problem with this film was the ending. The original had a great ending which everyone should know. This film's ending was sub-par. I did not like how the battle ended and the aftermath of the battle (similar to my opinions to X-Men 3). Everyone has also criticised the plot-twist at the end.I admit, when I was younger I did enjoy the film from an action-adventure viewpoint; but even then I did not like the plot twist. However, this film does have it fans like Mark Kermode and Richard Roeper.One to miss in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no threat to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest version of 'Planet of the Apes' is an interesting misfire. It has a lot of ideas, good and bad, and seems unable to distinguish between the two, and ends up emphasizing the bad ones more than the good. In a very broad sense, it follows the general idea of the 1968 film, that of a world where apes rule and mankind is considered inferior, and of a time-travelling astronaut who becomes stranded there. The apes behave quite differently in this film though. They are apparently meant to behave like real apes, aside from the fact that they are more intelligent and can speak. So they growl, screech, roar and leap all over the place when excited. An ape army leader, General Thade (Tim Roth), is particularly savage in his manner; the other ape characters seem generally less so. Mark Wahlberg plays the astronaut, Captain Leo Davidson, who is stranded on the planet. He has one of two reactions to any situation- annoyance or confusion. Or both. His one-note, furrow-browed performance doesn't allow the audience much emotional involvement in his plight. As the female ape who cares, Helena Bonham Carter's character Ari very much recalls Dr. Zira from the earlier movie. Here though her interest in Leo seems much more than a professional or humanitarian one; she obviously has the hots for him but don't worry, nothing along those lines ever happens. Carter gives far and away the most credible and nuanced performance, however her ape make-up is far too 'cute,' and provides a constant distraction. Perhaps the main thing missing from this 'Planet of the Apes' is a hero. Wahlberg is definitely no Charlton Heston and it's apparent the script never intended him to be. In fact, despite a few back-and-forth gags vis-a-vis human/ape behavior and stereotypes, it's hard to know exactly how this film wants us to feel about the planet's society and its treatment of humans. (Probably the funniest line in the movie has to do with getting rid of human 'pets' before they reach puberty- "Believe me, you don't want a human teenager in your house!") The huge battle between apes and humans at the end is pointless and unsatisfying, and the tacked-on epilogue is just downright stupid and reeks of desperation to find some kind of clever ending. Rod Serling would not be pleased.</fullReview>

A kind, female ape called Ari (Bonham Carter) sees something different in these humans, and plans to help them in whatever they need to do.Even with wonderful performances by the actors, a small amount of action and a poorly crafted ending makes this version of the classic ends up as one of Burton's weaker films.Are you trying to put me out of business?

		<shortDescription>What have you done!?!?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh god no! why!? Planet of the apes is such a classic ground breaking film. It's a true masterpiece because it said more about ourselves &amp; society then any other movie, so when you try and remake it your really asking for trouble. The expectations would be so high that such a film would be doomed for failure, which is kinda what happened.I don't care what anyone says, it's always a bad idea to remake a classic like Planet of the apes, hell look what happened to Psycho! it's just better off not to be remade. Heres why this movie ultimately failed: For one thing this really doesn't fit directors Tim Burton's resume. Tim Burton has done masterpieces like Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish, etc. So how does a Sci-Fi Action movie fit his bill? I give him credit for having the balls to try but come on! The Lead character (Mark Whalberg) was stupid, Shallow, Arrogant, and bone headed. Whalberg could never fill in the shoes of the late great Charlton Heston. Heston was Larger than Life, Whalberg is kinda annoying in this film. Besides him most of the acting is shallow &amp; over the top. Seriously the dialogue is ridiculous, were the screen writers monkeys or something. The best performances by far were Tim Roth &amp; Michael Clarke Duncan, they were the only bright spots in the film. I thought the Make up was fantastic and worthy of Oscar consideration but that's it for the positive's of this film.I've heard from many people who like this movie and say don't compare it with the original. Of course were gonna compare it to the freaking original! They both have the same titles and similar story what do you guys expect!? My problem is that there are many references to the original, but this film lacks any soul or message that the original had. The original made a serious political statement on society and where were going in the future. This remake is basically a way to cash in. It lacks any of the magic of the original, It doesn't take itself seriously, there are way too many moments of comic relief, The ending made no F*****g sense, and it's just totally forgettable.Planet of the apes probably should have never been remade. Perhaps with a different director, and definitely different writers, a Remake could have been meaningful. Unfortunately this film is a major disappointment, and is totally forgettable. 10 years from now we will still be talking about the original, and the remake will be largely forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT Burton's best film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes come in all shapes and sizes. What's the reason for making remakes of the classic movies that fitted well? Some remakes get to show a different side of view like Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear in 1991 where rather than showing a happy family in peril (like in the original 1962 classic), Scorsese shows a dysfunctional family filled with anger and a disease where it made audience applaud for De Niro's character.Tim Burton is known for making movies in a goth emblem from Beetlejuice, Batman Returns (the best of his work), Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and much more. Now he directs this 1960's classic about how a man from space gets stuck in an island filled with talking and vicious primates. Mark Whalberg is Capt. Leo Davidson who doesn't do much except try to wow women with his boyish good looks where one of his lab chimps goes inside a space rocket and leaves the space station where he goes into another planet. Leo tries to find his pet until he realizes that once he arrives everything is upside down with humans in cages and use for enslavement while primates (Gorillas, monkeys, orangutans, etc.) rule the planet. The leader is General Thade (Tim Roth, who stands out) who wants to abolish all humans from the face of the earth. His henchmen involves the volatile Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan), Limbo (Paul Giamatti) the fool, and sweet Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) who crushes on Captain Leo.If you seen the original movie about how the humans and some of the chimps fight off the bad primates, there's a twist in the ending. There's no enthrallment, no cheers, it felt as if certain scenes from the trailer worked rather than the film itself while breathing in relief after I walked out of the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. SPOILER. The only way this movie &amp; ending makes any sense is if the planet was earth all alone...Leo is not aware that he traveled in time...AND if he traveled at the end, NOT back to his own time, but into the future again (or as my husband insists into another dimension which would not work because the anomaly was a time warp not a dimensional warp or none of it would have taken place.) Anyway, if you go back in time and make sure that you and all the other humans don't exist, you would then never be born and therefore couldn't go back in time to change anything. If he were on earth the whole time the future aspect works better -- so the readings on the space module were shown rewinding in time in error. Why do that? There is not the remotest chance that someone could go through a time warp and find the exact time he left and get back to his home era and place (hitting it exactly would be like throwing a dart from earth at the stars hoping to hit a specific one.) I can only assume that somehow Thrase got loose, crazier than ever, and finished the task of killing off all the humans. Sorry for any misspelllings.Also why would Washington DC still exist and be the same as it was only with apes instead of humans? How would they even know to put Thrace there except they tore down Lincoln and erected their own statue in his place. The similarities could not have been random. The only other possible explanation of the ending is that there really were no people at all and this astronaut is dreaming the whole thing. I hate that premise...it's a cop out.Also, where was his chimp friend in the module those few days? Past, present, future? Could he have altered the course of evolution somehow? Evolution, as far as we know, takes more than 2000 years anyway...billions of years to develop language and speech, too. So DUH.The movie was fabulous as far as costumes, acting, cinematography but the plot was terrible and awfully unsatisfying ending especially is you were expecting something like the awesome surprise ending at the end of the original Planet of the Apes which was an explanation not something that created total bafflement and left you wondering what the H***?Also, will the message about being humane to humans and apes, why didn't they list the names of the real chimpanzees in the movie on the cast and credits? Who played Semos etc.?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending Ruined It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the year 2029: Astronaut Leo Davidson boards a pod cruiser on a Space Station for a "routine" reconnaissance mission. But an abrupt detour through a space time wormhole lands him on a strange planet where talking apes rule over the human race. With the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari and a small band of human rebels, Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Gorilla Army led by General Thade and his most trusted warrior Attar. Now the race is on to reach a sacred temple within the planet's Forbidden Zone to discover the shocking secrets of mankind's past - and the key to its future.I was really looking forward to this film and finally, I've seen it. It was a good movie, but the ending ruined it. Let's start at the beginning. The score was appropriately themed with the movie. It was wonderfully cast by great actors and actresses. The action and story was good.Well, what's wrong with the ending? It's one of the most pathetic excuses to leave open a sequel (AKA: The cliffhanger). Ugh, if only that would be different, I would recommend this good picture. The one liners were cheesy but I didn't mind it. The makeup effects were excellent (you couldn't tell which actors/actresses were which). Some CGI shots were also pretty good.I like Tim Burton's look on the whole world is great. The plot was surprisingly complicated (not like a mind puzzle, though). Mark Whelberg plays one handsome protagonist. Tim Roth plays a surprisingly creepy and angry antagonist and Helena Bonham Carter's performance was really sympathetic. And last but not least, Paul Giamatti gives a great comedic role.I'll say it again: The ending ruined the film. I hated it. Still, if you want to watch an entertaining movie with some great action and story, go ahead and watch it but be aware of the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally Despised, But If You're Not A Fan Of The Old 1960's Originals, This Can Be An Entertaining Two Hours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The modern remake has two purposes, A. to modernize the setting, characters, film technologies, etc., and B. to generate interest in the original work it remakes. The latter is used only when the former is weak and they have no idea how to really make the remake a better attempt than the original. This is one of those times.The main problem with this work is not the other the top apes, the shortened story line, the effects, the story itself, or the premise. The problem with this work is that Mark Walberg, though I do like him as an actor, is NOT a lead actor. Sorry Mark, but you're not. Mark Walberg is a great supporting actor, but he does not bear the presence on screen to bolster any movie, unless it is something small and weak enough to make him seem stronger. It's not his acting, it's his presence, or lack thereof.As far as this film goes, he IS the weakest element of what otherwise could have been a successful attempt, but Burton's works seem to deteriorate in the third act, with few exceptions, thereby calling for a strongly-written ending, something completely unexpected, or something totally over the top, in order to strengthen his inability to keep it together. Sleep Hollow is one example of a Burton work which does not fall into that generality, but only barely. A good example would probably be Ed Wood, which was bad enough on its own, and for other reasons.The reinvention of the Planet of the Apes was generally despised by Baby Boomers who loved the original campy, sometimes horrid Apes run, by virtue of fond childhood memories. The idea of combining several of these "beloved" works into one movie failed to generate the positive response the studio hoped for, and even served as a catalyst to bring down the work entirely, were it not for the name Tim Burton.As it is, this work went on to almost quadruple its initial budget, but the studios listened for once, and did not continue on with this line. At the base, this whole work was weak, from script to post production work, and in every way in between. So why the 6.8 rating? Because it served well to make younger audiences seek out the originals, and in spite of it all, this work IS entertaining! It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just not Burton!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A few good moments and some fine make-up work, but not Burton's very best movies. Director Tim Burton, so far, has started and continued a promising career as a Hollywood filmmaker. So far, his first films I saw was "Beetlejuice" and "Batman", both are well-done. Burton continued such masterpieces like the sequel "Batman Returns", "Edward Scissorhands" and the highly acclaimed "Ed Wood". Even his dark comedy "Mars Attacks", which proved a little different from his other films, is still a great funny entertainment, which was a little better than the too-serious "Independence Day". Besides, when it comes to Burton's different film, it can only be this, a remake of the classic adaptation of Pierre Boulle's classic "Planet of the Apes".Just by looking at the results of this film, I'm sure that Burton was out of place here. No matter how brilliant he is as a director, the epic genre is something he's not in to. His films are usually the bizarre, or fairy tale-like films, combined with some dark comedy and satire. "Planet of the Apes" has none of those. It's a full-blood epic that revolves around man battling a more intelligent species that they weren't aware that will out-evolve them. In other words, the plot for "Planet of the Apes" is darn serious. Burton, most usually don't take everything seriously, and likes to look at the weird side. Since this film has no room for any of those, it's easy to see a failure. The make-up effects by Rick Baker are truly superb, giving each Ape character its own different look and personality. I guess that more than makes up for the films blander human characters, say Mark Wahlberg as a bland, often unconvincing action hero. Certainly, Tim Roth as the overreacting human-hating ape Thade, Helen Bonham Carter's human-loving ape Ari and many of the other simian co-stars steal the show, providing some terrific performances while under that heavy does of make-up. It ain't Burton at his definitive best, and PLANET OF THE APES certainly doesn't end being the summer's biggest blockbuster (even JURASSIC PARK III has more to offer than this). An intriguing yet misguided disappointment. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

Yep, cool CG, adequate make-up (I'm not as impressed with the make-up as are others) and an uncredited cameo that made me smile when I realized who it was under the make-up. Aside from that, I can't think of anything else that's noteworthy about this movie.As I watched the remake of Planet, my mind began to wander.... I lost interest in the movie and was preoccupied with making a mental list of crappy movies that must've "looked good on paper." That is, instead of screwing up classics like Planet, go back and remake old movies that had potential, but didn't come through for whatever reason (direction, editing, cinematography, screen adaptation, etc.).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a Tim Burton fan since day one. I actually own "Frankenweenie", and I've watched it about ten times. Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. Edward Scissorhands. The Nightmare Before Christmas. I could go on and on. I love the guy. Then he made "Batman" and "Batman Returns". I winced, but I managed to get over it enough to enjoy "Ed Wood", "Mars Attacks", and "Sleepy Hollow". I had almost forgotten the pain I felt at realizing I paid good money to see Danny Devito drool for two hours.Then Tim Burton went and did it again. He turned out a ghastly piece of garbage, and gave it a sacred name--"Planet of the Apes".Where do I start? Timmy boy screwed everything up right from the start. The plot is too convoluted. The makeup is impressive, but it can't make up for bad writing. Then there's the plot holes. The apes have mastered the art of warfare but can't figure out how to get across a pond. The humans run around in what look like costumes from "Caveman", yet they speak modern American English. Mark Walhberg looks like he's trying to escape from the movie, not the planet. And the ending--WHAT THE &amp;*$%# IS GOING ON??? Rod Serling is rolling over in his grave.Oh well. Maybe if I watch "Big Fish" a few dozens times I'll forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was first out, five years ago. I am often skeptical about remakes. This one was Okay, and worth seeing. But since that time, I have several times noted that "Planet of the Apes" was playing on one of the cable/satellite channels, and then been disappointed to find that it is the remake rather than the original. I might have watched it if it were the original. I have not yet felt inclined to re-watch the remake.Sometimes a remake is better than the original. I have never seen the original "Maltese Falcon" with Ricardo Cortez, but the remake with Humphrey Bogart is probably better. Everybody remembers the remake, many not even aware that it is a remake. I hope that, when we remember "Planet of the Apes," we will remember the original and not this lesser remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton did a really good job of "bringing the world of the apes to life". No doubt there. Nor do I have a problem with the acting, special effects, or anything like that. It's a good movie on purely technical terms, but what I hate about this movie is how it completely ignores the meaning of the first movie.The first movie just had such a mind blowing effect. Sure there were some corny ape costumes and funny dialog, but when you saw the end and realized that the planet of the apes WAS EARTH, everything came into perspective. It meant something, and you were changed after you saw it. It made you think.In the remake though, there is no indication that the planet of the apes is Earth. And whats more, more humans can talk. At the end there is no surprising twist. Its all quite predictable. Listen, I know it would have been hard for the makers of this movie to use the same ending. It loses all of it's surprise now that everyone knows how the movie ends. But for god sakes, if you cant make an awe inspiring twist, then just don't do the movie.So if you like battle scenes and pretty colors, go watch this movie. If you want to have your mind blown away, watch the old one. It's more artistic, and its better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually outstanding but poorly scripted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film is visually far superior to the original from 1968, the plot and characters fall far short, due mostly to a poorly written script and some wooden acting. Burton's style is out in full force on this one, and it works very well for the film, but the plot dives into action when it should be focusing on plot &amp; character development. The first third or so of the movie works very well, homaging the original while retaining its own style. Unfortunately, the story falters and the suspense, horror, and sci-fi thrills - which were built up very well - are sacrificed for the sake of big action scenes. The final battle is a complete mass, topped only by the unbelievable, albeit intriguing, ending. The twist defies logic in all its forms, but it's still cool to see. A disappointment, to be sure. Something tells me this would have worked much better as a sci-fi horror/thriller than an action/adventure.There are some intriguing concepts at play within the film, mostly dealing with the evolution of the apes and their culture. The fact that they all evolved from the monkeys that the humans took with them is quite an ingenious idea, made even more so by the fact that the apes all worship these simple monkeys. A nice jab at our own religious beliefs when Ari states that their story of creation is nothing more than a fairy tale. The ape culture is interesting because of its apparent similarity to, yet stark difference from, our own - seems to suggest that evolution turns out the same regardless of species. A thought, though - if the apes evolved from the monkeys who rebelled against the humans, then where did the humans on the planet come from? Definitely a plot hole. Still, the overall concept is quite good, marred unnecessarily by the poor storyline.Technically, the film is superb. The makeup, costumes, production design, music and special effects are all top-notch and very cool. The apes look, act, and move like real animals, not just humans in monkey suits. The score, especially during the opening credits, is excellent and quite appropriate for the film. The ape village is very Burtonesque, which suits it well. Some of the early scenes are startling in their dark beauty. Most of the cool shots in this movie are in the first half, save the final scene. The second half goes awry with silly battle scenes and lame attempts at character development. Once again, the script is to blame. The acting is all over the place, ranging from scenery-chewing (Roth) to mediocre (Wahlberg) to downright bad (the blond chick). In general, the apes seem to do a much better job than the humans - not sure why Burton felt the need to make the humans talk in this one; the muteness of humanity in the original is one of the contributing factors to its greatness. The only human that should matter in this film is the lead character - the rest of the humans are just animals to the apes, and if they can talk, it ruins the idea. Still, the film looks beautiful.All in all, this was a great disappointment. A director as visually skilled as Burton, a classic film just itching to be remade, and loads of money for effects? It's too bad the script fell far short - this would have been a modern classic. Still, the first half or so is great to just look at, if you ignore the inane plot and annoying characters. The twist, however cool, is nothing more than a sorry attempt to top the original's ending - but it's not happening. Burton should have just stuck to homaging the original ending, rather than trying to beat it. Maybe have Wahlberg encounter an ape Statue of Liberty - that would have been cool. Overall, a beautiful film marred by a poor script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is Tim Burtons remake of Schaffner's "Planet of the Apes" from 1968. Mark Wahlberg surely was not the best choice for the protagonist. Take a look at old Heston in 1968, he did a great job. He's a leader, a strong man with authority. Mark Wahlberg lacks those charisma. Compared to Heston he looks really poor - a half-grown boy trying to command. The rest of the film looks like a more or less solid film. But Tim Burton likes to show some weird things in his films, but this time it made a medium film worse. I am talking about the unrealistic end of the film (!!!). In my eyes it was not logic and useless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Nightmarish World of Clever Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An energetic, adrenaline-charged and slightly surreal remake of the classic '68 original, still based on author Boulle's novel (oh, someone preferred the term 'reimagined' - as if 'remake' is a dirty word now - too late for such pomposity at this stage). But we can imagine what director Burton's penchant for nightmarish landscapes and dark fairy tales would look like if imposed on the well-known Planet of the Apes storyline. With such preconceptions, it's not at all a surprise what this film ended up becoming - in fact, it's fairly predictable, perhaps its biggest weakness. It's no surprise that many of those crowd shots of soldier apes here resemble the scary monkey-things from "The Wizard of Oz." Ironically, the first drawback for this version is its faithful adherence to the novel; the hero astronaut (Marky Mark) in this one really does travel to another planet, where the inhabitants (ruling apes &amp; underdog humans) speak perfect English. The explanation for this bizarro planet and its presumed natives in the final third is not nearly as elegant as the logical one in the classic '68 film. We're asked to go along with the fanciful concepts and not think it out very much - this is fairy tale madness, after all, dressed up as science fiction for the masses. Burton seems to be in conflict with himself here - at once the eclectic stylist at odds with presenting a standard summer popcorn flic for the consumers.Where Burton and some of his actors do succeed is in presenting most of the new ape characters. Roth pretty much steals the movie from everyone as the central villain, Thade. Interestingly, this film was more accurate than the original in that it understood that chimpanzees are the most violence-prone and bad-tempered of the apes in our reality (gorillas are actually more benign). Thade, a super-chimp for lack of a better term, is possessed of power on several levels (physical, social, political) and uses it in displays of ferocious antipathy. Roth so loses himself in the role that, even as I viewed this a 2nd and 3rd time, knowing who it was under that ape make-up, I still could find no traces of him. It's a triumph of make-up FX and stellar method acting. All the actors who play apes in this picture, including Bonham Carter and Clarke Duncan, succeed in dazzling the audience to such a degree that, unfortunately, all the ones playing humans, including the main lead, come off as very bland. The climactic battle between the two armies is exciting and we tense up some more as Thade's villainy appears to near an end. Then everything becomes abruptly copacetic on this weird world and the final (secondary) climax back on Earth still doesn't make sense to me, not after the 3rd time, and probably not when I see it a 4th time. I think Burton's just messing with us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this were a standalone film, or the first time this story was made into a film, then it wouldn't be too bad. It was mildly entertaining, with a pretty good storyline that featured some interesting twists and turns. But, when compared to the original classic, this has legs shorter than "Tattoo". And when I saw "Marky Mark" in the leading role, it really made me want to say "de plane....de plane!" I expected him to bust out with a rap at any moment about his plight on the planet. But in all seriousness, another major flaw of this film is the colors. The film in general is very dark (in color), and this didn't help. Who wants to watch a colorless film? They should have just made in in black and white. Watch the original and then watch this one, and you'll toss out your copy of the 2001 DVD. 4 Bananas out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Planet of the Apes (1968) will always be a landmark in the sci-fi genre (more specifically, the apocalyptic sub-genre). It's an excellent movie, which didn't need a remake, if not to make it more appealing to a new generation of film-lovers. Tim Burton's "reimagining" of the movie was interesting on paper, no doubt about that, but it's also the most disappointing film he's done so far.Burton already did sci-fi in 1996, directing the hilarious Mars Attacks!. Now, that movie may have looked like his most un-Burton-like project, but it worked, thanks to the witty script, which perfectly reflected the director's freaky sense of humor, and the terrific cast (Nicholson, DeVito, Natalie Portman, Pierce Brosnan et al). Planet of the Apes, on the other hand, contains the quintessential burtonian theme (outcasts feared by other people), and it's really, really dark compared to the original, but its strength is all in the style: from Rick Baker's utterly realistic make-up to Danny Elfman's "simian" score, the movie is perfect, technically speaking. It's the storytelling and acting that aren't always as good as expected.The screenplay, while repeating the same basic idea - human astronaut ends up on another world where intelligent apes have enslaved mankind -, is supposedly more faithful to Pierre Boulle's novel, especially the ending (I won't spoil it, but it's far less shocking than what Charlton Heston saw back in 1968), although it suffers from one detail: much of the original version's charm had to do, among other things, with the fact that humans didn't talk on the Planet, making Heston's presence more intriguing. In Burton's movie, they can talk, which leads to an obvious question: why did no none try to have a reasonable conversation with the apes? Sure, that would have killed the movie right away, but it just feels pointless to introduce this new aspect and not develop it.The other weak element is the acting, particularly the "humans": Mark Wahlberg has none of the charisma he had in Boogie Nights, and his co-stars (Kris Kristofferson, Estella Warren) don't impress that much either. It's the monkeys that deserve our attention, most notably Helena Bonham Carter as the human-loving scientist and Tim Roth as evil general Thade (a treat for fans: Charlton Heston plays Roth's daddy). They bring intensity to their characters and Carter in particular succeeds in bringing new life to one of the most loved primates from Franklin J. Schaffner's classic.Overall not a very bad film, but we expected more from the man who gave us the "new" versions of Batman and Ichabod Crane. Too much studio interference, perhaps?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a deception, in the real sense of the word. When I heard about this flick, I though that this "re-imagining" would be at least visually better than the original film. Well, it's not. The new makeup is more complex than the appliances used in the firs film, but the apes are grotesque. Ari, for instance, has hilarious ape features, and so David Warner's character. The problem, I think, is the "realistic" sculpture of the masks, made by Rick Baker. I don't know if "realism" is a good choice in a movie called "Planet of the Apes". The general concept is quite bizarre, and realism can make things even worse.In the original, the characters looked like apes, but had a more sophisticated appeal, a noble aspect. It's very difficult to achieve this balance, and perhaps it explains why the makeup of the new "Planet" wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Add to that a bunch of apes running like rabbits, "primitive" humans that think and talk like evolved humans and poor sets, and you have a natural looser. But what really upset me about this film is the title: it should be "THE VISITOR", as Burton had originally envisioned. "THE VISITOR" is more accurate in the sense that the movie is a "re-imagining", not a remake.</fullReview>

The acting is barely sufficient to carry the undemanding plot: all that was required was to update the 1968 original with the current state of the art: and I mean ART. The only good idea in the film is the casting of Charlton Heston, who starred in the original.The remake's finale is worrisome with its latent opening for a sequel: let's hope it never does come about -- but as the saying goes, monkey see, monkey do.If someone from the film industry actually reads these comments, I would love to hear an explanation of how a scene with four-handed apes outrunning four-hoofed horses makes it through the final editing. Maybe this will become clearer in "Planet of the Horses," where the noble steeds take over the world mounted on very fast apes that run on all fours. Director Tim Burton demonstrated his genius with "Big Fish": one movie per species should suffice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of the Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start of by saying Tim Burton is a visionaire, he has proved that over and over with films like Beetlejuice and Edward scissorhands, etc... but as far as telling this classic tale he kind of got lost along the way in expressing his vision on this tale. Resulting in the end in having more and more beautiful pics and awesome action cut scenes but the story stays behind, and even though the actors do put on a great show, as we can see that Tim Roth is on a roll while portraying a vicious Ape General, even a bit over the sadistic side. But nevertheless it is an OK flick, just that when u expecting the great story told in the novel u would come out deceived.But for pure entertainment reasons I would go for it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***CONTAINS SPOILERS***This was a strange, great movie. As you're watching it, it all seems to tie in with the original. The planet does not seem to be earth. The special FX and sound are wonderful. The acting is average and the movie almost seemed a little boring at times. But what I really hated was the quotes from the original (one made by the man that originally said "Damn them all to Hell!!" as he lay in his death bed. The ending of the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and this totally ruined the it. He clearly lands back on earth and clearly shown to be going back in time. Now if it's all about inter-dimensional travel, it still makes no sense as the present cannot be altered by an action in the future. But images of General Thade were on display everywhere indicating he was a hero in the past. It just cannot be put together to make sense and that's why I hated it so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not yet seen the other Planet Of The Apes (or it's affiliated films from the 70's) so I will make no comparison. Well, I might have seen them, but I was very young and don't recall them or since i9t was the 70's I might have been stoned...who knows.Anyways...I look forward to the sequel...I think this movie is very good...especially all the work and effort that went into it and with 20 minutes of uncut film added to the script, would have made this a kickass film.The only flaw that I found this to have is that Estelle Warren's character served no purpose aside from looking good in skimpy clothing and LIPSTICK...now where would she get LIPSTICK and MAKEUP and EYESHADOW from in a JUNGLE?And why did all the humans have perfect white teeth?Oh yeah...what was the initial reason of the purpose for the humans in the final cut film? Maybe to show us that even in the jungle that we can have a nice tan and well manicured hair and nails.To claim this movie to be bad is wrong...it just missed the mark...and with a staff of over 600 people and so much to do, I'm sure that some oversights can happen when you are directing a film and Tim Burton's oversights were proper character development and motive...but aside of that I think he did a wicked job....as well as EVERYBODY ELSE involved in this film from stunts to makeup, costumes, painters, props and EVERYBODY...I was overall pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to sound rude or anything but this film is stupid, pointless, dumb and boring. OK, it's better than some films like the remake of "Moulin Rouge", but i mean that's just like saying that hanging is better than stabbing. I found it hard not to burst out laughing hysterically when I saw some weird looking ape-guy jumping all over the place saying dumb-sounding stuff like "Kill them all". What the hell happened to Tim Burton, the director of the fantastic "Ed Wood"? The end of "Planet of the Apes" suggests that Tim Burton was intending to make a sequel, but I hope for the sake of respectable cinema, that this will never happen. 5/10 (that's being pretty generous too)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply flawed but beautifully made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm ambivalent about which of the two is more significant: It's a beautiful movie, but the story has more holes than swiss cheese.I was impressed by the production values: the makeup, sets, editing, and such. I'm less sure about the costumes. (Most outfits appear to look like they're made primarily from vinyl.) In many ways, it's visually stunning. A lot of the things they did with ape culture, modes of expression, even movement were very creative. Though some turned out silly, like the "running".The acting was, on balance, pretty good. Some of the characters were preposterous (even ignoring the ape makeup), but in particular Tim Roth and (in stark contrast) Paul Giamatti were amazing in their roles. In some sense, just the variety of personalities shown in the apes was impressive.But the story had holes in it bigger than the ones the spaceships flew through. While I understand that it's a fantasy, rather than SF, given the "auteur", the inconsistencies in the plot, if you will, were too much for me. I can suspend disbelief for the big things, but the details are too much to handle. (Some of these questions may be spoilers.) How did the apes become masters of vinyl-making, when they can't produce a decent knife? Where did the horses come from? And for that matter, where were the gorillas from? Their "escape route" from the city was laughable. The climactic battle was *terrible*! And the "twist" at the ending evoked more stupefied laughter than awed thrill.Maybe upon repeated viewing, I can gloss over these flaws, but I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this on tv. I agree with the earlier comments rating this as mediocre and illogical at every turn (within the bounds of the fantastic premise of course.) I haven't read most of the 1238! comments but don't see any bringing up an aspect which jumped out at me. __ To digress, I was stunned to see that, when the film Ghost Busters was turned into a tv cartoon series, Aykroyd's &amp; Murray's characters were transferred not unlike the originals but Ernie Hudson, the one black ghost buster, was replaced by an ape! Planet of the Apes strikes me the same way. __ I'm white and do not presume to speak for blacks but I cannot see how this movie, with only one token black human surrounded by otherwise entirely white humanity, can avoid coming off as comparing blacks to simians. Yes, I realize that this flick is presenting a lame, elementary-school-level case for liberalism. I do not however see that as negating the fact that, while the film repeatedly instructs us that slavery is bad and that intolerance is bad, the humans are basically purely white, which means that the other set of characters (the apes) must represent blacks. __ A weak claim is made that humans enslaved apes and now, after turnabout, apes have enslaved humans. The problem with that is that humans do not use apes as slaves. Hmm, who did whites used to enslave if not apes? Blacks. So then, if this society represents a reversal of our own, who must the apes represent? Blacks. __ Other fantasy films successfully make the desired point by either having characters of different colors or races on both sides, thus pointing out that intolerance is not inherently caused by racial difference, or by having characters with cultural differences which in no way resemble actual ethnic or racial groups. I am in no way saying that the apes in this film resemble actual blacks but I am saying that some of the characteristics (besides their ability to ignore the laws of physics) they exhibit are exactly how bigots used to make fun of blacks. __ Am I the only one here who was alive before the civil rights movement and thus what I'm talking about is totally foreign to the rest of your experiences? Please explain to me how I am reading things wrong, if I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In comparison to the original this remake suffers but because the source material is so strong, I found it to still be a more than worthwhile viewing experience. The makeup, props, special effects, settings, choreography, and sheer attention to detail are all first class as befitting a film of this scale and budget. However, while the entire supporting cast, especially Tim Roth, is very convincing and in fact is superlative in its performance, the star Mark Wahlberg never convinced me he was in this fantastic situation that almost defied description. He almost seemed 'ho hum' about it! Also in this version the underlying themes of ethics and philosophy and even the sheer sense of adventure and discovery seem to have been overshadowed by a more a conventional 'action movie' approach. Still the movie is marvelously entertaining, 7/10.</fullReview>

Too often this resembles the work of someone else, not Burton.Mark Wahlberg wasn't what made 'Three Kings' and 'Boogie Nights' strong. He was presentable because the source material is strong. Here his source is weak. Under that weak of a structure, he collapses.Overall, the (obvious) subtexts of the original have been exchanged for simple action.

		<shortDescription>Tim Roth is great...Not worth the fierce hatred it's gotten, but still just average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll state right off that this is a prime example of the burning backlash that resonated after this film's release: The Oscar for Best Makeup went to A Beautiful Mind. Apes wasn't even nominated!!! A SPECIAL Oscar was created for the original!!!And that's a problem. The costuming and, especially makeup, in the 2001 Apes is absolutely marvelous. But people nowadays just seem to despise the film, and Burton himself for having directed it. But this is not deserved, although I'll express my problems with it.The story in a nutshell resembles the original: A lone astronaut crashes on a planet ruled by talking apes, and must survive their prejudice against him. But whereas the original had a deeply philisophical plot and dialogue to provoke thought, the 2001 remake is little more than a glamorized chase scene, running too long.I believe Mark Whalberg is a fine actor, evidenced in films like Boogie Nights and the Yards. But here as main character Leo Davidson, he has little to do besides look awed and run away. Literally. There are some lines here and there suggesting what could have been deeper thoughts, but for the most part it's just plot city: React to the apes, run from them, find shelter, rally to defeat said apes. And the worst part is that the rest of the human characters are a mixed bag of nobodies, equivalent to what I call the "Shirts" of Star Trek lore. You know them, they're the extras who get killed defending the heroes whose names we actually know. Giving the humans the ability to speak does nothing more than hand them the chance to rebel more vocally. There's no explanation for why they can speak, and it doesn't really matter that they can. And worse, the fact that the apes are used to human speech takes away from one of the most powerful moments and subsequent scenes of the superior original, which of course is where Chuck Heston speaks for the first time.That does remind me of the fact that although there are a few too many silly puns (as with the original as well, to be fair), the opportunity to reference the original is met successfully too. Heston's famous line is mirrored by an ape this time, as is his famous last line from the first film. In fact Heston himself appears in a role built in irony: Not only does he play an ape this time around, but he also condemns the evil capacity of a gun, which must have made some of his NRA pals a little miffed.Aside from some fun moments like that, the movie's redeemable aspect is, of course, the apes themselves. Using the aforementioned excellent makeup, the actors in ape costume can now emote with the best of them. They snarl, sneer, smile, and speak mostly clearly. No more muffled sounds coming from the almost duck bill appliances that the 60's actors had to work with. The apes MOVE like apes too, loping about, running on all fours, using their feet to hold things. If the movie focused more on them and far, far less on the throwaway humans, the movie would have been much more enjoyable.What I did like, or rather love about the film, was Tim Roth. I saw the film in the theater multiple times, directly due to Roth's portrayal of the cruel main ape, General Thade. This character absolutely lit up the screen when he was on, delivering lines with the cruel ferocity and impatience of a madman just brimming over with contempt. He has passionate, naziesque hatred of the human race, and makes it no secret that he longs to exterminate them in any way possible. Roth chews the scenery and loves every minute of it, and it surely makes for the most entertaining part of the film. He swaggers, swings, and essentially becomes the most believable portrayal of a primate that I've ever seen. My favorite scene in the film is when he grabs Whalberg's leg from under him, tripping him onto the floor with a crash without even looking at the human. He then jerks Whalberg up and bends him over his lap, to pry open his mouth and look inside to see if a soul exists. Satisfied that he sees nothing, he pitches Whalberg back onto the floor without looking, as one would do to a piece of wadded paper being tossed aside. It's good, energetic stuff, and gives the film a very dark edge that the original didn't quite have.I've established that the film consisted mainly of scenes with Whalberg and other humans running, escaping, and otherwise walking away from the ape city and any other real interest. Now for the ending..I won't spoil it, but I must say this. The original film had one of the best shock twist ending in history, and was a very tough act to follow. This time around, there are two main twists, none very adequately explained or built up to, and at the end the viewer isn't left with awe but rather a shrug, as he ostensibly thinks "some of that was cool, but the ending was pretty lame and / or confusing." And since Tim Burton said he'd rather jump out of a window than direct another Apes movie, we'll probably never have a follow up.That's sad, considering that this movie WAS entertaining, but not really done right. The apes were very interesting, but at the sake of the expendable human characters. I left feeling as though the raw power and fierceness of the apes was represented, but not enough. And if the movie focused more on them, as I'd said, it would've been more entertaining. But I admit there would've been less story and conflict as well, so what can you do? Now if only General Thade was in it way more....Ahh, yeah.In closing, I found it a fun but disposable film. The original is still better and a way more engaging, thought-provoking film. The 2001 remake is kind of a more short-attention span flash-fest, with some fun stuff here and there but not much more to sustain your interest after a couple viewings. The makeup, costumes and scenery were great, and Tim Roth's General Thade was a blast. But past that, not too much to sustain interest. But I do maintain that it wasn't the horrifying, joke-and-cringe inducing wreck of flames that pop culture might be saying it is. Decide for yourself, but whatever you do don't blame Burton entirely. The man's done some great work, and he honestly tried. Besides, he didn't write the much-rewritten finished script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For it's era, I thought the original was fab, and eagerly anticipated this remake, thinking that Tim Burton had huge scope for improvement with the technology now available. I was left feeling rather flat. I found Ari's belief that apes and humans could all live together in harmony rather syrupy. A good cast was wasted under undeniably impressive costumes. Although I did think the costumes too 'human'. The much-hyped surprise ending was a huge let-down. I did think it was ending very well, right up until the last couple of minutes and all I can say about that is 'Eh??'(Yes, I 'get' the idea, but cannot figure the time scale).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I say. This movie, while poorly written, acted, and for the most part, executed, was entertaining and though provoking.Many of the reviewers don't realize that the movie is NOT a remake by any means, and obviously doesnt pretend to be judging by the fact that the plot is almost entirely different, and any messege the film tries to get across to the viewer is also quite different.The purpose of the film is to confuse and disorient the viewer and make them sit through the credits with a perplexed look on his or her face. The ending is much too bizzare to make any conceivable sense, and not even the director could clearly explain it.Though it falls short when it comes to the script and acting, the pace of the film is sporadic, and its clear that Tim Burton didnt give it his all, this is not a bad movie. Its an entertaining film that succeeds in doing what it was meant to. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton Goes Mainstream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 7.0 (out of 10)With 'Planet of the Apes' (2001) and 1999's 'Sleepy Hollow' iconoclastic director Tim Burton seems to have been drifting toward the mainstream lately. This after forging a solid carrier on gothic, post-modern and often anti-climactic movies where Burton rejected all Hollywood conventions of pleasing an audience. Of the two, 'Sleepy Hollow' is more fun and more exciting. 'Planet of the Apes', taken on it's own right, is not a bad movie - if you accept that it's content to being just another mindless summer popcorn flick. It's a fun diversion for someone wanting to just sit back and stare at the screen (that is a compliment even though it doesn't sound like one).The movie looks great. It's probably his best looking movie. The makeup, costumes, stunts, cinematography, everything looks good. Which really helped pump up the entertainment (and the final score) when the script is giving us silly puns and 1-liners obviously designed be used in the trailer. The highlight: one of Danny Elfman's best scores since 'Men in Black'. He and Burton give this one a more "techno" look and sound then the other films. The movie is worth seeing just for Danny Elfman fans (which I am). The low-point: Mark Walburg's wooden acting. It's mostly because of this movie and actors like him that I divided up my 'Acting' category to score in two different sections: one for the Lead and one for the Supporting Players. Because while Walburg drags down the action, Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are really giving their all behind those Ape costumes. Roth's rants and raves make for a great villain. Lastly, I loved the ending. It's the best part of the movie. I like the epic imagery of the final shot. I like the fact that it's open-ended enough to send the viewer scratching their head as to it's meaning. And I like how Burton has thrown in hints and lines of logic here and there (Lincoln "freed the slaves") to send us on that journey for a meaning- even if there isn't one. Try to follow me on this (my explination is not the best): This is the type of enigmatic ending people want when they see what they think is an otherwise brilliant movie "fall apart" or get "conventional" in the end by resolving itself (Signs, 28 Days Later, ect.). When a movie is mysterious people aren't happy with any ending. This is an ending that doesn't really end anything. Truly "open to interpretation". But this is coming from someone who doesn't think there is anything cinematically sacrilegious about remaking 'Planet of the Apes'. It was a movie for it's time and place and I get it's campy cult following, but a cinema classic to high and mighty to be remade? Hardly. It could be done and it could be done much better. The problem is that this movie will be remembered more for what it isn't then what it is. Burton and his writers had a chance to take this creatively fertile premise and really do something different with it - show us something edgy, that we've never seen before. It would seem like Burton would be a perfect fit for a PofA remake- well, the old Tim Burton. Yet, he does nothing different here. Instead of telling his own story he just remakes the original film sticking pretty close to it's existing framework but coloring in the lines with a glossier hue. As a result the movie isn't much better or worse then the original film - and it isn't helped by it's built-in lack of originality and clear reliance on the original film. I think, the only solid improvement Burton's film has is making the Apes more "ape-like". The imagery of them charging across the desert on all fours is a fleeting glance at how visionary, freaky and wonderfully twisted this movie could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, the apes really need some prozak!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, the apes being villains, that they're not supposed to be the nicest of characters, but isn't it a little unrealistic that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM walks around all day grunting and growling? The only apes in this remake that aren't mad all the time are Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and Limbo (Paul Giammatti), and that's only because Ari is the "hero ape woman" and Limbo the comic relief. Of course, the humans in "Planet of the Apes" aren't really any better. They're either really nervous all of the time, or really angry. Maybe if both races calmed down a little, they'd have some peace!Aside from the prozak prescription, this was a reasonable remake. Not Burton's best, not by far, but his directing it makes it a lot better. The fight scenes are entertaining, and Tim Roth delivers as the evil General Thade. Unfortunately, Roth is the only actor who delivers a great performance. Sure, the others weren't bad, but they didn't match Roth's ability to basically "become the ape". Even Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan moves a little roboticly sometimes.Still, a good, dark sci-fi thriller, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre and mildly disappointing remake which lacks imagination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes is a very disappointing addition to his other films. Having seen Batman, Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks! I am surprised to see this unwelcome addition to his list. To be fair though, this is probably his first mediocre film. Its not a disaster and it has its good moments, but there's not enough fresh material in it to make it very memorable. Mark Wahlberg is the film's `hero' but the role really doesn't suit him. While in films like Boogie Nights and The Yards he had good supporting players, in Planet of the Apes he just can't carry the role. On the other hand, Tim Roth is very moody in his role as Thade, the film's menace. Helena Bonham Carter is good as the female monkey with a heart, but the make-up is unconvincing. Most of the other performances are standard but nothing award-winning. The film's direction is surprisingly bland giving Burton's usual atmospheric style. There has been a lot of controversy about the ending. I for one liked it and although it was a big surprise, I thought it was very clever. Overall, Planet of the Apes isn't a bad movie, but it could have been much better. It's good fodder for the eyes but after watching it, you'll probably forget about it straight away. 5.3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAUTION SPOILERS WITHINHaving just viewed this film last night, it is fresh in my mind and I wanted to make a few observations. Not a review per se, just some thoughts.Although flawed, it does have a few good things going for it. Rick Baker's work is truly amazing. The flexibility of the masks/make up used allows the actors to produce varied, expressive and very believable expressions. Nicely done.Most of the art direction and costume design is creative and well implemented. The ape army is cleverly and boldly realized.The acting, overall, is good, and especially in the case of Tim Roth, David Warner, Michael Duncan, &amp; Helena Bonham Carter. They help create believable, if somewhat two dimensional characters. The lovely Estella Warren does fine in an underwritten role.Danny Elfman's creative score, effectively covers a wide variety of moods ranging through suspense, comedy and militaristic combat themes quite well.And then there's the other side of the coin, an at times interesting, but largely wooden formula driven plot, with dialog suffering from a bad case of pun infestation.A few things that don't work:At no time did I get the feeling that Captain Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) was all that surprised or impressed that he had discovered a culture where apes could talk, and ran the planet. It was sort of like `hmmm, that's odd, talking apes in charge of the world, hey look over there, we don't have oak trees like that on earth, this is INSANE!'And then the escape from the ape city, whose route cleverly goes right through the center of about a half dozen ape houses, `we'll keep running through these houses until we find the forest, its got to be around here somewhere. Once we've checked all the houses we'll start searching for the forest outside.'What's up with people (and apes) flying twenty feet or more through the air when they are struck by any ape (not just the gorillas), not occasionally, but everytime? The great strength of apes? It would happen on earth. Lower gravity? Then apes would fly when humans struck them. Lots of stuntmen with springboards? Maybe.And then there's that one scene that just defies any logic, and I'm not talking about the `surprise ending'. Its when Captain Leo, wins the battle, brings a new understanding and compassion between apes and humanity, finds himself as the leader of a new world order, and then immediately hops in the space pod to return to earth. WHAT??? I mean, what's the hurry? He knows his crew have been dead for thousands of years, he's just won this planet's version of the Superbowl, the Nobel prize, and been elected President, clearly Estella Warren wants to jump his bones, and even Helena Bonham Carter's Ari is obviously intent on more advanced and exotic interspecies research. Even if he chooses not to lead this world through a new political, cultural &amp; scientific revolution, how about taking some time to smell the roses, you know, a few weeks to gather scientific samples to bring back, to help advance anthropology by studying cross cultural (and species) mating rituals, to work at turning his space pod into a two seater, or to even bring extra food and water for what is likely to be a long and possibly fatal journey? I just don't get it.Worth seeing and entertaining, even for its flaws.Six out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is from the goofs list. Revealing mistakes: Captain Leo Davidson pushes the throttle on his pod forward to accelerate towards the storm while the chimp pushes his in different directions. Then again, it is just a chimp.My thought is, perhaps he's doing it wrong. After all, the chimp made a perfect landing, while the human crashed not one but two pods.That says something doesn't it?Also, perhaps the chimp was trying to avoid the storm and got sucked in anyway. The human, was 'trying' to enter the storm. Remember, he was on a rescue mission for the chimp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original. It had a lot more to it than a simple sci-fi flick. Everyone agrees with that. Did I expect this remake to be up to the same level? No. I went in with a fresh perspective, letting the movie stand on its own. What a mistake that was.One ?plot' point that bothered me was all the people wanting to see the man who defies the apes, since they defy the apes every day by congregating in roving bands of scavengers evading capture. Also, there is a difference between giving the ending a hanging twist, the sort that requires you to think, and incomprehensible one. Oh, and the two swiped lines from the original ("Get your stinking hands off me..." and "Damn them...") had the feeling of being forced into the script. They just did not flow.Warren is a horrible actress. Wahlberg was fairly stiff. Bonham-Carter was a caricature. Roth was the stereotypical mister-mean-man. The script was just plain weak and the craft of storytelling was nonexistent.So, I thought I would read the book. Let's see, the beginning was nothing like the book, the ending had little in common with the book, the middle wasn't really that much like the book. However, there were talking apes... So, yeah, it was similar in that respect.I am glad I only rented this. Well, not really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey there chimp! I mean chump! Yes you! You are the ones who went bananas when you heard that the famous classic neanderthal film `Planet of the Apes' was being remade by noveau director Tim Burton. However, after you saw its `mongoloid' ending- you probably went apes and wanted your money back. What planet are you from anyways? Don't worry! I `peel' your pain! The same thing happened to me. However, I was fascinated by the incredible `mono' a `mono' makeup created by the great Rick Baker. I was also `going ape' by the realistic set design.

		<shortDescription>Only thing worse is Burton's explanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first viewing of this film was on DVD...after not understanding the ending, I decided to watch the final chapter a second time, but this time with Tim Burton's commentary track turned on. This must be heard to be believed! He goes on for the whole chapter and also half the final credits trying to defend the ending, but he is stammering and interrupting himself and making no sense at all. It seems he rarely finishes a sentence during this explanation and for all the noise he makes, he doesn't say a single thing. His basic message is apparantly, "This ending does not make any sense, I only put it in because I thought it was a neat visual," but it takes him forever to say that because he's trying to validate it at the same time even though he himself has no explanation. Wow...I don't know how the rest of the commentary track goes, but the commentary in the final chapter is the worst commentary I've ever heard on a DVD. I felt embarrassed for Burton just listening to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost everyone involved in the making of this movie is to be lauded for their individual creative efforts; this much is certain... great costumes, props, makeup, etc.My only problem with the end result of POTA is its emphasis on action, and very little attention to the human vs. ape and mankind philosophies so aptly and dramatically demonstrated in the original 1968 film on which the "reimagined" 2001 Tim Burton movie was partly based (The screenwriters who worked on this one also pulled information from Pierre Boulle's short sci-fi novel "Monkey Planet.").True, everything made nowadays must have one sense-throttling, action packed sequence strung almost imperceptibly to the next, never stopping to look at the wondrous 'flower' that made the 1968 film so unique. The original film was nature vs man, evolution alongside devolution, and an overall downward spiral towards mankind's oblivion (or pretty much the next worst thing, anyway, since people aren't totally extinct by the time the main character crash lands on either eponymous planet).The best things in the 2001 remake are the handful of pop references made first in the original movie, the references to modern (some 21st Century) attitudes ("I'm having a bad hair day," says one female chimp in Burton's version), and the overall upgraded feel and tone of the movie now that more than thirty-three years have elapsed in the world of cinema.Its a given to say that special-effects are a boon to this new, improved version. Yet, I miss hearing all that (somewhat) great dialog heard in POTA 1968.Everyone I know who's seen the Burton version has mentioned something about its ending, and the questions it poses. Let us all hope Simos (the name of the simian deity in this film) answers our inquisitive, and slightly confused, prayers in a rational manner... ...and will there be an even more confusing sequel to this reimagination?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's only one thing worse than paying $8.50 for a movie that has an axe to grind: a movie with APES doing the axe-grinding.It's hard enough to suspend one's disbelief and get into this whole farce based, essentially, on Darwinistic evolution (which in itself is nothing more than ideological dogma, rather than anything truly scientific). But to believe, in a "relativistic universe," where we all supposedly evolved by pure chance without intelligent design nor moral purpose, a BEAST like an ape is going to develop a moral sense and espouse a knowledge of "right and wrong" (where this came from is never stated) is just laughable. And this is almost how the movie comes off.I would have been more able to suspend my disbelief had the apes--ALL the apes, been truly beasts. It would have been horrific and been, FINALLY, this remake's only shot at equalling (let alone improving over) its 1968 original by creating a more potent nightmare. Instead, it tries to re-create the original's formula--as if any of us would still be "oh'd" by the notion that this "actually could happen."Been there, done that.So, instead of exploiting the truly hellish potential of this concept, we are constantly reminded that this is a remake. No risks are taken. No opportunity missed to "sensitize our political ignorance" (thanks, Ms. Ape). For lessons on creating a masterful (read 'believable') science-fiction world, the makers should have studied Ridley Scott's ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER, or Cameron's TERMINATOR series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that I've finally seen the big Planet of the Apes remake, and before I look again at the reviews. I am asking myself why the movie just didn't work. And I think I know.It wasn't awful, not to me anyway. I enjoyed the effects, I enjoyed Elfman's score, the makeup was wonderful, the acting of all the ape characters was pretty terrific, the plot was at least interesting. Those are all good things, and made it an endurable experience, not like, say, Nightfall.So what was wrong? One factor. MARK WAHLBERG.He's just *nothing.* He's this bland, flavorless, rice-cake/styrofoam object filling up air and reflecting light rays. Not Rufus Sewell obnoxious/bad, not David Birney talentless/bad, just... this-was-supposed-to-be-a-steak-and-it-turns-out-to-be-tofu bad.I will never see Boogie Nights, so I will never have a comment on his "work" in that, I don't remember him from Perfect Storm, so I don't know if Wahlberg is capable of being interesting. The part wasn't written terribly interesting (but think Sean Connery, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart - a talented actor can *make* a part interesting). Doing a lot of standing around and staring, occasionally broken up by some moving around and staring, won't breathe life into a part.And when he did do something or speak, I found his character unsympathetic and centerless.Now, I didn't think much about the original while watching, because I think such comparisons are unfair and usually irrelevant. But I feel I need to say one more thing: Charlton Heston. Not one of my favorite actors, but compare the life and scope of that character to this listless... thing.Too bad. The movie could have been a lot of fun.</fullReview>

The Rod Serling screenplay in the 1968 version was such a witty and insightful parody I can still remember the scenes and dialogue today. There is NOTHING memorable about the remake. This movie was doomed from the start because the surprise twist ending in the 1968 version could never be redone. So instead the film makers pathetically come up with their own surprise ending that is a stupefying non sequitur. What a waste of celluloid and ape makeup.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Tim Burton was doing a remake of the '68 classic,I (like any other Burton fan) was very excited at the prospect. I never thought that the original needed remaking, nor that it could be bettered (the twist ending, along with the Usual Suspects, is one of the best I have EVER seen), but nevertheless, I thought that, if anyone, Burton could put his own fresh, dark spin on the idea. However, the whole thing gave an impression of a Burton being constricted by studio bosses hungry to chock up another Summer hit by throwing in everything including the kitchen sink- check out the extras-filled DVD if ya don't believe me. Nice idea, wrong director. Burton is unparalleled for his alternative-style movies like the classic Edward Scissorhands. Here it felt like he was on a leash, his creativity tragically stunted.The make-up effects weren't much of an improvement on those of 1968, which only serves to highlight the superiority of the original. The acting, well, apart from those who were struggling under their ape-suits(Roth,Bonham-Carter,Clarke-Duncan), was poor- I agree with another reviewer who said that Wahlberg wasn't yet strong enough to carry off an action lead, and as for Estella Warren, well, I think we all know that she was only there to provide some Raquel Welch-style eye candy. The music,from the always dependable Elfman,was superb. The ending: lets face it, it was always going to be compared to the original's which, if not impossible, would be pretty damned hard to better. The ending to Burton's felt silly and tacked on,and smacked of an overall air of "please, be shocked!" whereas it actually only left punters scratching their heads and looking for refunds.If you're curious, wait until the video rental price drops down. If not a Burton or sci-fi fan steer well clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The revision "Planet of the Apes" pretty much lived up to my expectations as a not-too-good nice try. By itself it makes a reasonable action sci-fi but falls far short from the great originals. Although it does try to make a statement of some kind, it is far too obviously and shallowly done. The characters were also a let down, being quite one dimensional.That said, however, should the movie be judged by it's own merits, and not seen in the shadow of the original Planet of the Ape movies, it does deserve some credit as far as entertainment is concerned. It follows a good, exciting and 'non-stagnating' plot, and the viewer remains interested throughout.Overall; a nice try but should not have tried to follow in the foot-steps of the originals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you might think (and the ending DOES make sense!).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a Tim Burton admirer long before most others have (*I* first discovered him through one of his very first animated shorts, "Vincent", shown on The Disney Channel in 1984!). I've enjoyed a lot of his work--especially "Edward Scissorhands", which I feel is his best--and also have been bored silly by a bit of some of his other stuff ("Mars Attacks!"). I got a kick out of "Ed Wood", enjoyed "Beetlejuice" and was delighted by "Sleepy Hollow" and "The Nightmare Before Christmas" since they both seemed to be a return to his more traditional style.This film is by no means a match for the original 1968 masterpiece, but that doesn't mean it's not interesting or fun to watch. In fact, it's more interesting than I expected it to be. Sure, it's just treading water, but what redeemed it in my eyes and earned more respect in me for the script's concept than I otherwise would have had is the ingenious and wildly misunderstood ending.I'm not a huge POA fan, but that doesn't mean I don't admire it. While the original films were simply too dark, cynical and terrifying for me as a child, I admired them very much for their great intentions--that is, to use a sci-fi story as a metaphor for prejudice, intolerance and class problems (basically reminding us all that treating others as less than ourselves lowers us to the level of wild animals instead of beings with the ability and intelligence to treat each other with love, dignity and respect).My main complaint here is "Marky Mark". Lousy actor. He reminds me of Madonna skimping her way through such flicks as "Body of Evidence" and "Shanghai Surprise". He simply can't communicate emotion. Charlton Heston was wonderful as Taylor, a man who begins his dark tale as a cynical jerk who gets a taste of his own I-can't-stand-people-and-think-they're-no-good medicine and comes to realize that his attitude was the same one that led to the nightmarish situation he now faces. In this new version, Leo Davidson is simply bland and almost gives the impression that he's gotten himself as stoned out of his mind as possible just to avoid dealing with his dilemma. This makes it hard for the audience to identify with him, but even so the story's idea is so strong with its ending being so effectively jarring (even when trapped in a cornball script) that it can be frightening in its own right.Which brings me to the twist ending. Before I explain it, I just want to mention something: after reading all the comments both on here and made by paid critics, I am genuinely amazed as a writer how little people pay attention to the finer details of scripts! I guess the modern attention span of folks is so limited that such important details sprinkled throughout the story are lost unnoticed these days (a good example: Roger Ebert's comment that "all the apes' varieties don't make sense considering the film's logic"--YES, THEY DO! Look carefully in the beginning of the film and you will SEE WHY!).Tim Burton and his writers created the ending *VERY CAREFULLY*, and it is NOT--I repeat, *N*O*T*--just "tacked on"! All you need to do is pay attention, use logic and imagination to realize the gaps, and you will see that it is NOT really just some cheap setup for a sequel. In fact, going by the film's logic there isn't really any NEED for one, as the film stands on its own in its entirety!As if in outraged retaliation to the public's criticizing the finale, the videotape and DVD versions of this film contain a featurette re-showing various scenes and saying, "Watch carefully for clues that lead to the explanation of the surprise ending!" It further goes on to say that, just in case you are still too dense to get it, more information is further available on the movie's official webpage.***WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!***After seeing this film, I was easily able to guess what must have happened. I was delighted to find the info I've mentioned above on the internet later on and discover my theory to be correct!What basically happened in a nutshell was this: Thade was bloodthirsty for revenge (remember, he was never killed in the movie) and learned all about space travel through the information contained in the Oberon, salvaged and repaired Leo's ship, then attempted to pursue him through space and time. When Thade reached earth after following him through the temporal storm, he had arrived before Leo did. In vengeance, Thade set out to disrupt Leo's world the way that Leo had disrupted Thade's own. He led a rebellion of the apes and disrupted it into what we saw at the end of the movie before Leo's arrival.It would appear that Burton wanted a portion of his film to be the same way that such new films as "The Blair Witch Project" are... meaning, films that must also be experienced over the internet and through various other provided sources alongside the movie in order to completely understand them! In other words, asking the audience to use their intelligence instead of spoonfeeding all the information to them! Very ingenious. And different, too!That said, I for one am very impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all that bad. But sadly, not good, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two kinds of remakes: one, where people, for whatever reason, think, they should redo a film in the same way it's already been done before. Vertigo and Vanilla Sky come to mind. Then there's the idea of taking a premise of a movie and see what you would make of it. Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes falls into that latter category. As such, I will not compare it to the earlier movies. Sadly, it manages to under-deliver all of its own. It's the last half hour that ruins it for me. Until that point, I was entertained. The apes all look individual and very good. Although they go over the top in demonstrating the hideous conditions in which humans are kept, around 80% of films about social injustice go even further (Mad Max, anyone?). The action was fine, and, considering the genre, made a sufficient amount of sense. Apart from that, Tim Burton is one of my favourite directors, so it couldn't be all that bad, could it? Well, let's see.Spoilers ahead. Then, of course, they had to go for the happy-ending-that-isn't. How Attar was so easily convinced of Thade's treason, I'll never know. Just because a monkey - sorry, prophet - landed at the right moment, in the right spot? Speaking of which, what a prodigious coincidence! Give me a break.What really did it for me was the "shock-ending". Wasn't the guy going BACK in time? Does the Apeworld run on Anti-time (as seen in Star Trek TNG, All Good Things...)? Yes, we knew it could not end well. But we hoped it would at least make some degree of sense. Is that too much to ask?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, if you expect a standard action-science fiction tale, but not nearly up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who haven't seen the original, this is a 'reimagining', which means that it shares some elements of the classic version but not others. Basically the stories involve a spaceman who lands on a planet where the barbaric humans are controlled by intelligent apes. This version is a good film, entertaining and with a surprising ending, but it lacks the punch and depth of the first edition.Tim Burton is my favourite director. 'Bettlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands', the first two Batman films, 'Sleepy Hollow' - all excellent: macabre, gothic and filled with black humour. 'Apes' also looks great - the sets are spectacular and the makeup is amazing: the apes truly look real. What the film lacks is some of Burton's darker, slightly disturbing touches. It plays too much like a straight action/sci-fi flick, whereas the original was a powerful allegory for racism and animal rights as well as great entertainment.One of the reasons why the latter film doesn't match up to the original's power is because all the human characters talk. In the original the human's mysterious silence added to the theme of 'men as beasts'. Here that impact is gone, but they might as well not have bothered - the humans still have nothing interesting to say. It's the apes that have all the good lines and characterisation.Also, the ending of the original 'Apes' is one of the greatest in movie history, resonating with meaning, whereas this version's finale feels like a tacked-on surprise designed to set up sequels.The other main reason why the orginal is superior is that Mark Wahlberg lacks Charlton Heston's macho charisma in the role of the heroic spaceman. Heston was cynical, angry, confused. Wahlberg is bland.Nevertheless 'Planet of the Apes' is is a good movie, a cut above the average Hollywood science fiction film. However if I was given a choice of renting the original or the new version in a few years, I know which one I'd chose.6 1/2/10</fullReview>

Isn't it scary that this shows that they seemed to have taken everything into account except the script?I followed this ?reworking' up the point where the Space introduction ended and we ended up on ?The Planet of the Apes' and it was about here I realised how poor the film was.As a basic example; in the original, at least it had the sense to say that the reason society had evolved the way it had was because the humans were at the Stone Age level where they hadn't even developed the capacity of speech. As a result the apes had evolved faster than them and were able to dominate them. This reworking didn't even bother to do that. I don't think I'm being too pedantic by saying, if the humans could speak why were they still wandering around like caveman? It seems such a fundamental flaw to the plot, I felt it rather insulting to my intelligence.Then again, so many things seem to suggest that the script was written by a bunch of precocious High School students. As someone else has pointed out in these reviews; it's full of quotes from the original - including the famous `Damn them all to Hell!' ? which have absolutely no relevance to the current movie. You can almost see the writers of this thing sniggering behind their hands saying `I know, wouldn't it be cool if we put this line in!'The DVD shows they spent months on getting the make-up right, the movements of the apes right, etc. etc?we even had a very boring documentary about how much effort Danny Elfman put into writing this score, but who was looking at the story? Were the people behind this movie too frightened to say to Tim Burton because he's such a `visionary genius' that the film didn't make any sense?I dunno, what does it matter? This film was a commercial success so it must be good. The only small mercy I can think of is that that, once upon a time, Tim Burton seemed the obvious choice to visualise `Lord of the Rings'. After seeing this movie, thank goodness he didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flying Monkeys?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At some point, while watching the hordes of marching soldier apes as they rocked side to side like Stevie Wonder on speed, I had a sudden cinematic flashback - yes, I had seen this before: the flying monkeys from the Wizard of Oz! Slow paced (it's a thin story, so the plot had to be squeezed out for all it was worth like the last tube of toothpaste on a deserted island) and mundane, I started wondering when something was actually going to happen. Nothing ever happens, not even an ending. Ok, there was an ending, but it wasn't like finding the Statue of Liberty buried in the sand... Skip this and watch reruns of FARSCAPE on the telly - far more entertaining. And why *is* Mark Wahlberg a movie star, anyway? The chimp astronaut had more charisma than Markie Mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those not familiar with that expression, it dates from a 'Punch' cartoon of 1895, where a nervous curate is breakfasting with his bishop.Bishop: I'm afraid you've got a bad egg, Mr Jones.Curate: Oh, no, my Lord, I assure you that parts of it are excellent!So, parts of Tim Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' are excellent. The lifelike and varied ape makeup, combined with the effort that has gone into making the apes... well, apes, and more individual than the oppressed humans can manage to be, makes their society utterly believable. Helena Bonham Carter delicately brings out the character of Ari, shewing us that a full face prosthesis need not handicap a great actress, and Tim Roth camps it up completely as Thade (which you may not think is a good point).On to the bad parts. Mark Wahlberg does nothing to arouse my sympathy, or indeed interest. It doesn't help that his character is halfway between James T Kirk and Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, and does not develop at all throughout the film. The plot is stupid, ridiculous and yet utterly predictable, and forces characters to act unrealistically. The eventual resolution is contrived and unsatisfying, it gives no extra depth to anything, in fact, it seems to be the only way the writers could think of to finish off the plot. The ending is tacked-on and inconsistent.I would recommend avoiding this film unless you really have nothing better to do, and no expectations of intelligence. But stylistically it's worth something, and Helena Bonham Carter's performance is worth adding a couple of marks, so reluctantly, i give it 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is Tim Burton. There is no use comparing it to the original. Forget the original, for now.There is great special effects and a lot of humor around the edges.You could tell this was a Burton movie.A few points. Wahlburg cannot fly, or at least cannot land well. The plot devices to set up the whole time line twist don't work. Don't even try to figure them out. Just watch the movie and enjoy the (over) acting.Wahlburg's character is an idiot. Roth's character is too overdone. Bonham-Carter was fun to watch.Tim Burton makes a great fantasy movie. Reality takes a back seat. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a difficult movie to rate. As a stand-alone I guess it is quite alright. When compared to the original, it is weak. If one doesnt make the mistake of comparing the two of them, then one can really enjoy it in a standard-action-movie kind of way. The original was very politically charged and had a philosophy behind. This remake was a pure action flick, no deep thoughts here. Tim Burton is as always an excellent director so the movie is visually pleasant to watch. The ending wasnt too good. I can see the idea behind it but it failed miserably and just left a bad aftertaste. While it really has nothing to do with the original movie (except apes that talk and rule the humans), it is really hard not to compare them two while watching the movie. Therefor I, with some reservations, would not recommend it to people who have seen the original.</fullReview>

What gets me is all these "industry" types, who know the film is a total disgrace, but since they really don't give a whit about anything in life but padding the bottom line, are like- "who cares if the acting is miserable and there's no depth to the story, no complexity, no nothing - I thought it was pretty entertaining, and the costumes and special effects were great!" Or "we'll recap on the foreign market and dvd special features" Gag.These people are ruining the medium of film.You put so much money and time and effort into a work like this, but you completely ignore the few things that could turn it from TV-quality crap (with GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!!) into a real, honest to god movie. To bad they could collectively care less. They're not movie-makers, they're just businessmen.Well, I'm glad to say you got all of about 5 cents from my viewing...cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has great looks, the apes (with a few exceptions) really look apelike, you've got lush jungles, deserts, big, action packed fight scenes, and a whole ape city that looks totally realistic. Director Tim Burton wasted no expense or effort to make this a visual feast. Too bad he didn't put the same effort into creating a terrific story, especially since there was so much potential to work with. The 1968 original is considered a Sci-Fi classic, not just because of the story, but also the issues it dealt with. It used a society where apes are the top species to comment on and satirize our own society. There are moments of this in "Apes 2001", but mostly it's another big budget action film, only with actors in monkey costumes. As proof of this, the lead character, played by Mark Wahlberg (aka Marky Mark) is just another hotshot fighter jock, meaning there's no problem he thinks he can't solve by simply blasting the bad guy to bits. Which is a shame, since it would be much more interesting to see him outwit his enemies, thus showing who really was the superior species. Also, it doesn't help that the female lead, played by Helena Bonham Carter, doesn't even remotely look like a real chimp. I guess Burton &amp; Co. couldn't resist making her look sexy, complete with a fashionable hairstyle. So, ultimately what you have is lots of good looks, but not much in the way of brains. I'm looking forward to viewing the 1968 original, just to see how this film falls short by comparison. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was unfortunate enough to pick this movie up today at the local video store after seeing a slightly above average rating on this site. Sadly, this is the first time the ratings have been, in my opinion, totally inaccurate. From the savages to the apes, I can't help but laugh at the pathetic dialogue, poor, uhm, acting?, and the, well, general atrocity of the overall movie. The blond savage was the highlight of this movie with her sequined(I didn't actually notice the sequins, but it was commented by the rest of the excited crowd gagging on the movie), tight-fitting, low-cut cave woman swimsuit, and I can't forget to mention the sexy red lipstick she manages to keep smudge-free throughout the movie. *note: i just heard "what a crap movie!" as i'm typing this review.

		<fullReview>My main beef with this flick was the lack of dialogue between Mark Wahlberg's character and the apes where he tries to convince them he is smart. That is what I remember mostly about the original; Charlton Heston was desperate to prove he was intelligent. I remember just feeling helpless concerning his plight, and aching for him to succeed. I would have felt the exact same way had that angle been explored more in this remake. Helena Bonham Carter's character doesn't go through that discovery, she believes in the intelligence of humans right away it seems. That fact alone made this version of "Planet of the Apes" far inferior to the original. Instead of just making it look more sleek, Tim Burton should have been more concerned with this thematic element, an element that in my opinion made the original so compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typically Burton - huge on style, light on substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up, I'd like to say that I liked POTA. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The make-up, effects, cinematography, costumes and sets are all pretty hard to fault. On the acting front, Tim Roth is utterly fantastic as General Thade and he just about makes up for the price of admission on his own.So what's the problem? Well as much as I want Mark Wahlberg star to continue to rise, I just don't think he has the charisma to carry Charlton Heston's role. Not that he was bad or anything, his acting is fine and he is certainly a lot better looking than Chuck ever was. But is he really the brave and indignant leader of the human race who defies the apes and their dirty paws? Maybe he would have been better as the plucky young male that defiantly chases after the hero (read George Clooney) after being told to stay behind with the others?But in Mark's defence, I don't think replacing him would have necessarily made the film any more satisfying. This was a difficult film (conceptually) to make when you consider how highly the original is regarded. Do you just remake it with the same emphasis of script and story, or if you are going to do something different, what do you change?So Burton does what he does best and creates a film that emphasises style over story, and action over acting (or actors). It worked for Batman and I think it does for POTA. Time will tell after the franchise has come and gone whether people criticise "POTA Forever" as not holding a candle to Burton's original!Enjoyable: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of mockery!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 5 minutes in after the opening titles I knew this was going to be a criminal miscarriage of what could have been. Character exposition in the opening sequence was axed in order to bustle the hero (or lack of one) into the so-called action as soon as possible. What results is a woefully underdeveloped series of events thrusting us along on an adventure that is laughable and miserably cheap. Tim Burton's influences lay in many obscure and cheesy drive-in sci/fi movies and TV shows of the past (which he actually tries to pay homage to rather than satirize) and it's not surprising that this film plays like Lost in Space meets One Million Years BC meets Claude Rains' version of The Lost World meets Planet of the Apes. If Burton felt that people would be excited at the prospect of seeing his own self-indulgent vision of the Book and Heston's classic, full of gawdy touches typical of his style, he was badly mistaken. His realization of Batman was far more successful.When I first saw the commercials for this movie I was immediately taken. Images of marching Ape armies and the atmospheric visuals inspired hopes of a science Fiction action epic like no other. Spartacus conquers the Apes as it were. Sadly it was all window dressing and the truly best parts of this movie are ALL in the commercial spots. What we are subjected to is an unspeakably badly written visual feast which belies a very limited budget lurking just below the surface. The only reason to see this abomination is for the costumes and make-up design, as well as the production design (aside from the space station and space suits which look to have been stolen from the 2001 prop vault).The original planet of the apes is not one of my top ten favorite films but it is an honest and intelligent piece of science fiction. Though a bit of a talk fest, it does bring up some very thought provoking issues (thanks to the great Rod Serling) and ends on one of the most powerful and stunning climaxes in movie history. It's a film deserving of its classic status and rated a better remake than what Richard Zanuck and Tim Burton have foisted on us here. In fact, Zanuck should be fined and his producer's license suspended as he was also in involved in making the original.Any and all intellectual content is missing leaving us with good actors buried under mounds of make-up. Except for Wahlberg, who should have just been buried. This guy is the most vacant action hero since Keanu Reeves in Speed. Aside from disobeying commands in order to rescue his chimp, his motivations are unwritten, leaving him to loaf from one scene to the next muttering little more than "hey" or "what" or "whatever", while glancing more than periodically at his Tandy hand-held. The guy has the intelligence and personality of a soapsud. An actor with a grasp of dead-pan humor might have made this character zing. Wahlberg just sits there, looking constipated as another IMDb reviewer mentioned.As far as the other cast members are concerned, what is the deal with Kris Kristoffersen. He has two lines then gets run through with a spear. Estella Warren is atrocious as the obligatory female human. She's no Raquel Welch in the looks department and is an even worse actress. Helena Bonham-Carter is wasted, as is Tim Roth as Thade and Michael Clark Duncan as his Right-Hand Gorilla. One wonders why they hired big-name actors to be unrecognizable under all that latex when they could have hired medium priced actors and saved some money on the budget. Marquee power I guess. As good as he is, Michael Clark Duncan just sounds like the guy who played Worf in Star Trek.As far as Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as Thade's father, spouting familiar lines he used to condemn the Apes in the original, though here in reversed context: maybe in another script, with a better director for the material, it would have been sly and humorous. Not here. The same goes for other memorable lines quoted from the original.Much has been debated about the ending, which is about the only pure Burtonian stamp on the movie. It has no relevance other than to set-up a sequel (would anyone care to see it?). It pays homage to Serling and is a twist on the original's shattering ending, but really it comes off more of a tribute to Marty's nightmare sequence in Back to the Future Part II than anything else.What we're left with here, in the wake of other deficient hack jobs such as U-571, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, is a clear message that a great deal of Hollywood no longer cares about providing their audience with a well written and performed production once their marketing machine has lured us into the theatres. If people keep falling for it it's going to end up sealing the end of quality entertainment for good.Here's hoping that The Lord of the Rings doesn't turn out to be a mishandled treatment of Tolkien with GREAT commercials.</fullReview>

Sure the apes look more real, but their dialog is rediculous and a huge missed opportunity to even make the apes scary: something that shouldn't be too hard.I hold Burton responsible for this blunder and I'll never see another movie he makes in the theatre again, he's violated my trust by churning out this crap.

		<fullReview>Pierre Boulle's original novel of apes ruling an earthlike planet is an absorbing and truly terrifying piece of science fiction. Unlike the 1968 film version with Charlton Heston, this film retains (an Americanized version of) the original ending, which actually works pretty well. There are good scenes along the way too, but somehow, the story just doesn't quite make it. Excellent performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth shore it up a bit, as does the superb make-up. In the end, though, poorish special effects, unmemorable music, and a seeming indecision on the part of the filmmakers as to whether to stick with the original story or write one of their own mean this movie just doesn't work as it should. Watch it by all means, but a classic it is not.</fullReview>

Burton really didn't nee that ending to make it good. it was great by itself. USAF space station Oberon is doing experments on geniticly altered monkeys in space. One day a chimpanzee named Periclese gose to investigate an elctric magnetic storm and disaperes. The film's hero, Leo Davison (Mark Wahlberg), who has become freinds with Periclese, gose out to find him and is swept up in the storm. He eventualy crashes on a planet that is contrloed by apes, and is captured. He then mets Ari (Helana Banham Carter) and escapes "Ape City". The group is being hunted by the comander of the ape army, Thade (Tim Roth). They reach the sacred ruins of CALIMA, and have a hugh battle with the ape army. The film had incredible scenery and make-up. I loved "Ape City" (probubly so did everyone else), and all the scenes were the veiwer gets a look at ape civilization. The action sequences are also outstanding with a whole lot of apes flying through the air. I also liked that the actors actualy moved and looked liked apes. Mark Wahlberg's preformance could have been better, but was berible. The stand-out preformances are realy Tim Roth and Helana Bonham Carter. Both did exelently in their roles. Roth is no where. It's all Thade. This is undoutibly one of Burton's most imaginitive films, but not his best. I give Planet of the Apes 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was disappointing in so many ways. As my wife put it, they had so much to work with, and they completely blew it. I don't even know where to begin with how disappointing this movie was.The action sequences were non-existent. Times when there should have been a good scene (like the horse-ride through the camp, which could have been really great) were very detached from the action, and consequently quite boring. Both the cinematography and the editing in such scenes were really, well, bad.The acting was stiff. I guess Burton was trying to do this whole thing where people actually moved like apes. But that was annoying. And they seem to have spent two or three times as much time and effort on that as they did on more typical (and effective) elements of acting--you know, emotions, character development, little things like that.The CGI was pretty transparent. When Marky Mark first lands and is standing in the forest looking around, for example, it's SO clear that he's in front of a bluescreen. Ugh. The makeup, on the other hand, was really well done.The score was stifled, I thought. But maybe it was just because it had nothing decent to accompany/illuminate.I expected more cool references to other movies. 2001 was a completely obvious allusion, for example, and they only made one (probably accidental) allusion to it--when Pericles is about to take off in the pod. They could really have done a lot of cool stuff with that--both on the planet and in space. So, what was good about the movie? The makeup, as I already mentioned. That's it, as far as I can recall. Enjoy.</fullReview>

I think it's just the ending that brought it down.Astronaut Leo Davison (Mark Wahlberg) goes to find a chimpanzee named Peracliese who was lost investigating an electro magnetic storm. Leo is swept up in the storm and sent to a world where apes rule over humans with an iron fist. He is captured and brought to Ape City. A human rights activist named Ari (Helana Bonham Carter) frees Leo and Daena (Estella Warren). They all escape with others and soon become hunted by General Thade (Tim Roth). The group reaches the sacred ruins of CALIMA, and have a huge all-out battle between the ape army and the humans.This movie has intense action sequences, amazing make-up, a good score, fair visual effects, and great directing. The best performances are Roth's (who I think needs a nomination for best supporting actor) and Carter's. Burton again does a superb directing job. The movie itself is good. I just hated that ending.I give Planet of the Apes 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was appalled! I waisted how much on this? Even my popcorn had a funny taste! This movie lacked it all: Acting, script, direction, logic, originality and, most of all, heart. I saw the original in the theater in first release- I took (pardon me tortured) my daughter to the first release of this re-make. She was bored, I was enraged- we both wanted to leave early and get back in the mall. I have only walked out on one movie- "Visiting Hours" - but was considering a repeat ! Only the critic's comments about the "silly ending" kept me in the theater and, when it came, I said "I waited for this?" Yah, the makeup was superb... so what? Yah the special effects were 21st century... so what? I liked the scene with Charlton Heston repeating his "Damn them to Hell" speech... ummm thats it. Oh, Ya.. did i mention the popcorn was stale? 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1968, the world's fascination with outer space was still largely in the science-fiction realm. Sure, we'd put some men in space, but no one had landed on any foreign worlds. We imagined, through the voices of such authors as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, interstellar travel and advanced civilizations. But all of that seemed to be part of the distant future in 1968.Here were are 33 years later, and while we haven't traveled to other galaxies or met any other civilizations (advanced or otherwise, Whitley Strieber's experiences notwithstanding), we have put a man on the moon and are hard at work on the international space station. In short, in 33 years we've come a long way, baby.Anyone who has seen the original 1968 Planet of the Apes knows that the ending is a real kicker. I certainly won't give it away here, because there's an entire generation that hasn't seen the movie and most certainly should. Suffice to say that the original is unique, not simply another sci-fi flick.The new one is termed a "rethinking" of the original. Tim Burton, who gave us Edward Scissorhands, Batman, PeeWee's Big Adventure, and Sleepy Hollow,is the director here, and the film is full of his stylish touch.Mark Wahlberg is Captain Leo Davidson, an astronaut in 2029 on a small space station that is conduction experiments on chimps. An electrical storm strikes, and a chimp is sent out to survey the cause. When the animal does not return, Davidson launches himself - against his commander's orders - to find him. Next thing he knows, his space pod is crash landing on an unknown planet inhabited by talking, aggressive apes - with humans as slaves.Davidson is captured by the apes along with other humans, but escapes. His plan - get back to where his pod crashed, find his GPS-like device that will allow him to locate his mother ship, and get back home. But it's a long way back to the pod, and he suddenly has thousands of apes after him.Luckily, he has on his side Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), a kindhearted ape who feels empathy toward the humans. Ari, of course, symbolizes animal lovers on Earth; she cannot understand why her fellow apes treat their humans so badly. "We can learn much from them," she claims, but her claims fall on deaf ears. Davidson, with the help of Ari, leads a small band of refugee humans (including the Daena, played by the delicious Estelle Warren) to his pod, where he makes some startling discoveries, none of which will be revealed here. (If you've seen the original and know the surprise ending, the discoveries Davidson makes are as intriguing as that ending.)Hot on the trail of the astronaut and his friends is the evil General Thade (Tim Roth) and his fiercest warrior Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). The makeup jobs on all of the apes are astounding, and the actors are completely unrecognizable under their disguises. The general has been told by his ailing father (an uncredited Charlton Heston, who starred in the 1968 original) that humans, in the time before time, humans brought violence to their planet; now that apes dominate, humans must be destroyed.As with the original, this is a fascinating treatise not only on how we treat other animals but on how we treat ourselves. Is it truly accurate to say that humans are civilized and the apes are the savages? The film actually makes you think about such things, but it's no philosophical hodge-podge of mumbo-jumbo. It's a exciting, powerful movie, worth watching on just about every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a huge disappointment. Having seen the original 5 films from the 1960's - 1970's, only the first three warrant viewing. The new film doesn't capture any of the uniqueness, excitement, and action. Poor script writing, casting, acting, and editing...which is worse? It's hard to tell. Hopefully, there will be no sequels to the new remake. Let the originals live as proof positive that remakes seldom can equal or surpass the quality of their originals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can one really say about the Planet of the Apes except that it's relatively well-made. I must admit though, special effects are becoming the norm - however, I must give credit to the directors in that the apes look rather realistic, and significantly ugly. Generally the plot was sound, the character of General Thade being sufficiently menacing - I mean, snarling at the camera every five seconds was enough to send a shiver down my spine. Well, maybe a exaggerate just a touch but his characterisation was definitely superb. The other characters are less certain, in fact did the girl really say anything? Of course, she was there for aesthetic purposes .. . . . need I say more?</fullReview>

I guess i have no interest in seeing dialogue with actors in monkey suits! Mark Wahlberg should stick to the roles he knows and performs best such as Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights or the Psychotic boyfreind in Fear these are roles he excells in! Now i wont lie to you about one thing Estelle Warren is a total hottie but unfortunatly i've seen both the movies she starred in and they both sucked! This one and Driven. Well highlights of the movie are Tim Roth as Thade and Micheal Clarke Duncan as well! The war at the end between the humans and apes was impressive eye candy and the twist ending was neat but over all a flop!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Tim Burton's, his dark themes and special effects are always fantastic and dynamic. I could not wait to see this movie, unfortunately I had to until it came out on video. The original Planet of the Apes and this are very dissimilar, both are quite enjoyable in their own right. The special effects in this movie were, as usual,Tim Burton amazing, however the story-line was a little weak and hard to follow. Mark Wahlberg was of course his sexy self - his brooding good looks make the weak plot more enjoyable. It seems with every movie he does his acting ability increases, I felt that he played the character very well. I was very confused by the ending of this flick and wish that there were a little more detail that would have helped me understand it more. I look forward to seeing a sequel to this film, so I can finally put my mind at ease over the ending.</fullReview>

The alleged spoofiness is too uncommitted to raise even a wan, jaded smile, and the socio-political commentary was copied off the back of a cereal box. I must congratulate the other Users on this site for concentrating on this movie hard enough to articulately explain some of the myriad reasons why it is so awful; my own mind simply rejected it wholesale.

		<shortDescription>APES is not so bad of a PLANET...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES: BThe plot of "Planet of the Apes" doesn't take much thought. Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on a distant planet run by ape people. They're scary, aggresive, and they hate humans. They inprision humans and make them slaves. But, Leo is the macho, egotistical type (a must for these kinds of movies). He breaks out along with the beauty Daena (Estalla Warren) with the help of ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). General Thade (Tim Roth, one scary looking dude) quickly finds out about this and doesn't take to it lightly. He gathers his whole army so they go searching for the humans. Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) is humble assitant who is second in command.For about 45 minutes of the movie it wasn't looking so good, because of the character of Leo and his cliché. The characters were kind of a problem. They were old and tired. Ari posses the most heart, though. Also, a love triangle emerges between Ari, Leo, and Daena.. Th film seems scared, though, to take on the subject of "inner-species" dating. It doesn't, until about the last 30 minutes, give us anything we've already seen before. Except great make-up. But the thing about it is, it's a lot of fun. I picked up the problems I listed above, but really didn't care. Tim Burton, personally, is my favorite director. He has yet to make a bad film. He has a certain style that is dark and ominous, Here, it is muddled and doesn't show up until about the last 30 minutes. You can sense it's there but it doesn't show up until then."Planet" has one of the greatest endings of the year, which is the high point of the movie. It's also got some other neat twists in it along the way. So, despite it's many problem, "Planet" is an enjoyable, often funny, often scary, summer movie.Note: Pay attention to Danny Elfman's tremendous score. He had done most of Burton's films and each score is terrific. I don't feel he gets enough recognition, so I thought I'd mention it.</fullReview>

And when Marky Mark 1st saw them, it was like "oh, hey, these monkeys can talk... isn't that something?" The visuals were impressive but thats it... The extras are cool... I tried not to compare with the original, but you cant help it. When in the original, Heston 1st noticed the apes running around in horses, it was like WOW!! Then when he speaks, it was like Oh oh... Here is like nothing. When Marky Mark asked some of the other humans stuff like "Hey whats going on here?" The humans where like "Oh, well you see it's like this...". The dvd has one of the things I hate the most... If you miss a line and cant understand what was said, you cant just pop the subtitles... You have to go to the main menu... Same for the sound... The end was neat but I wont give it away... Not to buy, just rent and you'll survive...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where Tim Burton gets his ideas to make a movie but somebody, someday should wake him up. I could go on about the endless flaws in this movie but I just don't have the time. I will touch base on a few to keep those interested in viewing it far from it. In one instance, Captain Leo lands in a mud filled swamp on the Ape planet. Sure enough when they show an underwater scene the water seems clearer than the Great Barrier Reef. I paused the DVD to see if I could see Coral. Another HUGE flaw is the fact that the Apes hate humans much like humans dislike wasps in cars. Funny thing is that the Apes live so much like us humans all the way down to their Versace clothes. Like I said, I could go on and on but I will not. This movie is awful!!!! 2 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apart from Estella Warren, what do this and "Driven" have in common?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler for the ending (not the first one, as you may have guessed).Before the break we asked you what, apart from Estella Warren, do the new version of "Planet of the Apes" and "Driven" have in common?In both films the silver screen's most gorgeous pouter (Angelina Jolie? We don' need no steenkin' Angelina Jolie!) is one of the best things, and in both films one of the high points is watching her swim. Unlike the movie that several people here and elsewhere accurately dubbed "Drivel," however, this one does have some other stuff in its favour, but not enough to stop it from being second only to "Mars Attacks!" as Tim Burton's least interesting movie to date; note that I said least interesting and not worst, because Burton is apparently incapable of making a bad movie (he can, however, have his name on one - "Batman Forever" is billed as "A Tim Burton Production," but that was chiefly Joel Schumacher's fault).The man's never been hailed for his unwavering grasp on story, but his grip on the plot is even more tenuous than usual; he seems more interested in the look than the tale - the elements never really come together (especially the Wahlberg/Bonham-Carter/Warren "triangle," which never quite registers and explains why the ending is a bit weak). In fairness, Burton and the cast aren't helped by the script from William Broyles Jr ("Cast Away," the excellent TV series "China Beach") and sequel specialists Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal (who did "The Jewel of the Nile," "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" and "Superman IV: The Quest For Peace" - is that warning bells I hear?), which doesn't give anyone much to work with and makes the first hour in particular a slow haul.The second half is all told an improvement, although it suffers from some hard-to-believe plot points (the phrase 'deux ex machina' comes to mind)...***SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE READERS WHO STILL DON'T KNOW THE ENDING*** ...and the ending, though closer to the end of the original novel (in both the book and this film the hero returns to Earth only to find out, thanks to a memorial to the Tim Roth character, that the apes have taken over there as well), is clumsy, illogical and idiotic; see "Back to the Future Part II" for a similar twist, which at least had some credibility along the rules the film set itself. There must have been an easier way for Twentieth Century Fox to graft on a set-up for a potential sequel. (That's what you get for leaving Estella Warren behind, Wahlberg!)***END OF SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE ET CETERA ET CETERA ET CETERA***Technically it's pretty good, with impressive Rick Baker makeup (although Helena Bonham-Carter's makeup, in addition to making her look a bit like B'Elanna from "Star Trek: Voyager," seems to be getting in the way of her speech), fine although non-staggering Industrial Light and Magic (and company) FX - the crash sequence and the climactic battle are standouts - and another good Danny Elfman score (although whoever decided to stick that Paul Oakenfold remix on the lengthy end credits should be taken out and shot). Some of the cast actually manage to come through the makeup, notably Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth (although Mark Wahlberg looks more like an ape than the other humans), and the apes are actually pretty scary... but I miss Roddy McDowall. (Note that I haven't drawn any comparisons between this and the 1968 classic; it's not fair to do so, and I'm trying to look at this on its own merits.)Alas, Tim Burton movies shouldn't be enjoyed for their technical merits - they should and often do take you to another world. It's ironic that the first of his movies that really IS set on another world should ultimately fail to do so; lots of good things (I liked the slave trader, I didn't mind the links to the original movie - good on Charlton Heston for going uncredited, however - and I certainly enjoyed the big action scenes and some of the quieter pleasures, like the unofficial tour the humans take while escaping through the apes' city) but not a success. It's still better than the TV series or the last two sequels, however, but this isn't a real Burton movie. "Planet of the Apes" might have seemed more impressive had this identical movie been directed by Michael Bay, but from a real genius it's something to rank below his best work.But Estella is as sexy as ever, which is where we came in.</fullReview>

A little before, and almost constantly after he leaves the ape city where he was a prisoner, he's in a state of shortness of breath.

		<fullReview>I first became a fan of the "Planet of the Apes" saga when I was 12 years old. HBO was showing the original film and I came in on the scene in which Charlton Heston's Taylor was being interrogated in the apes' court. I was hooked from that moment on. I bought all five original films and watched all of them countless times and re-bought them when Fox put out the THX-Widescreen tapeset for the 30th anniversary. What did Apes do for me? Well, to begin with, it made me examine my religion. The end result? I determined I wasn't Christian. It also made me want to be a film director even more. THIS WAS WHAT SCI-FI COULD DO. Even the weakest entry of all, "Battle for the Planet of the Apes," was above standard sci-fi entertainment.So here I am, 22 years old, exploring religion, life, and directing my first ambitious independent film, which is even titled as a small homage to the fourth "Apes" film, "Conquest of Area 52" (there will be an IMDB entry on it next year sometime). "Planet of the Apes" is among my biggest reasons for wanting to make films and it's impacted the way I think as well.I've read the wonderful Pierre Boulle novel (and own the first printing, which I um, borrowed from my high school library) and I will be buying the "Apes" TV series on DVD. And of course, I saw Tim Burton's "reimagining" of "Planet" on opening day.From the beginning, I'm already biased. The original Apes saga was my Bible. To paraphrase, "Everything I Needed to Know I Learned From Apes." Heh-heh. Tim Burton... love the guy. He made "Ed Wood," one of my top ten favorite films. His unique visions and styles have always intrigued me. Admittedly however, Burton normally did not have strong points in plot or character development. His "Batman" films were a mixed bag, not showing enough of the psychology of what it meant to be Batman, but they were so visually entrancing that I am still able to watch them on their own merits. In fact, both "Batman" and "Batman Returns" get an 8.5/10 from me. "Mars Attacks" is a joy to watch on the right day, and the same goes with "Edward Scissorhands" and "Beetlejuice." By the time he directed "Sleepy Hollow," I felt that Burton had evolved so much as a visual storyteller that he really could not be judged for weak plot or character. That's the way he wants to be as an artist, so let it be.But...This time, he's done "Planet of the Apes." If it were anything else, like say a remake of "2001", I could still watch it and not crucify it. No, this new version is not anything worth crucifying. "Apes 2001", shall we call it, has the all the Burton standards- plot and character on the back burner, awesome visuals at the forefront. What sets Burton aside from say, the biggest hack of all time Michael "Pearl Harbor" Bay, is that while his character drama may not be the most engaging, it's not exactly boring or annoying. It's just SIMPLE. This version plays out like the 1968 version except cut down to the core: an astronaut crashlands on a strange planet, he gets caught, is imprisoned at Ape City, gets away with the help of a lovable chimp, goes into the Forbidden Area, finds out the origin of the apes, and leaves the apes to go home. That last part is the only thing really different in the overall structure, except this time, the film does not end there, and we get an ending which both pays its respects to Boulle's original novel and Franklin Schaffner's original film.There are several references this version makes to the original series. With the Apes army we get a nod to "Beneath." With the love story, er, triangle, there's a similar feel to Zira and Cornelius' plight in "Escape." The look of the astronaut costumes is very similar to those in the first two. And the origin of the apes rings in similar tone to the fourth film, "Conquest."Did I like it? I've only seen it twice, so its a bit hard to say that without going, "except for this... and that... and this... and that..." What I liked: the cinematography, the sets (which are never all that real-looking but invoke memories of illustrated children's books, which is a Burton constant), the movement and makeup of the apes (maybe the two most noteworthy things done here), the cameos by Chuck Heston and Linda Harrison (Nova from Apes I &amp; II). I also liked the love triangle between Ari, Leo, and the blonde; this was very humorous. Wahlberg didn't add much depth to a written character already lacking depth, but he certainly had the right expressions for his character. I wouldn't be particularly overjoyed by my stay on the Planet of the Apes either. Helena Bonham-Carter is always good in whatever she does, and her character in this was endearing enough to accept her makeup, which differs greatly from the others. Paul Giamatti's Limbo may be the best character of all, providing the most comic relief. Tim Roth as Thade is brilliant, as are the rest of the key players. I didn't appreciate that the social commentaries were sometimes rather clumsily slapped on; indeed a lot of the time they seemed like desperate attempts by Burton to put SOMETHING in there saying ANYTHING when the script had little to give him (Burton arrived on the project fairly late and had little time to shape the film).Overall, this 2001 version of "Planet" is far better than it should have been, given the success it had to live up to. It doesn't hold a candle to the original, and I certainly never expected it to. I'm glad Fox put a commercial artist in charge of it, rather than a commercial hack such as the afore-mentioned Michael Bay or Tony Scott. It may have been more intriguing had Oliver Stone worked on it (Stone was attached several years back).Tim Burton did the near-impossible for me: I didn't want to kill him after watching this. And for an Apes fanatic such as myself, that is saying a heck of a lot. Let's all hope that when Fox greenlights the sequel, they don't hand it over to Joel Schumacher. I'd take Ed Wood's Planet of the Apes over his anyday.I do have one quibble I think is more than worthy of consideration to even a non-Apes fan not familiar with the original series:We know where the Apes come from in "Apes 2001." But why the heck would that space station have HORSES on it?! Sorry, I'm not gonna take the old lame scientific explanation about how life on other planets must be similar. I may be a Darwin enthusiast, but come on. That's stretching it.</fullReview>

His unique visions and styles have always intrigued me. Admittedly however, Burton normally did not have strong points in plot or character development. His "Batman" films were a mixed bag, not showing enough of the psychology of what it meant to be Batman, but they were so visually entrancing that I am still able to watch them on their own merits. In fact, both "Batman" and "Batman Returns" get an 8.5/10 from me. "Mars Attacks" is a joy to watch on the right day, and the same goes with "Edward Scissorhands" and "Beetlejuice." By the time he directed "Sleepy Hollow," I felt that Burton had evolved so much as a visual storyteller that he really could not be judged for weak plot or character. That's the way he wants to be as an artist, so let it be.But...This time, he's done "Planet of the Apes." If it were anything else, like say a remake of "2001", I could still watch it and not crucify it. No, this new version is not anything worth crucifying. "Apes 2001", shall we call it, has the all the Burton standards- plot and character on the back burner, awesome visuals at the forefront. What sets Burton aside from say, the biggest hack of all time Michael "Pearl Harbor" Bay, is that while his character drama may not be the most engaging, it's not exactly boring or annoying. It's just SIMPLE. This version plays out like the 1968 version except cut down to the core: an astronaut crashlands on a strange planet, he gets caught, is imprisoned at Ape City, gets away with the help of a lovable chimp, goes into the Forbidden Area, finds out the origin of the apes, and leaves the apes to go home. That last part is the only thing really different in the overall structure, except this time, the film does not end there, and we get an ending which both pays its respects to Boulle's original novel and Franklin Schaffner's original film.There are several references this version makes to the original series. With the Apes army we get a nod to "Beneath." With the love story, er, triangle, there's a similar feel to Zira and Cornelius' plight in "Escape." The look of the astronaut costumes is very similar to those in the first two. And the origin of the apes rings in similar tone to the fourth film, "Conquest."Did I like it? I've only seen it twice, so its a bit hard to say that without going, "except for this... and that... and this... and that..." What I liked: the cinematography, the sets (which are never all that real-looking but invoke memories of illustrated children's books, which is a Burton constant), the movement and makeup of the apes (maybe the two most noteworthy things done here), the cameos by Chuck Heston and Linda Harrison (Nova from Apes I &amp; II). I also liked the love triangle between Ari, Leo, and the blonde; this was very humorous. Wahlberg didn't add much depth to a written character already lacking depth, but he certainly had the right expressions for his character. I wouldn't be particularly overjoyed by my stay on the Planet of the Apes either. Helena Bonham-Carter is always good in whatever she does, and her character in this was endearing enough to accept her makeup, which differs greatly from the others. Paul Giamatti's Limbo may be the best character of all, providing the most comic relief. Tim Roth as Thade is brilliant, as are the rest of the key players. I didn't appreciate that the social commentaries were sometimes rather clumsily slapped on; indeed a lot of the time they seemed like desperate attempts by Burton to put SOMETHING in there saying ANYTHING when the script had little to give him (Burton arrived on the project fairly late and had little time to shape the film).Overall, this 2001 version of "Planet" is far better than it should have been, given the success it had to live up to. It doesn't hold a candle to the original, and I certainly never expected it to. I'm glad Fox put a commercial artist in charge of it, rather than a commercial hack such as the afore-mentioned Michael Bay or Tony Scott. It may have been more intriguing had Oliver Stone worked on it (Stone was attached several years back).Tim Burton did the near-impossible for me: I didn't want to kill him after watching this. And for an Apes fanatic such as myself, that is saying a heck of a lot. Let's all hope that when Fox greenlights the sequel, they don't hand it over to Joel Schumacher. I'd take Ed Wood's Planet of the Apes over his anyday.I do have one quibble I think is more than worthy of consideration to even a non-Apes fan not familiar with the original series:We know where the Apes come from in "Apes 2001." But why the heck would that space station have HORSES on it?! Sorry, I'm not gonna take the old lame scientific explanation about how life on other planets must be similar. I may be a Darwin enthusiast, but come on. That's stretching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe SPOILERS, maybe not. ( My english is not perfect, but it is much better than your russian :-) Once again I read Pierre Boulle's book and once again I'm wondering - WHY ? Why not Tim Burton neither ? couldn't simply adopt this book on screen word-by-word ? Why they were trying to change the story radically ? The story in the book is much more entertaining, surprising and significantly deeper in people-ape relations than in 68' and 01' films taken together ! Those who read the book will understand me well - the ending at the book is really shocking ! Of course, that half-destroyed Statue of Liberty at the ending of 68' film is very symbolic , but. I'll prefer not to say about 01' film ending sequence - it is in real Hollywood's style - heh, where can possibly crush your spaceboat - in the field, wood, river or ocean ? No !!! It will land right before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. ! WHY ? Simply because this is an american film !So, if you like GREAT science-fiction plots, good acting, directing, music and special effects, then you will like this film. I'm just sorry for that book's story - filmmakers did a big mistake, when decided to rewrite it.My rating : 8 out of 10. But the 68' film is better anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many others, I rather admire Tim Burton's artistic spin-outs, although for every BATMAN there is a MARS ATTACKS, and for every EDWARD SCISSORHANDS a SLEEPY HOLLOW. He had NO RIGHT however messing with PLANET OF THE APES, a great film that was majorly under-valued critically (NOT at the box-office) even on its release in 1968. "Are things so bad that BEN-HUR has to start mixing it with Gorillas?" proclaimed one dumb-ass reviewer! Wonder what he would have written about this?Well guys for whats its worth, here's my assessment! In a word, INSULTING to the original! (and to anyone in the audience of moderate intelligence.) Obviously geared towards two distinctly identifiable social groups: those who have never seen the original series and today's (for the most part) attention-deficient audiences, who just want some one-dimensional entertainment to accompany their popcorn (or ecstasy tablet). Burton is selling himself short here - he is worth more than that.PLANET OF THE APES (2001) is not categorically a turkey, the special effects are excellent, although the incessant use of digitizing becomes wearisome eventually. What IS wrong with it is loopy Wahlberg as an intergalactic Captain....I mean could you take this guy seriously? Would YOU rather fly to Alpha Centauri with Chuck Heston at the controls or under the direction of some guy who flashes his "jewels" while boogeying? Aimed at a "youthful," marketable audience, sure he's your man, but in the interests of credibility, Wahlberg is a 10-1 longshot! The film suffers from ludicrously unstable continuity with a script to match - it is sheerly a visual extravaganza. Obviously in an attempt to play down the social and paradoxical issues of the original (coz you might have to actually THINK!) Burton has gone for noise and movement.The marvellous ending of the 1968 film (probably only ever equalled in power by THE USUAL SUSPECTS) is replaced by an obviously tacked-on "lets not worry how to explain this - anything to leave us a sequel" finale. In the upshot, not the embarrassment Gus Van Sant's PSYCHO was, but totally unnecessary and totally unsatisfying!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too noisy monkey business?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Franklin J. Schaffner's 1968 version of Pierre Boulle's novel was the first film I saw when I started my moviegoing career at 13, so rather inevitably it would take a lot for this new one to surpass my wonderful experience from then.Except for Tim Burton's film to be pacier and noisier, one of the important differences is the fact that the apes here are apier (e. g. swinging in the trees and so on), and the ape masks and costumes have become more flexible which altogether should add up to some improvement.On the other hand the incessant onslaught of computer-generated special effects unfortunately dwarfs the actors much of the time (especially Mark Wahlberg), and further the philosophical aspects and debating are toned down compared to the old version.All in all this was somewhat of a disappointment. Certainly not because Tim Burton has made an un-professional or amateurish movie, but because I cherish Schaffner's film more for sentimental reasons and not least for having a more adventurous feel and a narrative flow (and drive) that is missing here.A circumstance I hardly understand myself as Tim Burton's film is choke-full of great images, noise, action and commotion in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a bad movie this is, one of the worst of the year, I hate those bad science-fiction movies with no actions and pseudo- intellectual ideas. They are so pretentious. One good thing about this film is Estella Warren, she is great! She is one great actress, I sure hope that someday some producers will exploited her to do some nude scenes in film and maybe someday hardcore movies. Who knows? Here is the story of Planet of the apes thanks to Tim1370.It is the year 2029: Astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) boards a pod cruiser on a Space Station for a "routine" reconnaissance mission. But an aburupt detour through a space time wormhole lands him on a strange planet where talking apes rule over the human race. With the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter) and a small band of human rebels, Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Gorilla Army led by General Thade (Tim Roth) and his most trusted warrior Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). Now the race is on to reach a sacred temple within the planet's Forbidden Zone to discover the shocking secrets of mankind's past - and the key to it's future. Wanna watch a good movie with Estella Warren and Carmen Electra? Go see Perfume, two of the hottest babes in one flick! See only Planet of the apes for Estella!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton "Planet of the apes" is fine breathtaking picture which I enjoy so much. I've seen it two times and want to see more. Tim Roth as general Thade took very big part of the plot and used it in a very good way. He's aggressive, scareful and, I think, acts just like Napoleon of the apes (because of his small height). Helena Bonham Carter as Ari looks very lovely, ironic, and sometimes shy. I liked Mark Wahlberg as Leo Davidson less than previous characters, but his eagerness to get away from the planet and what proceeded to his escaping makes him unforgettable. Also I liked that there were no "four-letter" words in the picture. Danny Elfman created unusual electronic-orchestral-percussion score. My rating is 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ome of the better summer movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes was a real delight after a summer of disappointing movies. This summer has been one disappointment after another. First there was Tomb Raider, which was full of dumb cliches. Then there was A.I, which had too much hype behind it and was too long to keep your interest. After all the disappointments it's a real relief that the studios can still come up with a good movie. Tim Burton brings us another blockbuster hit. This is Burton's best work since Sleepy Hollow. Burton uses his unique techniques to bring the apes alive for the film. His artistic expertise that Burton displayed in the making of Planet of the Apes has probably made him one of the most well known directors today. The mere talent that Burton brings to a film makes him one of the most unique directors of our time. Mark Wahlberg is wonderful in this film. He plays Leo Davidson, a United States captain who crash lands on the planet and discovers that the apes rule the planet. This is a step up for Wahlberg from 1994's Renaissance Man, where he plays Private Tommy Lee Haywood. This is probably Wahlberg's best film since Boogie Nights. Tim Roth plays the evil General Thade, general to the ape army. He despises the human race. Charlton Heston makes a small cameo appearance as General Thade's Father, the only ape with a gun. Overall I gave Planet of the Apes a 6. If you liked this I would suggest renting Sleepy Hollow, Batman, and Edward Scissorhands.</fullReview>

However, the film feels like Burton-lite, like MI2 was John Woo-lite, the apes have caged Burton here. The aesthetics show flashes of his sensibility, but his gothic romantic style is virtually absent. Also, Mark Walberg and Helena Bonham Carter are poor and miscast.However, Tim Roth and Michael Clarke Duncan are superb, with a true apish spirit. And whoever says there's not going to be a sequel is either lying or is forgetting what has happened before ("It's not a sequel, it's a continuation!")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful images don't mean a good movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of The Apes is a Tim Burton film. And, knowing that it is in Burton's habits to put spectacular and beautiful yet dark and mysterious images on film, I expected a "Planet of The Apes" with the same story than the original, but with a different perspective in the images. But I was somehow disappointed to see that, sure the images were nice, though not as amazing as "Edward Scissorhands"' or "Batman"'s, but the script seemed to have forgotten. The film lasts two hours, but you don't see them pass away, because you feel like nothing happens in the film, but everything is happening at the same time. The movie could be separated in like three chapters; The beginning, the core and the ending. That's it, no surprises, nothing special, except the images and Tim Roth's acting. This film wasted lots of potential interesting performances *Spoilers warning*(Kris Kristofferson doesn't even play a role, he only runs and die, and Helena Bonham Carter has a very hollow and empty role as an ape who has more feelings, and her feelings are so hard to see because of the limited facial expression due to the make up). Plus, they put Estella Warren wearing some kind of leaves made bikini, isn't that superficial and commercial? This is the first Tim Burton film that deceives me, and I hope it's the last one. This is a very good example of a movie which has special and make up effects as a structure. many people won't realize it, because they'll be fascinated by the images, but this blind attitude is exactly what the makers expected. Planet of The Apes is more a (commercial) vision of The Planet of The Apes by Tim Burton. It is not so identic to the original, I couldn't say it's a remake. The ending is good though, but is still pretty predictable. But really, you can't really get inside of the movie, because it is not attaching enough, all you can do is look at the images...I give it 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILERS*I liked this film. I went to the cinema, paid my money and was entertained for the 2 or so hours it was on. It is a good film. Not a great film, but a good film. Too often people compare it to the original (which in itself was hardly a cinematic masterpiece), stating silly things like; "Why can the humans speak?"... Because it's a different film! There's simply no reason why they couldn't speak!? They are the decendents of english speaking humans! "How can I not compare it?"... okay, they're both about monkeys! But the story line is completely different from that of the original. Star Wars and Star Trek are similar but the two are very rarely compared.The make-up is fantastic, the movement and acting is generally above par. The special effects are pretty awsome. The sets range from spectacular to pretty unimaginative, but this was possible intended (how interesting can you make a barron desert?)The statue of liberty style "twist" at the end isn't done in the same format. After seeing the original you would say: "Oooooh, right! That's what happened!?" After seeing POTA 2001 most say: "How the hell did that happen?" - though this has been critisised I think it was a deliberate attempt by Burton to give the viewer the option of drawing his or her own conclusions (yes, you have to use your brain!). Why people see this as an opening to a sequel, I don't know - it's not! There won't be a sequel... bets anyone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has some of the most elaborate makeups that somehow feel life like. All the apes walk with an "apey" wobble and the expressions they all make give an underlying realism only Tim Burton could have brought about. However his magic was lacking from the movie. The movie seemed to have a not so convincing or involving story twists I would have attributed to a re-creation(not remake) of a classic like this. It fails to make any lasting impression. Helena Bonham Carter does her bit well, so does the rest of the crew. Appearance by Charlton Heston (although barely recognizable) is memorable.As for the sound, it is very good. The LFEs are quite convincing and less distracting. The set of the planet matches with the score perfectly well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pick, pick, pick : ). Sure you can quibble about the details, but I grabbed the kids and took them to see it when it first came out and no one was disappointed. We all got a kick out of it and afterward we rented the original so that we could compare. The kids thought the newer version was better, but I suppose a lot of that has to do with the updated technology and all. Now that they've gotten hip to DVDs and all the features they include, they want me to get it for all the inside stuff so I suppose I'll preorder it here. The make-up jobs in this film were certainly much better than in the original. I expect that will make its category at the Oscars. I had no problem with the acting, Tim Roth is always great, look forward to anything he's in. I didn't get Wahlberg's performance till I thought about it a bit more and realized that was his character, a bit selfish and tunnel-visioned. He kind of deserved the ending ; ). And I rather enjoyed seeing a different version and wouldn't mind seeing more directors do this. Seeing the second version of Psycho mimicked shot for shot left me cold. This version of Planet of the Apes still dealt with the important issues and I'm glad for that. We all had a lot of discussion about the nature of human behavior and how we all need to get along somehow. I know the cynics are scowling now, but its true. I see some folks don't get the ending and I'm not sure I do either. Perhaps that was intended, because it was left wide open for a sequel. Anyway, I'm not going to quibble, it was enjoyable and fun to watch, worth the money. Lord knows we could use a little entertainment nowdays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps there's no such thing as a bad Tim Burton film, but Planet of the Apes comes perilously close. Visually the make-up is generally impressive ? the overall effect of seeing so many simian humanoids at once is quite overpowering, even if most of the set-design is pretty unimaginative.Tim Roth's performance as a sort of Richard III ape is perhaps the most memorable ? his strangulated restless manner is reminiscent of the mortally wounded Mr Orange in Reservoir Dogs (although he wasn't a monkey). Bonham Carter is also impressive in a decisive departure from her flowery Merchant Ivory image. Only the make-up lets her down ? her visage seems to have been tampered with in an ultimately futile attempt to make her look her like an attractive ape. This fails. On the other hand, Estella Warren's Daena is far too much like a supermodel to look like a convincing native girl.So why does Planet of the Apes fail? Here are some ideas.1) Why do the humans on the planet speak? In the original film and the novella there was a direct human-apes reversal situation ? the humans could not speak or communicate anymore effectively than monkeys can on Earth. That was why the arrival of Heston's character stirred the waters. Here the humans are clearly ruled over by the apes, but given their supposed ?mastery of technology' which the apes lack, there seems no real reason why the apes should be so dominant. Burton seems to be striving for a civil rights parallel. Roth's ape even misquotes the reactionary Senator Barry Goldwater at one point. But this paradox still makes little sense.2) Too much of the dialogue is banal or just stupid. There are a number of signs the film is rushed.3) The ?comedy' orang-utan is annoying. 4) Wahlberg is no action hero. He got away with it playing a porn actor but not here. 5) The ending seems to be an attempt to echo that of the novella. Yet that made sense. This one doesn't. It is not clever, just inexplicable. I HEREBY DEFY ANYONE ON THESE PAGES TO EXPLAIN THE ENDING SATISFACTORILY! It's impossible - it's nonsensical.Overall, not a disaster, but highly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a certain perception that is suggested when Tim Burton takes the helm of a movie. That perception is that you'll see something very different than the usual lint that's produced after good movies are tumbled about in the Hollywood dryer; with all their wrinkles removed, sickly pseudo fresh (like a Downey fabric sheet that touts it smells of `Fresh Rain' yeah right), and softened as not to cause chaffing. But Burton is different. Burton has vision. Burton is a visionary. I have uttered those words before in reference to his litany of twisted, incredibly clever and dark films. Burton's early shorts, Vincent and Frankenweenie, are things born of a mind and an eye that's capable of seeing the world through gray colored lenses. Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Batman, Mars Attacks?every one of these movies had that vision?that dig up the dirt up and put it under the light feel.Which is why then, with Planet of the Apes, I can claim as the only explanation for such appalling drivel is that Burton completely and utterly sold out for the lure of a `Big Budget Hollywood Summer Blockbuster'. Who better than Burton to `revisit' P of A (as Burton nearly screams in every interview that this is NOT a remake), one of the darkest and engaging sci-fi films made? But, here's the question: if this is not intended to be a remake, then why not cast that famous Burton vision on this piece and make it something more strange, more?dare I say?human? Take Burton's other films?the hero is most often an odd, socially maladjusted, misunderstood, feared, decidedly melancholy, alone, scared and scarred, but somehow better than the lot of others around him. His characters, in their own eerie way, show the more benevolent side of human nature.So, then Mark Wahlberg's self-serving Leo in P of A is someone NOT from Burton's world. So, then the `plot' (and I use the word `plot' with hesitation) of P of A is also something not Burtonesque. Thus the whole experience is such a total let down that it makes one wonder if big budgets and high profile stars stifles anything creative as easily as a 40ft wet blanket thrown on a single lit match (enter into evidence America's Sweetheart). Burton usually strives on lancing the boil of our perceptions and getting to the raw under layer of cultures?and P of A (the original was a hearty, if campy, examination and damnation of the snobbery of humans to dub ourselves as rulers of any planet) would seem to give Burton the chance to perform a wonderful social surgery.The gray colored glasses though were replace by the $green$ colored lenses, and so we are left with just another shell of a movie. The only vision Burton can see, for what are supposed to be genetically enhanced apes, is that they will emulate human social customs?they will form armies, they will have a senate, conduct dinner parties and sport Jackie O bobs; this is visionary? Hardly. In the end all we learn from Burton's P of A is the same thing we see in too many movies and the same thing we see in nearly every nook and cranny of the world; whoever can beat one's chest the loudest, whoever can physically beat the other side down, whoever has better weaponry will ultimately prevail. Burton had the chance to show a better way?instead he merely aped his lesser peers and created another loud, ridiculously expensive and mindless testament to violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES was a film that sufficed but left me wanting more. The film stressed more, OZ style sets and costumes and great backdrops over gunplay. The script and story had a few continuity problems (probably due to editing) yet the film is a great update of the first two movies. I think the original series warts and all is the best. I liked this film and primarily the " camp by the water sequence" for the lighting and art direction. The film features an all star costumed cast. In the opening on the space station the name on whalbergs suit reads briefly "wahlberg". PLANET OF THE APES main problem was it's "too quick" resolution of the conflict and not enough exploration of the FORBIDDEN ZONE. A good film and well told also imaginative on the visuals and TOLKIEN novel visual flair. This is perhaps TIM BURTONS best film. Of note is the genre classic line "okay guys we only got one shot at this". The apes were too realistic I am a fan of the original chambers designs...yet these were utterly life like. Of note is the surprise ending in keeping with the 1973-74 animated series and an origianl draft by serling. One more note...the forbidden zone sequences look like some of the story boards for the DEHN scripted sequel. (fascinating)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*The original is already a classic and here the makers got the chance to introduce the story to a younger generation taking advantage of the technical advantages of today while using one of the original director of today's Hollywood, Tim Burton, whose unique style is something that can give the edge the film needed. However the result is less than you expected from a technical or story and characters development point of view.As usual there are a list of good and bad things and I'll start with the good ones:- Make up - Almost perfect. The actors look like apes and you would not guess that there are real actors under the masks(I won't be surprise if the make-up will win an Oscar). That saying there are some reservation. While the man apes are perfect the female apes are less good. They look like actors and not like real apes. The decision to let the apes walk and jump like apes do is used to a great effect and is the big advantage of the film.- The dark tone of the story is been reflected in the dark cinemtography. Even when there is light it is not a strong one but it is moody and dark.- Music- As usual the music from Danny Elfman is effective and serve the film.- Tim Roth as General Thade is excellent and his performance convey the menace and the hunger for power that exist in his character.That all I can say that was good in the movie. The list of bad things will be longer:- Mark Wahlberg as Capt. Leo Davidson is weak. He doesn't carry the film on his shoulders and moreover he is not as strong as Tim Roth's Thade. How can anyone see him as a messiah is beyond my understanding.- In the original film the main female character, Dr. Zira(Kim Hunter), was a scientist. She fought for the humans to have equal rights because she think they are intelligent but she could not prove it because all the humans in that film couldn't speak. The arrival of Col. Taylor(Charlton Heston) gave her the tool to prove her theory because he could speak. Beside that she was a strong and believable character. Here the main female character, Ari(Helena Bonham Carter,) is been portrayed as "human lovers". There is no reason why shy thinks like that or what made her change her mind in such an hostile environment towards humans. It doesn't help that her performance is so weak and her contribution to the film is less than zero. In general the female apes are less convinced than the men apes.- Towards the end of the film,the chimpanzee that was sent in the beginning of the film and that we thought has already died, re-appear,out of nowhere. This development in the story is very contrive and served only as mean to end the battle between the apes and the human. How the chimpanzee has survive the magnetic storm. Your guess is as good as mine. Another development that strike me as contrive is the decision of General Thade's aide to simply turn to the other side just because he doesn't believe The General anymore. Why has this happened? Through the whole film that aide is a loyal servant. He has no reason to doubt The General so what happened now? Was it enough for him to hear Cat.Davidson's words in order to change his heart? In short no logic in both events.- The ending doesn't help making the film coherent. The only explanation i can think of is that the storm was not only a jump through time but also a jump through dimension. Otherwise the whole film stand on very weak basis and the ending make the whole film illogical.- I like Tim Burton. I have seen every film his has done(not all perffect) and I would continue to see his films. However something is missing from this film. He is in his best when he direct projects that he initiate or are close to his heart. His best films were the ones that have an outsider as a hero that Burton, as an outsider himself, can identify with. I didn't have the feeling that he was fully committed to this project, probably because he was hired to direct this film and didn't initiated it.At the end I was very disappointed. Something that looked good and promise to taste good turned out to be not as good as it should and could have been. Just like an half baked cake. It looks good from the outside but it taste bad because someone forgot to put some of the ingredients that would have make the best in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: For those who haven't seen this film, please do NOT read my review. I will be outlining the plot, or lack thereof, in my critique.Several years ago, legendary scriptwriter William Goldman lamented that it was no longer fun to ridicule current films. The present author agrees, citing Hollywood's limited imagination and obsession with proper packaging. One example can be found in Tim Burton's `reimagined' Hollywood's classic, Planet of the Apes. Mr. Burton is known for the Batman series, The Nightmare before Christmas, and Beetle juice. His Planet of the Apes is another dark foreboding film aimed at summer moviegoers.Burton correctly did not compete with the original movie's screenplay written by Rod Serling. The creator of The Twilight Zone was inspired by Pierre Boulle's satirical novel Monkey Planet. Now one can buy the novelization of the Tim Burton film. As one local paper observed, Burton created another contemporary action film. A US Air Force pilot marooned on a strange planet, pleas for us to love our neighbors, as we would love ourselves. In other words, Batman passed through the Stargate to discover EnemyMine. The author is grateful that he did not have to pay to see this forgettable remake. However, one should keep perspective and view this film as part of Hollywood's highly successful strategy as an electronic baby sitter. Its core audience is probably unaware that Planet of the Apes launched the first commercially viable nerdocracy nine years before Star Wars.What was Planet's secret? Great costumes, breath taking special effects, eye-catching explosions, token comic relief and of course sex appeal. The film team cut and pasted this formula onto the script but added his trademark: darkness protects evildoers. Instead of swaggering through Gotham's streets, these nefarious characters literally swing from tree to tree. Then our hero with the subtle last name of Davidson leads his people into the Wilderness. Meanwhile eye candy masquerading as characters diverts the male lead's attention: Helen Bonham Carter and Estella Warren. His young male audience secure, Burton enlisted living legends Charleton Heston and Kris Kristofferson ostensibly to develop the plot. However, the author suspects they were bait to lure the Baby Boomer generation.Thus, one can discern a movie's full power without distractions like plot or dialogue. One applies this Zen-like state when watching Burton's film. You should suspend disbelief when learning that the US Air Force in 2068 cannot prevent a rogue space launch. Then Mark Walberg, our Rambo-like hero, travels thousands of years into the future not because of technology. He is a cosmic Dorothy sucked into a space tornado that accelerates his vehicle past 88 miles per hour. Once in Oz, the newly arrived prophet reveals several millennia of tradition as a lie.How does he do it one might ask? Because Marky Mark is charismatic and bright. His character only needs a couple of days to gather a band of followers and discover the ruins of his old space station. Somehow falling out of orbit, the facility's nuclear power plant and computers still work. Our intrepid Spaceman discovers the truth: On Space Station Oberon, human and apes astronauts lived in happiness. Then the chimp Semos, like the Serpent in the Garden of Evil, spread hate.Apparently, Burton's filmmaking team believes that current moviegoers are unable to grasp ambiguity. Whereas the original film showed a world of mute humans, Burton's world is one where man had nothing to say. Heston's conflict at the ruins in the Forbidden Zone revolved around the clash of ideas. Kung-fu trained gorillas fought ideological issues the original film never resolved.In conclusion, the author believes he is too harsh. After all, the movie had hot leads, good production values and the plot was enough to keep me awake. My favorite part was ending, partially because the torture was over. However, another reason was Burton's ending was reminiscent of Boulle's finale. In the novel, our hero lands his spacecraft at a Paris airfield is met by a police car. Which was driven by a gorilla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Evolution of the Ape...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those of you who watched this version of that 1960s sci-fi classic about intelligent simians on a mysterious planet having dominion over mankind in the distant future were probably in for a little surprise (assuming you've seen the original).I would have to say that this latest film incarnation by Tim Burton is not at all a remake, but rather a retelling of the apes story from a perspective of pure fanfare and entertainment. Yes, there were several references throughout the movie on the morality of treating fellow humans, apes or any walking-and-talking being alike with respect and contempt. But there is a difference between this year's version and the original classic starring Charlton Heston.In 1968, the original `Planet of the Apes' revolutionized the sci-fi genre through its shocking image of mankind's future on the Planet Earth. Of how an inferior species such as the apes could grow in power and intelligence to rule over humans, largely because mankind itself had used weapons of mass destruction on each other, therefore contributing to a series of events leading to ape domination. Because the 1960s were such a turbulent time both politically and socially for the American people, the youth could especially empathize with the film's antiwar message. I'm sure no baby boomer will ever forget the gut-wrenching conclusion of Heston pounding his fists on the beach sands and damning all of humanity to hell after feasting his eyes upon a half-buried Statue of Liberty. Such scenes reflected the frightening times of the Cold War and Vietnam War, both looming as a shadow over the U.S. and other countries during that decade, and the whole movie itself directly reflected the mood of the times.Burton's version is quite a departure since it focuses on simple adventure entertainment and stunning visuals rather than any symbolic metaphor on the dangers of a worldwide engagement in nuclear war, or for that matter, any epidemic. Instead of Planet Earth being the venue, Burton seems to have taken us to another world in another galaxy, therefore giving us a fresh take on the apes story. At least this time around, the human slaves have the ability to talk. I will never forget such scenes as Mark Wahlberg's pet chimpanzee landing in his space capsule from the sky during the climax of the ape-human battle. These and other highlights made `Planet of the Apes' the escapist formula it deserves to be. There are many inside dialogue references to the original `Apes' film, but I suggest you go see that version first in order to catch them all here.The movie is also blessed with a bunch of gifted performers. Mark Wahlberg is OK as the chief protagonist. But Tim Roth practically steals every scene he is in as the villainous ape general Thade. With his experience as a stage actor, Roth magnificently portrays an enemy who is thoroughly corrupt and demonic with no hint of remorse. Helena Bonham Carter provides an example of simian benevolence through her open-minded chimpanzee character. And Michael Clarke Duncan, being the huge man that he is, is at times terrifying as a gorilla commander. Oh, and yes, keep an eye out for cameo appearances by Heston and Linda Harrison, stars from the original `Apes' movie.One common element between the two versions of `Planet of the Apes' is that both have a shocking finale, but for those who have not seen either, I will go as far as that! For sheer pleasure, I rate this 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSAs with many of you reading this, I love both Planet of the Apes (1968) and the films of Tim Burton.However, like oil and water, the two are not a great mix.I like the fact he had a brave stab at one of Hollywood's best sci-fi movies and Rick Baker is bound to get an Oscar for his work on the make-up.However, that script and plot left a lot to be desired.There are little things that bug me, not the huge sweeping visions of apes thundering across the planet in Braveheart mode.When astronaut Mark Wahlberg puts his hand on a thousand year old door lock, it opens with barely a problem. If I leave my car door closed for a month it seizes up.And when Mark crashes his space pod at the end, he strolls from the wreckage like he's just got up from his chair to make a cup of tea. Where is the logic in simple inertia and seized up mechanics. It doesn't take a genius to apply these little things that make all good sci-fi films work. Okay, it doesn't have to be Nasa approved but it does have to have a modicom of reality we can all relate to.2001 has been one of the bleakest years in living memory for movies and the news. Planet of the Apes will not be remembered for turning things around but merely burying them in a deeper pile of misery.If you only watch one film this year, make it Moulin Rouge and leave Tim Burton's flawed offering well alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don´t forget it is a FANTASY movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! Don´t read if you didn´t see the movie yet!At first I have to say that I didn´t see the original movie yet (shame on me!) but I don´t consider this to be important for this review. As I´m a Tim Burton-Fan, I had to watch the new "Planet of the Apes" - and I liked it.It is a great movie, full of fantastic pictures - the great comic-style, which I love Tim Burton for. The soundtrack is perfect, the special effects are great and , what is the most important: the story is very entertaining and full of suspense.Of course, as many of you did, you could ask many logical questions as: - Why are there horses on the planet? - Why are there different races? - How is it possible for a few humans and two apes to ride through a complete camp of aggressive apes? - Why does the chimp land exactly at the moment when Leo is about to lose his fight? - How is it possible for a small spaceship, to fly from the planet of the apes back to the earth? And why does it only take three minutes? - Why does Estella Warren wear lipstick? - Why is the earth full of apes at the end?I read many questions like this, and of course there are many more you could ask! But please don´t forget, it is a fantasy movie! A fantasy movie doesn´t need to be realistic, and it also doesn´t want to be!Nobody asks why it is possible to hear noises, when space ships in Star Wars shoot at something - although it is impossible to hear noises in space! A fantasy movie lives of exaggerations! Why do you always bother about realism in fantasy films? If you want to watch a realistic movie, then you should watch a drama or something, but no fantasy or science-fiction movie! - Or at least, don´t wonder about exaggerations!Of course it was not a perfect movie. Mark Whalberg really didn´t act very well, and I often asked myself why Estella Warren is in this movie. She is always in the middle of the plot, looking beautiful but speaking only five sentences over the whole movie.But altogether it was a very nice movie. I will have to buy the DVD as soon as it is available!Therefore 8 out of 10.Well, I think I will watch the original movie soon, but I´m not looking forward to compare the movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, I'm not reviewing "Tomb Raider," or even "Hobgoblins," but a film somewhere along that line: The remake of "Planet of the Apes."It might be unfair to judge something without seeing/reading/whatevering the original, and I haven't. But I nearly did once, and after watching a few minutes, I left. I couldn't do that with this one, because I came with my brother, his teacher, the teacher's son, and the son's friend, and couldn't go anywhere else. [sob] Just kidding there.I have got to start coming into movies with NO expectations. When I want an okay film, it sucks; when I think it'll be bad, it is; and whenever I think it'll be good, it's okay, and that isn't good enough. Here, I thought it would be bad. Tim Burton's remake (I'm not calling it a reimagining, it doesn't deserve such a title) was such a bad film, that whereas I thought in the theater, it was closer to the "okay" line, now I think it was closer to the evil of Tomb Raider. (Maybe it exceeded that.) Quite a turnabout!I'm an 11 year old (and am awfully smart for my age), and I had to do homework for a week-and if you knew me, you would know that I wouldn't consider it without a bribe-to see this. I barely got by, and after leaving, I said to myself, "I did a week of homework for THAT?!" It's that bad.The only redeeming part was the ending. And even that sucked. (Spoilers ahead, just as you would expect from me.) I mean, the first part was stupid-the apes caused the humans to mutate like that? (It was subtler, but that's the general point.) The final scenes where he gets back to Earth were cool-replacing the Abraham Lincoln statue with an ape-but it leaves a plot hole bigger than my lust for death after the film. If Earth's humans get turned into apes like that, how the f*** did Leo stay human? (I'll leave out the words next in my mind, because the IMDb would reject this thing.) Plus, how does the theater audience stay human? (Just kidding, but still...)This is the type of film that makes people consider suicide. Name a worse film that I haven't seen, and I'll consider seeing-and destroying-the film. No? FiguresRating: -2537396746584475673/6 (Lately, that thing hasn't been working.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the effects, not the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had mixed feelings about this film.Let me start by saying my enjoyment would have been greatly increased had this been a pseudo-sci-fi, action, ape-based flick that stood on its own merits instead of being associated with "The Planet of the Apes". There were certainly things in this film which made it worth seeing.Despite what is said, the visuals and effects were interesting. There was enough story to at least hold the interest of most.Sadly, what it lacked are those elements which made the original PotA good. The original had weak effects to be sure and the plot even had its problems. Nonetheless the depth of the plot, the debate about the content of man, the thoughts and concepts that were classic, are all missing. I would have hoped that in a "re-imagining" the philosophy and concepts would have CHANGED; but not that they would have been omitted.I still use illustrations from the original to elucidate points. I didn't walk away with such a feeling from this movie. The debate between superiority of human vs. ape has been reduced to scant allusion to racial tension. There is enough illogic to not deserve itemization (the horses have already been discussed quite throughly). Worst of all was the ending. My friend and I are quite familiar with sci-fi, fantasy, irony and great literature. We "get" most every reference. However, BOTH of us looked at each other and said "huh"? While there may be some explanations for this they didn't even establish enough clues for some healthy hypothesizing. It seemed just "thrown in" and out of context with the rest of the movie.To close out the critique I will just state that there is a positively tragic movement in Hollywood to "dumb down" every creation. It's like Hollywood has the touch of mental mediocrity. You'd think for scores of millions of dollars they could somehow come up with a story and content worth the millions of dollars of effects. Give us something that can stimulate our minds, not just our senses. I fear this "re-imagining" fell prey to this phenomenon.That being said, I return full circle to the fact that this movie enough going for it to have been enjoyable were it to stand on its own (and taking into account the current brain-dead state of today's Hollywood scripts). There were a couple homages to the original movie which gave us a laugh or two. As I said, the effects and even visual composition were worth seeing. If you wish to see a movie to go "ooooh" and "aaahhhh" over the effects as opposed to the "invisible effect" approach (where you are engrossed in the story, not aware of the visuals being "effects"), then you will enjoy this.I would recommend watching this. Just enjoy it for what it is and don't expect a level of content comparable to the original. At the very least, this movie is FAR beyond the level of any "Apes" SEQUELS, which had thoroughly useless plots without the concession of good effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quit moaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I wonder if people go to the cinema purely for the purpose of moaning and sniping about the films they see. While I will admit that far too many films are moronic today, so to are far too many of the audience. The original Planet of the Apes is undoubtedly a good film with some stunning moments ( it's wonderful how a film gets elevated to the level of masterpiece when people need a reason to moan about its sequel / remake ), but the potential was in the premise for a different type of film. For all the original's strengths I think you'd be hard-pushed to claim it was exciting, or visually interesting. Tim Burton has seized the opportunity to explore these possibilites, resulting in a highly entertaining if undemanding film. As a complete redraft of the original it is ultimately a very different entity, but it in no way embarrasses the original nor takes anything away from it. Honestly, what do the 'how dare they do this to a classic film' brigade imagine is going to happen? Do they think the original is going to cease to exist? That from now on people will only ever discuss the remake? Unlikely. There is little in this film that will cause much discussion, but then I've never heard anyone discuss the original either. And yes, the ending is obvious and not as good as the first one ( as the most known 'twist' ending of all time they could scarcely have repeated it ), but there is nothing in the original that scarcely comes close to the amusing satire on human behaviour to be found in the first half of Burton's remake. Most important of all (and this goes out particularly to those who decry the tarnishing of the original 'classic'): This movie is FUN. You can't say that for the '68 version...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say it. Tim Burton's retelling of Planet of the Apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys.OK, that's off my chest. No more monkey puns, I promise.Seriously, though, Planet of the Apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing, filled with thrills, action, adventure, wit and bits of funny (dare I say, monkey) business. I know, I know, I promised.And for those film buffs who are fond of the original, Burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie.Mark Wahlberg stars as Capt. Leo Davidson, a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future. He crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted, captured and sold into slavery.Despite being darker than the original, Burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious.Some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically Burton: An organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed. Then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter. The seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty: "One thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager," he says. You don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement. Touches such as these are what stamps this movie with Burton's brand.Lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout: The first words spoken by an ape to Davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are: "Take your stinking hand off of me, you damned, dirty human." Anyone familiar with the first version of the film will, of course, recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue.Another of Burton's in-jokes is to have Charlton Heston, star of the original, play the chimpanzee father of Tim Roth's Gen. Thade. The young chimp goes to visit his dying father. Both have one thing in common, a hatred of humans. With his dying breath, the elder spews out his vile: "Damn them, damn them all to hell," he says before expiring. That is the famous line Heston's Taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret.The performances throughout are top-notch. Wahlberg plays Davidson not as some gung-ho hero, but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home. He is reluctant to lead the human rebellion; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet. This hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable.Roth is ferocious, cunning, cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity. He leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet. It is a masterful turn.Helena Bonham Carter is Ari, the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals. Hers is a smart, compassionate characterization.Michael Clarke Duncan is big and brutal as Attar the gorilla aid to Thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken.A fine comic outing is given by Paul Giamatti as Limbo, the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures. As the battle between apes and humans looms, the cowardly Limbo pleads, "Can't we all just get along," echoing the words of Rodney King.Much of the success of Planet of the Apes goes to Burton's technical crew, especially production designer Rick Heinrichs and the legendary Rick Baker who created the ape makeup.Burton's musical collaborator, Danny Elfman, provides another fine score, though it is not as memorable as his work on Batman or Sleepy Hollow.The movie's only letdown comes at the very end where Burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original. He comes close, but falls short.Otherwise, Planet of the Apes is what a summer movie should be: An amusement park ride filled with lots of action, stunts and a few laughs. This is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the intelligence of 12-year-olds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a committed fan of the original movie, and also of the under-rated TV series, I felt duty-bound to see Tim Burton's reinterpretation, despite the off-putting hype. What I saw can be simply and honestly summarised. Special effects (the least consideration of any cinema-goer whose IQ achieves triple figures), very good. Make-up, very good (Thade especially). Mark Wahlberg's acting, monosyllabic and wooden. Helena Bonham-Carter's acting, a little better than her usual low average. In my native England this movie carries a 12 rating (i.e. suitable for viewers of age 12 and over), which slightly over-estimates the level of intellectual maturity required. A complete absence of plot and character, but a superabundance of noise and violence. Much jumping and gratuitous aggression from the apes, considerable banality from the humans (especially Wahlberg). Given the considerable resources available to Burton we are entitled to something considerably less moronic than this flimsy, catchpenny movie, which cynically exploits brand loyalty and the reputations of director and cast. The truth is that this film will not bear scrutiny six months from now, let alone in a decade or so's time. None of this will matter. Mugs like myself have ensured that it was a box-office smash. More fool us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read somewhere that this is the worst movie Tim Burton has ever made. Well, for that, its pretty cool !On the other hand, there is nothing in it to get in any way excited about it. Just a very average science fiction story. Well the surrounding are made very nice. The apes really look and behave like intelligent apes. But the story itself lacked any noticeable inspiration, except maybe some nice jokes - such as apes fearing water. On the other hand, there where story holes, and unexplained parts. Especially the end was really bad.For men, there is Estella Warren with her supersweet kissme-mouth. But she appeared quite seldom in the scenes, and had not really much more personality and charisma than the boring Marky Mark, the main actor. Helena Bonham Carter was however very good, as was Tim Roth.I can't really recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to be objective with this new vision of Planet of the Apes, as the overwhelming desire to compare it with the 1968 original is almost too much to bear for any would-be movie critic with too much time on their hands. However, a word of caution ? they are two very different movies. The original, with its world-weary Heston, moralising anti-nuke plot and the gee-shucks-can't-we-all-just-get-along narrative, plays out like one of the better episodes of Star Trek. Tim Burton's take on the simian planet is a million miles away (literally) from the Franklin J. Schaffner version, and so we have the action and the hokey chimptalk, but none of the social relevance. This, quite frankly, damns the film, damns it all to hell and makes it yet another summer blockbuster of running about and shooting at nasty things.However, considered out of the context of the whole Apes saga, this is a damn fine no-brainer popcorn-flick with plenty of action, plot twists, rugged heroes and monkey madness. Helena Bonham Carter makes a decent chimp, Tim Roth makes a decent psycho-baddie and Mark Wahlberg makes a decent, well, underwear model. There is enough to keep your average film junkie happy and the movie does not outstay its welcome.Hollow, but entertaining nonetheless, Planet of the Apes (2001) is not a bad film and is only disappointing when compared with a) the original b) Tim Burton's back catalogue. It's also a damn sight better than the four sequels and the TV spin-offs. Come to think of it, The Simpson's Planet of the Apes Musical may not be such a bad idea after all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I took my son to see this, I tried to set my expectations real low, as I had read the reviews. The visual eye-candy is 100% brilliant, and it's not a disagreeable way of passing 2 hours, so what's wrong? Unlike the original film, the humans haven't regressed mentally, in fact they seem quite cultivated. The film contains no real challenges, no warning of ecological disasters. This film is just a "product" there is no religion, no politics, no racial problems. In fact humans and apes can get along just dandy, just with a twist of the director's pen.This is the Planet of the Apes series "Phantom Menace". Tim Burton: remember the anguish we all felt in the original film when we saw all human history reduced to the head of the statue of liberty poking from the sands... THAT WAS CINEMA!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read somewhere that this is the worst movie Tim Burton has ever made. Well, for that, its pretty cool !On the other hand, there is nothing in it to get in any way excited about it. Just a very average science fiction story. Well the surrounding are made very nice. The apes really look and behave like intelligent apes. But the story itself lacked any noticeable inspiration, except maybe some nice jokes - such as apes fearing water. On the other hand, there where story holes, and unexplained parts. Especially the end was really bad.For men, there is Estella Warren with her supersweet kissme-mouth. But she appeared quite seldom in the scenes, and had not really much more personality and charisma than the boring Marky Mark, the main actor. Helena Bonham Carter was however very good, as was Tim Roth.I can't really recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On second thoughts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I don't enjoy this film more than I would enjoy the original Planet Of The Apes films, or even the television series, but Tim Burton's recreation of them has gotten a pretty raw deal, all the same. People scream that the makeup effects weren't well done. Well, what do you expect from an attempt to synthesise human faces with ape bodies? I felt they were done just the right way... such that they looked like apes but the actors were still recognisable.Tim Burton's deft touch in the set design and photography lends his usual dark edge to the film, making it far more grown-up in appearance than the pastel-like sequels to the original Planet Of The Apes, especially the television series. Everything looks a lot more believeable, and the sets appear much more functional. The Omeron looks much more like a deep-space research station, and the flight pods look more like they were designed for their purpose.Mark Wahlberg is good as a caring human being, and I really believed in his compassion for the monkey, but he doesn't quite possess that leader quality. I think it would have been better if he'd been supported by one or two more humans from the space station. The ending, such as it is, had me a little perplexed too. Here is a man standing on the verge of a brave new world where men and other members of the animal kingdom can be educated to work together in harmony, he has a beautiful woman who wants him, and he decides to go home. Sorry, I just couldn't buy that, but then, it's pretty plain to me that the Earth of 2001 just sucks.Still, with all the barbs about inter-species arrogance, reverse racism, and the origins of cults, Planet Of The Apes is one film that should be given a fairer hearing. Maybe the critics of today just need to put down their Bibles, their filmmaking guides, and their prejudices towards old, outmoded special effects, and just lighten the hell up.</fullReview>

The movie goes through a complete reinvention that Burton even dispenses with the "apes do not kill apes" law from the original movie series and TV series.

		<fullReview>I say if you were even thinking of going to a film that just plain visual and somewhat entertaining....see this in the theater! I won't tell you that parts of it weren't just corny or over-Hollywood-ish, but it is rather fun and if you don't go into it expecting too much, you may leave thinking that it really wasn't too bad! Like I did....... I thought that the special F/X were great, the costumes were pretty well designed, and the scenery was very enticing to the eye and mind. Granted, the dialog was mostly silly at best, but again, for an entertaining film with interesting effects and a nice twist on the Ape saga, Go see this movie. It may be good on DVD with surround sound speakers on a big TV, but if you don't have that, go see this while still at the theaters. I think that the graphics and visuals will be lost on small screen. I gave it 7 out of 10 - just for shear entertainment of the flick, not anything more than that..... Burton's mind is very creative, too and deserves a lot of credit for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different take on the Ape concept.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the original "Planet of the Apes" film on DVD, it blew my mind. It was such an incredibly moving film and was so brilliantly well done. Even the 1968 ape make-up was amazing. So when the 2001 film came out, I was anticipating seeing it.My first sitting of the film was somewhat mixed. The opening progresses quite quickly and jumps straight into the point rather than dilly-dallying with any character development. There was an awful lot that happened in the film, and I didn't really get the chance to process it all until after the film had finished. That's not to say that the plot was hard to follow; it just took me a while to process everything that had happened. During that delayed reaction, I commented rather negatively on the film, but once I'd processed it all I appreciated the film a lot better, and thus the film was much better.During my second viewing of the film, I saw it for what it was: really good sci-fi action film. That's not to say that the re-working of the film is a bad thing: the remake gives a fresh angle on the ape concept, which can be a great thing if it's executed correctly. And the 2001 version of "Planet of the Apes" executes it brilliantly.In the modern film, genetically-enhanced monkeys pilot survey pods through unexplored space while the humans stay safely on their space station. When one such monkey is lost in an electromagnetic storm, pod pilot Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlburg) decides to attempt a rescue. With his navigation instruments down, Leo crash-lands on the planet of the apes....just as an ape hunting party is rounding up a fresh wagon-load of human slaves.Critics will say that the new film completely ignores Pierre Boulle's original novel, but it doesn't. The modern story is very different certainly, but it is still closely tied with the novel. Human-sympathising ape Ari (rendered absolutely superbly by Helena Bonham Carter) suggests a reason for why Earth's apes don't speak ("the way you treat them; maybe they don't want to"), which comes from Boulle's original novel. And the movie's ending (one that'll make you gasp out loud) is lifted straight from the original novel.Everything about this film is excellent: the modern ape make-up is amazing, the peformances are of an incredible standard (especially Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth as the human-hating ape Thade), and the characterisation is just as superb as in the original film. The film is brutal enough to make a statement about man's inhumanity to man (and ape), yet there is still a definite humour in the ape parodies of society.This truly is a great film. Go out and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Planet of the Apes, set for a new target audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately I've seen a few bad reviews of this film floating about, at first i thought that this was because of the films somewhat confusing ending. Now i see that people didn't get the idea behind the new film. The film IS a 're-imagining' or whatever you want to call it, and it is not a 're-make.' If you go to the cinema expecting to see the original 'Planet of the Apes' only with different actors and better effects you will come away feeling disappointed, if you go expecting to see a Tim Burton film on a par with the likes of 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'Batman' and with different messages behind it you'll get what the film was trying to do. This is a problem of any film trying to do something thats been done before, the film its self is lost in the comparisons, take 'The Phantom Menace' for example, if you hadn't of seen 'Star Wars' you'd probably thing it was a great film on its own.Long story short: They've taken the original 'Planet of the Apes' and set it to a new target audience. Take that into account when you see it and you'll see a truly great modern film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** spoilers ***I neither do belong to the core-fans category for the classic movie from 1968 nor am I a huge fan of Tim Burton movies. Nevertheless I think Burtons "re-imagining" is better than the critics generally say about it. The center problem is I guess that most people stay with comparing it with the original version although Burton always said he invented new characters and therefore it's not a remake. OK the story-line first is comparable and actors re-appear in the new one but the way Burton used these elements for his new version, is partly very funny and sometimes cynical. I like the scenes when Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) tells Davidson (Mark Wahlberg)"Take your stinking hand from me, you damn dirty human" (remember Heston when he shouts out this one in the original but then dedicated to the apes) or Charlton Heston appears as Thades (Tim Roth) father and telling him about the former power of the humans because of owing guns (that is cynical, especially when Heston tells this and I liked it). But the Burton version has a strong visual accent, perfect make-ups of the apes main-characters (Thade, Attar, Ari, Limbo), a break-through performance by Roth and an interesting story why these apes do rule the planet. It's quite entertaining and - come on - for what further reason was this movie produced? Some things - very independently from the original - could have been made better, for example the acting of the human roles. I guess that Wahlberg in his role as crash-landed pilot is physically strong but not very emotional. He does not seem to be very surprised to find himself in a world upside-down. That's sad because I think he can act quite superb. Estella Warren is only there because they needed a kind of female human that attracts the male moviegoers I guess. She never does find a real part in the movie. There are also logical mistakes in it, some scenes are superfluous (especially some scenes in Ape City) and the ending is strange but what's the point? It's a movie on a blockbuster-concept and it's made for the masses. With this target I guess Burton has done a solid job.</fullReview>

Tim Burton has this time made a movie with characters out of an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie (and a bad one at that) and a story that is sketchy at best. The only reasons to see this movie is for the makeup -which is fantastic- and for Tim Roth as general Thade- a truly menacing S.O.A.B., awesome performance! That can however wait for video-release (preferably an evening when somebody else is paying), don`t pay full fee for this one. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Hollywood attempt at a remake...typical failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone we talk to agrees: Planet of the Apes 2001 is a disappointment. Did they spend a ton of dough to make it? Yes. Is it a blockbuster like Armageddon, Independence day and the like? Almost. Did Shrek and even American Pie 2 make more money (which means more warm bodies and eyeballs)? You bet. Without giving away the weak plot, Tim Burton has screwed up, and had his first bad story, bad acting and his first sell-out. When analyzing a movie, I look at the director's choices: cast, editing style, photography, dialogue and subtext. Cast: Mark Wahlberg deserves a huge movie, he deserves the cash and the popularity. Michael Clark Duncan is typecast as a big tough guy. Tim Roth plays a good bad guy. Helena Bonham Carter could have been replaced by anybody. The savage humans were poorly used, and where did the female human store her MAC makeup kit? Editing: Typical use of quick cuts, swish pans, high speed shutter shots, typical of current batch of action films, usually disguising a bad action sequence. Photography: adequate, did not give away effects, slow motion overused in action sequences. Dialogue: Terrible. Granted, even the Star Wars films have crappy dialogue, but the actors pull it off. Much of the conversation is trite, and the exposition is blatant. The humans should not speak, making the astronaut all the more unusual to the humans and the apes. Subtext: Not enough of it. They hardly touch upon the whole issue of the sensitive apes wanting to free the humans. And the sappy speech by Helena about the human who came from the stars...gimme a break.That being said, the makeup was good for the men, bad for the women, overdone for the female human lead. The sets were overdone. If they had metal helmets and spears and shields, why are the cages made out of wood. The whole time for bed escape scene was too campy for this film. Finally, as a movie that keeps one's interest, this movie fails. About 30 minutes in, I wondered if it was over yet. Thank goodness it's over now. Rule the Planet? I'm afraid not, Tim. Stick to superheroes and Johnny Depp. And if you've got Kris Kristoferson on your payroll, I think the world is ready for Pee-Wee Herman and the Last Crusade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of man, apes and lip-gloss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Planet of the Apes' was originally made in 1968 and turned out to be a box office smash, despite a rather limp plot and none too subtle allusions to the racial problems wracking America. It went on to spawn a number of weaker sequels and a short-lived TV show with ever decreasing results.Having said that, any of them have to be better than this luke-warm effort from Tim Burton. The studio was clear that this was not a sequel or remaking of the first film, it was a 're-imagination' - but it is quite clear that imagination is one thing missing from this movie.As with almost all big studio movies in 2001, the plot has been released back into the wild and is noticeable by its absence. To make up for this oversight the movie lurches from set-piece to set-piece throwing off any semblance of thought and coherence. Rather than have a plot, the movie sets up all sorts of gimmicks to get the heroes out of difficult situations. Mark Wahlberg has a gun in his survival kit, uses it to scare off some hostile apes. But two minutes later the gun is destroyed - oh no, what will they do now? No problems, right at the end of the movie ANOTHER gun is introduced from thin air to help out the heroes. Why not just keep the first one, or not have a gun at all?Instead of having the heroes, (or heaven forbid), the audience think, the movie always plays dumb. The climax is set in a ruined space ship that has been sitting in the desert for thousands of years. This ship (a hugely impressive set) has rusted through almost entirely, collapsed in places and is filled with sand. Yet little tiny switches work first time, convenient doors open and close with satisfying swooshing noises and there are video clips to explain the plot to the hard of thinking. There is simply no magic to the film, no satisfaction in working it out for yourself.And when its not playing dumb, it has gaps in the logic that make you go 'eh'? For instance, if the apes and the humans are both only on this deserted planet because of a crashed space ship, where did the horses come from?Is there anything worth seeing? Yes, Tim Roth's performance *IS* excellent, he does convince you that he is playing an ape and has a fine time chewing the scenery in the finest pantomime tradition. This is helped by some truly astonishing prosthetics used on his face. The rest of the ape designs are less successful, particularly Helena Bonham Carter's mask which is so thick and expressionless that she looks like a Muppet and forces her to talk with an irritating lisp.But if there is one thing that sums up all that is wrong with the film it is Estella Warren - beautiful, blond and completely and utterly pointless. Long lingering shots are devoted to her pouting and flicking her hair, but she does nothing else. Perhaps it's my age I couldn't help but think of Raquel Welch in 'One Million Years BC', but at least she had the decency to be chased by a dinosaur, Ms. Warren just stands in the background like a sulky teenager appealing to the teenage demographic. Perhaps I'm being too hard on her, because she does provide a tiny glimpse of hope for humanity. Apes may well be ascendant, mankind is reduced to savagery and the whole edifice of Western civilisation has come tumbling down but thanks to Estella Warren we know there is a bright future for orthodontistry, a girl can be sure of a fabulous leg wax and there is no shortage of non-smear lip gloss. A planet run by apes doesn't sound quite so bad now does it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got a theory, and it's the only only way i can fathom how this great tragedy of a movie came to be the way it is... Tim Burton slept through every single take, just to wake in time to shout "Cut!" and then nod through the next scene. Honestly, every single element of this movie was without vision, without style, without anything.There is honestly no one to pick on, cause everyone and everything was equally bad. Even Tim Roth irritated me as the over the top Thade. Where did that stupid kid suddenly come from just before the final battle? The so-called twist at the end seem to have been forced in there just to give this film some credibility when compared to the first film. Ironically, it just highlights the incredible shortcomings of it.There are honestly SO MANY BAD THINGS to pick on, but i'm sure the guys here at IMDB have some sort of limit on the length of comments. So, in conclusion: The entire cast &amp; crew of this flick must have been on an overdose of sleeping tablets, god help them.Burton, you better do something next that's up to your previous standards, otherwise i'm coming for your soul...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expecting an enjoyable evening of cinema-going, i went to see Planet of the Apes. Last week I saw Sleepy Hollow for the 5th time, so I hoped (and expected) for some more Burton-magic. When I left for home I had seen almost none of that.First the story. The script had to many flaws. During the whole movie the story stays mainly too shallow, for instance the character of Leo is always two-dimensional. I also missed some big-scenes. Their were just a few moments in the movie that 'resparked'the movie. Also Burton could have done better, for instance the big fight-scene could have been a lot better. Also disappointing was the scenery, it looked like a set all the way. The acting was mainly poor, Wahlberg en Bonham-Carter can be good actors, but this time he couldn't convince me. Warren was a big laugh. The exception was of course Tim Roth. Maybe sometimes over the top, but in general great.In general: 4,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, through out any reference to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow what a great blast of a movie . This is not a remake of the original so be forewarned . The premise is the same but the story line is not , most people like me were left dazed ,confused and shocked esp at the ending .what a cool movie.SPOILER ALERT**** -- dont read below unless you want to .contains ending spoilers.The ending has Marky Mark going back through the time warp storm in space back to earth and his chronometer shows him going back to his own time.Yet when he crash lands in Wash DC , he gets out and looks up at the statue of Lincoln which is now a statue of General Thade ,the ape from the future planet of the apes . And the police are all apes that show up. Id like to see what they do next for an encore . If you go by the original movies , he should have been on the earth of the future when he crash lands at the beginning .But how could that be possible by going into the past and earth is changed as well to an ape planet at the ending ..I agree with some other comments . One theory is that when he goes through the time storm after the lost chimp and into the future that he does not land on future earth but actually another planet in the future. Somehow the chimp does not go through the time warp and just floats off in space and the spacestation crew that are looking for Marky crashland at present while looking for him on the same planet without time warping. This sets off a chain of events leading to the future Planet of the Apes and that the humans are descendants of the spacestation crew and the apes are evolved from the apes that were test subjects on the station. Also near end of movie the chimp arrives in the future which is more confusing , leaving us to believe that somehow the chimp mustve landed here in the past as the apes had knowledge of his return as foretold. Then the chimp somehow takes off again to arrive in the future.And then after Marky takes the chimps spacepod to return to Earth its overrun by apes yet hes back in his own time . Somehow maybe the apes of this future planet used technology from the crashed spacestation to follow marky but ended up going back way further than he did and overtook earth . Thats a possibility but very confusing.Another theory is , he was on earth of the future .that even though it looks like he is nowhere near earth ,that the storm somehow sends him there in the future and when he leaves at the end ,it sends him back in time to earth as well. thats its a slingshot ,so even though it looks like hes traveling away from the planet ,its really only a time warp and hes traveling in a circle with just time changing.Only problem with that is , the spacestation he was on ,they come looking for him and crashland on the planet obviously way before he does. In the movie ,the ruins of the spacestation are a thousand yrs or more old.Could it be that the time warp only threw them a few yrs forward and marky a thousand ? And if it was earth why when they crash landed couldnt they get help ,where were the people?. And what really happened to the chimp,did he land in the past and then the future or what ?. So many paradoxes.Im guessing that the Planet of the Apes is not Earth. That somehow the chimp sets off the events in the past leading to its creation. The human slaves are the descendants of the spacestation crew sent looking for marky .The chimp somehow gets to the future Planet of the Apes, how he does that is a future mystery for a sequel. That the Apes use the spacestation technology and somehow get to earth much further in the past,obviously before the 19th century as the Lincoln Monument is now a monument to Gen Thade. Being highly intelligent and advanced they could have gone back just before Lincoln was around and changed history and thus Thade takes Lincolns place somehow. Too many theories .Wait for the sequel and let hollywood figure it out ..I liked it regardless of confusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you want from a summer movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! Lots of comments here, and most of them negative!It wasn't that bad. Tim Roth was terrific (villain of the year?), great special effects, great action, great humour, even some satire. What else would you want from a summer movie? Not the best or most logical script in the world, and not a patch on the original movie, but this is not unknown in a remake. If you believe what you read Hollywood has been trying to make a new "Planet Of The Apes" movie for years, and Tim Burton was the man who actually managed it. For that at least he should be applauded.The ending didn't really make any sense. Many people have already commented on the ending, and I will not add to the comments here. What I would say is that I wonder if Tim Burton, who has said that he will not be involved in a sequel, chose this ending as a challenge to whoever will be doing the sequel - and surely there will be a sequel. You know "explain that, if you can?". Just an idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton didn't put one ounce of imagination or creativity into thislong, dull film.In fact, he stole ideas and characters from more films than it ispossible to mention. He's like a music writer who patchestogether everything from a 2-bar phrase to a 16-bar phrase from50 different oldies to "create a new song."Just for example, though, let me mention a few. He stole frommovies spanning the spectrum from The 10 Commandments (ironically not the Charleton Heston part, the Edward G. Robinsonpart), to The Time Machine, to Star Wars. And along the way heeven swiped bits from The Wild Geese, Andrew V. McLaglen's1978 film and Red Dawn, John Milius's 1984 film. I can't imaginehe admires either film, but he wasn't above pilfering from them.Oh, yeah. Jai-alai cestas?And of course he stole the whole "shocking" ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping I would enjoy this film and I did!!!!Planet of the Apes really is a wonderful and engrossing film to watch. It has a unique look throughout, with some wonderful and vast sets and locations. The scenery is always slightly different, and that makes it interesting to look at.The conversations between the characters are involving, entertaining and in places even charming. There is some very amusing humour in there as well, nothing hilarious, but enough to get a laugh from the audience.... "There's nothing you want around your house LESS than a human teenager" for example, or the Ape with false teeth!The plot is also good. And to a certain extent keep you wondering what will happen next. Mark Whalberg is excellent as the main character. He's just the type you want in a film like this. Lets face it, you wouldn't want Sylvester Stallone or some other muscle bound 'Conan' type bloke down there. But Whalberg makes a very believable main character. General Thade's character is fantastic throughout also.Finally, you know throughout that SOMETHING will happen at the end. It was inevitable. And what IS at the end was very satisfying, hard to get your head around, but really cool none the less.And anyone who thinks that your a shallow individual for thinking that a 're-make' (or re-imaging) is good, is totally wrong. Planet of the Apes is a fine film that entertains throughout and doesn't disappoint anywhere......... and thats ALL anyone can ask for!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look at all them fancy monkeys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I should warn you that there are a few minor spoilers in this review. So if you don't want to know even minor details about the plot, do NOT read on... (but judging how much money the film made over the weekend, most of you have already seen this film...twice.)I went in to Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES really expecting to see one of the worst films ever. This was a surprise since I love every Tim Burton film I've ever seen (definitely not counting Batman 3 &amp; 4 which he produced, but had no other evolvement and it shows). From his first big screen film Pee Wee's Big Adventure, to my favorite Ed Wood, to the recent Sleepy Hollow, I've admired his style and direction...though most of his films seem to have been edited overnight in some parts.His latest is a "more faithful to the original book" adaptation of the french book; Planet Of The Apes...and just so you don't get upset while watching the film, the book is NOT set on Earth like the original was. In case you were born in the eighties and never knew the joys of playing with the Mego toys of the same name back in the 70s, I'll explain the basic story. A guy gets trapped in a space-storm that flings him to a world where monkeys rule and people don't. Yep, that about sums it up.The book was adapted to film in the 70s starring Charlton Heston and a bunch of similar guys with beards. I believe that the original's sequel Return To The Planet Of The Apes won a special achievement award for Best Beard in a Speaking Role. Not much is known about what happened to those beards after the 70s. I'm sure we'll see an "E True Hollywood Story" about those beards one day, but I digress...Actually one of the first things that sticks out in this new version of Planet Of The Apes is the lack of beards on most of the human characters. Mark Whalberg (of Boogie Nights) plays beardless human astronaut Leo who trains geneticly engineered monkeys to fly spaceships. When one of his monkeys gets lost, he follows it into a space-storm that hurls him to the planet below. This is where the story most of you all know kicks in. Leo is hunted down by human-like bearded apes. Soon he meets a human woman named Daena, her father, a chimpanzee woman who believes in Human Rights, and an orangutan slave trader who deals in humans.So basically we get a peek into Ape society and meet General Thade played by Reservoir Dog star Tim Roth who hates all humans, but loves to jump around and make monkey noises.I won't give any more story away, but lets just say that man and monkey fight and surprisingly the Apes do NOT throw poo. If there is one way to catch a human off guard it would be to throw "monkeypoo" (which, by the way, is my 1 word review of the film Monkeybone) at them. Actually, if they did throw copies of the movie Monkeybone at the humans they would have surly been destroyed much like our own society almost was when it was released.Ok so I liked this movie... There were a few things that bugged me like the make-up on the female "apes" and all the "wired" jumping and, of course, some of the dialogue. But in the end it's a movie about a planet where apes rule and people don't (see 3rd paragraph above). It's campy and yet interesting.Mark Wahlberg continues to bury his Marky Marc image in a role in which Keanu Reaves would have said "Whoa" a lot like in all his films.Helena Bonham Carter's Ari character is actually interesting unlike Estella Warren's Daena character who stands around gape-mouthed for most of the film.The make-up is excellent. Can't get much better `cept for the female apes that I mentioned already.And, YES, there is a "twist"...just not the one you remember. Check it out. Also look for cameos by Danny DeVito and George Clooney. If you blink, you'll miss them. And also look for interesting twists on dialogue from the original film.So, again, I went to this film with the most lowered expectations due to a lot of bad pre-press, but came out liking the film a lot. I'm actually going to see it again and you KNOW I'll buy the DVD when it comes out too. So go...enjoy. Buy candy at the liquor store and sneak it in. $2.00 for candy?

		<shortDescription>Tim Roth as the Feral Chihuahua</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I'd hoped Tim Burton would bring the same clarity of vision he brought to Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood and even the first Batman. Instead, he gave us the second Batman: some great visuals, a few strong archetypes and a terrible script. Tim Roth as the feral chihuahua was ridiculously over-the-top and not in a good way. Perhaps Rick Baker should've stopped punching Estella Warren in the mouth long enough to find her motivation. Or at least a personality. This was a straight-ahead, cliched escape movie, with no pause for character development. The ending wasn't as bad as many suggest and is definitely feasible if you consider that Thade's ultimate fate is left up in the air. It'll take some explaining but it's possible. All in all, I'm hoping Burton will take a pass on the sequel and let someone with stronger STORYTELLING skills take over. NOTE TO JOEL SCHUMACHER: THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went on the movie, Planets of the apes, with "semi" expectations. For some reason I didn´t expect much from talking monkeys. In some way I was surprised with how fantastic the make up was in the movie and how well the monkey, sorry, "ape" caracters were well performed. The physical expression off them was believable and worked quite well but thats about it. I hoped that the movie would get better in the second "half" but on the contrary it got twice as bad.I heard that Tim Burton had made 5 endings to the movie and this one was chosen rather than the others. Anyone who has seen the movie must be thinking, how bad could the other four endings be so that this one was chosen. The ending is so bad that it effects the whole plot of the movie and made me give this movie 4/10.If the ending would have been different, would have made a little bit of sense, then it would possibly get a higher score.Please write me if you think this writing is out of the blue, or even smack down in the middle of the blueÁgúst Kr, IcelandP.S. pardon my spelling</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could easily have been so much better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*******************************************Spoilers all the way, don't read this if you're planning to see the movie.SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! *******************************************I am not going to say anything major about the plot, as it has been related better before.This movie irritates me a great deal. It could easily have been so much better, by some simple adjustments.This film has a lot of plotholes, and most of them could easily have been avoided.1. The language problem Both apes and humans speak english. Pretty stupid if the two species have been on the planet for 1000'nds of years. Why couldn't the two species have spoken some unknown language which Davidson could have been taught in some months' captivity among the apes. This could also have given us a better chance to learn more about ape history and ape culture.2. What are the characters motives for doing certain things? This is a big problem, perhaps the biggest in the movie. A. Why do Thade hate humans so enormously? B. Why do the slave trader switch sides so easily? This could have been better explained. C. Why did Leo Davidsom escape so soon? Wouldn't it have been more sensible to learn more about the place he had come to? D. Why did the blond bomb have a role in the movie at all? Her actions didn't have any significance. E. Why did Ari return to general Thade if she was interested in "The human cause". F. Why did Attar turn against Thade at the end of the movie? H. There are much much more...3. I believe there was something about a man coming from the stars. If this was better explained it could have made Thade's killing of the two space-arrival spotters more easy to understand. It could also perhaps have explained why Attar switched side in the ending.4. There are more, but i gotta go to bed now...------- Im not sure if i will comment much on the ending of this movie as i'm not sure if i understood it. Here are some ways it can be understood. (Perhaps...)A. They were at the earth all along by some strange twist of fate and Davidsons actions altered history so that we got an "Ape" Lincoln. That does not explain that it said general Thade on the statue though. I don't like this explanation, and i hope it is not correct.B. The travelling through and forth in the magnetic storm got Davidson into some other dimension beside ours, where Thade was a hero. This could explain why there were fairly nowadays police equipment and cars when the cops showed up.C. Thade may have travelled back to earth and changed history there after Davidson had gone. We have to note though, that the cops seemed to be evolved apes. This seems to suggest that it must have been a vast amount of time since Thades arrival and Leos arrival at earth. Difficult difficult... Another problem: If Thade and the apes fixed the Oberon in some way, and got it flying, isn't it kind of strange that the original crew didn't managed that some time directly after the crash? Even sophisticated technology is best BEFORE it has been lying around for some thousands of years...This is perhaps just rubbish, and i will be very thankful if someone did this explanation better than me!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I have just seen the movie and all that I can really say is that it is O.K., not a masterpiece or a total dud. The main problem I had, apart from the well signposted ending, was the fact that the constantly changing tone. The script goes from standard sci-fi to action movie to almost a love story, along the way there are attempts at slapstick and satire. There is even a bumbling sidekick! Towards the end it really lost the plot, don't want to give anything away( but trust me you will easily guess the ending) On the plus side the make up and acting were very good.*******SPOILER ALERT*******************SPOILER ALERT************The ending is quite simply a tacked on piece of nonsense, many people have posted ideas about it but none of them hold water. The writers needed a "surprise" ending and from the looks of things used the first one that came to hand. I know that it was the ending used in the book, that does not make it any better.Overall the bad points outnumber the good points but its close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>possible ending?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beware! Spoilers for those who have not seen the movie! I'll just question one glaring plot flaw I have not yet read, before I offer a possible ending to the movie. In discovering the 'mayday' message on the Oberon where Leo finds that he has unwittingly caused all the events etc. We hear the female animal/chimp handler stating that the monkeys have started killing them all. If this were the case, how could humans have eventually out - populated the planet 4 -1? With this and the horses (and certain aspects of the ape civilization) these to me are the major let downs in the story. I quite liked the time paradox angle. And remakes will always be viewed with scepticism by a generation old enough to have enjoyed an original.I watched it without any plot info on purpose (so it could unravel honestly and maybe I could enjoy it more) Anyway, I mostly did enjoyed it until the end then I got the impression there was enough plot for a sequel jammed into the last 15 mins. So if I sum up a few of the plot twists: Apes are descendants of our genetically engineered space cadets. They are deeply religious - except for Thades' bloodline (was his great grandaddy the violent one in the cage they were talking about in the beginning?) Ok we've got that sorted. I think that Leo's character was fairly honestly acted by Wahlberg. He didn't really care about any of the people or apes but just used them to get back to his ship (or what he thought would be his ship). So if for a minute we agree that he is a selfish individual, and that he has no choice but to rally the human troops or be killed by the approaching ape army even quicker (and ignore all that 'we can do it' crap) Heres my version of the ending: The second pod comes down with his chimp mate onboard (this is ok as we know the cosmic whatever has cause this time displacement) Leo doesnt just walk over to it and start man-handling the 'deity' as I'm sure the Gorilla Commander would have taken him apart. But the Space cadet bounds out into Leos arms in Friendship at least giving the still pumped up ape army something to think about for a minute. General Thade who lets face it is not going to calm down for even Simo himself goes all out to kill Leo as he is obviously threatened by the possible shift of power. The Fighting kicks off again and in the scramble Simo is killed, Thade has to kill his own Commander (who is religious) and Leo makes a run for the pod and escapes. In his escape into the sky we see the human element being once and for all dealt with by Thade and his now un-opposed command. Leo enters the cosmic anomally again and is ejected on the other side to what he can visibly see is earth (maybe just thinks he is lucky) he chooses america and flies in etc. Then the end could play out as written. I know I've rushed that a bit but at least it would have tied in the twist ending more plausibly. It also keeps with his selfish character, the total ape population of the 'final' planet and with the overall dark tone (Thankyou Mr Burton) of the movie. The overall massage of these films is what B******s we as a species are. So why even attempt a happy ending, and then mess it up even more with a meaning less twist at the last minute?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT After watching the latest Ape Caper I walked out of the cinema thinking that the film made no sense whatsoever, but it was actually pretty enjoyable nonsense. After a couple of days I came up with a scenario that sort of makes sense. Apologies to anyone who's heard this before, or thought of it already.Spaceman flies into future(NOT the past), crashes on strange planet(NOT Earth). Spends 90 minutes faffing around finding his spaceship with his new found cross species mates, gets into a few fights. Snogs a monkey. Pretty average day so far.Finds spaceship, goes back into the past to find Earth overtaken by the same evil Ape he thought he'd left on a different planet in the future. Mmmm...go figure.After Leo goes 'home' Thade retakes control of the Monkey planet, uses found technolgy to develop space travel, tries to follow Leo with army, ends up even further back in the past than Leo does. Conquers Earth with army, Earth becomes Monkey planet. Leo arrives back on Earth after all this has already happened.Does any of this make sense, probably not...but hey my name's not Kevin Smith...only joking!Scenario for next movie, Leo has to get back to the future to prevent Thade from getting to Earth in the first place. Them darn time travelling space monkeys are nuthin' but trouble!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film, because the 1968 original had a strong impact on me. This is a very good movie, but it suffers from Mark Wahlberg's boring, one dimensional performance. Heston's Taylor in the original goes through a tremendous physical and emotional transformation and takes the audience with him. Mark's acting is a lot like James Franciscus in the first sequel-very wooden.The film also seemed thick and claustophobic, never really allowing itself to breathe. And the music-somebody tell Elfman that less is more, there's too much underscoring here. The supporting cast fares better, with good performances from Tim Roth, Paul Giamatti and Helena Bonham Carter, who channels a bit of Kim Hunter's Zira for good measure. The physical production-sets, costumes, effects, and of course, the makeup are quite impressive.The other major liability is that there's no equivalent to the philosophical jousting between Taylor and Dr.Zaius, hence there's not enough emotional meat for the audience to sink it's teeth into, so the plot twists are almost telegraphed in advance. The Rod Serling-type ending was cool,and you almost have to compare this to the original film, because it's nothing like the book, either. It's obvious a sequel is coming, and they'll do better if it's in the spirit of 1971's Escape from the Planet of the Apes. I give this 3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reimagination of a cult classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, the 1968 Planet of the Apes was one of my favourite science fiction movies of the time. Indeed, a whole generation grew up on the concept of "going ape" over the numerous sequels and the inevitable tv-spin off. So when I knew that Planet of the Apes was going to re-done, I was jumping for joy - at last a real chance to put a big budget to an original concept penned by the author of the book which inspired the Planet of the Apes movies. CONTAINS SPOILERS But with the movie, came casualties - fortuently, Tim Burton, director of Batman (1989), bravely took on the mantle that other directors (i.e. James Cameron) would not take on - the poision chalice that was to "revisit" the planet of the apes. Burton claims this version is a reimagination of the cult classic, but it is clear that Burton wanted to outdo the original in every way possible, and in some areas he certainly succeeds.The costumes, the make-ups, the sets, the direction and special effects is brilliant, and a much darker version of the original, but special effects and costumes do not make a good story. And this is where Burton falls down.The 1968 version of the planet of the apes illustrated and concentrated on pressing issues of the day, namely civil rights, racisim, and to some extents, animal welfare and slavery. The 2001 version, in contrast, doesn't answer or ask questions on any specific issue outside civil, the effects of time travel and animal rights. In fact, it seems to taken more from the Amercian Civil War, rather than today's issues.The plot revolves around a space outpost near Saturn's rings - that use's highly trained and intelligent chimps to do missions that humans won't do - one chimp is sent through an electrical storm to a planet, and Mark Walberg goes to rescue the lost chimp - only to find himself on the planet of the apes. Without revealing too much of the plot - it transpires that Walberg blames himself (with good cause).Yet, with all its dark and well developed speical effects, Its clearly intended as a summer blockbuster movie, it could have been so much more - espically from director, Tim Burton. I expected something wierd yet stragely compelling, yet we have a summer blockbuster movie that tries to get "bums on seats" without a good script and story that was compelling enough.We have the hero, Mark Walberg playing as wooden as I've ever seen him - in a constant state of concentration, with little emotion. Fortuently we have the over-the-top bad guy Tim Roth as General Thade and the wonderful Helena-Botam-Carter to keep the story moving at a fast pace. But sometimes the pace is too fast, there seems to be no time to look around, no time to actually dig at the concepts, the ideas, the questions that it was trying to raise to society, whereas the original stopped and took the time to create concepts and build on the ideas with the ability to ask the questions, and then answer them in a concise and logical way.Some may criticise it for being a trashy summer movie, and in some ways they are right. This isn't one of Burton's best - and nowhere near the original 1968 version - but if you took it as a standalone movie without comparing it to any other Ape movie - perhaps I can agree that it is indeed a good, watchable film - but it lacked the vigor, the charm of the original - and the ending was confusing, yet logical.Thade had gone back to Earth and caused a revolution in the same way that Walberg had done on the Planet of the Apes - the whole story is very similar to the novel - but there is one problem, how did Thade know where Earth was? No-one told him where it was, nor did he know what it looked like. In either case it was a clever ending, perhaps a bit too clever for its own good - because it made the audience confused.Of course the rumors behind the movie fuel the confusion. Was it true that Burton had edited the film right to the last minute? Were scenes cut that would have made the film more of a soul? Did Burton steal the ending of a General Thade sitting in the Lincoln Memorial stolen from someone else? Were there really five different endings? All these questions don't detract from the enjoyment of the movie - but it does make one ask where the soul of the film was and what it was trying to achieve.Throughout the movie there are many problems. For example, throughout the film I kept trying to figure out why, in the year 2029 did the American Space Force use Chimps, and not satellites or other robotic system to investigate the electrical storm? The planet that Walberg lands on is certainly not Earth, as it has two moons - yet, how does Thade (indeed, the whole ape civilisation) move from the planet to Earth? Why, when Walberg goes back in time, doesn't he try to stop himself or his ship from going into the storm? And why, when Walberg goes to Earth does he go straight for Washington, instead of Cape Caveral? Did NASA move its lauch facility to Washington DC?Despite the plots problems, the confusing ending (was Walberg really on Earth all that time or not?), and the general feeling that it had been rushed. I did enjoy the film, and it did make me think about the issues that it wanted to raise, but I just didn't think about the issues or feel enjoyment of the film as much I enjoyed and thought about the original Planet of the Apes - perhaps I'm giving the original too much credit, and Burton not enough - perhaps I demanded and expected too much and cared too little to what Burton was trying to do, trying to say with the film. Nethertheless, the message was lost in amongst the special effects and little care and detail to attention of the main concept of the film.Overall: An average, yet an enjoyable movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i know i am nnot meant to directly respond to another post, but i think these questions need to be answered:*******SPOILER ALERT************Q. How did the clock in the mini-spacecraft know what year it is? You see the year quickly moving forward - on what signal or date is this based?A. I dunno. But it turned out to be innacurate anyway, as Davidson was actually in the past.Q. In the original movie, the humans could not talk. This made it believable that the apes would treat humans like animals, because in our own world, animals do not talk. One of the biggest problems in this remake is that the humans CAN talk. This makes the idea that they would be treated like animals ridiculous. You can bet that if apes could speak English in our world, we probably wouldn't keep them in zoos, animal rights notwithstanding.A. Remember when Americans kept black people as slaves? I beleive they could talk, but it made no difference to their 'masters'.Q. How is that when Capt. Davidson (Wahlberg) lands on the planet, he enters it in the future, but when the main ship crashed on the same planet going after him, it was thousands of years in the PAST? Wouldn't the time be the same for both - after all, they are going through the same space-time distortion?A. The distortion was unstable, so it spat anyone that entered it out at many different points in time. Hence Davidson, the Monkey, and the main ship all entering at different times.Q. It's never clearly explained how the chimps mutated to become apes, and intelligent, English speaking apes at that.A. In the film it is mentioned that they were genetically engineered apes. After arriving on the Planet and killing the humans on the ship, thy evolved into English speaking apes.Q. How did the apes get from their planet to Earth and replace all the humans? A. The apes never left their planet. There planet was in fact Earth. Davidson landed on Earth in the PAST, therefore affecting the future. Since he didn't kill General Thade, we are meant to assume that after Davidson left to return home, Thade escaped from his captivity, got the apes to join him again and dispatched all the humans. So when Wahlberg returned to Earth in the FUTURE, it was populated by apes.Anyway, that's how i understood the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very dissapointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton... Planet of the Apes... what could be a better combination? Well, pretty much anything. I was very disappointed by this movie. First the good - it is visually stunning, as you would expect from a Burton movie; there are a couple of good performances, particularly Helena Bonham Carter who is outstanding. Sadly that's it.Now let's get to the bad and the ugly. The story is so full of plot holes that you'll weep with anger. Didn't anyone bother to read the script? Its nonsense. Characters do things that are obviously absurd and have no internal logic. An example (warning: very minor spoiler), when they get to a river crossing guarded by part of the Ape army, Leo tells us that they can't go around because they don't have time - they have to ride through. But then they wait hours until the dead of night before doing that. The only reason they wait is to make the visuals of the "ride through the camp" scene more dramatic. This makes no sense. It is literally nonsense. And don't even get me started on the ending... its meaningless.Its not just one scene, almost every point in the movie is gibberish if you think about it for more than 2 seconds.Beyond that the characterizations are non-existent. Apart from Leo and a couple of the apes, no one has a character. Who on earth are the humans? What motivates them? Would we care about them if they all got thrown into a giant meat grinder? No we would not.What is most annoying is that this could have been a great movie. The visual execution is stunning. The apes look real and move as you would expect an evolved ape to. They must have spent so many hours and so much money on that aspect of the film. Why did they only spend 26 minutes and $2.80 on the script?Finally, however much of a cliche it has become and however cheesy the costumes where, the 1968 film at least tried to be about something and its famous ending was genuinely related to the point of the film and was truly shocking. The new Planet of the Apes has no point; its ending is a crass setup for a sequel. What a waste of a great potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a rank defiling of the memories I have from childhood of the Planet of the Apes movies and TV shows. I don't know if I was more disturbed by the fact that the acting was bad, the makeup occasionally laughably bad, or the nagging feeling that the end was rushed and limited because they were running out of money... hard to tell. But I have decided the majority of the blame should sit on the shoulders of the writers, who obviously just punched the clock and saved their best stuff for something else. It is impossible to build a good movie without a good script.I'm sick of seeing movies like this one, that cash in on a big opening weekend before word of mouth can get out that it stinks. I'm also sick of seeing movies where it is obvious that the writers ran out of steam and rather than take time to make a good product, just churn out another piece of mediocre crap. Everything doesn't need to be high art, but decent entertainment is a good aspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IT'S NOT CONFUSING AT ALL.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a remake as Tim Burton states it is more of an updateThe original was good but as the ending is so well known it spoils it allot cos you know where the hero is all along. But on the other hand it does have it's advantages over the new Tim Burton version.In the original version, Humans are treated like animals because they can't speak, and the apes are being like humans cos they have the ability to speak. And it shocks the apes when they finally hear one man speak.So there's a conflict in the ape kingdom because the scientists see the human more than just an animal, whilst the others do not want to know and still prefer to think humans are still animals.Where as in the remake, the humans and apes can speak yet they are treated as slaves and also as animals (which contradicts itself in a big way).With slavery- there's always pressure groups and other organisations that will try to abolish slavery no matter how different they are, so I couldn't understand why an entire race would hate humans-for no reasons other than they are humans- and only one person who sees them as something more than.************************************************************************ ***************************WARNING SPOILER ALERT************************ ************************************************************************I thought finding out who Calima really was was a dead rip off to Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Where Kirk finds out who V'ger(the creator the alien race was searching for) is buy scrubbing the dirt away the name V'ger, and finding out that it's actually Voyager. So Calima when Mark scrubs the rest of the dust away was actually Caution Live Animals (And there was me thinking that Calima was homage to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).I can't understand why people are confused about the ending to Tim Burtons remake. What Tim Burton is trying to say, is that as Darwin's evolution tells us, we are direct descendants from apes, now that Mark and his scientist friends, they have tampered with the evolution process, and now the apes are direct descendants from humans. And the statue Mark sees isn't Thade or anyone else but An "Ape"briaham Lincoln (I know corny joke).Another thing is that according to the (TWIST) ending he was on earth all along so therefore where did all those people come from in the ape world? Are they cave people if so how can they speak English perfectly well? If they are on a different planet, are we supposed to put our brains in to Star Trek gear and believe that everyone in the universe speaks English?******OVERALL VIEW OF THE FILM ((((NO SPOILER))))******On entertainment value it is good, but if you're looking for a Tim Burton film- you won't find it here,There's none of his trademarks- the humour is more Hollywood than Tim Burton, and there's nothing strange, or unusual, or magical, that you get when your watching a Tim Burton movie, it's all Hollywood and no Tim.Floyd_Dylan 2001 (review 1)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumbing down for the current generation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether written or film, Sci Fi works best when it's either ahead of it's time and cautionary, or of it's time and satirical. The original Apes' films fell in the latter camp, using the generation gap of the late 60s, the optimism and expectancy of the moon shots and (increasingly) the racial tensions building up in the states as its themes. Tim Burton's film does neither, living with the glib message that "we should, uh, just all get along and live with each other".Though there's a fair amount of spectacle to enjoy and a cracking performance from Tim Roth, POTA is ultimately unsatisfying. Up to this point in his career Burton was part of that small (miniscule?) group of American directors who had managed to deliver witty, scary, ironic, enjoyable films AND managed to get them distributed to your local McMultiplex. POTA sadly whiffs of compromise and poor editing ending up being confused and confusing.Go and see it (at the end of the day it IS fun) but don't let the phrase "hang on, why...?" appear in your mind at any point and don't be be tempted to wonder that if, in 30 years during which we've been able to shrink computers to a tenth of their size and digital watches have come and gone, monkey make-up still looks as ropey as it did when Roddy McDowell first started piling it on to spook Charlton Heston.</fullReview>

What I found was that the film was poorly written, and it lost all of the flavor of the original. All of the social commentary is gone, as well as all of the mystery. The plot has been replaced by some substitute filler, and the entire thing wreaked of recycled plastic. Although I did find some scenes laughable (most notably the ones that required acting) I would see it once just to know what I am talking about.

		<shortDescription>Weak second half of the film capped by nonsensical ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* WARNING - THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS *I haven't seen the original movie, so I watched this with a completely open mind, without any expectations (except for the fact that I expect Tim Burton films to be top notch!)... ...anyway, the movie starts off in great enough fashion with some nice special fx. Burton does well to convey the Wahlberg character's sense of desolation after crashing on the planet and an interesting subplot ensues, involving Helena Bonham Carter's ape character and the attempt to escape from their masters. Tim Roth is absolutely outstanding as the general - you won't see a more expressive pair of eyes! The love triangle element with Estella Warren's character (what a beauty!) is also fairly well handled.The film simmers along nicely for the first half and then completely degenerates towards the end. The first absurdity is when (*SPOILERS AHEAD*)Wahlberg's monkey jets in and stops the battle - the scene just looked silly, it did not look like it could turn the tide of the battle...then later the henchmen (sorry henchapes!) of the general capitulate too quickly without really being convinced.And the "twist" ending was just well...incomprehensible I thought...another writer here said he found it easy to understand because it was a take on the original film's ending....but for someone like me who hasn't seen the original, I just thought - huh? Was it meant to be a "what-if?" scenario, or was it a direct consequence of what had happened before? I couldn't get my head around it...maybe I'm thick...need to think about it a bit more, but I suspect that I still won't get it...Overall - a good first half to the movie....great performance from Roth and Wahlberg was good too...Burton got the visual style of the film spot on and the costumes and ape make up were just awesome and any special fx used looked good...unfortunately, plot holes and inconsistencies in the second half of the movie undid all the good work and effort put into the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen any of the original Planet of the Apes films so I can not compare the remake to any of them. However, I do know how the original Planet of the Apes film ends and I would say that it seems a much easier ending to understand. Don't worry, I won't give any spoilers for either film.The acting was very good, especially Tim Roth as Thade and Bonham Carter as Ari. I don't understand why others have complained about the poor acting. The special effects are also unbelievably brilliant in every department and a lot of effort was put into the little things like the behaviour and mannerisms of the apes.However, there are plotholes and the ending is very confusing. This doesn't mean it doesn't make sense as so many people have claimed. No offence to anyone but you should really make sure you understand the ending and it's relationship to the rest of the film before you judge it. I myself don't understand the ending 100% and am therefore making an effort to find out what it means.Some of the plotholes pointed out by others are minor and don't really make the film any less enjoyable. Then again, I don't fully understand what happens in the film so maybe the plotholes are significant. Anyone who claims to understand the end can feel free to explain it to me.Possibly the poorest area of the film was the action scenes. They just weren't exciting enough.All in all, although I didn't fully understand the ending, the film is entertaining and definitely worth seeing. I might change my mind if I ever see the film on video, seeing how the special effects and sound effects were breath taking, but I'm sure I won't ever consider this to be a dismal pointless movie. There's just too many clever ideas for that too happen and I can't stop thinking about the film now.My provisional rating: 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had anxiously anticipated the release of this movie since I first saw the trailer. It looked promising, exciting and fun. As I sat through this movie I was wondering..."Why am I sitting through this movie?" "Planet" leaves much to be desired. The only thing great about this movie are the visual effects. If you love effects, you won't be disappointed. I like effects but not in place of a good story line which this movie certainly lacked. I saw the original and was floored by the awesome story told. This version said nothing. It had no balance, no texture, no nothing but lots of awesome effects. I guess Hollywood thinks audiences today are too brainless to follow a plot that they feel they need to entertain us with an all you can see buffet instead of giving us some credit to THINK! I was disappointed to say the least. But the effects were great! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(BEWARE: SPOILERS ARE COMING UP PRETTY SOON - STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MOVIE YET!!!) First of all, what was up with all those apes smoking bongs? that was really messed up! it was so random and unnecessary! i thought it was hilarious, though! Not to mention Ape-raham Lincoln at the end! That was a priceless (and some would say tasteless) mockery of a beloved American president. plus, i never knew apes could jump through the air like the warriors in ;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&amp;lt and who ever heard of a man kissing an ape-human?! That was just wrong; very. very wrong.Anyways, This movie does have many holes in it's plot, and the acting at times is very sub-par, but the basic story and the surprise ending at the end are at the least thought-provoking. Yes, the first one has a great ending, but i am very glad that this one took an entirely different route with it's overall plot (although the basic "planet ruled by apes" premise is still there). reading the previous reviews, it is obvious that those who didn't like the movie obviously didn't fully understand the surprise ending. You see, Thade, the ape-villian, never died at the end. he just sat around in the spaceship after helplessly shooting his flare gun, and after mark wahlberg went off, he somehow found a way to work one of the spaceships. Just like how that one ape said, "Thade will stop at nothing to get you." So, thade flew up into space, inadvertently went into the space time warp area, and flew way back in time. There, he became Ape-raham Lincoln and emancipated (yes, kinda cheesy) his fellow apes from the shackles of...well, you get the point. Then he dies and becomes a hero representing freedom and liberty to all ape-kind. Kinda interesting to think about. It's so bizarre and strange that it made for a genuine surprise in this movie-goer, even despite the fact that i was expecting some sort of twist.that still doesn't justify apes getting faded on bong hits, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With it's excellent effects and direction this film was always going to be a big summer hit and unfortunately that has given them the excuse the forget about the plot. The film starts well enough dropping clues and introducing the main human. It flows along nicely with alot of references to the original film ('Take your hands off me you damned dirty human'). There is a humour and darkness to the film that can only be provided by Tim Burton as well as his trade mark scarecrows. But as with all good things, what was right about this film came to a crashing end and that comes at the end. The initial plot resolution seemed to be an afterthought and then the 'shock' ending was illogical and did not seem to tie in with events in the rest of the film. If anybody has any theories as to how the ending is possible please let me know as we haven't been able to work it out.So for effort, cast (especially Estella Warren), direction and initial plot I give this film 6 out of 10. But it would have been higher had the ending been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of the film - caution comments on Ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;Caution, possible spoiler comments here!&gt; I have just seen the movie and to be honest I do not know if I really liked it or not. There were some great aspects of the film, some of the characters had real depth, the acting and special effects were very good, and the general feeling of the Ape world was certainly believable. The problem for me was that firstly the initial plot twist was very obvious from the first minute of the film (expecting a twist, a space station with Apes and Humans above a strange world - an unusual space occurrence, straight from Startrek Next Generation?) and I'm still actively puzzled by the ending.&lt;Do not read onwards if you have not seen the film and wish to do so&gt; The end of the film, the hero locks general thade in a zoo with supreme irony, kisses the ape, kisses the girl and fly's back to earth (surprisingly quickly for a space exploration shuttle). He arrives to find that General Thade has beaten him to it, and that Apes evolved as the superior species to man on Earth. That's where I get confused, was it a parallel universe (star trek again?), in which case how did Thade get there? Was the Ape planet actually earth, and after 'Leo' leaves the planet he returns to find that millennia have passed and Thade had taken over and become the leader? Is it all a coincidence, why have the timelines changed on earth? how did Thade appear as Abraham Lincoln and just how did Apes invent fire engines and police cars etc when Charlton Heston himself (Thade's dying father) had told us that Apes lacked the creative genes necessary to do this?In conclusion, I think I liked the film, it is amusing, thrilling and intelligent. The ape effects are really good, and whilst some characters are nicely developed, there is a shallow element to some. The ending does have me mystified, but its possilbe that I missed the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot holes, yes. But, please, slavery not one of them!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes the movie has some pretty serious plot holes, all described in other reviews and won't be repeated here. I don't want to ridicule other reviewers, but to suggest that the apes would not enslave humans, or consider them savages because THEY CAN SPEAK ENGLISH and display intelligence is unbelievable baffling. The very point of the whole D*** movie is to point out how unfair and bigoted people (or apes) can be. Of course it's illogical, that is the point !!! Has no one heard of the basically continuous human history of enslavement of our fellows ???? Funnily enough there was ample evidence of intelligence and language there, even English, and yet slavery went on! All this real life enslavement with one hell of a lot less motivation (greed basically) than is provided the apes in this movie. Please if you are going to go on and on about plot holes at least stick to safer ground. Do the other plot holes really detract from the movie, decided for yourself. I thought the whole look and feel of the movie made up for the its other shortcomings, and that it was a worthy remake of a much loved classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With it's excellent effects and direction this film was always going to be a big summer hit and unfortunately that has given them the excuse the forget about the plot. The film starts well enough dropping clues and introducing the main human. It flows along nicely with alot of references to the original film ('Take your hands off me you damned dirty human'). There is a humour and darkness to the film that can only be provided by Tim Burton as well as his trade mark scarecrows. But as with all good things, what was right about this film came to a crashing end and that comes at the end. The initial plot resolution seemed to be an afterthought and then the 'shock' ending was illogical and did not seem to tie in with events in the rest of the film. If anybody has any theories as to how the ending is possible please let me know as we haven't been able to work it out.So for effort, cast (especially Estella Warren), direction and initial plot I give this film 6 out of 10. But it would have been higher had the ending been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of the film - caution comments on Ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;Caution, possible spoiler comments here!&gt; I have just seen the movie and to be honest I do not know if I really liked it or not. There were some great aspects of the film, some of the characters had real depth, the acting and special effects were very good, and the general feeling of the Ape world was certainly believable. The problem for me was that firstly the initial plot twist was very obvious from the first minute of the film (expecting a twist, a space station with Apes and Humans above a strange world - an unusual space occurrence, straight from Startrek Next Generation?) and I'm still actively puzzled by the ending.&lt;Do not read onwards if you have not seen the film and wish to do so&gt; The end of the film, the hero locks general thade in a zoo with supreme irony, kisses the ape, kisses the girl and fly's back to earth (surprisingly quickly for a space exploration shuttle). He arrives to find that General Thade has beaten him to it, and that Apes evolved as the superior species to man on Earth. That's where I get confused, was it a parallel universe (star trek again?), in which case how did Thade get there? Was the Ape planet actually earth, and after 'Leo' leaves the planet he returns to find that millennia have passed and Thade had taken over and become the leader? Is it all a coincidence, why have the timelines changed on earth? how did Thade appear as Abraham Lincoln and just how did Apes invent fire engines and police cars etc when Charlton Heston himself (Thade's dying father) had told us that Apes lacked the creative genes necessary to do this?In conclusion, I think I liked the film, it is amusing, thrilling and intelligent. The ape effects are really good, and whilst some characters are nicely developed, there is a shallow element to some. The ending does have me mystified, but its possilbe that I missed the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the original Planet Of The Apes and I think it's very good but this 'new updated version' is even better. Mark Wahlberg is brilliant as are the rest of the cast, including: Tim Roth, who plays a real baddie here, Helena Bonham Carter and Paul Giamatti and the little monkey who had a starring role here. The special effects and make-up are obviously amazing and *definitely* deserve an oscar nomination. The twist-ending was a little strange but it was really good and it looks as if they will make a sequel, which I'm more sure will be just as great. I give Planet Of The Apes a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rule the planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all those reviews and comments, I feel that I have to add mine.I'll start with the things I liked:The make-up is fantastic. The always-amazing Rick Baker did an incredible job here and created some truly realistic apes - I'll risk in saying that it's probably the best ape make-up ever made, and - as some people have already mentioned - a lot better than the make-up used in the original series. I especially liked the make-up for Thade (Tim Roth). My least favorite is the make-up for Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), which looks quite different from the rest; I guess Rick wanted her to look "half-human" (a similar approach was used for the wolves animatronics in the 1994 "Wolf"), but for me it was too distracting, as it looked too fake. Actually, she's the ONLY ape who looks fake.In addition to the make-up, costumes (Burton's regular Colleen Atwood) and sets, I realized that what makes the apes especially realistic is their movement and their use of space (jumping all the times, using trees and roots, etc.). This aspect is another credit point for Burton, who always put special attention to the behavior and movement of the characters (Lisa Marie as the Martian Girl in "Mars Attacks!" immediately comes to mind) and made the actors go to "ape school".Danny Elfman's score is always fantastic and this one is no exception. The use of primitive tools and jungle motives in the main titles is great. It starts quietly, as a simplified and primitive tune and builds up (as usual in Danny's themes) to a march piece of heavy metal instruments, "like bars closing in", as one review described it. While the theme reminded me past works such as "Men in Black" and "Dead Presidents", other cues reminded me of Danny's earlier works such as "Mars Attacks!", "Edward Scissorhands", "Batman Returns" and the "March of the Dead" from "Army of Darkness". Now that I listen to the soundtrack, the final part of the track titled "The Return", which ends the movie, seems to be highly influenced by the work of Bernard Herrmann (Danny's mentor).One thing that I liked about the plot *SPOILER ALERT* is the added explanation for the apes being "smart" - the genetic treatment, which is unfortunately ruined totally later on (I think. Depends on how you understand the ending). *END OF SPOILER*Two bits that made the movie entertaining for me were the parts of Limbo, the slave trader (played by the hilarious Paul Giamatti), and the two guest appearances by Glenn Shadix and Lisa Marie (as Senator Nado and Nova) - I wish they had a bigger part in the movie.And now to the things I didn't like:First of all - Estella Warren. From the very first moment she appears on screen, early in the movie, I felt her casting is wrong. Except for putting her as an attraction for the male audience (me amongst them), I saw no reason for using an amazing blonde model, dressed in small rags, for this part. It simply distracts you from the movie and damages its realism. I wanted to see Lisa Marie in this role, just so she could have a bigger part, but this one wouldn't solve the real drawback -Aside for the casting of Estella Warren, the role of Daena (and her entire family, for that matter) seems absolutely redundant - She has almost no interaction with the hero, and seems to exist only to fill the role of the traditional "blonde girl the hero kisses at the end" - not to mention that this kiss seems completely out of place, since they had no interaction before that. The same, though on a smaller scale, goes for the rest of her family, which seems to be "dragging" along with the hero for no apparent reason.I think the biggest drawback of the movie has to be its script. There are lots of things to say about it, and I'm not sure where to start. Here are several points: The script (especially the last quarter) seems like a big mishmash of bits from the movies in the earlier series; The script has no "social meaning" at all - the writers seem to have taken an everyday-life cruel behavior towards animals (and a politically-correct objector) and reverse the roles, without debating any valuable issue; None of the characters seemed to have depth and we get no reason for Ari being so fond of the ugly humans; *MAJOR SPOILERS ALERT* The fact that the apes and humans, who live as primitives without any technology and don't know what a gun is, are not a bit surprised by digital gadgets, spaceships and "a weapon that blow-up everyone", in addition to the fact that is made by primitive humans who can't invent anything; The ending that didn't make much sense to me, other than trying to give a shock and a surprise that would be different from the one in the original movie - one which you simply can not top; This in addition to the disappointment in revealing (a minute earlier) that the "planet of the apes" is indeed a strange planet and not Earth (which, as I mentioned earlier, destroys the rather good logic that was built up to this point). For a moment I thought the writers were trying to play a trick on us: because we were expecting to hear that the humans destroyed Earth, we instead see that apes have overtaken Earth - so perhaps they are the ones to destroy it? But then, the earlier planet is not Earth?; There also seem to be some plot-holes concerning the time traveling, both of the money and the spaceship itself; I also found it highly unbelievably, after the money came down from the skies, that all of the apes, who up until then considered humans to be filthy and primitive, decide in an instant that humans and apes are equal - the only reason for that seemed to be that the writers needed to get to the end of the movie. *END OF SPOILERS*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LET'S GET A FEW THINGS STRAIGHT - SPOILERS AHEAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original planet of the apes movie (and arguably three of the four sequels) were much loved by folk around the world - and quite rightly so. As Hollywood is always on the look out for a safe film based on an old movie/TV show that was much loved (when are they gunna remake Land Of The Giants?) and that is guaranteed to be a hit, it's a wonder it took this long to do a POTA re-make. Bearing in mind the sort of churlish, mind numbing, spirit crushing gruel that Hollywood has become so good at delivering the citizens of the world, POTA (2001) was not all bad.SPOILER AHEAD In a plot sense, there were holes all over the place.1. The Oberon only seemed to have humans and chimps - so where the devil did all the gorillas and orang-otans come from?2. In the year 2029, can it really be easier to train a Chimp to control a pod than automate it some how? I betcha HAL could've controlled it remotely, and that's using late 20th Century technology.3. Why did Attar turn on Thade at the end? He said Thade lied to him, but about what? Also, we are expected to belive that Attar will gruesomely kill his old master, and then suddenly start sprouting Gandhi like dogma about apes and humans living together in harmony. I THINK NOT. General Urko would not have dropped his bundle like this.4. Where did the gorillas develop this fear of water from - current day gorillas are prepared to wade through water.The ending is like something out of a 50's masterpiece. However, a 50's masterpiece would leave the ending alone. I'll be surprised if we don't see a new Planet Of The Apes franchise developing. The sequel will explain how the apes took over earth. It should not be explained, any more than the ending of any Twilight Zone story need to be explained.POTA 2001 is worth a look - you may even enjoy it 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consistency please...and a different ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where should I start? The hype for this movie came out months before its release and generated a lot of interest, including mine. Mind you I've never really seen the original movie, at least not all of it. But from the promos and interviews, this was Tim Burton's version of the movie, which was basically a bit more up-to-date, realistic, and cutting edge. But I couldn't help but wonder what or who would allow the ending they chose to be shown. Let me warn you that there may be spoilers in this review.The basic premise to this movie revolves around a scientist (Mark Wahlberg) getting stranded on a planet years into the future. The situation arises because of a strange anomaly they encounter in space and at the time, humans were using chimps as test pilots to send into unknown or high-risk situations. Their test pilot was sent in to examine the anomaly (which was to do nothing more than to do a fly-by) and suddenly vanished. Wahlberg's character, being the softhearted scientist, against wishes flew in to rescue the test pilot and himself disappears only to reappear hundreds of years into the future to crash land on a strange planet. He discovers very quickly that humans are not the dominant species on this planet but apes are and he is quickly rounded up to be a slave. His only driving goal from that moment on is to escape and somehow get back to his crewmates.To be honest, the storyline isn't very strong, nor is it overly intelligent. The audience is given a very basic premise and is told to go along with it. However, if it weren't for the ending, I think a lot of people wouldn't have minded. There are little things throughout the movie that make you wonder how it's possible that something could happen. One of the major ones is that in the future on this strange planet, apes have evolved into intelligent speech cable creatures. But they allegedly came from the science station that Wahlberg's character came from as a result of them coming to search for him and crash landing on this planet. However, the science station was using chimps as their test pilots so where did all these apes come from?? As well, there are humans on this planet, which the movie at one point indicates that the entire crew of the science station was killed by the chimps when they turned on them. Where did all these humans come from?and the horses?? Yes there are horses! It seems for the sake of making this movie they made a lot of assumptions and conveniences but the audience is not that dumb. They will pick it out and they will remember when the sequel comes out. There's no doubt about the sequel. The ending was left in such a way that a sequel would be created. Was there anything I liked about this movie? Well they did remain accurate on ape movements and that element created a sense of fear and menace that the apes in the original movie didn't quite have. The make-up and special effects were pretty good but then Tim Burton has always been good at those areas. Overall I wasn't overly impressed. The movie was acceptable up until the ending and after what I saw for an ending, it kind of ruined everything prior to that. It sounds like I'm being harsh but if you don't believe me, go ahead and see this movie. Just don't write back to me complaining about it because I warned you. On a scale of 1 ? 10, I give it a 5. I thought it could have been much better. Not enough time spent on developing a reasonable and logical plot line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!!! (SPOILERS AHEAD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it and thought that it was awesome, baby! (A little Austin Powers lingo there). I know many of you didn't like or understand the ending, but I think I do. Now I don't know if this is what Burton had intended, but here's MY take on things. (Again, if you haven't seen it yet, STOP READING!)The astronauts at the beginning are investigating this anomaly in space and decide to send the first monkey into it for a closer look. Wahlberg goes after the chimp into the time warp, and also disappears. Obviously, the whole crew follows them in an attempted rescue. But then, towards the middle, the crew turns out to have arrived on the planet BEFORE Wahlberg. Leo arrives after they do (some 3000 years later), and the chimp arrives after Leo. This is the exact REVERSE order they went into the time warp. (Still, this does not explain the horses, so I guess that does go as a goof!)Later, when Thade is trapped in the spaceship and is not killed off, I saw EXACTLY what Burton was going to do! I thought he was going to show us that in the second movie, but he teased us with it in THIS movie: Thade somehow escapes the ship, gets his band of Apes together, comes back to the ship, and escapes in it with his apes to Earth, probably in a period post American Civil War (after Lincoln). They fight the world, take it over, deface the Lincoln memorial, and put General Thade's face on it. Many years later, Mark arrives back on Earth, and finds that Apes rule! Again, note that Leo leaves the planet before Thade, but arrives on Earth AFTER Thade, the exact same thing that happened before. This is the only logical and obvious explanation of what happened. Anything else would make for a bad sequel. (Hope I haven't given away the sequel :))</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected the new 2001 Planet Of The Apes movie to be a high-tech blast of chills, thrills, and spills. It had none of that, I was not chilled or spilled. But I was thrilled at the end! That was pretty cool. But I won't tell ya anything about the ending so don't worry. Of course, the ending was nothing compared to the original- (and if you haven't seen the original I won't give that ending away, either.) Some scenes were quite ridiculous, though. And the storyline was not as good as the original. Although at least Tim Burton had his own special storyline instead of copying the original's. Overall, it wasn't a bad movie. If you like movies without blood and a lot of swearing, and you are not totally opposed to science fiction, I think you won't be disappointed, but won't be exactly thrilled either.Not Too Shabby!-madmax-1</fullReview>

Suffice it to say, I walked in with the "lowered expectations are best met outlook".My god, what a waste of time and money this was. Once in a long while my judgment lapses famously, Apes is the winner this time around. Never mind being true to the theme of the original, suspension of disbelief and such - this movie has no redeeming qualities that I can cite; casting and acting were poor, the story was bad beyond belief, and the visuals &amp; effects were weak to laughable. I have enjoyed some of Burtons past flicks, but this effort seriously calls his talent into question.Save yourselves...</fullReview>

Even though I walked into the theatre slightly sceptical of "talking apes", I walked out completely satisfied. Definately a movie that will leave you thinking even long after it's over. If your sick of all the teeny bopper movies, and ready to see an unforgetable tale of human kind being turned upside down, I recommend this movie to you!</fullReview>

The ape make upp was way more realistic than the first films. But one thing kept bugging me. The ape voices! In the original they all had perfect voices for the apes but in this one its a little bit off. Maybe I just watched the old ones to much, But still. The ape society was more advanced this time around (not in electricity and such but when you watch the movie you'll know what I mean.) The story is very similiar to Battlefield Earth now that I think about it. Very. But it is still an awesome must see action movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that I've only seen the original for the first time this month (though I'd seen a making-of-the-series show and thus was aware of the basics), and I acknowledge that this new version is only supposed to be inspired BY the original -- not a faithful adaptation. Therefore I was prepared to accept the new movie on its own merits.Even so, I walked out of the theater scratching my head and wondering why they'd bothered doing it at all.Yes, I love Tim Burton. Yes, the costumes, make-up, and sets are amazing. Yes, it was fun, had some good lines, and featured some marvelous acting on the part of Helena Bonham Carter, who was remarkably believable in her chimpanzee-inspired mannerisms and movements.Other than that...so what?Without spoiling too much of either movie, I have to say that the message of the original was far more intelligent. It really made you stop and think: who's right, who's wrong, do we have any right to judge the apes or should we learn lessons about our own failings in theirs? This one was merely simplistic summer-movie fare, with a predictable plotline I was correctly forecasting as little as five minutes into the movie.(Yes, and I easily guessed the "surprise twist ending" everyone is raving about. Yawn. You want a REAL surprise twist ending, go watch "Sixth Sense" or "Unbreakable.")Last but not least, I find it interesting that Heston's character was likeable precisely because he WAS such a crusty cynical old b*****d. Wahlberg's "brash hotshot pilot" persona conforms to almost every "hero" stereotype in the book...and, thus, is entirely bland and uninteresting, though I do not knock him as an actor. I DO give the writer(s) full credit for not going the obvious route with the annoyingly "perfect leggy blonde" potential love interest, but other than that...well, not much I can say.In short: rent the original and pretend you don't know the ending. You'll get your money's worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this over the weekend. It's bad. Not bad meaning good either, OK? Mark Wahlberg is expected to be the hero, but he can't keep this dog alive. Nice costuming, effects are OK (but what's up with that upside-down fishbowl Wahlberg puts on his head when he takes off in the pod?).The dialog is pathetic. Estella Warren has what, 8 lines through the whole thing? The comic relief was lame. The best (unintentional) comic relief was when the commander tells Wahlberg, "No more arguments, your monkey launches at 16:30!." There was inappropriate laughter at other dialogue as well.Just overall quite lame, you can wait for it to come on HBO or Cinemax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie and I was completely blown away! I love the first films and when i heard they where making a re-make I was happy. Not that the original needed one but it was nice to see yet another "ape" adventure! This one has more action than the original, The casting was good and the score was amazing! The ape make upp was way more realistic than the first films. But one thing kept bugging me. The ape voices! In the original they all had perfect voices for the apes but in this one its a little bit off. Maybe I just watched the old ones to much, But still. The ape society was more advanced this time around (not in electricity and such but when you watch the movie you'll know what I mean.) The story is very similiar to Battlefield Earth now that I think about it. Very. But it is still an awesome must see action movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!! Hi Folks! Please excuse my poor English - I'm just a bloody German... But to those of you who found the ending gag of PLANETS 2001 quite unlogical: consider THIS! The film starts (and Whalberg leaves Oderon station) in the year 2029 (it is written when Oderon station is shown for the first time) and Whalberg returns through the wormhole in 2165(!!!!) - this year is shown on his display for a very short moment when he passes the hole. So, if you take in consideration, that even without Oderon station, mankind has made experiments with apes to make them more intelligent to be a help us, apes whould have had a plenty of time to take over earth...! and the Lincoln memorial??? - eehh, well, may be there was a war between mankind and apekind with an ape leader looking quite familiar... and the apes won. hey, this is a sci-fi-film - I've seen worse! It's not THAT unlogical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES * * Unnecessary remake brings nothing new to the table in terms of imagination or inspiration. Performances by Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth and many of the others playing apes are the only redeeming features. Everything money can buy, expensive sets, makeup, costumes and actors, can't make up for an incoherent and illogical script. Finally, if the average movie goer has to research the internet to try to understand the final scene, then the moviemakers haven't done their job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen it yet...DONT READ THIS!ok..now i can start.The movie is a great action adventure. The story is good..how evolution might do to apes that crashlands on a planet in another solar system. It was a cool movie...but then it happened. The ending...extremely stupid and not thought through by the makers. How could he return to earth..going back in time to his own time. How can earth then be ruled by Apes?And we do know that the ape planet was another planet, not earth. Cause of the 2 moons, and that the crashed spaceships computers logg says so. We know that the general ape, Thade wanted to kill every human on that planet. And maybe it was so he did when our hero goes back in time again, back to earth. But why was it a statue of Thade on earth saying he killed every human. Why was apes ruling earth, cause we know it was eart he came back to cause of his own spaceships computer, and we saw him traveling back.So people you see...the ending destroyed the whole story of the movie..it was just stupid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Planet has been Ruled!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many emotions struck me while watching one of the summer's most anticipated films ?Planet of the Apes'. Yet, the emotion that struck me the most was that of ingenuity. Director Tim Burton proves himself as an ingenious filmmaker and he proves it twofold in this exciting, inventive and thrilling film. The sets are spectacular, costumes are terrific and Danny Elfman's musical score captures the essence of the film as he does with all his musical compositions for Burton's films. The producers of the film have stressed that this is not a remake, but more so a ?revisiting' of the original. Anyone who compares this film to the original is gravely mistaken due to the mere fact that the 2001 version has been dichotomized by one of the ?soon to be' legendary alternative filmmakers - Tim Burton. This film widely separates itself from the original as seen from its' first frame and takes off on a whole new different direction. The film opens with a great credit intro. sequence displaying Danny Elfman's fierce musical score which sets the film's tone not as an unrealistic fantasy, but as a rousing sci-fi/adventure. The opening scene depicts Wahlberg's ill-fated space station attempt at conducting test runs with the ape species. After a mishap forces him off the ship, Wahlberg's character Leo Davidson finds himself crash landing on a distant planet ruled by apes. This is where the fun begins? Director Tim Burton puts a classic spin in this film invoking the notion of role reversal. In this planet, humans are the pets, the slaves, in essence humans on that planet are all the things we as humans on this planet earth shape and torture our inferiors to be. A great scene is one of the very first that immediately displays the intelligence of these iron fist creatures conversing around the dinner table about the threat of the human species. Enter this year's ultimate movie villain ? General Thade. The incredibly underestimated and unrecognizable Tim Roth plays this overachieving ape villain who is hell-bent on the total annihilation of all humans with fierce audacity and destruction. Upon the dissection of this film as a cinematic lesson, one will discover many ?plot holes' - (Did Leo Davidson and Ari, his rebellious ape escort have a love affair?) Many more plot holes - (Did Leo Davidson and Estella Warren's human rebel Daena also have an affair?). Mysterious deaths not explained - (Why exactly did one character so unexpectedly sacrifice himself for the sake of others and the rest of pack continue on as if nothing happened?) These mind-benders as well as others will occupy the intelligent filmgoer's mind for quite some time after the film.Yet, these questions can all be put to rest because Burton does not set out to win awards with this film (Except for Best Make-Up come Oscar time for Rick Baker). This film is merely a means of the best of the ?popcorn blockbusters' this summer. As well, we see Burton's maturity as a Director in relation to the grandeur of a film. Let's face it ? the revisiting of the classic apes' films is a huge undertaking. And for Tim Burton to create and present a richly satisfying, fun film is quite the achievement. Anyone who expects a brash film course should not watch this film. This film wants the audience to have fun and to dwell into a world never seen before in this uniqueness. Therefore in this sense, the film scores some big points in terms of imagination and vision. The film makes it a point of paying ?homage' to the originals yet distancing it enough so it is not afraid to make fun of itself. Furthermore, despite its surreal qualities, fantastic set pieces and incredibly true to life ape creatures brought to life by a wonderful cast, the film's major drawback is that it seems too dark and animalistic for its' own good. We are all aware that Burton's visionary uniqueness is brought forward with dark sets and spooky visions. Yet, it seems as if Burton intentionally wants us to know this is his creation even when we are entangled within the film, resulting in the darkness and primal aesthetic being overused. But in an odd way this is what adds to the genius and excellence of it all. Resulting in this film easily regarded as one of Burton's best films.Giancarlo's Rating: ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes can sometimes be as good as the original from what I hear, but in this case, its just wrong! The movie wasn't a snoozefest because of the action (well most of the time its inaction) sequences, the comic wit of Paul Giamatta was well placed, and the little inside jokes made it a good enough work to make me wish there was more. Tim could have done so much more with this picture, but for some reason chose not to. At best, Marky Mark was a wooden actor. Total textbook anti-hero. The plot holes were big enough to drive a Mack truck through (If humans outnumber apes 4 to one, why were they winning? The ENDING? How a few hundred ape warriors get blasted by an afterburner rocket and none wind up to be extra tasty crispy? How all of a sudden Pericles KNOWS where the ship is and comes "just in time"?)The saving graces of this movie were superb performances by Tim Roth (general thade), Michael Clarke Duncan (general Attar), and Paul Giamatti (Limbo). I wish I was the guy who owned the local hydraulic catapult supply house for Hollyweird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some say, and not as good as others say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Yes, here's another person so full of their own opinions that he feels compelled to post them on the internet. Here's my $0.02:First off, I agree with Leonard Maltin that POTA 1968 is a near-classic. However, people who espouse the movie's cultural importance are exaggerating to a certain extent. Let's "talk turkey" for a moment. The chief concern with POTA 1968 was to produce a well-scripted, entertaining family movie. Concern #2 was that the Ape prosthetics were believable and not something the audience would laugh at. Here's a little bit of trivia: As revealed in Arthur C. Clarke's "The Lost Worlds of 2001," Stanley Kubric and he were furious that POTA beat out 2001:A Space Odyssey for a special make-up effects Oscar. Go figure.The political commentary was tertiary. It was craftily woven into the script but was not the key purpose of the movie. Indeed it was so well written some viewers didn't even realize they were watching a work containing political metaphors and social critique. In fact 20th Century Fox studio exec. Richard Zanuck himself didn't even see those aspects of the movie, or to this day refuses to admit they exist. It is of some note that he produced POTA 2001.Modern day viewers who criticize POTA 1968 (or even go so far as to say the 2001 version in better) should keep in mind that we watch a movie with eyes affected by the era that surrounds us. The perceptions of a person who watched this movie when it first came out (or during a re-release sometime in the 70's as I did) will not be the same as someone who watches it for the first time today. I can only imagine what disparaging comments viewers in thirty years are going to say about the vapid quality of Hollywood excreta nowadays.Now let's look at POTA 2001 piece-by-piece: Script: I had a bad feeling when I saw three screenwriters, three executive producers plus a full producer!!! Whoah! This is just way too many hands dipping their opinions into the cake mix. It's no surprise that the story often screeches to a halt or leaves viewers scratching their heads in confusion. I won't go into the plot contrivances and holes except to say that Tim Burton should have asked for at least five more drafts.Make-up: Who needs to say anything more about this? One of the best parts of the movie. Previous user comments say all the chimpanzee women look like LaToya Jackson. Don't you think this is just the teensiest bit racist? I guess I'm the only one who thinks Ari (and Helena Bonham Carter for that matter) is pretty.Sets: Burton only directed this, folks. He didn't write, produce or design sets. However, it still comes off feeling like a peek into Burton's mind: dark, grim and definitely moody. The set direction is somewhat claustrophobic. Though this may be purposeful, it doesn't quite match the expansiveness conveyed by the long shots of the city.Acting: There's a reason so many of us love Tim Roth. I agree that his Thade will go down in the annals of cinematic villains. Are some of his lines incomprehensible because of the way he speaks? Yes, but Tim Roth sometimes mumbles and grumbles with any of his roles. So what? At least he's not Estella Warren. Guys think this woman is beautiful? Yuck. That's beside the fact that she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Why did they decide to have the humans talk anyway? Nothing was added to the story by their dialogue. Then again, almost none of the dialogue adds anything to the story, so what the hell. Carter is okay as Ari, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa gets a decent role, David Warner is still alive and kicking, Mark Wahlberg is cardboard and emotionless (though this may be on purpose to reflect most modern day men) and the cameo by Chuck Heston is simply priceless.The ending: The next part is a bit spoily, so proceed at your own caution. As far as the ending is concerned, this is going to be disparaged and debated amongst pro and anti groups for some time. First off, before you put down a movie, try reading the book (for those that don't know - that's what you do with books; hold them in your hand and read them.) As stated in another user comment, the Boulle novel took place on a world other than Earth. When the astronaut returns to Earth we get a similar situation as in POTA 2001. But how could this coexist with the explanation of the ape origins in the 2001 movie? Simple, as explained in another user comment, with Thade recovering Davidson's pod, repairing it, and learning how to use it. In fact if a person thinks about what's going on instead of just letting their mushlike brains stagnate, this adds new irony to the end wherein Thade does to Davidson's world what Davidson did to Thade's. On the other hand, much of the rest of the movie cultivates our brains into mush so it's not surprising the end did nothing but confuse most viewers.Yes, this theory is hard to believe. But the entire premise of the third Apes movie, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, is based on Cornelius, Zira and a worthless throwaway character finding Taylor's ship, lifting it out of hundreds of feet of water, learning how to use it, finding fuel for it, and somehow managing to travel back in time with it. And all this is back story; it is never explained. At least Thade knows exactly where Davidson's pod is. And we're talking about a pod, not some multi-thousand ton craft. It's sitting no more than thirty feet below the surface of a tiny pond. Also, Thade has a tutor: the Ape Davidson left behind. However, it's a stretch even for someone who suspends his disbelief as easily as I that a little pod has 1) The power to achieve the velocity to break free of the planet's gravity well as well as 2) Fuel capacity to travel from Saturn to Earth.All this being said, I enjoyed this movie. Why? Because it was fun. Tim Roth was Damn scary. Wahlberg was convincing as a bland, everyday "stranger in a strange land." Much, though not all, of the supporting cast makes the world come alive to a certain extent. There's just enough of a story and hints of character development to pique interest, though granted not enough to last the entire movie. There are a lot of little things that are likeable, such as the tongue-in-cheek references to the 1968 POTA with the lines, "Get your stinking hands off me you damn dirty human!" and "Damn them all to Hell!" There's the reference to V'Ger (Star Trek: The Motion Picture) and Zardoz (Zardoz) with the name of the forbidden "Calima." POTA 2001 has it's flaws, but what doesn't these days? If you don't want to risk 8-9 bucks, go see a matinee.To the people who say "This isn't science-fiction": Let me put it this way: If I film myself lighting a match, that's science. If I film myself lighting a match in a cro-magnon setting, that's science fiction. Don't be a sci-fi snob.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am the first to say, its only a movie don't try and analyze it like a Shakespeare play. But with the blatant holes in the script, I walked out of the movie shaking my head. How could a director of Tim Burton's character make this version of Planet of the Apes with a script that made Lost in Space (TV Series) look good.I could probably ignored some lapses of common sense in a movie but when the whole premise of the story has so many gaping chasms you cannot ignore them. The effects were good, but I would wait until they had a movie double with Battlefield Earth. That way you can feel really ripped off.Spoilers don't read on unless you really want to see this movie. When you see a movie the last thing I hate thinking is how silly, why did the hero do that. Example, After he escapes the ape city then he gets his survival kit from his ship rather than when he crashed. The Holes - If they descended from the original space station and the only animals they had on board were chimpanzees. Where did the horses, gorilla's, orangutans &amp; parrots come from? The worm hole? It was so convenient. I can imagine the scriptwriter, William Broyles saying to himself, "gee I have painted myself into a corner here, I'll just use the worm hole, nobody knows how they work". And worse of all he did a couple of times. Very weak writing, with no understanding of plausible continuity.Finally I could see why they were training chimps to fly the Pods (That incidentally can reach speeds 6 times that of light. (Saturn to Earth in under 30 seconds). Because lets faced it, at least the chimp could land the thing; Wahlenberg had two goes and crashed both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent entertainment, although not Burton's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, this new adaptation of Pierre Boule's classic novel Planet of The Apes isn't a wonderful exploration of human behavior or something like that, but that is not it's target. Instead it tries to be an incredibly entertaining summer movie, while still being intelligent and retaining Burton's gorgeous visual style. And with that in mind, it fully accomplishes its goals. First of all, the soundtrack, made by long-time Burton collaborator Danny Elfman is up to the composer's high standards. The brutal percussion-based sounds of his score fit the movie perfectly. The story is very satisfying and the ending is excellent. Touches of clever humor add to the script. But, of course, what steals the show is Burton's gift for creating memorable images and his army of apes, led by General Thade, a memorable character played to perfection by Tim Roth. For this movie, Burton often leaves his trademark dark and blue colors, but the movie still has his wonderful touch. As for the apes, they are very impressive. The cast is good, without having very hard jobs to do, but as I said earlier, Roth shines. So, this may not be Tim Burton's best movie, but it is the perfect summer entertainment, offered to you by one of history's greatest directors.85%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a bummer! As I am a fan of the original, 1968, movie, I was excited when I heard they were doing a re-telling. I thought that with today's effects technology, and a story idea as compelling as Planet of the Apes, I thought there was no way this could fail. But boy was I wrong. There is utterly no character development aside from pointing out to us who are the villains and who are the heroes. There was no motivation for General Thade's (Tim Roth) hatred or Ari's (Helena Bonham Carter) great compassion. To call the plot shallow would be to imply that there was any substance at all. And all the inside jokes concerning the original series got old, too. However, nice touch having Charlton Heston appear in a cameo as General Thade's dying father. Mark Wahlberg, who has consistently turned in very good performances in films like "The Perfect Storm" and "Fear," falls flat with a one-note character stolen from the pages of a comic book.Sure, the effects were great and the costumes were superb, but no matter how much make-up they pancaked onto my grandfather at his funeral, he was still lifeless, as was this film. All in all, a disappointment; no drama, no suspense, no depth of plot. Just another forgettable action film. My rating: D.</fullReview>

I'd rather watch the Battle for the Planet of the Apes (the weakest of the series) on a 24 hour loop then ever see this again. At least Aldo would make me smile with his terrible acting because his was probably only paid in peanuts (no pun intended) due to budget restraints. Not paid a fortune like Marky Mark to be the Hero in this movie. He can only muster himself up to sounding like Dirk Diggler in the documentries from Boogie Nights, only there is no fake apendage to help him out this time.........I must stop now or I will explode....ahhhhh!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a formidable Burton-fan, his remake of the 1968 classic, THE PLANET OF THE APES, was an affair I'd looked forward to for quite a long time. But, after having seen the film, I regret to say that my emotions are mixed at best. First off, THE PLANET OF THE APES, doesn't have the feel of a Tim Burton film. The one thing I love the most about his films, are the characters in them. You really get to care for a Burton character. But the only character in this film that might resemble a previous Burton character, such as Edward Scissorhands or Jack Skellington, is Ari. She's the typical outcast in her society, set aside by her revolutionary ideas that humans should be treated equally as monkeys (sorry, apes?), but other than her there really aren't any other characters in this film that can evoke care and emotions. The film doesn't visually have the Burton-esque style to it, either. There are occasional shots where some of that Burton magic shines through, like when we see the ape-city at a distance (it looks bewitched), but for the most part the visual style of the film is typical Hollywood extravagance. It would actually seem fair to compare this film with BATMAN. Both films are financially huge projects, where the producers seems to have put a lid on Burton's imagination, perhaps in fair of loosing the bigger audience. ?Tis a shame? Also, the film doesn't feel grand. I, personally, was expecting a huge film. After seeing the intense trailers, I though THE PLANET OF THE APES would be a film that could give us a taste of what's to come, with LORD OF THE RINGS looming in the distance, speaking in terms of huge CGI made battles and such, but alas? There's only one such scene, and it's over in a flash.There are also several things that bothered me in the script. First off, the beginning, which was too short too explain why a pilot would risk his life going after an ape lost in an electromagnetic storm. More time should have been spent, or been spent more efficiently, on this bit. There was also stuff in the characters development, which didn't fit. *SPOILERS* There's a scene in the film where Ari sneaks back into the camp of the vicious Thades, to conduct some sort of peace meeting, where she ends up being branded by Thades with the mark of humans. The film doesn't explain why Ari would attempt such an act in the first place, or why Thades would just let Ari and Sandar, who accompany her, leave afterwards, and the scene isn't followed up later in the film. It's only there to give Thades a chance to mark Ari. The writers should have thought of another way for this to happen. Also, towards the end of the film, we see Colonel Attar suddenly betray his patron, Thades, after, for the most part, being a pretty grim ape himself. It didn't seem like a logical course of action for this character. They should have sown the seeds for such an act earlier in the film. I also thought the filmmakers dispatched Sandar too easily. He was the former superior of Thades, but cast into shame when Thades betrayed him, and in the battle scene, where he's supposed to fight his previous protégé, he's intervened by Colonel Attar and defeated in a minute or so. I would have thought such a character, as Sandar, would have deserved a better exit.The ending, high above all things, must be discussed. Naturally, there was a huge amount of pressure on the filmmakers to come up with an ending that would match the original 68-ending, and take it's audience by surprise. It seems to me, that in their desperation to concur such an ending, they exit the film with more questions than answers. *HUGE SPOILER* I see only two possible answers to the end: (a) Everything took place on earth all along, and Captain Leo Davidson has only been traveling back and forth in time, as in the original film, or that (b) we are talking about two different planets. If it's the first, (a), then Captain Leo Davidson should have been able to figure all this out, by calculating coordinates and such, but if it's the second, (b), then how in the nine hells did Thades make his way to earth? Puzzling.Tim Roth, who stars as Thades, makes it clear that he's one of the meanest villains out there. Mark Wahlberg is a fine enough actor, who's done better before, that pulls of the part of Captain Leo Davidson quit nice, not being especially heroic, but not too much of an anti-hero either. Helena Bonham-Carter, as Ari, is, next to Tim Roth, the best actor on the cast. Putting Michael Clarke Duncan behind the make-up of Colonel Attar was also a good move on Burton's behalf. First off, because he's big enough to fit the role, and second, because his melancholic eyes are perhaps the only thing that lends credibility to the fact that he chooses to disobey his patron, Thades. Paul Giamatti was superb, creating comical relief with Limbo, the slave trader. Estella Warren, in her skimpy Xena outfit, was incognito at best. So, all in all, as I arrive upon my conclusion, it must be said that THE PLANET OF THE APES is a pretty entertaining film, if nothing else. The film is clearly less political than it's predecessor. It seems to have no ambitions. It only wants to entertain. And so it does, many thanks to a good cast, great make-up, enough funny scenes, and, last but not least, an excellent villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poor excuse for a movie. Tim Burton needs to take about 5 years off and go reorganize himself. This movie had no soul, no cohesion, and a really insipid script with all kinds of inconsistencies and errors. It is a shame to see a big budget movie like this when there are so many really talented directors and script writers just struggling. Hollywood continues to prostitute itself and Tim Burton has now joined the ranks of the brothel-panderers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original film was outstanding. Thirty years ago, the plot of apes taking over the earth was shocking and very creative in its concept. Now, over the years, we've seen just about every kind of creature appear on the earth. The main character here didn't have the eloquence of Charlton Heston. The end of the film was confusing since he returns back in time to earth, but finds that it was being run by apes. Also, the script deviated from the original one. Aside from the rather slow, confusing plot, the make-up for the apes was outstanding. The scenery was bare, twisted, dark and sinister. The actors who played the apes walked bent or ran on all fours. I think it was good for the action scenes which were not overly violent or bloody. It would be a good family film for children over 10 years of age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******************************************************** ****** SPOILER ALERT *********************************** ****** I will talk about the ending ******************** ********************************************************I saw this movie the first weekend it was out and thought the movie was entirely predictable but I can enjoy movies where you already know the plot line and the ending. There were no surprises I knew what was going to happen next. Like James Bond movies you know Bond is going to get the girl and save the day. I liked this picture better than the original not because of the story line but because of the sets, acting, and costumes. The characters behaved in a more realistic manner other than the first one which just humans dressing up in ape suits.The ending was a disappointment to me. When I first heard they were going to do the Planet of the Apes again, I thought to myself "here we go again the movie will end with human hero of the picture in front of a monument with Earth being conjured by the Apes". This is what I expected from the beginning, when I walked in the movie theatre, all the way through the picture, and at the end when the space craft landed. I heard that the movie wasn't going to be a remake, the picture took place on another planet and the ending was going to be shocking. I was personally waiting, hoping and praying for a different ending to the picture that would be surprising and shocking. So much for that idea. Hollywood came through again with the same old same old. I guess there was no other way that Hollywood could end the picture, but it was incredibly predictable. What a disappointment but I enjoyed the movie up until the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a bummer! As I am a fan of the original, 1968, movie, I was excited when I heard they were doing a re-telling. I thought that with today's effects technology, and a story idea as compelling as Planet of the Apes, I thought there was no way this could fail. But boy was I wrong. There is utterly no character development aside from pointing out to us who are the villains and who are the heroes. There was no motivation for General Thade's (Tim Roth) hatred or Ari's (Helena Bonham Carter) great compassion. To call the plot shallow would be to imply that there was any substance at all. And all the inside jokes concerning the original series got old, too. However, nice touch having Charlton Heston appear in a cameo as General Thade's dying father. Mark Wahlberg, who has consistently turned in very good performances in films like "The Perfect Storm" and "Fear," falls flat with a one-note character stolen from the pages of a comic book.Sure, the effects were great and the costumes were superb, but no matter how much make-up they pancaked onto my grandfather at his funeral, he was still lifeless, as was this film. All in all, a disappointment; no drama, no suspense, no depth of plot. Just another forgettable action film. My rating: D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Be warned, there are minor spoiler warnings here. You might not want to read farther if you don't want to know anything about the movie.I left this movie wondering at what point the creators thought this was a GOOD movie.It's difficult to review this version of PLANET OF THE APES without comparing it to the original. Visually, it's stunning, but the story holds together about as well as sand castles in high tide. True, the remake does a better job of having actors, you should pardon the expression, ape the movements of simians, but little else of this movie is an improvement over the original.The movie doesn't really create an ape society so much as it takes aspects of present human society and has apes do them for satiric purposes. Not only does this joke grow old very quickly, it's frustrating to watch the movie squander the opportunity to produce real satire or explore more deeply the aspects and workings of this ape society. That could have been interesting. Unfortunately, the movie moves quickly to the action sequences so doesn't spend enough time in Ape City to do much more than give satire or social commentary lip service.Still, the movie wasn't bad up to a point, but you hit that point -- the final reel and the ending -- with all the grace and abruptness of a crash test dummy.About that end: without revealing what the end is in the remake, said end pales when compared to the end of the original. The famous surprise ending of the original was set up in that movie. It made sense within the context of the movie, because Taylor's speech at the beginning of the movie, when he's recording his log entry, lets us know that conditions exist which make the surprise at the end possible. The ending of this remake is not set up. It comes from nowhere. (Yes, I know where the ending REALLY came from, but, again, in the context of that source material, its ending made sense. In this movie, the end has no context and no set up.) The remake's end simply made no sense. Nor did the several plot contrivances or the unexplained personality-altering epiphanies of main characters which all occur within the final ten minutes. No sense other than that they were necessary to end the movie. It was as if writers William Broyles Jr., Lawrence Konner, and Mark Rosenthal and director Tim Burton realized, we only have ten minutes left, we'd better throw out logic for the sake of expedience.Then, just when you thought the ending couldn't get any worse, well...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, well, well, where DO I begin with this film? The beginning is a nicely done introduction, letting you see what Mark Wahlburg's charachter is all about, he is the classic american hero He doesn't take orders well, which makes you wonder why he is in the Air force, but whatever, this Is an action movie, and the plot takes a side role to the suspense and fight scenes anyway. The film wastes no time enslaving him, and wastes less letting him escape, it gets better after he leaves the hatefull city, and the interesting side plot about his divivded love between the gorgeous human, and the intelligent, compassionate ape. The final battle does an excellent job of tying up all the loose ends, both by fulfilling the ancient prophecy, and taking care of the antagonist Thade. There my like for the film evaporates as Tim Burton ends it with something only one large fan of the original series has been able to explain to me as "jumping to another dimension". I don't know about you, but "another dimension" is code for, "the writers ran out of GOOD ideas". the biggest shock of all comes after you've seen the film, and then realize that Mr.Burton shot an additional 4 DIFFERENT endings, and THIS is the one he chose! overall: two hours of entertainment, followed by 10 minutes of mysterious crud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...oozes with style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the better films I have seen this year, perhaps even the best. Tim Burton once again delivers a movie that oozes with style, class and sophistication, with a world so detailed and believable it's almost mind-blowing. Not being familiar with the original movie/tv series myself, I didn't quite know what to expect. I knew from the few articles I had read that Mark Wahlberg plays a pilot who crash lands on a planet ruled by apes, and in an interesting twist, finds himself as the "alien". The story is a great concept and really brings up some interesting issues to think about. This is one of the things I appreciated about it. It is one big role-reversal but in two different ways. Firstly we're no longer the master species in control, we're the animals without the souls to be used and abused. Secondly, instead of being discriminated against because we might be black, white or purple, we're now discriminated against because we're simply human. It says a lot about how we as humans treat others, whether it be animals or people... I really liked this movie. The actors were great, especially Tim Roth as Thade. I've never encountered such a menacing, intimidating character as Roth's Thade on screen before. Helena Bonham Carter's Ari was curious, naive and likeable and Mark Wahlberg didn't disappoint. In general, all the ape actors did a fantastic job and combined with the stunningly detailed make-up, pulled it all off in a very convincing fashion.Danny Elfman is the man responsible for the film's score and I remember thinking during the credits, "Hmm, that name is familiar..." I will definitely remember his name from now on. The score is excellent, and at times spine-chilling, particularly during the opening credits.I'm an every-movie person and I really couldn't find much to fault Planet of the Apes on. My only gripe is that like so many movies these days, it leaves you feeling just a little unsatisfied somehow.. Maybe it's how film-making has changed these days, or the new techniques they use, I really can't put my finger on it. But with this film it's only a minor thing. See it. You wont be disappointed. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>On exiting Planet of the Apes, my friend uttered "What the hell?" I quickly replied "No kidding." For the next two hours we analyzed and reanalyzed Burton's "re-imagining," which turned out to be two hours of completely and utterly nonsensical filmmaking. However, Burton was TRYING to explain the course in which he thought that the human evolutionary pattern is following. For those who have seen the movie, you would remember that Leo's pod crash landed around 2400, when he had left from the 22nd century. The apes on the planet had said that the ruins of the origin of the apes was thousands of years old. This explains that the Oberon when passing through the electrical storm went back in time thousands of years. IF we say that the planet of the apes is really earth we can deduce that in the end when apes ruled present day it was because the oberon had crashed before Leo's departure from it. Because the ship's apes took over thousands of years ago they built up their technology the same as we had in our present day. Burton therefore is suggesting that the apes civilization fell and they were reverted to their ancient primitive ways. Then Leo crashed. Therefore although Leo was trying to make it back to his time, it no longer existed!PS. I went to this movie thinking that even if it was bad, Burton's visuals would be nice as they usually are but all I received was two hours of run-of-the-mill scenes, with nothing special whatsoever.In conclusion, the only thing good about this movie was the music. Ironically Planet made you think, something the filmmakers obviously did not do.</fullReview>

There are two things that are out of logic: the human sensations, and fictious stories. I thought the only logical explanation for this story is that it's a dream. Another explanation is that the astronaut is travelling through space-time. But the first unlogical thing is that the Apes are speaking English(well, this is the only language they can say to show to American audiences). Well, the ending(I'm addicted to talk about endings of movies), is quite unexpected. And it quite supports the explanation of the astronaut travelling through space-time. Okay, don't talk about the logic thing, I think this is rather a fable, to put human into an inferior position how they often treat animals.

		<shortDescription>this movie hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll cut right to the chase: This movie was really stupid. No, worse than stupid, so far beyond stupid I can't even use real words to describe how stupid it was. It was Uberstupid.The story is no secret. Even if you've never seen the ultra-cheesed-out original you know that an astronaut lands on a planet inhabited by a bunch of smart monkeys, and doesn't like being pushed around. As a kid I remember reading the "Apes" comic books with the little 45's in the back, and those left an indelible mark on my brain: images of aggressive monkeys dressed in hip 60s-style war togas; atomic bomb-worshipping men; general world destruction. And of course I remember the evil Dr. Zaius.The new "re-imagined" "Planet of the Apes" left mental scars as well -- not scary or thought-provoking scars -- just plain old scars, like when you fall off a jungle gym or something. We begin our uberstupid-ness on a space station somewhere near Saturn, where some scientists/astronauts/people-in-white-clothing are training monkeys for solo space flights. Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) likes the primates enough but he wants a shot at flying for himself. When an electromagnetic (aka "time-travel") storm comes too close to the station, Leo decides to rescue a monkey that's already been lost in the static. He (of course) encounters some bright lights and big booms, and ends up crashing on a nearby planet.As soon as he arrives, Leo realizes that things are a little off. He, along with hundreds of other humans, are kept in cages by walking and talking apes who want to trade them or kill them or brand them, or all three. But Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), the daughter of the Apes' political leader (and who bears an eery resemblance to post-surgical Michael Jackson), doesn't think humans should be abused and caged. Leo convinces her to purchase him from slave-trader Limbo (the hilarious Paul Giamatti) as a house-servant. Ari also buys Daena (Estelle Warren), the fiesty daughter of Kris Kristofferson who has a thing for Leo and dresses like Raquel Welch in "One Million Years B.C."Leo and Daena end up working as caterers at Ari's father's dinner party. Guests include a snooty orangutan, a vicious gorilla named Colonel Attar (Michael Clark Duncan), and General Thade (Tim Roth), a Danny Devito-like chimpanzee who compensates for his short stature by growling at everything and jumping around a lot. When Thade's not wheezing like an asthmatic Jack Palance, he's trying to win over Ari, who's not really impressed with his Alpha-Male routine. She'd rather mate with the heroic yet sensitive spaceman, who returns Ari's longing glances and finds beauty in her ability to write with her feet. But Leo also yearns for Daena for some reason. An odd interspecies love triangle ensues.Anyway, impatient Leo is anxious to get back to his ship, so he easily escapes from the ape city, taking Daena, Ari, Ari's gorilla bodyguard, and a few other stragglers with him. They travel over jungle and desert on their way to Calima, an ancient ruin that holds the secrets to the Apes' origins (gee, what could they be?). When we discover why the place is called "Calima" I have to wonder how stupid these apes really are.Thade and his army march to Calima to have it out with that pesky astronaut once and for all, and then some other stuff happens that will either confuse you or disappoint you. Or both. Characters seen only briefly until now suddenly take presidence, only to disappear again.The ending is just as random.The monkey actors are generally decent, but are held back from being great by mumbling incoherently beneath rubber masks and waddling around like, well, like monkeys. The humans ain't that great either. Everyone is this movie just needed to shut up. Every time someone opened their mouth I rolled my eyes and prayed it wasn't yet another line taken from the original movie thrown into a new and supposedly funny context.I don't know why this ended up being so bad. Tim Burton is a fabulous director who's brought marvelous vision to the screen before he wasted his time with this disjointed and sloppily-directed project. The "Planet of the Apes" story is a microcosm of racism and classism and how opposable thumbs are the coolest by far, that sort of thing. The new movie is a microcosm of stupidity. It's like that really obnoxious friend we all have that's hyperactive, vain, loud, and a lot less funny than s/he thinks. The comic book had all but one human lobotomized or mute, leaving that one desperate guy with no other choice but to escape and find his ship again. The apes were also a lot more scientific and a lot less animalistic, which in itself is quite frightening. But aside from the screeching and howling and Thade's ultra-hip armor, the apes in the new version aren't even all that scary. There's nothing left to Burton's story but broad strokes of one-dimensional characters who just happen to be in the same place at the same time. Just when it seems there will be the slightest bit of depth to anything, it vanishes like Charlton Heston's cameo.Grades for "Planet of the Apes":action: C plot: D acting: C- special effects: B- overall: D+/C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Burton movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the movie reviews, thought "that's not too promising", but when a friend pointed out that it was a Tim Burton movie, I agreed to watch it. Burton usually provides nice twisted stories and wonderful sceneries. But not this time. There is none of crazy of Mars Attacks, and too little of the moodiness of Batman. None of the skilful storytelling of Sleepy Hollow. The apes are wonderful and quite believable, except for their wild jumps. The ape city is fabulous. But the rest is rather bland. And the story sucks big time! It is too predictable, too simple, just done without feeling. If anyone is surprised at the end, I am amazed.The acting is quite OK, Helene Bonham Carter does a wonderful job as an ape. The crazy ape Thade is a lovely psychotic. But the hero is wooden, and the babe unnecessary. The movie had me twisting in my seat wishing certain scenes would end quickly. The logic at the end, when here can choose between staying and being everybody's hero and have at least one human and one ape girl to enjoy himself with, but instead goes off into space and into a storm is just mad. If I were the guy, I would stay and not risk the storm again; never know where it would put me.The one redeeming quality is the few massed scenes were the ape legions leave their city and the attack at the big battle at the end. And the apes' make up, again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That was a "shocking" ending?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I generally like the first version of a film and tend to skip the sequels, remakes, and anything else designed to remind me of the first film. Being a child of the 80s, I recognize that some sequels are inherently superior to others (i.e. Star Wars films, Indiana Jones, but not _Temple of Doom_, and others), so I tend to be suckered into repeats.So I purchased my $5 IMAX ticket (thank you, Canada) and was eager to see the newest addition to the _Apes_ saga. From the first scene the sound and special effects are great. You get wrapped into this film quickly and intensely. You are, in fact, held throughout the entire film.Burton, as usual, has created a very, very dark film that seems to offer no hope for salvation. Characters become aware of their "sins" and misconceptions of reality. The battle seen of ape vs. man shows the reduction of man to his survivalist instinct, and a hope, albeit distant, for reconciliation.Most films would have stopped there. Kudos to Burton for going further, but where did he think he was going to take us? A great film was RUINED by the ending. Too predicable, too "I need an ending, let's go with this one." You lost me, sir. As we left the theater, my friends and I all echoed the same disappointment. Tsk-tsk for going the easy way out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huge Disappointment. As a fan of the original 'Apes' and Tim Burton I was doubly disappointed with the new "Planet of the Apes" The story is almost non-existent. The dialogue is terrible and/or self-mocking. The much-heralded make-up by Rick Baker is actually not that big a leap from 1968 (except perhaps for Tim Roth and the orangutang). And as for the new shock-ending-please! It might have worked except for a stupid illogical name turning up (you'll know what I mean when you see it). All in all, much anticipated but a major disappointment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film on opening day with hopes for air conditioned diversion, I got exactly that. I am going to see the film again today with my father so I decided to check the showtimes and noticed that there were something like 520 reviews and checked some out. You people are really moronic. Anyone who was disappointed by this film did not use common sense. Do you really think a movie this big, with this kind of budget, this kind of A-list director and this kind of cast was really going to satisfy you when it comes to plot and character development? There has not been a hollywood movie out in years that has satisfied my intellectual yearnings, I have stopped seeking this kind of satisfaction in a hollywood film because it is Sisyphean. This film did exactly what I expected it to do, it kept my attention for a full two hours. Anybody who wanted to have the social commentary of the first movie, the melo-dramatic over-acting of the first movie, the garish orange costumes and the justified willful suspension of disbelief that the first film supplied you with you should have rented the first movie and stayed home.Anyone who enjoys Tim Burton's beautiful productions and just wants to sit in an air conditioned theatre for two hours without expectations should see this film, maybe even twice if your father missed it when you went with your girlfriend the first time. And for the jackasses who keep trying to fault the film on its technical "inaccuracies" and anachronous plot holes: shut up and sit down! It is popcorn fare for popcorn people. You want to discuss technical boo boos, go to StarTrek.comI'm sorry I have to be so harsh with you but you have to learn somewhere along the line that Hollywood will not satisfy you anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie, nice rework of the BOOK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** ++Spoilers++People need to remember that this movie is a reimagination of the 1963 BOOK...not the 1968 movie.Also, the ending of Burton's Apes equals the ending of the BOOK...why blame or criticize Burton for remaining faithful to the BOOK? If you have fault with the ending, take it up with the BOOK...not the movie. Stop acting all surprised (er, ignorant) about the ending of the Burton Apes. Better yet, go read the book and compare for yourselves. Reading takes time and effort, of course.The POTA Book, written in 1963, was written by Pierre Boulle. He also wrote the Bridge Over The River Kwai.This movie does a good job of updating the original premise put forth in the BOOK, without giving away everything and explaining every little detail in full technicolor for the movie going audience. Both the book and Burton's Apes are similar in a few ways. For one, the main character(s) travels through time, into the future, to a planet inhabited by Apes. We learn that the planet was once ruled by humans (Thade's father and the pistol, a doll in the Book), and that the Apes would prefer keeping this secret. Finally, the main character returns to Earth only to find out that Apes inhabit Earth.On the main plot points, the Burton Apes is similar to the BOOK, even the ending. On lesser points, the book and this movie are also similar. The Apes, having taken control of the planet, haven't made much technological progress in the last X thousand years...still using tools, weapons, etc., that existed way back when, when they took control. The book explains this by mentioning that while the Apes are good with mimicking what they see already...they lack the ability, for the most part, for creating new ideas. They simply took over, while humans left for the jungle areas and lived that way for 10,000 years (a short time in evolution standards, agreed) until the main character (Ulysse) shows up. The "ape hunts human" scene in the beginning of both movies is similar to the book as well.In other areas, they diverge. In the book, the humans cannot talk (much like the 1968 movie version) and Nova plays a large role. The Apes don't speak English (actually French...the main character (Ulysse) in the book is French) but rather an ape language, so at first Ulysse doesn't understand them. He learns their language in time, however. Both Cornelius and Zira play critical roles in the book, similar to the 1968 movie as well. However, Dr. Zaius is not as powerful in the book as he was in the 1968 movie; in fact, "gorillas" are the dominant players in the book, the Chimps and Orangutans are in leadership positions only because gorillas allow them and support them in those roles. The gorillas are the real doers in the book.The book was more of a satire...an updated Gulliver's Travels, that poked fun at society, thinkers, educated people, etc. The ending of the book involves Ulysse, Nova, and their son returning to Earth. On both the trip away from Earth, and the return to earth, much time has elapsed on Earth (due to scientific explanations of which I won't bore anyone). When they land, Ulysse is expecting to see futuristic vehicles and buildings and so forth, and is at first surprised that things look not much different than when he left (which would have been hundreds/thousands of years previously). He is shocked, of course, when he sees a police car pull up and 2 gorillas step out. At that moment, he realizes that what happened on the Planet of the Apes (decline of Humans, rise of Apes, not much technological change for X thousand years) also happened on Earth!In the movie, this is not entirely clear. What really happened, it appears, in the movie is that Wahlberg returns to Earth well into the future (not the present) and learns that humans declined, apes took over, and not much technological advances occurred in between. In other words, the ending of the Burton Apes is similar to the book! The explanation of "Honest Ape" Thade at the end could be one of two things, at least. One, it could be a monument to another "Thade" that rose to power on Earth and has no connection whatsover to the Thade left, in captivity and decidedly NOT killed on the Planet of the Apes. Or two, it could be that Thade escaped from his cell, commandeered a flying vessel (either repaired the one in the water, or perhaps another pod lands shortly after the chimp's did) and flies to Earth at a time much sooner than Wahlberg and precipitates an uprising leading to the downfall of Man and rise of Apes.In all, a very interesting movie based on a very interesting and funny BOOK that provides the viewer with much to think about. Special effects are very good, and while I don't think it's a perfect movie by any stretch, I do think it's definitely worthwhile and entertaining, worthy of seeing. Also, read the book...and stop complaining about the ending of the Burton Apes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton´s re-telling of the novel "Planet of the Apes" by Pierre Boulle is a stylish and exciting adventure. In the year 2029, astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) travels through a storm in space and is separated from his comrades. He lands on a remote planet, where humans are slaves and the apes are rulers. He is captured but attempts to escape and tries to revolt against the apes. You might think that a new version of "Planet of the Apes" from 1968 would be a bad idea. But since the story in the new one is rather different than in the original, it becomes a whole new film. Burton´s version comes up with many interesting ideas. He develops the racial issues more than the first one did, and questions the real differences between the humans and the apes.The acting is first class all the way, Mark Wahlberg is perfect in the leading role, but the real stars here are those who play apes. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth are all excellent, especially the latter. Roth is terrific as the evil General Thade, a character whom in the wrong hands could have been a bit silly. But Roth makes him a great villain, and he actually steals the show. I would love to see this British actor in more big budget productions in the future. The acting through the very realistic ape costumes is definitely something worth seeing.Overall, I liked the new "Planet of the Apes" better than the first one, and I still liked that one a lot. But the new one has better actors, cooler effects and a clever and entertaining script. It´s not perfect, the movie becomes a bit sentimental and cheesy towards the end, when Wahlberg tries to motivate the humans to fight. And why does it always have to be a kid who wants to be a hero in these big summer movies? I first thought that it was only in the "Jurassic Park"-trilogy that this was common, but "Planet of the Apes" was no exception. This is still the most exciting adventure I´ve seen this year, and it´s nice to see a summer movie with both brains and muscles. And I liked the ending, even if I didn´t understand much of it at first. But it certainly blew me away, just like Michael Clarke Duncan said it would, in an interview I read.* * * * out of * * * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a Love/Hate Barrel of Monkeys!... I mean Apes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to be a trend this particular year that there is alot of movies hitting the big screen that are either loved or hated and sometimes lack a satisfying ending. In this regards "Planet of the Apes" 2001 is no different, however once again Tim Burton reminds us how wide the imagination can spread.If your like me and are generally unsatisfied with the tripe peddled to the masses in modern day supermarket cinemas then you'll understand my pleasure when a Tim Burton movie comes out. He does things just that extra bit different to most film makers that sets his films apart and makes them a refreshing experience. The first feeling I had when leaving the cinema was "I need to see that again". Partly because of an unusual problem with the ending, and partly because Burton's "Apes" was an absolute riot.I want to get the plot issues out of the way first; the film is not different in plot to the original in 1968. He arrives, he is captured, he escapes, and there is conflict about the origins of Apes and then a twist ending. No surprises here. This version of the story holds together really well. That is up until the conflict sequences towards the end. Sometimes I wonder if they change writers in these films but the person who thought hard about the script suddenly stopped thinking about it and the movie seemed to suddenly lower a level or two. I am not saying it was poor, no not at all but not up to the same standard as the rest of the film up until that point. Although one must remember this is a film about Apes, and what Apes they are!These walking talking Apes are absolutely fantastic. Unlike the original they all look very different to each other and they actually act like Apes. If you have ever been to the Zoo and Watched the monkeys play you'll know what I mean. Tim Roth was absolutely outstanding and totally convincing as the evil Ape, I was completely in awe of how convincing his character and monkey suit was. Not only was the make-up outstanding but they also must of studied how Apes behave because they had the personalities and behaviour habits down to a fine art! Watching Them hang from the sealing, leap from tree to tree and go berserk was an absolute riot and I enjoyed every minute of it!The humans and the hero on the other hand are a slightly different story! They are obviously not the focus of the film so there are no strong performances, certainly they do not get much screen time. As for Mark Whalberg as Leo he is probably the first true to life hero. There is absolutely nothing special about his character and in the end he does nothing special either except give hope to the humans on this upside down world. He is not an over the top action hero, he is more of a "nineties man" with no special traits except his inability to accept Ape control. But we all would object I believe. This is what I liked about Leo, he was ordinary and even when he was trying to motivate the humans at the end no one fell into the trap of an over the top inspirational speech. he sounded like you or I would making it up on the spot. Tim Burton once again gives us a different spin on an old icon.Finally we come to the very end and probably the main point of confusion for everyone. No matter what your theory is I think we all need the script writers to come forth and "please explain!". I did like the ending but originally it did confuse me and there are so many conflicting facts in the story that prevent most logical conclusions that my mind was going to explode. All the same I implore you not to let this be a deterrent as the film in totality is a marvellous experience.I don't want to give this movie a rating because it is again definitely one of those films, which you will either love or hate. These kinds of films generally cause discussions of great length and analysis and no one will ever agree particularly on a theory for the end of this one. However I certainly loved the film and believe it was worth the price of the admission. The best thing to do is go and see it for yourself, making up your own mind is the most satisfying thing about it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most mis-understood ENDING of ALL TIME!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** SPOILERS ****This review is riddled with spoilers because I want to explain the ending to everyone!It is not what you think!!! If you went in expecting only one logical time-line then you've messed up already - there is in this film at least three different dimensions or realties as you will find out by reading on!I thought about it for a while and now I appreciate the genius of it all. The world they are on is certainly not Earth but there are two moons... this is 400 years into the future. He skips through two time/dimensional wormholes and ends up in the same solar system - on Saturn! That is right Saturn. Two moons, the glowing rings around the planet etc. In this alternate dimension Horses are obviously native to the planet. Now the Oberon obviously flew through the storm and has ended up in the same dimension only thousands of years earlier. The genetically engineered apes rapidly evolve and conquer the humans. Over many hundreds of years the humans become nomads and education falls apart. Whilst the genetically engineered apes who are bred to learn and develop become the socially dominant group. Semos forbids the Apes from Calima and wallah you have your set-up!Then we come to the end. Obviously Leo skips once through the time/dimensional wormhole. So one can assume we are now in an alternate reality again. Of course it is similar to our own and General Thade is there. This is a where the creators are laughing at us... in alternate realities things are generally the same with just slight twists. You know in the Simpsons when Homer goes back in time and when he travels back Ned Flanders rules the world? This twist in this film is that the Apes have evolved even further than on the previous planet in the other dimension into technological beings very similar to humans - perhaps in this alternate universe there is a film called "Planet of the Humans". Do you see what I am getting at. I don't think we need to ask how Thade got to Earth, or what about time lines because the filmmakers did not even ask those questions. They created different possibilities for how time and reality could evolve and used the electric disturbance in space to transport our hero between them all!And so there you have it. A neat sci-fi ending that amuses the suits into thinking they can generate a sequel. My hope is if they do that they do their best to tie up the lose ends and treat the story with intelligence. This would be neat if they thought hard about explaining the new dimension.I would prefer whatever the sequal maybe to treat the entire movie as the explanation and not just resolve it in the first 5 minutes - that would be neat and interesting with room for a classic ending...Now that I have that out of the way I hope you all appreciate it a little more!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't leave the theater, and I didn't fall asleep. Neither was I riveted to the screen. Though the apes in this remake are better looking, and the sets more lavish compared to the original, the plot, characters, and dialogue leave much to be desired. I expected more from Tim Burton. The characters are tepid, shell people (apes). A little "character development" was in order. The plot, hokey enough with time travel as main device, was an unworkable, meandering journey through the frenetic pace all to common in todays' typical Hollywood offering. I thought some new angle as to how the apes took over the planet would have been cool. But the usual "humans caused the problem" babble continues. And there are holes galore in the story. For instance, since there are supposed to be four humans for every ape, then why would it be so hard for humanity to fight the apes? Especially since people have the power of speech in this new version.And how, at the end of the flick, did Capt. Leo get from Saturn to Earth in his little space pod thing. And of course I must object to the usual liberal political correctness that permeates Hollywood. Would we seriously expect a bronze age culture to have a "Human Rights" group? As usual, so much more could have been accomplished with this film. But instead they settle for the two week thrill. Another great movie theme sacrificed on the alter of the summertime box office. The sequel can only be better!</fullReview>

Maybe. But this is pure silliness and irrelevant. I mean, if this was Earth, I'd take an interest and enjoy it more. But alas, it isn't, so who cares?? I don't. Why care about humans or apes or even horses?? I say kill em all. Ravage the land and destroy all that exists. I mean, this is supposed to be another planet, right?Planet of the Apes is SO much different from the original. Of course it is supposed to be!! But this has become altogether changed for the worst. I don't see how I am made to care. Tim Burton has gotten us to another world where we DO NOT sympathize nor feel for. IF apes that talk land on Earth and threaten human existance, that'd be so cool and I'd care. Charlton Heston landed on future Earth and I cared as well.I gave this movie a 3. 3 based on Special effects and AWESOME music.-4 on story and -1 on acting. 6 for directing and 9 for music. 9 for action sequence and -5 for credibility. This is a pure Hollywood popcorn movie so many people love/hate.

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to make of this film. Was Tim Burton doing a parody of the first movie? It felt like Fox was rushing through production to complete this movie before a writers strike and sacraficed the writing itself. The film never really explains itself and relies upon the audience knowing the premise of the first film for plot guidance. When I saw this film, the audience actually exploded in laughter during the final scene clincher. Was that supposed to be funny? The only saving grace of this film was the acting of Helena Bonham Carter which makes Marky Mark's acting appear even worse than it is in their scenes together.

He lands on a remote planet, where humans are slaves and the apes are rulers. He is captured but attempts to escape and tries to revolt against the apes. You might think that a new version of "Planet of the Apes" from 1968 would be a bad idea. But since the story in the new one is rather different than in the original, it becomes a whole new film. Burton´s version comes up with many interesting ideas. He develops the racial issues more than the first one did, and questions the real differences between the humans and the apes.The acting is first class all the way, Mark Wahlberg is perfect in the leading role, but the real stars here are those who play apes. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth are all excellent, especially the latter. Roth is terrific as the evil General Thade, a character whom in the wrong hands could have been a bit silly. But Roth makes him a great villain, and he actually steals the show. I would love to see this British actor in more big budget productions in the future. The acting through the very realistic ape costumes is definitely something worth seeing.Overall, I liked the new "Planet of the Apes" better than the first one, and I still liked that one a lot. But the new one has better actors, cooler effects and a clever and entertaining script. It´s not perfect, the movie becomes a bit sentimental and cheesy towards the end, when Wahlberg tries to motivate the humans to fight. And why does it always have to be a kid who wants to be a hero in these big summer movies? I first thought that it was only in the "Jurassic Park"-trilogy that this was common, but "Planet of the Apes" was no exception. This is still the most exciting adventure I´ve seen this year, and it´s nice to see a summer movie with both brains and muscles. And I liked the ending, even if I didn´t understand much of it at first. But it certainly blew me away, just like Michael Clarke Duncan said it would, in an interview I read.* * * * out of * * * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pathetic. There are no moments at all when you feel any connection to the characters. Mark Walhburg was the worst of the cast. He just stood around with a stupified look on his face. The action scenes were contrived and trivial. There was never a sense of danger. The ape makeup was one of the good things of the movie, but it was probably best on Tim Roth. Helena Bonahm Carter's makeup was the worst. There were so many plot holes, illogical plot elements, and incosistencies with the apes that it ruins all the enjoyment of the movie. Not one actor gave a half-decent performance. The only thing to see this movie for is Estella Warren. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is plain fun. I liked the original movie, but the fact that the monkeys behaved like humans annoyed me. Chimps are really aggressive. Just as in this movie. Man, I love this new apes. They act like intelligent monkeys, not humans. The plot maybe somewhat empty, but it's not written to make you think but to entertain you. The ending is good, it's enough open to leave room for a sequel. Go see it and try not to think about the original movie. Have fun! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My take on POTA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the best possible review for the latest Tim Burton movie comes directly from the source material, Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel "Planet of the Apes.""I soon succeeded in convincing myself that well-trained animals might well... become expert in in all the human arts, including the art of cinematography." -Pierre BoulleTim Burton was so wrapped up in the idea that this was about the apes, that he apparently was humanitarian enough to let a real live ape write the script.The film was 15% Planet of the Apes, 15% Tim Burton, and 70% Hollywood Bull Crap.The plot is thin, the dialogue ridiculous, and the ending a completely predictable insult to viewer intelligence. Fortunately the special effects are perfect... so what you end up with is a lump of coal wrapped in pretty wrapping paper.A waste of potential!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First up. I don't think this is as good as Burton's other work. Edward Scissorhands has been his best so far- I think because it was his concept, it was so bizarre and yet he made a boy with Scissorhands the most emotionally engaging story I have ever seen. As the critics said "beauty told in simplicity".Planet of the Apes (POTA) is very distinctive from the opening credits as a Burton film. There are elements of 2001: A Space Odyssey and other little movie references to be found throughout the film. Wahlberg is ideal as the Taylor/Leo character. As an actor he can't go as far as some others but the role is suitable for him. The supporting cast are excellent as apes/chimps/gorillas- the whole bag of bananas. While some will see their antics and comments as corny or cliche, keep in mind this is Burton's own vision (reimagining- that itself is now a cliche!) of Boulle's original novel "Monkey Planet".The social comments are very clever and will have you chuckling at certain points. Look out for a classic moment where Burton's partner Lisa Marie performs an exotic ape dance for her man, err ape, err orangutang. The make up is amazing and the set design of Ape City is very stylish. The only quarm I have with it, is it comes across as more like "Ape Housing Commission" because it seems so small or claustrophobic.The story is strong, but missing certain power in some parts- however where one element weakens, Burton knows how to fill the screen with something else to take your attention away. I have no doubt in saying Rick's makeup will score him a 2002 Oscar at the Mann Chinese Theatre, not to mention a few others possibly for other areas....And the ending. Oh, the ending. Many will not like the ending, but many will be very intrigued. I thought the ending was unreal- totally Burton!I definately reccomend you go see this film. It is one of the better films of the year. It is not Burton's best, and in a way he has slipped. But we are talking about Burton here, so rest assured he will quickly pick himself back up and create something BRILLIANT again! I'd give it 7 out of 10 bananas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything you see, except the ending, is explained more or less as you view the movie. You will notice if you have seen the originals that several lines of monologue were reproduced for an insider's bit of hilarity. It's a bit flipflopped from the point of view in the first Planet Of The Apes but is memorable in that people having seen the first one recognize these quotes immediately. The first and last quotes by the human astronaut(after capture and escape) in the first film are reproduced from an ape's perspective in this latest one. For example, "get your paws off me you damn dirty ape" has been reinvented as "get your hands off me you damn dirty human". Also, the famous "damn them, damn them all" was used by the same actor but in an ape role. All Hail, Charles Heston.K1</fullReview>

You know the whole reverse evolution thingy ... What was Burton thinking!?! I'll admit that if this was an original movie I would have liked it, but it's not! There are certain elements of any classic that just shouldn't be messed with.Maybe if they would have changed the name a little, say "Ape Planet" or "Marky Mark goes Ape" or "Clash of the Vertebrates"Boooo, Mr. Burton, Boooo indeed.WAIT FOR THE VIDEO!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighten up, it's science-FICTION! (that means not real)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoiler Alert*** I don't actually tell the ending of the movie, but I'm sure I've written something that could ruin it for someone.Everyone who hates this movie seems to dislike if for the same reason-the ending. I loved the original POTA, and feel it has one of the best surprise endings of all film history. While the original movie followed the overall plot of the book, (yes, book. It was a book first, and obviously NOBODY who has posted here has ever read it) its ending is vastly different. This new incarnation has absolutely no similarity to the book other than an astronaut being stranded on a planet of apes-AND the ending!This is what I think happened, Burton knew he really couldn't top the ending of the original, and so settled for the next best thing by paying homage to the book's ending. A quick synopsis of the book's ending for those who haven't read it: The astronaut flies off of the planet of the apes. He flies back to earth, makes radio contact with ground crews, and lands. On the ground (I seem to remember him landing at an airbase) he sees jeeps and trucks approaching his ship. But as they get closer he sees that they are being driven by ? APES! My details may be a bit off, I read the book over 10 years ago, but that's the gist of it. The planet of the apes and Earth were two different planets in the book, as I believe they are in the new film. You see, the thrust of the story is that the hero isn't merely trapped on a planet controlled by apes, but trapped in a universe populated by them. Alternate reality, parallel dimension, whatever. It kind of ticks me off that all these sci-fi geeks that are ripping the new movie for time-travel flubs can't broaden their minds to possibly accept the fact that Wahlberg was traveling through dimensions as well as time. Think about it people, in this film you buy into the idea that inter-stellar travel is possible in 40 years, apes can walk and talk, and a `magnetic space storm' can toss a tiny little ship through time, but it's too ridiculous to think it could open portals to another universe.I'm not claiming that this is a perfect solution to all the problems and questions the movie brings up, but I think it is closer to what the film makers were trying to convey.Was it just me, or did anyone else think the faces in those fuzzy, static filled video images at the beginning and near the end of the movie looked rather ape-like? More clues that it is an alternate reality?Did anyone else catch the Wizard of Oz line? `You go this way, you go that way, the rest come with me and we'll surround them!'Oh yeah, I enjoyed the movie. It entertained me for two hours and that's all I was hoping for. I never really expect Oscar-like performances from mega-hyped summer blockblusters. The original is still better in my book, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is not quite as good as the first film, but is definitely alot of fun to watch. The one downfall of the film is the overall substance of the human beings and their relationship with one another. It was pretty cold in that area. I would have given the lead to a different actor other than Mark Wahlberg. His character needed to be as big as the apes in the film. And the apes in this film were just as good as the characters in the first movie. Super makeup by Rick Baker and the sets looked fantastic. One final note...I wish the battle scene at the end had more substance and a little more thought put into it. This would have given the film its climax that it badly needed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fired up to see this movie. I went right away so no one could spoil the surprise ending. I was extremely disappointed in the film and urge you to save your 9 bucks. For the record, I think the original was excellent. Here are the main reasons why this movie falls short. (No spoilers) - Many plot holes - Cheesy humorous references to the first movie...why is this necessary? Apparently, they rightly felt that this movie couldn't stand on it's own. - Stereotypical bad guy (ape) - Stereotypical good guy( female ape , made up to look like Janet Jackson) - Drags at times. - Gratuitous "surprise" ending...not well thought out and inserted merely for the sake of having a surprise ending like the good, first movie.Rent it when it comes out and you'll see what I mean...or better yet, go rent the original.</fullReview>

The acting (except for Paul Giamatti) is bad, the changes from the original 1968 version do not improve upon the story, and the special effects are mediocre. The ape makeup looks great, although it's hard to understand what some of them are saying. The costumes for the apes look terrific too.If I never knew from the credits that it was directed by Tim Burton, I would never have guessed from watching it. Where is his distinctive touches? His films in the past have a very influential look to them. This film emulated the most mediocre elements of basic mainstream science-fiction tripe.

		<shortDescription>A Desecration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, where do I start? When the five original Apes movies were remastered and re-released on DVD, I spent a week rewatching them. Not only were the films pleasing on an aesthetic level, but I was better able to appreciate the complex political subtext that had been inserted by Rod Serling and later screenwriters. These are angry, intelligent films, which in many ways, despite diminishing budgets, get better as the series progresses. The revolutionary implications of the fourth film, Conquest (its climax was modeled after the Watts riots), were so extreme that the studio forced a re-shoot of the ending, which originally had Caesar (played with amazing Shakespearean grandeur by Roddy McDowell) leading a final slaughter of the hopelessly debased human population.How can a film over two hours long contain so little? There is not one good line, there is not one good SHOT in the entire remake. Given Tim Burton's track record, I expected at the very least a memorable visual experience. Instead we get a dim bluish murk, clunky editing, and shoddy, oppressive studio-bound sets. The oh-so-clever 'relevant' dialog wouldn't pass muster on a lackluster episode of Politically Incorrect, and the 'shock' ending is just completely incomprehensible. Also, why did they make Helena Bonham Carter's ape character look like Michael Jackson?In 1968, Chuck Heston, as the misanthropic astronaut Taylor, ran around in a loin cloth, bared his ass, and roared bitter imprecations in his great, gravely voice. Now Mark Walberg (the new Cary Grant, according to Vanity Fair - go figure) keeps his bulky, restrictive space suit on for the entire film, and DOES NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ACT. His voice never rises above a whisper. His facial expression never changes. Well, that routine only works when you have charisma to spare. Had I been casting this film, it would have been Bruce Willis all the way. He would have known how to empathize with an ape.How sad that the three-dimensional characters of the original series have been reduced to platitudinous stereotypes; or that the story is now nothing more than 'heroic astronaut liberates oppressed humans from evil monkeys'; or that, had I not read the reviews ahead of time, I would not have known who played the apes (in the old days they put distinctive voices under the make-up: McDowell, Kim hunter, Paul Williams, John Huston). THIS IS WHY I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES ANYMORE! This is why I would rather stay at home and watch Kurosawa on DVD.Thank God Roddy did not live to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As The Original, But Still Reasonably Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" is not a remake of the original version of the film, but rather a "re-imagining" or different take of that original material. Wise move. The original "Apes" is a film that still holds its own as an all-time sci-fi classic; pretty much any attempt to remake it faithfully would wind up like Gus Van Sant's remake of Hitchcock's "Psycho". . . a pale imitation of greatness. By "reimagining" the original film, Burton gives himself the opportunity to start with the established mythology of the "Apes" series, as well as the ability to travel in a new direction with that mythology. The end result? The new "Planet of the Apes" is nothing Earth-shattering (pardon the pun) -- in ten or twenty years, it won't be looked at with the same reverence or respect as the original "Apes" -- but it's still good, and brings enough new ideas to the table to make a reasonably entertaining film.The story, which ranges in spots from good to barely mediocre, possesses some serious gaps of logic and suffers from an awkward opening. The first fifteen minutes of the film makes little sense, and lurches along aimlessly for awhile until it stumbles into the heart of its story. (Examples of some nonsense: Couldn't chimp-piloted ships simply be controlled by computers? Would highly experimental exploration pods be able to launch from a space station just by one rogue pilot punching in a two-second launch sequence?) The opening of the film admittedly does make more sense by the end of the film, but it's still not very good. It appears as though the writers thought of a solid middle and ending for their version of "Planet of the Apes" . . . but had no idea how to get the story past the opening credits to that middle and ending. The weak beginning seems like their best attempt to get the story moving to those points. As for the rest of the story, it contains a lot of good, even original elements, but some points are glossed over in a rather hurried fashion -- there's little effort made to explore some plot threads, and some of the explanations as to how and why things happen in the film are either weak or come completely out of left field. The story's excellent . . . for a second draft. I've read that Twentieth Century Fox rushed this new version of "Planet of the Apes" into production. Too bad. The story and script could've been excellent -- and more important, solid throughout -- with some more work.Despite the uneven story, though, director Tim Burton does a nice job, given the script he has to work with. If nothing else, Burton has a knack for giving films an eccentric look, and his version of "Planet of the Apes" benefits greatly from his eccentric touch. He evokes a lot of the weird imagery of the original films (the weird scarecrows, the desolate landscapes) without ever blatantly stealing from them. He also does a great job when it comes to focusing on the smaller, quieter moments in the movie -- for example, there's a macabre scene where a child ape puts her pet human in its cage for the night that manages to be disturbing and funny at the same time. Burton, though, doesn't appear to have a clear idea of the overall tone of the movie. In "Planet of the Apes", he goes for a blend of action, comedy, and seriousness . . . but the blend doesn't always work. Some of the humor seems out of place, and the action often seems stilted, as if Burton didn't know what to do with the apes apart from having them leap around menacingly. The film is one of Burton's better efforts, but much like the script, the direction contains a few distinct weak spots.As for the actors . . . again, it's a mixed bag. The apes comprise the stronger half of the cast, which makes sense, since the apes are the weirder of the two groups - and Tim Burton specializes in weird. In regards to the human characters, Burton would've been better off making the humans in his version of "Planet of the Apes" more like the humans in the original film - mute. Apart from the protagonist Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), none of them add anything of import to the film anyway. The highlights of the individual actors come from mostly from the main characters. Tim Roth nails the part of villainous General Thade perfectly - he's one of the best sci-fi screen villains to appear on screen in quite awhile. Wahlberg plays Captain Leo Davidson in a manner similar to Heston in the original film; he's a man who's not terribly interested in contemplating how he arrived at a planet ruled by intelligent apes . . . he just knows he wants to leave. Fast. He's a pragmatic hero, one who reluctantly tries to help others in distress, but doesn't want to die in the process. Also worth mentioning is Paul Giamatti, who provides some much-needed comic relief as the peculiar orangutan slaver Limbo. On the other side of the acting coin, the biggest disappointment came from Helena Bonham Carter as Ari. Given the poor quality of her character in the screenplay, she does what she can for her character, but all she really does for the whole film is to go around being nice to humans. Period. Some reasons as to WHY Ari feels so passionately about helping humans would've been nice.Tim Burton's `Planet of the Apes' is an action movie that manages to take some of the influences of the original `Apes' films, and then creates something eccentric and new. Does it always work? No, although in general, the good outweighs the bad. Is it better than the original? Absolutely not. In a summer filled with blockbuster duds, though, there's something to be said for a film that provides some thrills and some fun, and the new `Planet of Apes' does exactly that. Overall, it's an enjoyable film; it's just not a spectacular one. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I should have been smarter, maybe I should have been wiser. However, when I went to see this, I was hoping, maybe even expecting, something intelligent that represented science fiction. However, this was not science fiction, and did not have an ounce of intelligence in its overly-long body. The movie is crap. It is dreck.First, I was not expecting the original. The original had a very '60s or hippy mindset about how humans destroyed the earth, and nature took over. That wouldn't go over now. So, I asked myself, what could they do to the movie to make it more modern. It seemed to me that they tried by making it be a metaphor for class wars, or political racism. But that was soon abandoned. Eventually it became the usual. A watered-down post-apocalyptic-like road movie (or escape, whatever).I was too busy searching for some sign of intelligence to tell you how the acting was (it could have been good, it could have been horrible). Visually it was stunning if you have to resort to that. And the score was wonderful (thanks Danny Elfman). But for the rest of the movie, skip it. I was so frustrated that before the ending came up, my Gatorade bottle was a crumpled mess.SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS****SPOILERS*****SPOILERSThe end of the movie was just pure hilarity. Maybe I wouldn't have found it so funny if I hadn't called it before it actually occurred. Right as Wahlberg got into the pod, I asked my friend, "Wouldn't it be funny if Earth was taken over by apes?" Lo and behold, it happened. And with police cars and everything, it kind of reminded me of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"'s ending. The Jefferson monument was a hark back to those cool cartoons where they would blow up Mt. Rushmore and it would turn into the villains face. Maybe I shouldn't be so judgemental, but that was the only redeeming part of the whole movie (and for all the wrong reasons).END SPOILERS2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, but not an improvement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did what the author of a previous comment suggested and watched this film with an open mind and tried not to compare it with the original. Compare it or not there was definitely something lacking in the story. I won't spoil the origin of the apes for those who haven't seen the film but (and pardon me but I can't resist) even a monkey could figure it out and the ending while it does open the door for a whole new set of possible sequels is really disappointing and lacks the punch of the originals ending. One high point however has to be the talents of the actors playing the apes, their not just actors in costume but really become the apes they are portraying and for an instant you do feel like they are really talking, civilized apes. Much less can be said about the actors portraying the human slaves, I liked it better in the original when they couldn't talk. Director Burton was definitely trying to go somewhere different with this one but seemed to not really follow through with his ideas. Out of a possible four stars, I give it ** 1/2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Production values, but cheap-shot ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be our species' somewhat perverse curiosity that'll make this remake, or as they say in their publicity material, "re-imagining," one of the summer's boffo hits. I am not big on science-fiction, but indeed, I was very curious to see Tim Burton's darker version of an already dark story. For the most part, the film holds up since Burton gives it a lot more intensity than the original. However, notwithstanding everything, including Mark Wahlberg's lightweight performance, the much debated ending is a cop-out; a cheap shot of Hollywood's creative bankruptcy. It just doesn't make sense, and isn't worth debating about because it is shot thru w/ holes. Why they didn't end earlier, with Leo just leaving the planet, is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie about ten times more that I thought I would. I guess that when you expect a movie to be kinda dumb and pale in comparison to its original version, then the good qualities of the new version can catch you by surprise and provide a lot of fun when you least expect it.I had been disappointed by Burton's "Mars Attacks!" (It could've been a classic considering that amazing cast), so I let some friends drag me to "Planet" with more than a little trepidation.In one of the earliest scenes, the lights of the space station all go dark, and I heard probably half a dozen people around me whispering various versions of "what, no emergency lighting?!", so I thought "Here we go; more Hollywood dumbness unleashed upon the screen..." but within the next few minutes things started picking up...and from then on I was completely along for the ride.My favorite part of this movie has got to be Danny Elfman's propulsive score; I can't wait to buy this soundtrack. It's great! My second favorite aspect of this film is Tim Roth's wild portrayal of Thade; he delivers quite an inventive homage to great SF villains, all the way back to Ming the Merciless! There are some scenes in which his character is so malevolent that it's spine-tingling.As for the ending (NO SPOILER) - I think it's all intended in fun, with a nod and a wink, not to mention unleashing a spectacular pun upon humanity! (Anyone who's already seen it should get it.)So come on folks, lighten up - this one is pure entertainment. Thanks for the good time, Mr. B!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5th Best APES film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yup, with all the resources available in Hollywood (not to mention the technical advances over 3 decades), Tim Burton has managed to film the 5th best film in the 6 film PLANET OF THE APES saga. Well, actually, I'd say it's a 5th place tie with the ignominious closer to the original series BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES. Advertised as a 're-imagining', it's much closer to 'rip-off' of the original. The thievery even begins with hack composer Danny Elfman's outright mimicking of Jerry Goldsmith's groundbreaking original score. What else has been 're-imagined'? Campy "ape" comedy? - been done. Twist on man/ape evolution? - been there. Use of an American monument for the 'shock' ending? - done that. Call me a heretic, but I was disappointed by Rick Baker's makeup. Not the makeup per se (they are to his usual excellent standard), but the design. Why do all the female apes look like simian version of LaToya and Janet Jackson? Sorry, I believe John Chambers' designs were superior 30 years ago. And, the ending(s)? Well, the main plot "twist" I predicted sight unseen over 6 months ago (Burton kept insisting that it would be "different" from the original, yet have a twist. So, the film's main evolutionary twist was easily forseen). The "double twist" at the end is both meaningless and far-fetched. I don't wanna be a spoiler like that #$#$! idiot Matt Drudge, so all I'll say is that the "shocker" ending is meaningless because it doesn't evolve logically by the events in the film (as the original's did) - it's just a twist for "a twist's" sake. Burton felt obligated to "top" the original, so he "had" to tag one on. Logically, it's far-fetched because for the ending to make sense, EVERYTHING in this new Evolutionary construct would have had to occur in EXACTLY the same way as modern Earth evolution to have THAT "monumental" ending. A disappointment all around</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, where do I start? When the five original Apes movies were remastered and re-released on DVD, I spent a week rewatching them. Not only were the films pleasing on an aesthetic level, but I was better able to appreciate the complex political subtext that had been inserted by Rod Serling and later screenwriters. These are angry, intelligent films, which in many ways, despite diminishing budgets, get better as the series progresses. The revolutionary implications of the fourth film, Conquest (its climax was modeled after the Watts riots), were so extreme that the studio forced a re-shoot of the ending, which originally had Caesar (played with amazing Shakespearean grandeur by Roddy McDowell) leading a final slaughter of the hopelessly debased human population.How can a film over two hours long contain so little? There is not one good line, there is not one good SHOT in the entire remake. Given Tim Burton's track record, I expected at the very least a memorable visual experience. Instead we get a dim bluish murk, clunky editing, and shoddy, oppressive studio-bound sets. The oh-so-clever 'relevant' dialog wouldn't pass muster on a lackluster episode of Politically Incorrect, and the 'shock' ending is just completely incomprehensible. Also, why did they make Helena Bonham Carter's ape character look like Michael Jackson?In 1968, Chuck Heston, as the misanthropic astronaut Taylor, ran around in a loin cloth, bared his ass, and roared bitter imprecations in his great, gravely voice. Now Mark Walberg (the new Cary Grant, according to Vanity Fair - go figure) keeps his bulky, restrictive space suit on for the entire film, and DOES NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ACT. His voice never rises above a whisper. His facial expression never changes. Well, that routine only works when you have charisma to spare. Had I been casting this film, it would have been Bruce Willis all the way. He would have known how to empathize with an ape.How sad that the three-dimensional characters of the original series have been reduced to platitudinous stereotypes; or that the story is now nothing more than 'heroic astronaut liberates oppressed humans from evil monkeys'; or that, had I not read the reviews ahead of time, I would not have known who played the apes (in the old days they put distinctive voices under the make-up: McDowell, Kim hunter, Paul Williams, John Huston). THIS IS WHY I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES ANYMORE! This is why I would rather stay at home and watch Kurosawa on DVD.Thank God Roddy did not live to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As The Original, But Still Reasonably Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" is not a remake of the original version of the film, but rather a "re-imagining" or different take of that original material. Wise move. The original "Apes" is a film that still holds its own as an all-time sci-fi classic; pretty much any attempt to remake it faithfully would wind up like Gus Van Sant's remake of Hitchcock's "Psycho". . . a pale imitation of greatness. By "reimagining" the original film, Burton gives himself the opportunity to start with the established mythology of the "Apes" series, as well as the ability to travel in a new direction with that mythology. The end result? The new "Planet of the Apes" is nothing Earth-shattering (pardon the pun) -- in ten or twenty years, it won't be looked at with the same reverence or respect as the original "Apes" -- but it's still good, and brings enough new ideas to the table to make a reasonably entertaining film.The story, which ranges in spots from good to barely mediocre, possesses some serious gaps of logic and suffers from an awkward opening. The first fifteen minutes of the film makes little sense, and lurches along aimlessly for awhile until it stumbles into the heart of its story. (Examples of some nonsense: Couldn't chimp-piloted ships simply be controlled by computers? Would highly experimental exploration pods be able to launch from a space station just by one rogue pilot punching in a two-second launch sequence?) The opening of the film admittedly does make more sense by the end of the film, but it's still not very good. It appears as though the writers thought of a solid middle and ending for their version of "Planet of the Apes" . . . but had no idea how to get the story past the opening credits to that middle and ending. The weak beginning seems like their best attempt to get the story moving to those points. As for the rest of the story, it contains a lot of good, even original elements, but some points are glossed over in a rather hurried fashion -- there's little effort made to explore some plot threads, and some of the explanations as to how and why things happen in the film are either weak or come completely out of left field. The story's excellent . . . for a second draft. I've read that Twentieth Century Fox rushed this new version of "Planet of the Apes" into production. Too bad. The story and script could've been excellent -- and more important, solid throughout -- with some more work.Despite the uneven story, though, director Tim Burton does a nice job, given the script he has to work with. If nothing else, Burton has a knack for giving films an eccentric look, and his version of "Planet of the Apes" benefits greatly from his eccentric touch. He evokes a lot of the weird imagery of the original films (the weird scarecrows, the desolate landscapes) without ever blatantly stealing from them. He also does a great job when it comes to focusing on the smaller, quieter moments in the movie -- for example, there's a macabre scene where a child ape puts her pet human in its cage for the night that manages to be disturbing and funny at the same time. Burton, though, doesn't appear to have a clear idea of the overall tone of the movie. In "Planet of the Apes", he goes for a blend of action, comedy, and seriousness . . . but the blend doesn't always work. Some of the humor seems out of place, and the action often seems stilted, as if Burton didn't know what to do with the apes apart from having them leap around menacingly. The film is one of Burton's better efforts, but much like the script, the direction contains a few distinct weak spots.As for the actors . . . again, it's a mixed bag. The apes comprise the stronger half of the cast, which makes sense, since the apes are the weirder of the two groups - and Tim Burton specializes in weird. In regards to the human characters, Burton would've been better off making the humans in his version of "Planet of the Apes" more like the humans in the original film - mute. Apart from the protagonist Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), none of them add anything of import to the film anyway. The highlights of the individual actors come from mostly from the main characters. Tim Roth nails the part of villainous General Thade perfectly - he's one of the best sci-fi screen villains to appear on screen in quite awhile. Wahlberg plays Captain Leo Davidson in a manner similar to Heston in the original film; he's a man who's not terribly interested in contemplating how he arrived at a planet ruled by intelligent apes . . . he just knows he wants to leave. Fast. He's a pragmatic hero, one who reluctantly tries to help others in distress, but doesn't want to die in the process. Also worth mentioning is Paul Giamatti, who provides some much-needed comic relief as the peculiar orangutan slaver Limbo. On the other side of the acting coin, the biggest disappointment came from Helena Bonham Carter as Ari. Given the poor quality of her character in the screenplay, she does what she can for her character, but all she really does for the whole film is to go around being nice to humans. Period. Some reasons as to WHY Ari feels so passionately about helping humans would've been nice.Tim Burton's `Planet of the Apes' is an action movie that manages to take some of the influences of the original `Apes' films, and then creates something eccentric and new. Does it always work? No, although in general, the good outweighs the bad. Is it better than the original? Absolutely not. In a summer filled with blockbuster duds, though, there's something to be said for a film that provides some thrills and some fun, and the new `Planet of Apes' does exactly that. Overall, it's an enjoyable film; it's just not a spectacular one. Grade: B</fullReview>

Then things stopped making sense. Leo's big plan turned out to be a dud. The humans should have been wiped out. Then, even though the highly trained human pilot crashes not once, but twice, we are expected that the chimp pilot experiences none of the same problems and can land his pod without difficulty. Why does a cute chimp landing in a space craft make the apes suddenly believe that the humans aren't so bad after all?Then there's the stupid "suprise" ending. The whole movie is based on the premise that the smart apes evolved from genetic engineered apes that crash landed on the planet with the humans. So why are we supposed to suddenly believe that Leo would crash land in a second parallel world where Washington D.C. looks just like ours, but everybody is an ape instead of a human? This ending had nothing to do with the rest of the movie.It had potential, but it bombed instead.</fullReview>

However, when I went to see this, I was hoping, maybe even expecting, something intelligent that represented science fiction. However, this was not science fiction, and did not have an ounce of intelligence in its overly-long body. The movie is crap. It is dreck.First, I was not expecting the original. The original had a very '60s or hippy mindset about how humans destroyed the earth, and nature took over. That wouldn't go over now. So, I asked myself, what could they do to the movie to make it more modern. It seemed to me that they tried by making it be a metaphor for class wars, or political racism. But that was soon abandoned. Eventually it became the usual. A watered-down post-apocalyptic-like road movie (or escape, whatever).I was too busy searching for some sign of intelligence to tell you how the acting was (it could have been good, it could have been horrible). Visually it was stunning if you have to resort to that. And the score was wonderful (thanks Danny Elfman). But for the rest of the movie, skip it.

Maybe I wouldn't have found it so funny if I hadn't called it before it actually occurred.

And with police cars and everything, it kind of reminded me of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"'s ending. The Jefferson monument was a hark back to those cool cartoons where they would blow up Mt. Rushmore and it would turn into the villains face. Maybe I shouldn't be so judgemental, but that was the only redeeming part of the whole movie (and for all the wrong reasons).END SPOILERS2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a rarity - a review of POTA that's not a rave or a pan. Obviously it is a good-looking film, with terrific costumes, photography and make-up. It is also usually compelling storytelling - not Pierre Boulle's PLANET but not the original film either. Points for originality for sure. I like that the humans could speak - their lack of speech in the first film was never effectively explained. Even though the film is fleet, there is a noticable lull after Neil and company have successfully fled ape city. Burton wisely gets right on to the film's conclusion and (surprise) ending post haste. But while the story flies by, the character development is non-existant and the love story is divided between the female of TWO species. To be fair, our leading man is not the most compelling actor - but Heston was no Olivier either. The story has multiple holes - where did the horses come from anyway? There's no sign of any non-ape or human life except these equines but no clue is given as to why there are no other creatures about. The cameos by Heston and Harrison are badly handled though the refs to first film are fun for fans. The surprise ending manages to combine the shock of the original with the option for a sequel.Burton's film lacks the scope and epic feel of it's inspiration and it will doubtless join the LOST IN SPACE film on the rental shelves. Now if someone were to make Boulle's vision - that would be something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is a pretty good film but it had its ups and downs. The movie is about a astronaut named Leo (Mark Whalberg) who gets sucked into a portal and lands on a planet where apes rule. Tim Roth plays Thade, an army general who hates all humans. His right-hand man Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) follows and executes all of Thades orders. Leo escapes with the help of a compassionate ape named Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and is now a fugitive on the run from the apes. This movie I liked but I don't think was 100% perfect. I thought the make-up was not as good as the originals. The acting was pretty good by my standards. Like all Apes movies, the endings have to twist which this one did. Overall this movie was good, and recommend to sci-fi fans, but probably not to Apes fans because it really wasn't a remake in my book.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything you ever thought about the Planet of the Apes, is wrong! Tim Burton takes this story to a whole new level. The entire story is unique, the characters and set design, even the outstanding makeup, are Tim's signature. You have to see this movie, it actually makes you think a bit about the way humans conduct themselves. That's one thing I always liked about the original Planet films, they give you this unique view point on the human existence. However, this new version give an entirely out of this universe look on life, literally. You won't know what I mean unless you see this flick. Trust me, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please stop comparing. Wahlberg is 'Leo' not 'George'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note that Planet of the Apes (2001) is not a re-make of Planet of the Apes (1968). It's a re-telling of the story. And please look up the word "re-make", which in the context of "filmmaking", means "to make a film using the same story as that of an old film". To expand on that definition, it's means that in that same story, all the same characters are used like that of the original story, and the script is, more or less, the same. Examples of true re-makes include Sabrina and Psycho. POTA (2001) is not a re-make, because Mark Wahlberg's character was Leo Davidson, not Col. George Taylor. If 2001's version was supposed to be a re-make, you would see Tim Burton use the same characters, but he did not. So it not a re-make. Please stop comparing. Comparing 2001's POTA to 1968's POTA, is like comparing Tim Burton's Batman (1989) to 1966's Batman: The Movie!!!!!! They are not the same!!!!!!!! That's sound ridiculous!!!!!The title for both films are the same, but that's it...the plot is different, the characters are different....stop comparing....My review of Tim Burton's POTA is very positive. I was very impressed with this film. POTA (2001) was one of a few films I was willing to go see in a theatre this year, and I was not disappointed. Kudos to Burton and the cast and crew of POTA (2001). No need to make people understand the film, if they can't use their own heads. GO SEE POTA (2001) TODAY WITH AN OPEN MIND if you haven't seen it yet...OR SEE IT AGAIN, SO YOU WILL SEE THINGS YOU MISSED THE FIRST TIME AROUND, and enjoy it even more, like I did!!!Can't wait for the DVD for this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid the comparisons. Just enjoy it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people are angered about this film... it's quite obvious something is going on here.Mainly, the fact that, being a remake, this movie had to stand up to the original one. A huge risk that Tim Burton took, and seemingly, with bad consequences.I was born 6 years after Charlton Heston went bananas on the original. I have *never* seen it. Once it was on TV, and I lost interest after five minutes. Not because it was a bad film, mind you, but because it looked too dated for me to watch, and I was in that terrible phase known as "adolescence". It would have been uncool to watch a '68 movie. I will correct this mistake later, when I buy the original "Apes".Anyway, I came into the movie theater with only one image of the original movie forever burned in my mind: the epic Statue of Liberty climax. I purposely avoided all reviews of this film, so as not to spoil the fun. And I found myself deeply immersed in another Burton fantasy, where reality is as dark and grim as the lush landscapes that are always depicted in his worlds of madness. He is an expert in depicting outcasts (as in Batman, Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands), and although Mark Wahlberg wasn't as strong as Johnny Depp, Jack Skellington (or even Michael Keaton) as a main character, he was credible enough. Helena Bonham Carter is still incredibly seductive, even under tons of makeup and (gasp!) a beard. The rest of the characters are convincingly depicted, and the makeup excels.Again, not knowing the plot of the original, the only thing I disliked about this movie was that during the first half hour it dragged a bit. I guess that was due to the number of characters that were introduced. Afterwards, the movie turns quite philosophical (at least, IMHO). Was it directed at racism (which, from what I've seen, is still alive in the U.S.)? At animal cruelty? Was it a veiled message that we, as a thinking race, are doomed to remain evil and cruel with each other for all time? Or was Burton only trying to entertain us? (I doubt the last assumption). Whatever it is, this is one of those rare movies that open up a world of possibilities due to the use of metaphors. In a way, very similar to fairy tales, where the main character has to have enough resources to thrive and survive in a hostile environment...*SPOILER AHEAD* *SPOILER AHEAD* *SPOILER AHEAD* ...that is, unless you realize this is a mythic story and not a fairy tale, and that the ending has an amazing twist. One that, if sequels are avoided, could be one of the best endings in *ages*.Mr. Tim Burton, please, DON'T make a sequel, and you will have done a homage to the original series. The ending is just *perfect* as it is.I hope watching the original movie doesn't change my mind about this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a rarity - a review of POTA that's not a rave or a pan. Obviously it is a good-looking film, with terrific costumes, photography and make-up. It is also usually compelling storytelling - not Pierre Boulle's PLANET but not the original film either. Points for originality for sure. I like that the humans could speak - their lack of speech in the first film was never effectively explained. Even though the film is fleet, there is a noticable lull after Neil and company have successfully fled ape city. Burton wisely gets right on to the film's conclusion and (surprise) ending post haste. But while the story flies by, the character development is non-existant and the love story is divided between the female of TWO species. To be fair, our leading man is not the most compelling actor - but Heston was no Olivier either. The story has multiple holes - where did the horses come from anyway? There's no sign of any non-ape or human life except these equines but no clue is given as to why there are no other creatures about. The cameos by Heston and Harrison are badly handled though the refs to first film are fun for fans. The surprise ending manages to combine the shock of the original with the option for a sequel.Burton's film lacks the scope and epic feel of it's inspiration and it will doubtless join the LOST IN SPACE film on the rental shelves. Now if someone were to make Boulle's vision - that would be something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but nowhere near original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is a pretty good film but it had its ups and downs. The movie is about a astronaut named Leo (Mark Whalberg) who gets sucked into a portal and lands on a planet where apes rule. Tim Roth plays Thade, an army general who hates all humans. His right-hand man Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) follows and executes all of Thades orders. Leo escapes with the help of a compassionate ape named Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and is now a fugitive on the run from the apes. This movie I liked but I don't think was 100% perfect. I thought the make-up was not as good as the originals. The acting was pretty good by my standards. Like all Apes movies, the endings have to twist which this one did. Overall this movie was good, and recommend to sci-fi fans, but probably not to Apes fans because it really wasn't a remake in my book.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is definitely a good movie. No, it's not as good as the original of 1968, but it really is an entertaining movie. The make-up they used to create the illusion of apes being the dominant species is breathtaking and quite realistic looking. I'd say that's one of the strongest points of the film.As for the storyline, it is changed up from the original. In fact, it is a very different story all together. However, this does not change the fact that this is a good movie and I'm willing to bet just about anyone who goes to see it will like it too.You've probably all heard about the surprise ending (which isn't that much of a surprise... me and my friend managed to guess it right!) DOES make sense. Really, trust me it does. I don't know, certain people might look at it from certain and different angles... but I managed to come to the conclusion that no matter what time or planet your on, the apes still manage to evolve and overtake the humans. That may not make much sense to you if you haven't seen the movie, but it will.All in all, I do recommend seeing this movie. I went to see it with my friends and we all agree it was a good movie. I think it has both funny moments and interesting ones... but don't expect a drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ending (Obviously, Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I really enjoyed this movie. As remakes go, I thought it was done well. It did justice to the original, while changing enough of the story to make it unique on its own. As for the ending, when I read through the other comments posted on this site, I realized that many people did not understand it or they have alternate explanations to what I believe. Unfortunately, these other explanations do not make sense. Therefore, I will explain the ending to clear it up. First of all, and this is the most important fact, the planet that Mark Wahlberg crash lands on is not Earth. The whole story and everything that happens on this planet is a separate issue from what has happened on Earth when he returns. When he does return, he finds that Earth is now controlled by apes, obviously leading us to the question of how it happened. Well, we are given the most important piece of information to understand this, the statue of General Thade. We then know that he is the one who led the apes to the control of the planet. The next question would be how he accomplished this task. Well, he must first get to Earth in order to affect any change there. And the only way to get to another planet is to fly there in a ship. What ship? The one that Mark Wahlberg crashed in and the one that General Thade knows all about. How will he fly or learn to fly it? The chimp pilot that is left on his planet. So basically, here it is. General Thade is alive when we last see him. He escapes or maybe just pretends to accept the changes that have occurred on his planet. In order to flee the planet and perhaps to get some revenge against the human who changed his world, he salvages the ship from the water, somehow repairs it, assuming it needs to be repaired, since all we know for sure is that it had a rough landing, and then learns to fly it with the help, possibly by force of the chimp pilot. He travels back along the same route as Mark Wahlberg and enters the storm. He is transported back in time, but farther back then Mark Wahlberg. Once there, he leads a rebellion of apes on Earth against humanity and wins. That's it. It is simple and makes perfect sense and contradicts nothing we saw in the movie. And it is not even a new idea. If you have watched the old movies, and have seen "Escape from the Planet of the Apes," you will remember that the apes got to Earth in almost the identical way. They salvaged Charlton Heston's ship from the water, somehow repaired it and learned to fly it and returned back in time to Earth. I actually think that is part of the reason this ending was used; as a throwback to one of the elements of the old movies. Of course, this ending is a stretch to the imagination, but this is science fiction and the fact that it is possible is all that is required. If you have watched the old Planet of the Apes movies, you will know that the stories stretched the line of believability even thinner. This ending also adds the irony that is needed in these types of stories. Mark Wahlberg changes the course of history on another world and then leaves to go back to his own, but is thwarted by General Thade, who basically does the same thing to his world. Now he is stuck on Earth in an even worse environment then the one he wanted so badly to leave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot to admire about the remake, and a lot to hate.It's an admirable attempt at a re-imagination of the saga but, please - why, oh why, were certain scenes played for laughs?The underlying story is so intrinsically interesting that surely it warranted a serious approach.

		<shortDescription>Comparison to original luckily stops at the first credit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I too caught that AMC Planet of the Apes festival back in 1998 and learned the whole, convoluted chronology of the original series. I also learned that somehow, apes just learned to talk on their own, a lot like evolving, but maintained their hunched appearance and brutish looks. You couldn't call the original series science fiction, because it wasn't really based on science. In fact, in order to really enjoy any of the original films, you had to forgive a lot of fuzzy logic.This new "revisioning" of the original film makes a whole lot more sense of how apes learned to talk and walk upright and possess all those "human" qualities without having any overt explanation scene. It just makes sense on its own if you really think about it. You don't have to though.Anyway, Mark Wahlberg proves again that he was never supposed to be a hip hop star and acts his way very effectively through this pretty darned intelligent film. First off, leave it to Tim Burton to make comedic yet emotionally trying jabs at bestiality. If you see the film, you'll see what I mean. Secondly, we see how operatic life in politics can be, and still be fun.Tim Roth leads a tremendous supporting cast of action movie veterans. Of course, you won't recognize any of them through the amazing make-up. The action is amazing, and artfull while the story moves at a locomotive pace.Honestly, this movie never stops. And we all expected a big twist ending, better than the original, but instead, we get a twist ending with such a huge sequel come-on that I almost vomitted. The ending manages to work, come out of left field, and tickle you pink, all at once. I was either elated or nauseous, I can't decide. Overall, a really good film. Better than the original, possibly. The 68 classic had no limitations as to how high morally it could reach. So this new revisioning decides to change gears. Don't walk in expecting a social commentary. Walk in expecting a summer rollercoaster ride with a seemingly infinite shelf life. Your grandkids will be asking you if you actually saw it in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not going to comment on this piece of stylistic dreck. Then I saw reviews from some folks who claimed that the movie was actually quite clever and people who disliked it were clearly not paying attention to the details. So, I carefully rethought the major plot points (there are few, so this was easy), and have a few spoiler type comments. Perhaps those who have not seen the movie yet can bone up on these thoughts and then see if I am still missing something.1) The monkeys in the beginning are genetically engineered to be smart, so that is why they were able to become dominant on the planet....OK, so one little chimpanzee crash lands on a planet with no monkeys. A whole bunch of years later, this chimp has not only acted like a plant seed and sired lots of other monkeys (of different species, no less) without sex or other monkeys to mate with. That IS intelligent. But wait, there WAS something about the 'crashed' mother ship that the hero finds on the planet...maybe our hero mated with those, but no, they are dead by the time he arrives. So maybe the apes on the planet came from the monkeys on the mother ship instead. This is lots better! It could explain how they turned into gibbons, gorillas, orangutans, and every kind of ape EXCEPT chimps, and this in a very few years. I guess that they were genetically engineered to evolve in amazing ways too. I could go on and debunk every argument I have seen for any part of this making sense, but I don't have all day. The plot in this regard is pure nonsense, and that is pretty much it.2) Humans had developed genetically engineered monkeys on Earth, and these clearly had also taken over, so the hero returns to Earth and finds out that they have become dominant there too. Well, I seem to have missed how this would change Abraham Lincoln into a monkey. Perhaps the symbology was just too extreme and the Old Abe thing a bit overboard. OK, then how did the Earth ape culture know the name of the general on that other planet to celebrate him? It was pretty clear that the hero's mother ship was not near Earth, but maybe the time warp ALSO send him back to Earth as well. Or not. The coincidences really need to pile up for this to even begin to be plausible. And since the film makers did not contrive the plot development to demonstrate any such path of reasoning, I don't think THEY actually had thought it through either. They just came up with a stupid and unsupported twist for the end of the movie. If you really need for the movie to make sense in order to enjoy it, then go ahead and rationalize meanings to your heart's content.3) By the way, it was pretty realistic that a huge and obviously orbital-space-only mother ship was able to land on a planet at all, much less intact. Enough so that the apes and humans on board could survive to populate another planet. Enough so that the engine(s) still work after so many years. Right.4) It was pretty clever for the film makers to suddenly let a tiny shuttle craft become capable of interstellar travel. Even WITH time warps, etc.The upshot is, this movie has no real level of excitement, no plot worth mentioning, no character development, no internal logic, unreliable presentation of core 'facts' to the audience, and precious little entertainment value. The money makeup was pretty decent though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been so often disappointed in the past going into movies with high expectations: Indianna Jones and the Last Crusade, Phantom Menance, Batman, to name a few. So I suppose my learned skepticism somewhat saved Planet of the Apes for me. I had absolutely no expectations for this film, after having enjoyed the first one so much. And of course, the new version does not live up to the original. The original was filled with layers of political, racial, and sociological themes; and it had an incredible ending. And who can match the tortured, almost humorous essence of Heston. Oh, and it was fun too. But the greatness of the original does not make the new version a bad movie. In fact, it was in my opinion quite an enjoyable movie. It surpasses the original in terms of its visual effects. While the theme/story is more simplistic, it is very well told; it moves very fast and fluidly, yet is not so packed with chaotic action (see Armageddon) that it does not allow for slower moments that can be saviored. For example, there is a great scene with Heston in a cameo. I wonder if he knew what he was saying when he said it: humans are deceptive and dangerous and are even more so because they have guns; beware of them? Not exactly the NRA's mantra. Anyways, he had a great cameo. There are many other humorous moments as well. Basically, the movie did not take itself seriously. It tipped its hat to the original without trying to mimick its feel. It is obvious Burton wanted to have some fun with this movie, paying tribute to the original while at the same time trying to give this movie its own unique perspective. I believe he succeeded and I believe that that is the movie's saving grace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrible dialogue, average acting. At times, boring. But...a lot of apes screaming and yelling and generally acting like a bunch of monkees. Now that made my day! Some questions:1. Where did the buxom blonde human find such a great plastic surgeon on that god-forsaken planet? And how did she always manage to wear make-up, even after going for a couple swims?2. Did anyone else find it a tad unfair that Mark Wahlberg stole the chimp's spaceship? I mean, after all this hubbub about apes and men living together in equality, the brash spaceman learns nothing and leaves the chimp behind!3. Didn't you wonder whether those soldier apes were stolen from the Klingons? I was waiting for Picard and Worf to emerge...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes remake - it's not good. Too much dialogue that elicits groans, plot elements that don't make sense, poor acting, wooden dialogue, predictable "surprises" at the end. It's obvious that no one connected with this movie had much respect for the original series or for any intelligent member of the audience. On the plus side - the sets were fabulous, the ape costumes great. Some individual scenes were quite striking. Filmed in the dark, with the Dolby soundtrack cranked up to 11. See it in the theatre at matinee prices so you can get the full benefit of the special effects which is about all that is worth watching anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie! Questionable Ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is well worth seeing, for the story, for the special effects, and for the apes (which are fantastic!)...but, be forewarned, you won't understand the ending. The only good thing that I can say about it: it definitely causes a lot of discussion, with many different interpretations.Truth be known...we will only be able to judge the ending by the sequel. There is no doubt they have tried to set one up, and, I can think of one that would fit...one that would be brilliant. But, somehow, I don't have faith that Hollywood could be quite that creative. I hope so...but, if they are, I will be greatly surprised. And, I really can't figure out how they could make my idea work and still stay true to the movie.If they don't do a sequel, or if they do a lame one, this movie will be added to my list of Great Movies with Terrible Endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending just ruined it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Tim Burton has shown in the past that the aesthetic and his love for 1950's B films are the predominant factors in how he goes about his work, and this time it was the latter that ruined that work for me. Time and again, Burton has disregarded the entire concept of suspension of disbelief, and that's fine, but when the end of your film is as ludicrous as that of the new Planet of the Apes, it makes one forget the positives the film may have presented. Not as good as the original (what remakes are?), I found everything in the film to be 'acceptable', even some of the cheesier heroic scenes from the Wahlberg character, but the ending just went too far. That drastically changed my impressions of the film, which I was thinking of as a 5 or a 6 until the finale reduced it to a 3. Wait for HBO: You won't be missing much.</fullReview>

While going into space to find Pericles the Chimpanzee, he is transported via time ward to a dark and mysterious planet where simians are the masters and humans the slaves. Pericles the chimpanzee lands on this globe and is revered as a deity. The simians accept humans as their equals. Wahlberg is again caught in the same time warp , and reversed, only to find out the awful truth about The Planet of The Apes!

I don't think the characters were as shallow as has been said, and frankly, I am not embarrassed to admit that General Thade scared the bejeezus outta me.

		<fullReview>This film is quite horrible... I can't believe they've made so much hype about that! The plot follows no logic. It seems that the writer stopped the film at that point so he'll have two more years or so to make the story sounds logical. The end is so pathetical that looks like a comedy and not a sci-fi adventure. It's bad directed, things are just thrown away and the scenes have no elaboration. The camera work is nothing but elementary, and, also, the make-up of the female monkeys looks fake and unreal. A real class on how to NOT make a film. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maybe the best movie of the summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when i went to see this movie with a group of my friends, my expectations were low. I figured it would be a cheesy ripoff of the first, since i already knew it had little to do with the original. i also used to like mark wahlberg in movies like three kings and the perfect storm, but the more i see him in interviews and in public, the more i wished his career died with the funky bunch. however, this movie was a very pleasent surprise. The make up was incredible, especially when you take into consideration the massive cast who all needed to be made into apes. i was also impressed with the way the actors who were portraying the ape characters moved and acted like the real animals. also, i was able to put mark wahlberg's over-all annoying behavior when he's off camera aside, and really enjoy him in this movie. the only thing i didn't really buy was the relationship between mark wahlberg and estela warren, who plays a very hot slave woman, human of course. towards the end of the movie you get the feeling that there is supposed to be a deep meaningful relationship between them, that simply wasn't built up enough. the only other low point was when mark wahlberg kisses the ape woman who has been helping them. this was supposed to be a very sensitive part of the movie, but the audience on hand that day responded with a resounding "EEEEWWWWWWW!!!" One of my friends even yelled, "GO FOR THE BLONDE!"(Warren) No one laughed at his joke but everyone felt the same way. the best part of this movie was the ending, which i would never give away. but i will say it meets, and nearly outdoes, the original ending. with all of the big summer dissapointments i've seen in the last few months, Planet of the Apes was easily worth the money, do yourself a favor and see it.9/10 stars or if you go by the four star rating: 3 1/2 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK ... so it wasn't the best movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went to see Planet of The Apes at the Cinerama theatre here in Seattle (nice giant 65ft screen, wicked sound system, etc ...)I think that all I can really say is that this movie was no academy award winning piece of art, however it wasn't the terrible production that people make it out to be here in the user comment section of IMDB.Of course, like all the other crud coming out of Hollywood, this film was definitely aimed at the dumber bunch of us humans ... i.e. the lowest common denominator, then again it is a summer popcorn movie.Anyway, I enjoyed this movie for what it was ... simple fun.Now, having read many if not almost all of the comments posted here, let me answer a few things that people have been asking and in most cases incorectly answering. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!1) Time &amp; Place / Where &amp; When: The film begins in an orbit around/near Saturn in 2029. Mark Wahlberg's character goes through the "storm" and gets booted to about 2329 (according to the ship's computer) and crashes into an uncharted planet with multiple moons ... in close proximity to a number of other planets which in no way resembles our solar system (past or present)... i.e. it is not Earth.2) Mark Wahlberg's spaceship: There is no way that anyone on the ape planet could salvage the ship. a) no technology available b) ship's electrical system is fried (that's why it crashes) and what wasn't destroyed on planetary-entry was surely destroyed while underwater c) the pod crash-landed on a planet. its broken. d) the capsule's window/door was blown off by explosive bolts e) its under water f) nobody knows how to fly it (well except for the Pericles ... but I don't think he is going anywhere soon)3) The "ancient" gun: General Thade's lineage was said numerous times to lead directly back to the progenitor of their current species. The ape that killed most, if not all of the humans after the crash ... who killed them with a gun.5) The Oberon wreck: 1) We did not know when the Oberon crashed into the planet, but since the storm was messing up their systems (remember the power going out?) it is safe to say that the station was pulled into the vortex so to speak. It probably got kicked backwards quite a bit. Remember, the pods went through numerous time-jumps becasue they were powered and had lots of forward momentum. So, the ship crashes way way in the past on the same planet that Mark Wahlberg lands on in the future. Apes escape and continue evolving ... (it is possible that there were other animal species (maybe not horses) on the station (it was afteral quite large) like Gorillas, etc ...) Station has three fuel tanks (2 empty and 1 full) and a nuclear powered electrical system ... which seemed to be shut down until Mark Wahlberg's character reactivated it. He said it would keep its power for 1000 years or so ... but if it was turned off ... well who knows. As for the ship surviving at all ... who knows. It seemed to be in the desert (dry air preserves things) and it was in the "forbidden zone" so it wasn't messed with so it could have lasted a long time in its current state.6) When the ape's attack and they start the main engine, it is highly probable that most of the apes would have survived ... albeit badly burned becasue the engine exhaust was not pointed parallel to the ground, but rather upwards at an angle ... the point of the tactic was not to kill but more to confuse/scare the apes.7) Thade is doomed. He cannot escape the ship's control room for a number of reasons: a) the only hand that can open the door left the planet. b) considering the glass wall/door survived impact from space into a planet without breaking probably means nothing on the planet is going to do the trick c) nobody likes him8) Someone asked why he was in such a hurry to get home? Well, would you want to stay in a primitive world when you had the opportunity to go home to all that you know and loved?9) When Mark Wahlberg's character re-enter's the storm, he clearly re-arrives back in the orbit of saturn and he clearly sets course for earth where he crashes. The chronometer on his computer display also indicates that he is back to 2020 something or other ...If anything is true ... I would have to say that when they jumped in time and space they also jumped realities. Saturn = mystery planet Present = way in the future Humanverse = apeverseon the return trip, he didn't manage to jump back from apeverse &gt; humanverse although he did get the time and space parts correctNow for my personal issues with the logic:1) Where did the horses come from2) If the original apes killed the remaining crew from the space station, where did all of the humans come from (remember humans purportedly outnumbered the ape population)3) If the humans are also descendants from the space station, and the apes evolved along with them, wouldn't the resultant society have been a bit more egalitarian?4) if the ape's planet really was a "mirror" to our own ... shouldn't all of the politicians have been humans?Well that's my take on this film ... again ... you can't go into summer event movies expecting anything to be really good ... you just have to enjoy films like these for what they are ... mindless entertainment (that costs $200 million or so to produce)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original story re-imagined. Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When 'The Haunting' flopped at the box office while the ultra-low budget 'Blair Witch Project' became all the rage, it was a prime example of how the most sophisticated high-tech special effects don't guarantee a good remake of a classic movie (or, for that matter, any other movie). Consequently, I expected much the same when I heard of the 'Planet of the Apes' remake: today's advanced effects, prettier actors perhaps, and essentially expensive rehash. Tim Burton's version of the classic epic is a pleasant surprise. Sure enough, the movie does have dazzling special effects--the most impressive beyond a single doubt Rick Baker's ape makeup. And the actor's are, for the most part, new-millennium pretty (even some of the apes). But the story has also been completely and compellingly re-imagined and re-created. This is a new tale which has little in common with the original movie except that they are both based on Pierre Boulle's book--and that they are both excellent. The attention to (often hilarious) detail in Tim Burton's movie is delightful, and for those who remember the original 'Planet of the Apes' well enough, there are also a few pleasantly twisted nods to the classic to discover. The story moves along at a brisk pace and never fails to involve, making the movie seem shorter than it is, and the plot surprises in intelligent ways during the final part of the action. Another wonderful thing to observe is how well the makeup allows the actors behind it to bring their characters to life. While the masks in the original films were impressive, they allowed for little more than moving mouths and the occasional twitching nose. The masks in the new movie, on the other hand, accommodate a seemingly unlimited range of facial expressions. It takes more imagination to picture that there are human faces behind the makeup than it does to accept the simian characters as genuine. This new 'Planet of the Apes' is indeed not a remake, but an original movie based on the same novel that inspired the first one. A strong story, solid characters, AND amazing special effects, that's the stuff the 'suspense of disbelief' is made of. Let's just hope it won't suffer from the same sequel-itis as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Burton cheese (spoilers, maybe)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much I can add that others already haven't. This is a typical Burton movie where story is sacrificed to visuals. There is barely enough story to provide an excuse for all the lush visuals to exist.The movie is entertaining enough, but why does nobody give a crap about script anymore? This movie could have been so much more but its only real contribution is to advance ape make-up technology. It's not a movie I'm anxious to see again; very few films made these days seem to have that quality.All the various flaws in the film have been pointed out already, but there is one thing I'd like to address and that's the question of female chimpanzees being the sexually dominant one. First off, why introduce this "fact" if it's not going to be explored? Second, it's not correct. There is an offshoot of the chimpanzee, the bonobo, (which tends to walk upright as often as not) where the female is more dominant, but in the main species (the one which scoots around on all fours), the male chimp rules the roost and I don't think this film was cognizant of bonobos or much of anything else, for that matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to the original, it has much better effects, much more realistic looking scenes and ape-suits. But the story just falls flat.Essentially, the story runs along so darn quickly that the hero never seems to stop and think. He never considers options, he never hesitates for a moment, and he never takes a wrong turn. As a result, the audience never stops to think, or worry, or wonder.Because the story is racing, the characters are never developed.What we want is: a roller coaster ride, where riders are hurled and twisted and turned and jerked around, with lofty highs and gut-sinking lows.What we get is: a rocket ride, shooting at a target 2 miles away, straight ahead, with the end always in sight and closing quickly.It's okay, but not great. I was left longing for Charlton Heston's (the original film) agonizing, pondering gaze. We *FELT* him struggling with the situation. We felt his pain. Not so here.It's a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my most anticipated film of the year and I was not disappointed. Like many others, I have been a huge fan of the original Planet of the Apes since I first saw it in 1968 and had great misgivings about a remake. Once I learned that Tim Burton was to direct I knew that I would be seeing something wonderful. There isn't any other director around today that I would have picked to make this film. I was also delighted to learn that he was not just remaking but re-imagining the entire story which opened up huge possibilities. The result is an exciting, rousing adventure with thought-provoking ideals that set it apart most of the bang and blow-up action films put out today. It manages to keep many of the elements of the original that made it so enduring while adding new twists to the story. The make-up by Rick Baker is astounding. Certainly his best work to date. The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Helena Bonham-Carter, Tim Roth and Paul Giamatti. This film must be seen on the big screen. I'll certainly be seeing it again at least once if not more.</fullReview>

The make up was incredible, especially when you take into consideration the massive cast who all needed to be made into apes. i was also impressed with the way the actors who were portraying the ape characters moved and acted like the real animals. also, i was able to put mark wahlberg's over-all annoying behavior when he's off camera aside, and really enjoy him in this movie. the only thing i didn't really buy was the relationship between mark wahlberg and estela warren, who plays a very hot slave woman, human of course. towards the end of the movie you get the feeling that there is supposed to be a deep meaningful relationship between them, that simply wasn't built up enough. the only other low point was when mark wahlberg kisses the ape woman who has been helping them. this was supposed to be a very sensitive part of the movie, but the audience on hand that day responded with a resounding "EEEEWWWWWWW!!!" One of my friends even yelled, "GO FOR THE BLONDE!"(Warren) No one laughed at his joke but everyone felt the same way. the best part of this movie was the ending, which i would never give away. but i will say it meets, and nearly outdoes, the original ending. with all of the big summer dissapointments i've seen in the last few months, Planet of the Apes was easily worth the money, do yourself a favor and see it.9/10 stars or if you go by the four star rating: 3 1/2 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK ... so it wasn't the best movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went to see Planet of The Apes at the Cinerama theatre here in Seattle (nice giant 65ft screen, wicked sound system, etc ...)I think that all I can really say is that this movie was no academy award winning piece of art, however it wasn't the terrible production that people make it out to be here in the user comment section of IMDB.Of course, like all the other crud coming out of Hollywood, this film was definitely aimed at the dumber bunch of us humans ... i.e. the lowest common denominator, then again it is a summer popcorn movie.Anyway, I enjoyed this movie for what it was ... simple fun.Now, having read many if not almost all of the comments posted here, let me answer a few things that people have been asking and in most cases incorectly answering. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!1) Time &amp; Place / Where &amp; When: The film begins in an orbit around/near Saturn in 2029. Mark Wahlberg's character goes through the "storm" and gets booted to about 2329 (according to the ship's computer) and crashes into an uncharted planet with multiple moons ... in close proximity to a number of other planets which in no way resembles our solar system (past or present)... i.e. it is not Earth.2) Mark Wahlberg's spaceship: There is no way that anyone on the ape planet could salvage the ship. a) no technology available b) ship's electrical system is fried (that's why it crashes) and what wasn't destroyed on planetary-entry was surely destroyed while underwater c) the pod crash-landed on a planet. its broken. d) the capsule's window/door was blown off by explosive bolts e) its under water f) nobody knows how to fly it (well except for the Pericles ... but I don't think he is going anywhere soon)3) The "ancient" gun: General Thade's lineage was said numerous times to lead directly back to the progenitor of their current species. The ape that killed most, if not all of the humans after the crash ... who killed them with a gun.5) The Oberon wreck: 1) We did not know when the Oberon crashed into the planet, but since the storm was messing up their systems (remember the power going out?) it is safe to say that the station was pulled into the vortex so to speak. It probably got kicked backwards quite a bit. Remember, the pods went through numerous time-jumps becasue they were powered and had lots of forward momentum. So, the ship crashes way way in the past on the same planet that Mark Wahlberg lands on in the future. Apes escape and continue evolving ... (it is possible that there were other animal species (maybe not horses) on the station (it was afteral quite large) like Gorillas, etc ...) Station has three fuel tanks (2 empty and 1 full) and a nuclear powered electrical system ... which seemed to be shut down until Mark Wahlberg's character reactivated it. He said it would keep its power for 1000 years or so ... but if it was turned off ... well who knows. As for the ship surviving at all ... who knows. It seemed to be in the desert (dry air preserves things) and it was in the "forbidden zone" so it wasn't messed with so it could have lasted a long time in its current state.6) When the ape's attack and they start the main engine, it is highly probable that most of the apes would have survived ... albeit badly burned becasue the engine exhaust was not pointed parallel to the ground, but rather upwards at an angle ... the point of the tactic was not to kill but more to confuse/scare the apes.7) Thade is doomed. He cannot escape the ship's control room for a number of reasons: a) the only hand that can open the door left the planet. b) considering the glass wall/door survived impact from space into a planet without breaking probably means nothing on the planet is going to do the trick c) nobody likes him8) Someone asked why he was in such a hurry to get home? Well, would you want to stay in a primitive world when you had the opportunity to go home to all that you know and loved?9) When Mark Wahlberg's character re-enter's the storm, he clearly re-arrives back in the orbit of saturn and he clearly sets course for earth where he crashes. The chronometer on his computer display also indicates that he is back to 2020 something or other ...If anything is true ... I would have to say that when they jumped in time and space they also jumped realities. Saturn = mystery planet Present = way in the future Humanverse = apeverseon the return trip, he didn't manage to jump back from apeverse &gt; humanverse although he did get the time and space parts correctNow for my personal issues with the logic:1) Where did the horses come from2) If the original apes killed the remaining crew from the space station, where did all of the humans come from (remember humans purportedly outnumbered the ape population)3) If the humans are also descendants from the space station, and the apes evolved along with them, wouldn't the resultant society have been a bit more egalitarian?4) if the ape's planet really was a "mirror" to our own ... shouldn't all of the politicians have been humans?Well that's my take on this film ... again ... you can't go into summer event movies expecting anything to be really good ... you just have to enjoy films like these for what they are ... mindless entertainment (that costs $200 million or so to produce)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original story re-imagined. Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When 'The Haunting' flopped at the box office while the ultra-low budget 'Blair Witch Project' became all the rage, it was a prime example of how the most sophisticated high-tech special effects don't guarantee a good remake of a classic movie (or, for that matter, any other movie). Consequently, I expected much the same when I heard of the 'Planet of the Apes' remake: today's advanced effects, prettier actors perhaps, and essentially expensive rehash. Tim Burton's version of the classic epic is a pleasant surprise. Sure enough, the movie does have dazzling special effects--the most impressive beyond a single doubt Rick Baker's ape makeup. And the actor's are, for the most part, new-millennium pretty (even some of the apes). But the story has also been completely and compellingly re-imagined and re-created. This is a new tale which has little in common with the original movie except that they are both based on Pierre Boulle's book--and that they are both excellent. The attention to (often hilarious) detail in Tim Burton's movie is delightful, and for those who remember the original 'Planet of the Apes' well enough, there are also a few pleasantly twisted nods to the classic to discover. The story moves along at a brisk pace and never fails to involve, making the movie seem shorter than it is, and the plot surprises in intelligent ways during the final part of the action. Another wonderful thing to observe is how well the makeup allows the actors behind it to bring their characters to life. While the masks in the original films were impressive, they allowed for little more than moving mouths and the occasional twitching nose. The masks in the new movie, on the other hand, accommodate a seemingly unlimited range of facial expressions. It takes more imagination to picture that there are human faces behind the makeup than it does to accept the simian characters as genuine. This new 'Planet of the Apes' is indeed not a remake, but an original movie based on the same novel that inspired the first one. A strong story, solid characters, AND amazing special effects, that's the stuff the 'suspense of disbelief' is made of. Let's just hope it won't suffer from the same sequel-itis as the original.</fullReview>

Burton applied the same visionary treatment that he gave to "Batman" and "Sleepy Hollow" to this movie, and the results are breathtaking, to say the least.

		<shortDescription>This is bad science fiction, and a wasted opportunity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Warning contains vague spoilers, but nothing specific*I liked Aliens. I did not like Independence Day. I liked Contact. I did not like Red Planet. I liked the original Planet of the Apes. I did not like Planet of the Apes (2001), not even a little.From the opening of the movie until the end, I found the cinematography to be amatuer, I was never able to get into the movie as it appeared fake, a movie set.Not one human character in the movie could act, with the male and female human leads being horrible actors (Mark W. and Estella W.) and badly cast. The worst scenes in the movie are when these two are together, she in her "just from the salon" hairdo and inflated lips, and he with his immature camera presence nearly made me groan out loud when they were on screen together.The human characters were all over the place with a polished butler and maid, a grizzled old bushman, an african-american with face-scar tatoos, and the hot babe, all speaking perfect English that they learned in their tribal villages in the mountains...The only two actors of note in the movie, Tim Roth (as the Chimpanzee General Thade) and Michael Clarke Duncan (as the Gorilla Commander Attar) were quite good, with great fierceness and expression, but their excellent performances only showed the flawed performances of the other actors, even Helena Bonham Carter (as Ari the Chimpanzee Humanist) performed poorly in this movie.The makeup I heard so much about was very good for the ape males, but I found the ape female makeup to be far inferior and distracted me from their characters so much that I could not enjoy watching them.Many times during this movie I wanted to groan out loud, especially at the ridiculous events that completely ignored science and probability. Humans randomly running through ape quarters kept bumping into every character you had met previously, how convenient. Two spacecraft getting hit by random time distortions show up at the same time in the future. Apes killing apes without remorse, even hundreds at a time.The ending is just plain stupid, won't mention it here but most people walking out of the theater hated the "surprise" ending. A surprise ending is supposed to have been foreshadowed during the movie, this ending was just pulled out of someone's rear for shock value.Rating: 1 Star out of 5Some good recent movies to see: Memento, Sexy Beast, Snatch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected so much from this movie. I was very excited to go see it, and I hoped that this would be the one good movie this year, after a long, long list of absolutely TERRIBLE movies for 2000. Of course, it did not break the trend. This movie was just as terrible as all the other over-hyped crap that came out this year. SPOILER ALERTA little warning here: I am going to reveal the ending. But it is of no consequence because the movie is total garbage and the ending makes no sense, so when you see the movie for yourself you wont even care how it ends, you will just be hoping that it DOES end!A laundry list of complaints: The script has too many holes in it to be forgiven. There is WAY too much dialogue. So much so, this movie cannot be considered an action movie. I almost fell asleep! The make up for the apes was not as great as everybody makes it out to be, and the actors have a really hard time spitting out their boring lines with those big, prosthetic teeth in their mouths. Its very distracting. The acting is poor and the sets are TOTALLY CHEAP! The Monkey City looks like something out of the Pirate Tour at Disney Land. I mean REALLY CHEAP! There is no edge to the movie. The viewer should keep in mind that this movie was rated PG-13. There is very little violence, and when a character does die, the camera conveniently cuts away to something less disturbing, giving the movie a very "MADE FOR TV" feel. I mean it looks like something slopped together by the Sci-Fi Channel. Humans should have been getting ripped in half like so many phone books at a strong man contest. But they weren't. Also, Tim Roth's character of General Thade was acted well, but he had nothing to work with! He was supposed to be the big, evil protagonist. But in the movie, we never see him do anything all that evil. Instead, he just grimaces in an evil way and hops around a lot when he gets mad. By the way, there is a lot of unbelievable jumping in the movie. It looks terrible, you can almost see the wires and the harnesses on the actors. It does not look like they are jumping at all, but SWINGING through the air. At the end we discover that all these stupid apes evolved from the experiment apes on board the crashed space station. But there are MANY species of apes inhabiting the world, and there were ONLY chimpanzees on the space station! This is ONE of many, many plot holes in the movie that are just unforgivable. Then, at the end, the little chimp flies his space pod down to the planet and makes a PERFECT three point landing and then hops out like a little pro. Marky Mark INSTANTLY jumps in to the SAME exact pod and flies off to space and then tries to land it, but totally crashes it for NO explained reason. Is the chimp a better pilot than Marky Mark? HOW STUPID!After CRASHING his perfectly good space pod, Marky Mark discovers that he is on a planet just like Earth, but again, totally ruled by Apes. And he sees the "Lincoln" memorial, and there is a statue of General Thade with a STUPID Lincoln like hair do. The ending makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all and it was the final down point to an already over-long, boring, and under-achieving film. These are just a few of the glaring plot holes in the script. Doesn't anybody proof read scripts in Hollywood anymore? I hated this movie, I was disappointed by this movie, I was BORED by this movie, and I strongly, STRONGLY recommend that you do not see this poor waste of celluloid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, Tim, you've done it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who has seen the original "Planet" movie, this must have been quite a giggle, as it was for both my husband and I when we went with our children.Great movie! Truly loved that fact that Tim took the old story and gave it a totally new look and meaning.Make-up aside, the actors must have worked quite hard with someone who knew primates of varying "classes," and while I have to admit that I was hard-pressed to believe "interspecies relationships," considering the various mixed marriages of humans, why not primates?Someone stated they didn't like the movie because the primates couldn't swim across the water. Ever do any research? It's true, they don't swim; they sink and drown. And anyone who has ever been to the zoo should ask the keepers about the accuracy of some of the primates with various "missiles" such as food or feces. They are DARNED accurate! :)I loved that Tim used people from the original movie! Anyone notice Charleton Heston? Or that he was anti-gun? What a blow to the NRA! :)I loved Tim's use of action, movement, reality, fear, emotion and just plain FUN throughout the whole show.Perhaps some of the people who really didn't like the movie should go once more, with a very open mind, and see the movie for what it is: an excellent story of what COULD be, WILL be, or WAS...Grade from our family: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes... I highly recommend you spend your money on something else. It was insulting, predictable and pathetic.Good Points. The opening titles.Bad Points. The quasi-science was just plain ignorant and hard to follow. Where was he? On Saturn? On Earth? And I thought Star Trek was bad with "Using the forward deflector array to spew gravo-metric techno-trash gibberish!" Just blame it all on an "electro-magnetic storm " or a "quantum sigularity tear in space-time" syndrome.The old plot was a masterpiece. Burton tried to impose a new plot but it was not creative enough to be thought provoking or intelligent in the least. His allusions to the old film were obvious and over-used.NOT A SPOILER: But what most really really really sucked - TIM BURTON'S SURPRISE ENDING!! The ending was not only bad, wrong in so many ways, but really inappropriate. It just wasn't funny (except maybe to Burton). It was an insult to audience, Charlton Heston and the makers of the first movie. Actually, Wasn't this ending already in a Simpson's episode!In all, a disappointment. Especially since he had such a unique opportunity to do something really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Damn Them All to Hell !"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new installment to the "Planet of the Apes" saga is a skillfully made film. It combines a new adaptation to the familiar story of the original. However, it is by no means a remake. The new movie has some very striking similarities, but is a new and different film. This "Planet of the Apes" uses enough of the now famous content, that made the original great, to sell it to the older fans, as well as a new story to win over a younger generation which would not properly understand the social gripping message of the 60's version. This film is clearly Tim Burton's best work. The cast does a very good job, especially considering all of the makeup. Charlton Heston steals the show as Gen. Thade's father, proving once again that no one does a "Planet of the Apes" film like Mr. Heston. Despite the overall excellent nature of this film, it is flawed in one major aspect. This film has no star quality. No offense to Mark Wahlberg, but he is not capable of carrying a summer blockbuster by himself. Mr. Wahlberg is a fine up and coming actor, but he has not yet reached the point in his career (and maybe never will) where he can open a film by himself, let alone a major film such as "Planet of the Apes". Wahlberg tries his best to play the reluctant hero, but the key word is "tries". He lacks the major presence that Charlton Heston provided in the original. Wahlberg is unable to sell himself as an "action star". His lines are not believable, and are quite commonplace. In order for such a film to have been properly done it would have required a big time action star. That star could only have been Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose name was mentioned for the Wahlberg role. His presence in the film would have made a big summer hit into a mega summer blockbuster. Just imagine Arnold delievering the lines "I'll be back..you dirty apes!" If the casting directors have any sense they will make sure that Arnold is back when they make the sequel. Despite all of this it was still a very entertaining film. 3.5 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: I will be talking about the ending, and possibly some other events that may "ruin" it for you. Just so you know.Yes, the script was bad, no charater development, useless people (Warren). most of those are talked about in the other reviews.Yes, as I said before the script is pretty bad, but some things can be the actor's fault. Some of mark's (leo davidson) lines were very poorly delivered. In my opinion, marky shouldn't have joined the Funky Bunch, and he should have gone to acting school (or a better one if he already has). Besides him, everyone one's acting was pretty good, but some of Duncan's deliveries were also poor.Yes, I liked this movie, but I did like the original better. It seemed that everything that was wrong with the original, was good in this one, what was bad in the new one, was good in the old one. Was Burton trying to make it better, and just missed the things that were good, concentrating only on the bad parts?Yes, the ending was bad. When Marky (leo) landed on earth (it wasn't the same planet, the solar system is our own, and it is earth when they show the large picture). He lands on the steps, and sees that the memorial now has Thade's head on it. The cops pull up, apes jump out, in full cop clothing, they pull guns on Leo. About this time I put my head in my hands, and just lost it. I laughed for a couple minutes, because of how rediculous it was. Hoping, that there was more, but no. Sure to be more if and when there is a sequal. Will it be a reimagining of the second original (lets hope not)?Yes, many people have tried to explain the ending. This specifically mentioned before in the movie contradict those theories. I have my own, which, fits EVERY thing mentioned in the move. It's not a realistic ending, but it FITS with EVERYTHING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the bad reviews "Planet of the Apes" is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Perhaps Wahlberg, while clearly trying to avoid the over the top melodrama of Heston's character, could have been a little more passionate at times, but the apes, especially Thade and Ari are wonderfully portrayed with a rich dimension helped along by Rick Baker's fabulous makeup effects.You must bear in mind that this is 21st century post-cold war America and this is a Tim Burton film. There is no substantial socio-political commentary here, although there are plenty of gentle nods to racism, classism, sexism, religion, and the rest---along with several well placed winks at the original production [including a splendid cameo by Heston]. This is much more of a "fish out of water" and "search for belonging" movie that is Burton's specialty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah! Planet of the Apes. I remember seeing the now classic 1968 science fiction film as a boy growing up in Indianapolis,Indiana on late night television with my younger brother and my dad. It was some of the more pleasant moments of my childhood,but that's a tale for another time.Ok,fast forward to 2001. My wife and I took in this flick on a nice friday afternoon(matinee) and I must say this: Rick Baker is a GOD! His make-up is fantastic!Breath takingly real. He is going to get his seventh oscar for this or at least,nominated. Danny Elfman's score was magnificent! That man is a genius. Tim Burton did a good directing this although,it was a very weak script. Mark Wahlberg does ok. I mean,it's no oscar performance.He just acts like a man who just is determined to get off where the apes can talk.Helena Bonham Carter,I tell you,no matter how much make up they put on her,she still has presence and beauty that cannot be denied.(Even though there is one scene that sent a chill through my bones.eeeewww.)Tim Roth and Michael Duncan Clark both make worthy bad guys for this film..but i wanted a little more from the script to make them MORE menacing..alas that was not to be. Now, don't go to this film to expect a masterpiece. Just go and enjoy yourself.Ignore(if you can) the bad dialouge and plot holes.Sit back and relax.It's a little bit of escapism that is worth the matinee price.(Key word:Matinee) The ending leaves a kind of twilight zone feel and perhaps a hint of a sequel,but hopefully they will have a better script with the next one.</fullReview>

The script is poorly written and contains major plot and character inconsistencies. The plot (and about 10 sub-plots) never gains continuity or momentum. And we learn virtually nothing about the characters. I know I shouldn't be worrying about this, but when there is no action, what else is there to do? I guess the acting was OK--I mean, Tony Danza's not in it.Tell your friends not to see this movie if they want action. This is not an action film!P.S.

		<shortDescription>Great movie, if you understand it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked out of the theater, I was initially disappointed; I thought it was nothing special, and didn't really understand the ending. After one day of trying to figure it out, I realized that this new version of POTA is great! A lot of the people who say it 'sucked', obviously weren't paying attention. Complaints about the super-strength of the apes, and the exaggerated leaps are wrong. The apes were GENETICALLY ENHANCED, that's why they EVOLVED and turned into the talking apes that they are. How else would the apes have revolted against the Oberon crew, unless they had that strength? The ending, although extremely confusing, is good for two reasons: would you REALLY want a cliché ending where Wahlberg goes back to Earth and lives happily ever after, and it causes discussion and deep thought even long after the movie is over; something that is rare in movies today. Roth's performance steals the show, while Wahlberg does an OK job (not like you'd expect him to be spectacular anyways).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new installment to the "Planet of the Apes" saga is a skillfully made film. It combines a new adaptation to the familiar story of the original. However, it is by no means a remake. The new movie has some very striking similarities, but is a new and different film. This "Planet of the Apes" uses enough of the now famous content, that made the original great, to sell it to the older fans, as well as a new story to win over a younger generation which would not properly understand the social gripping message of the 60's version. This film is clearly Tim Burton's best work. The cast does a very good job, especially considering all of the makeup. Charlton Heston steals the show as Gen. Thade's father, proving once again that no one does a "Planet of the Apes" film like Mr. Heston. Despite the overall excellent nature of this film, it is flawed in one major aspect. This film has no star quality. No offense to Mark Wahlberg, but he is not capable of carrying a summer blockbuster by himself. Mr. Wahlberg is a fine up and coming actor, but he has not yet reached the point in his career (and maybe never will) where he can open a film by himself, let alone a major film such as "Planet of the Apes". Wahlberg tries his best to play the reluctant hero, but the key word is "tries". He lacks the major presence that Charlton Heston provided in the original. Wahlberg is unable to sell himself as an "action star". His lines are not believable, and are quite commonplace. In order for such a film to have been properly done it would have required a big time action star. That star could only have been Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose name was mentioned for the Wahlberg role. His presence in the film would have made a big summer hit into a mega summer blockbuster. Just imagine Arnold delievering the lines "I'll be back..you dirty apes!" If the casting directors have any sense they will make sure that Arnold is back when they make the sequel. Despite all of this it was still a very entertaining film. 3.5 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the bad reviews "Planet of the Apes" is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Perhaps Wahlberg, while clearly trying to avoid the over the top melodrama of Heston's character, could have been a little more passionate at times, but the apes, especially Thade and Ari are wonderfully portrayed with a rich dimension helped along by Rick Baker's fabulous makeup effects.You must bear in mind that this is 21st century post-cold war America and this is a Tim Burton film. There is no substantial socio-political commentary here, although there are plenty of gentle nods to racism, classism, sexism, religion, and the rest---along with several well placed winks at the original production [including a splendid cameo by Heston]. This is much more of a "fish out of water" and "search for belonging" movie that is Burton's specialty.</fullReview>

Now, don't go to this film to expect a masterpiece. Just go and enjoy yourself.Ignore(if you can) the bad dialouge and plot holes.Sit back and relax.It's a little bit of escapism that is worth the matinee price.(Key word:Matinee) The ending leaves a kind of twilight zone feel and perhaps a hint of a sequel,but hopefully they will have a better script with the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has managed to take a science fiction classic and "reimagine it" in a way that manages to be both faithful to the themes of the original film, while accommodating today's action-demanding audiences.Of course in many ways the film IS superior to the 1968 original. Rick Baker's makeup is a marvel, and more than makes up for his King Kong debacle of 25 years ago -- even though they still can't seem to create an ape mask that doesn't make the actors lisp. The action sequences are fast-paced and brutal, and the actors do such a marvelous job ... er ... apeing the moves of primates you're forgiven if you think Burton tossed a silverback or two into the melee just to liven things up.Mark Wahlberg is a disappointment as Leo, coming off as a one-dimensional jerk. The only times he shows any real humanity is when he interacts with a favorite (real) chimp, though he's certainly capable in the action sequences.Helena Botham Carter as the cute, human-loving Ari is the best thing in the movie, presenting a very well-rounded character when she isn't making lovey dovey eyes at Leo (best not to think about it too much). Estella Warren as a sexy slavegirl gets to show off the best lips in Hollywood, engage in an aborted catfight with Ari, wear very little, and go off in a huff of jealousy when Leo seems to want to spend more time with Ari. I get the strong feeling her best moments were left on the cutting room floor. It's always good to see David Warner and Kris Kristofferson, though their time on screen is brief.Tim Roth is fun and scary to watch as the villain, Gen. Thade, while Michael Clarke Duncan makes a menacing figure as Thade's right hand ape.Look fast for Linda Harrison -- the original slave girl in the original movie. Rick Baker himself also appears as an ape. And Burton's longtime love Lisa Marie makes her obligatory appearance, with a funny bit as a snotty, horny ape.The biggest laugh in the file comes from an otherwise dramatic cameo by original film star Charlton Heston. I won't spoil the reasons why it's funny -- only clue: it's not just in the dialogue.Nor will I spoil the ending. I was confused by it at first until I realized... it was CLASSIC Rod Serling. Once I realized Burton was paying homage to the Twilight Zone -- and let's not forget Serling co-wrote the original film -- everything fell into place.My only advice to Burton is to let sleeping apes lie and not attempt to reimagine the other films in the original Apes series. This is a good one-off, but best to move on to the next idea.</fullReview>

There are a dozen social issues that could have been examined in the movie, but apparently Burton was in a hurry to get to the Braveheart-style Ape vs. Human battle. As for the acting: Wahlberg was a jerk, Roth was too dramatic, Michael Clarke Duncan was bland, and Estella Warren hardly said a word. The only worthwhile performance was from Helena Bonham Carter. As for the ending, it's sad that Burton felt he had to match (or top) the original by throwing in that outrageous ending. He fell short by a longshot. I suppose the movie was entertaining if you didn't compare it to the original... but can you really watch it without comparing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching the original, with good ole NRA leader, Charleton Heston. I remember it being meaningful, instead of this new-age "save the little people" approach that try to teach us animal rights and how humans are cruel and unpredictable.Let me just get this out in the open, the ending sucked. Sure it was a surprise, but it made no sense and it forces a sequel to explain it. I would've enjoyed it better if it was more like the original (and not the book).If you've seen the original, it's nothing like this version. He lands by himself and is quickly thrown into the conflict. A minor change (that I wasnt expecting, actually) was that he could talk as soon as he landed, where in the original it took Heston a while to talk. Dr. Zaius is back, thrown in a comedic role thus losing the serious role he had back in the original. Again, it's just a matter of taste. If you want a reved up, updated classic...this is the movie for you.Something has always bothered me. It was in the original and in this one as well (I dont know if it's the same in the book as well), but why doesnt the main character get that HOT human chick? He seems more interested in that female monkey! Sheesh, Estella Warren is very VERY hot, and she's a Canadian as well! ;) That chick from the original was hot too, but she's like 4 000 years old now... :(The effects were there, the musical score was there...the plot and development of characters was not. We get a sense of the theme, but neither the main character or his human friends are developed in any way.Overall, it's a very enjoyable movie, however they took a lot from the original that hard-core fans such as myself dont like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm not a fan of the previous Planet of the Apes movies (I've never seen them), I was pretty excited about seeing this remake/sequel.Unfortunately, I was very much unimpressed with what I viewed. The special effects were great, the scenery was realistic, and the cast seemed to be very talented (opinion not based on this movie). However, they were lacking in one MAJOR department: the script! As someone said before, I agree that you and a bunch of your friends could have written a better screenplay for the movie than these talented, well-paid writers did.There were many interesting directions this movie *could* have taken and didn't. I noticed that in the beginning of the movie, the woman scientist on the spaceship mentions that with chimps the female is dominant sexually. Of course, this led me to think; `What an interesting twist to the movie! The female apes could be really domineering instead of the males!' But instead the comment seemed to hold no relevancy to the rest of the film whatsoever! It turns out there were hardly any female apes at all, and those were hardly very aggressive.Maybe I shouldn't have gone to see the movie with such high hopes for a great flick, but I did. I am officially insulted at spending good money on a film that seemed to have lots of possibility but no delivery. For those of you who haven't seen the movie and plan to, my advice to you is to go into the movie with lowered expectations and maybe you'll appreciate it more than I did.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Short on substance and long on flashy peripheralia (ie, costumes, art direction, FX) -- which is my typical lament of the past ten years of film history. Mind you, it's NOT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, but Marky Mark, er Mark Wahlberg, can't carry the film. Estella Warren needs a few more pounds of collagen in her lips, and Kris Kristofferson's role was a throwaway. On the plus side, the humorous Paul Giamatti got a lotta laughs, and Tim Roth was thoroughly despicable and frightening.Some of Marky's weakness is due to the script changes... the humans can talk. Ok, so then what makes Wahlberg so special to the apes? They don't even comment on his spacesuit. Talking humans is a serious stray from the crux of the Swiftian novel by Pierre Boulle, with its Gulliver's Travels -like reversal of species. Meanwhile the second half of the flick degenerates into a long chase and so-called-epic-sized battle, neither handled well. While the film surpasses the original in costumes and FX, it owes everything to its 1968 precedent. ie, the introduction and exposition of the apes moves much quicker because of our familiarity of the original.The apes themselves are superior to the original in make-up and movement and cultural detail. The ape city is more impressive. But while the specifics of the FX are more impressive than the first, they are nevertheless over-the-top. Even the Foley artists-- every step, every wrinkle of fabric, every thump of the chest is horribly amplified (maybe it was just the damn multiplex whose volume levels were through the roof). In regards to the FX-ridden films of recent years, I was reminded of Laurence Olivier's remark about make-up (which doesn't apply to this film's make-up; it does apply to FX and film-making in general): exagerrate only one detail of a character (the long nose of Richard III, for ex.), otherwise the whole face becomes a meaningless mass of putty -- the performance becomes marred, not enhanced. The same rule applies to FX. Director Burton and most of our FX-crazy film-makers would do well to quit poring over every little technical doo-dad and spend more time on dialogue and plot.Oh, and I can't stand physics-defying FX ... apes that leap 20 feet in the air... apes that aren't vaporized by a horrendous rocket blast but are merely stunned for a few seconds... apes that punch a man so hard he flies 15 feet off the ground (when such a force would decapitate him)... men who survive being knocked 15 feet off the ground and arise to get knocked 15 feet off the ground a second, third, and fourth time (this isn't the mark of the character's heroism; it's the mark of a director's sadism. If he's not sadistic, then he's immaturely fixated on the visuals of slinging a body through space.) The opening segment provides a more plausible explanation, if you demand some kind of logical time-anomaly reason which the first version lacked. But then the time paradox in the closing really falls flat. It seems tacked on for the sake of an obligatory Time-Paradox twist. And for the obligatory sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You wanna see a bunch of guys in ape suits? Okay, this is your film. You wanna see good acting? Go far far away, as far as you can from this movie. The only one worth his weight in bananas is Tim Roth, but don't go expecting to see his Four Rooms/Resevoir Dogs personality because you'll never recognize him. Kudos to Roth for actually ACTING. Everybody else, well, I stick out my tongue and beat my chest at you. And who would have thought that all of Charleton Heston's classic lines would be hijacked by the apes themselves? And this "incredible new twist-ending"? They could have brainstormed a thousand years and never come up with anything sillier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was decent, not great but good enough to be a good remake. I'm a Tim Burton fan, and while I think that this is not his best film, it's still worthy enough to be a part of his work. The make up is great, and Tim Roth probably gave the best performance of a villain I have seen in quite some time.It's good but it needed a better Story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roger Ebert missed the main point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you missed Roger Ebert's review, he didn't like Mark Wahlberg's role as a hero, or his lack of heroism in the movie. He must have been asleep during the part where his character points out to Carter's female ape character, that "...we are not alike, you care about everybody else but yourself." For me, this whole statement defines the movie. He only wants to go home. He only cares about himself. And all without the arrogant 'attitude' we're used to seeing in movies. It's either Look at me I'm cool, or Look at me I'm a hero, Wahlberg's character and final decision in the movie pave the way for turning upside down everything you ever thought you knew about what's really going on. A perfect sci-fi where the seemingly explainable goes unexplained.The plausibility of the opening year at 2029? A stretch...only if you believe we're in the same reality, which you will find out becomes one for the X-files. The original 1968 movie left you with a shock, so you could figure out the timeline and the ape evolution. This movie doesn't try to shock, as many are thinking it's supposed to. It's actually supposed to make you THINK who came first, human or ape? You will realize that you would have never reached this point if Wahlberg walked the path of the true hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I expected a good movie, similar to the other movies from Tim Burton. There wasn't much good in this movie that I could see. It starts off with a space ship that has a strange resemblance to the Quake symbol. The space ship also somehow has gravity even though it doesn't spin or have any explanation as to how gravity is achieved. The other thing that was kinda weird was that Marky Mark puts on a space helmet right over his t-shirt so if he was actually exposed to space he would die, it didn't even seal.Okay, the movie is okay, the costumes, and masks are great. But obviously all the budget went to those rather than making a good movie. It had great potential but just never got to the good level.The time travel isn't explained well enough and the obvious screwy ending is setting the viewer with a to be continued feeling. Suggesting that maybe a sequel will be coming even though most sequels are terrible. The movie had too much money making stuff in it and not enough Tim Burton.If you want to see this movie I would suggest waiting until the video comes out because I felt like I was always one step ahead of the movie, including the ending. It was not worth $8!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey everyone i just wanted to comment on "Planet of the Apes" i think it was a great movie and they picked a real good person to play "Leo Davidson" (Mark Wahlberg)...i think that Mark Wahlberg is such a great actor because he can be so many characters..and make it look good...and for all the apes such as Helena Bonham Carter, and Michael Clarke Duncan were so good and so well trained to be apes and monkeys...i think that the new "Planet of the Apes" was well made (fixed up) it is much more realistic and the director Tim Burton and all the makeup artist couldn't have done better...i have heard from Mark Wahlberg that there is going to be a part 2 or second one and i can't wait until that comes out because the first one was awesome!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crash landing... capture... escape... battle... the end. Intricate plot isn't it? Burton decides to sidestep any meaningful themes in this film, and that's a shame. There are a dozen social issues that could have been examined in the movie, but apparently Burton was in a hurry to get to the Braveheart-style Ape vs. Human battle. As for the acting: Wahlberg was a jerk, Roth was too dramatic, Michael Clarke Duncan was bland, and Estella Warren hardly said a word. The only worthwhile performance was from Helena Bonham Carter. As for the ending, it's sad that Burton felt he had to match (or top) the original by throwing in that outrageous ending. He fell short by a longshot.

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but doesnt stay true to the originial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the original, with good ole NRA leader, Charleton Heston. I remember it being meaningful, instead of this new-age "save the little people" approach that try to teach us animal rights and how humans are cruel and unpredictable.Let me just get this out in the open, the ending sucked. Sure it was a surprise, but it made no sense and it forces a sequel to explain it. I would've enjoyed it better if it was more like the original (and not the book).If you've seen the original, it's nothing like this version. He lands by himself and is quickly thrown into the conflict. A minor change (that I wasnt expecting, actually) was that he could talk as soon as he landed, where in the original it took Heston a while to talk. Dr. Zaius is back, thrown in a comedic role thus losing the serious role he had back in the original. Again, it's just a matter of taste. If you want a reved up, updated classic...this is the movie for you.Something has always bothered me. It was in the original and in this one as well (I dont know if it's the same in the book as well), but why doesnt the main character get that HOT human chick? He seems more interested in that female monkey! Sheesh, Estella Warren is very VERY hot, and she's a Canadian as well! ;) That chick from the original was hot too, but she's like 4 000 years old now... :(The effects were there, the musical score was there...the plot and development of characters was not. We get a sense of the theme, but neither the main character or his human friends are developed in any way.Overall, it's a very enjoyable movie, however they took a lot from the original that hard-core fans such as myself dont like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm not a fan of the previous Planet of the Apes movies (I've never seen them), I was pretty excited about seeing this remake/sequel.Unfortunately, I was very much unimpressed with what I viewed. The special effects were great, the scenery was realistic, and the cast seemed to be very talented (opinion not based on this movie). However, they were lacking in one MAJOR department: the script! As someone said before, I agree that you and a bunch of your friends could have written a better screenplay for the movie than these talented, well-paid writers did.There were many interesting directions this movie *could* have taken and didn't. I noticed that in the beginning of the movie, the woman scientist on the spaceship mentions that with chimps the female is dominant sexually. Of course, this led me to think; `What an interesting twist to the movie! The female apes could be really domineering instead of the males!' But instead the comment seemed to hold no relevancy to the rest of the film whatsoever! It turns out there were hardly any female apes at all, and those were hardly very aggressive.Maybe I shouldn't have gone to see the movie with such high hopes for a great flick, but I did. I am officially insulted at spending good money on a film that seemed to have lots of possibility but no delivery. For those of you who haven't seen the movie and plan to, my advice to you is to go into the movie with lowered expectations and maybe you'll appreciate it more than I did.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Short on substance and long on flashy peripheralia (ie, costumes, art direction, FX) -- which is my typical lament of the past ten years of film history. Mind you, it's NOT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, but Marky Mark, er Mark Wahlberg, can't carry the film. Estella Warren needs a few more pounds of collagen in her lips, and Kris Kristofferson's role was a throwaway. On the plus side, the humorous Paul Giamatti got a lotta laughs, and Tim Roth was thoroughly despicable and frightening.Some of Marky's weakness is due to the script changes... the humans can talk. Ok, so then what makes Wahlberg so special to the apes? They don't even comment on his spacesuit. Talking humans is a serious stray from the crux of the Swiftian novel by Pierre Boulle, with its Gulliver's Travels -like reversal of species. Meanwhile the second half of the flick degenerates into a long chase and so-called-epic-sized battle, neither handled well. While the film surpasses the original in costumes and FX, it owes everything to its 1968 precedent. ie, the introduction and exposition of the apes moves much quicker because of our familiarity of the original.The apes themselves are superior to the original in make-up and movement and cultural detail. The ape city is more impressive. But while the specifics of the FX are more impressive than the first, they are nevertheless over-the-top. Even the Foley artists-- every step, every wrinkle of fabric, every thump of the chest is horribly amplified (maybe it was just the damn multiplex whose volume levels were through the roof). In regards to the FX-ridden films of recent years, I was reminded of Laurence Olivier's remark about make-up (which doesn't apply to this film's make-up; it does apply to FX and film-making in general): exagerrate only one detail of a character (the long nose of Richard III, for ex.), otherwise the whole face becomes a meaningless mass of putty -- the performance becomes marred, not enhanced.

		<shortDescription>Decent But not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was decent, not great but good enough to be a good remake. I'm a Tim Burton fan, and while I think that this is not his best film, it's still worthy enough to be a part of his work. The make up is great, and Tim Roth probably gave the best performance of a villain I have seen in quite some time.It's good but it needed a better Story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In case you missed Roger Ebert's review, he didn't like Mark Wahlberg's role as a hero, or his lack of heroism in the movie. He must have been asleep during the part where his character points out to Carter's female ape character, that "...we are not alike, you care about everybody else but yourself." For me, this whole statement defines the movie. He only wants to go home. He only cares about himself. And all without the arrogant 'attitude' we're used to seeing in movies. It's either Look at me I'm cool, or Look at me I'm a hero, Wahlberg's character and final decision in the movie pave the way for turning upside down everything you ever thought you knew about what's really going on. A perfect sci-fi where the seemingly explainable goes unexplained.The plausibility of the opening year at 2029? A stretch...only if you believe we're in the same reality, which you will find out becomes one for the X-files. The original 1968 movie left you with a shock, so you could figure out the timeline and the ape evolution. This movie doesn't try to shock, as many are thinking it's supposed to. It's actually supposed to make you THINK who came first, human or ape? You will realize that you would have never reached this point if Wahlberg walked the path of the true hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I expected a good movie, similar to the other movies from Tim Burton. There wasn't much good in this movie that I could see. It starts off with a space ship that has a strange resemblance to the Quake symbol. The space ship also somehow has gravity even though it doesn't spin or have any explanation as to how gravity is achieved. The other thing that was kinda weird was that Marky Mark puts on a space helmet right over his t-shirt so if he was actually exposed to space he would die, it didn't even seal.Okay, the movie is okay, the costumes, and masks are great. But obviously all the budget went to those rather than making a good movie. It had great potential but just never got to the good level.The time travel isn't explained well enough and the obvious screwy ending is setting the viewer with a to be continued feeling. Suggesting that maybe a sequel will be coming even though most sequels are terrible. The movie had too much money making stuff in it and not enough Tim Burton.If you want to see this movie I would suggest waiting until the video comes out because I felt like I was always one step ahead of the movie, including the ending. It was not worth $8!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Burton did well in creating Planet of the Apes for a generation that did not know it, and as well, keeping the ones who did satisfied. The acting by the human-played apes was marvelous, mannerisms such as hoots and grunts in amusement, anger, or excitement were quite well done. Burton was also able to create a scientifically logical theory behind the concept, engineering the thought that the primates were tampered with in the human image, and taught English when they were genetically engineered, which all of course was fantastical but eerily plausible. The ape culture was intriguing as well.There was moments where I was saying, "Wow, that was a really great idea".

		<fullReview>Ok...so, normally when I head out to the movies I have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to get. I made the mistake of expecting something from this, um, 'pseudo-remake' of Planet of the Apes. It looked fantastic (the make-up and costuming was amazing...) and the score was rather intriguing...but the 'acting' was, well, sub-par (to put it nicely). I don't know what was going through Tim Burton's head.At no point during the film did I think that any of the characters (simian or otherwise) were believable. The dialogue (what there was of it, anyway) was appalling. Characters acted rashly for no logical reason, and there didn't seem to be any cause for these actions. The super-intelligent apes treated the humans like dirt...but why? There was no explanation for anything.The worst example of this lack of explanation comes at the end. I won't say what happens (don't want to ruin the 'fun' for everyone), but its absolutely impossible and it really doesn't make sense. Sure, it was jaw-dropping...but only since it was utter nonsense...As opposed to the original, I don't know what Burton's purpose was (other than &lt;chi-ching&gt; $$$). Well, in any case, kudos to Carter, Roth, Duncan and the rest of the apes for going to school and learning to act like an ape. And as for the 'human' cast, maybe they should have gone to a school to learn to act like, well, a human (emotions are an integral part of life)...The bottom line is: if you want to look at a bunch of animals, go to the zoo...oh...and stick to the originals...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed, insulted and fed up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more can be said about the new Planet of the Apes (POTA)? Truly, this so-called summer blockbuster insults moviegoers with its trite storyline, excessive and inappropriate violence, monochromatic acting, inaccurate, contradictory and illogical sequences, implausibility, lackluster performances, and poor direction. To call this a remake of the original 1968 version is tantamount to pouring ketchup on a gourmet meal. The makers of the original POTA and the author of the original book must be gnashing their teeth in absolute outrage. What is wrong with this puppy? Let me present a few examples:· In the beginning sequences, what four-star general would ever tolerate such insubordinate language from a mere captain? Or for that matter, what general would speak so contemptuously to his star crewmember?· What rational human being and ostensibly highly trained military officer would flagrantly disobey his general and subject himself to such an absurd physical risk to reclaim his monkey?· If the apes used the humans as a valuable resource such as servants, why would they treat them so abusively defies all reason. To use humans to pull the cages of other humans is a waste of valuable resources, when they could have just as easily used horses that would have accomplished the task far more efficiently.· The original POTA had various elements of their society that were sensitive and intelligent. Why make them all appear to be such a raving band of lunatics, particularly their leader?· Does this Mark Wahlberg have any emotion at all? Clearly, he could have emailed his performance in rather than waste our time and money to watch him go through his ridiculous antics.· When in the initial scenes the humans are escaping from their cages, does it make sense for them to dash through bedroom after bedroom rather than simply flee the premises? Clearly, the scenes are a poorly contrived vehicle to bring some humor into this dismal display of MTV chaos that no doubt stimulates the average junior high school student to gape in wonder and awe.· Why in the world would the leader of this unruly zoo seek to destroy all the humans? There are no electronical or other mechanical assets to assist them in their daily living. It seems they would simply be destroying their own major assets.· If the original ancestors of the apes were these chimpanzees contained in the spaceship's cages, where did the gorillas and the orangutans come from?· If as Mark Wahlberg states in the spaceship that the nuclear power of the ship lasts for thousands of years, why is it that it is only good for one thrust to knock out the ape's attack? If that was indeed a blast from the ship's engines, it would surely have fried all the chimps to a crisp, not merely knock them out so they could regain consciousness all at once to resume the attack.· This story has been used so many times and in so many forms that it defies all descriptions of triteness and predictability. I cannot imagine any writer worth his salt turning out such dribble unless severely brain-damaged, high on drugs or alcohol, or simply senile. I further question the inaction of the director Tim Burton when presented with such nonsense. Does he believe all audiences are retarded? Perhaps so.In any event, I've spent far too much of my valuable time with this poor excuse for entertainment. If Hollywood continues to turn out such poor excuses for amusement, we are doomed as the world leader in the entertainment industry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chance to Go Ape Ruined by Tedious Audience Junkfood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersNo one can expect a remake to equal up to the legendary sci-fi classic even with all the special effects and ape costumes in the world. Well considering that Mark Wahlberg doesn't show a single expression beyond ?stupefied' doesn't help either. It's also his character, Leo Davidson, who gets transported to the future after he dives into a nebula of testosterone.If you need me to explain the plot, go out and rent the 1968 version. But Burton and friends took liberty with adding typical action flick characters and scenes that'd not find home in the 1968 classic. Like General Thade (Tim Roth), who sets himself apart from all other Apes by talking in a series of near incomprehensible grunts. Or Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), who not surprisingly sacrifices himself to save everyone else because he's old (originality?). The movie, like the entire franchise, is hauled into a dark alley and beaten to death, kicking and screaming the entire way.One thing that I loved so much about the original was it's unique score, primarily composed of drums and horns. The opening of the remake has exactly that, even better. I loved the opening score, yet that's the problem; it was only used during the opening. I faintly remember hearing it in the background for about twenty seconds later in the film. But Burton and Elfman decided to follow traditional boring action movie music, the kind that makes you want to attack the screen in a flurry of shotgun blasts.I sat bored through most of the movie. It's really really boring; half the scenes are dominated by General Thade bouncing off the walls and howling `Get the humans!' Or Mark Wahlberg (who can't be surprised by anything, even landing on a planet rules by tyrannical apes) heroically taking the lead with lines such as `Uhh?we've gotta escape?' Scenes invite groans, such as Wahlberg's insta-army. Once the escaped humans, and their ape companions have made if far enough away from the ape city, an army of humans come to join them. What's so terrible about this scene is that the army comes in from all directions simultaneously. In the next five minutes an army of humans are ready to go. Also, the ape city was walled off, with no room for expansion, what are they trying to wall out? Or in?You may remember Charlton Heston's kiss to Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) in the original. Considering that Helena Bonham Carter's character Ari is nearly a spitting image of Dr. Zira (the reason why I liked her the most in the film) it isn't surprising that she gets a little smooch from Mark Wahlberg. This is the big disappointment in Burton's `Apes'. Here is a chance to go over the top and really screw with the audience. Why didn't spaceman Leo Davidson sleep with Ari? Instead of kicking the audience in the ass, he's just invited snickers from the audience moms. If you're making a movie about a planet that's ruled by tyrannical monkey-men, how can you not go over the deep end? The 1968 version was a great movie with mixed satire, the remake fails.From the way I sound, you must think I hate this movie. The remake had some redeeming features I loved. I loved the ape costumes and how director Burton used the apes in a more primordial fashion. In the original the apes stood up and ran straight. In the remake Burton lets them run hunched over and perform bouncing leaps. The greatest thing about the remake? The ending of course, I won't spoil it, but it's genius. It doesn't make sense, it doesn't have to (just look at the title to the movie).The remake should've been titled 'Mark Wahlberg vs. the Planet of the Apes' because that's what it is. Instead of producing a social satire that explores dual bestiality and the inner workings of a nations ruled by apes (which would've been great). Burton throws a summer action movie at us with little redeeming features and wooden characters (except Ari, of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new and "re-imagined" Planet of the Apes is for the most part an extravagant exercise in style over substance. The make-up ( which is the real star) in this movie is good but somehow seems over done. Tim Burton's direction is interesting but his talent can't make up the movies spotty script. The original though dated was a far more focused movie throughout making it's twist of an ending a classic. This "Apes" also has a twist of an ending but is less effective, leaving it's audience with more of a belly laugh than anything else. Also, Marky-Mark is no Charlton Heston...and how those "humans" that speak English as well as anyone seemed a bit silly as well. In fact 'silly' may be the best way to describe "Planet of the Apes-2001." But if you want a nice light night out at the movies without too much thought, perhaps this ones for you. **1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where do we go from here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is my favorite director, he's never made a bad movie...(Mars Attacks! isn't bad, just grossly misunderstood), but I have mixed feelings about some of his decisions. As an aspiring film maker, I understand that in order to get paid, one must first appease the investors, (studio's). Burton however has managed to do this, without compromising his art, up until now. It seemed that Burton wanted to make a...for lack of a better word, darker movie, that addressed some perverse issues, but was forced to back up by a force off camera. (Perhaps the whole bestiality issue would have been interesting?) there were plenty of other issues that could've been explored but weren't. I loved the little details however, the ape with the music box and the human midget as his pet, it was great, you really got a sense of culture, I just wish I saw more of it. Many of the issues in the film were great?but there could've been more. I also felt that the political aspect of the film wasn't addressed. Perhaps a scene that took place in the ape senate would have been interesting. (Or maybe that's just the Sparticus inside me talking?) I really would have liked to see Glen Shadix a bit more. As usual, the film was visually stunning...but for the first time ever, I feel that Burton has sacrificed substance for style. The film was eye-candy indeed, but lacked that human, (or ape...sorry), quality. Marky's character was also lacking. He was the outsider, Burton's on-screen alter-ego...why would Burton not developed him more? Burton's renowned for glorifying the "outsider"...how could he let this one slip? He got Carter's character right, why would he over-look the obvious freak? Last but not least is Elfman. His score was lacking as well. That beautiful sense of pensiveness or melancholy wasn't present in this score. Perhaps I'm getting too picky, but like so many others, I expected so much more. I'm not criticizing Burton for "selling out"?(after-all, isn't that the goal of every director)? And I didn't think this was a bad movie, as a matter of fact, I liked it and thought it was a good movie?I just hope that Burton doesn't compensate his art for the sake of a sequel again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can be said about the new Planet of the Apes (POTA)? Truly, this so-called summer blockbuster insults moviegoers with its trite storyline, excessive and inappropriate violence, monochromatic acting, inaccurate, contradictory and illogical sequences, implausibility, lackluster performances, and poor direction. To call this a remake of the original 1968 version is tantamount to pouring ketchup on a gourmet meal. The makers of the original POTA and the author of the original book must be gnashing their teeth in absolute outrage. What is wrong with this puppy? Let me present a few examples:· In the beginning sequences, what four-star general would ever tolerate such insubordinate language from a mere captain? Or for that matter, what general would speak so contemptuously to his star crewmember?· What rational human being and ostensibly highly trained military officer would flagrantly disobey his general and subject himself to such an absurd physical risk to reclaim his monkey?· If the apes used the humans as a valuable resource such as servants, why would they treat them so abusively defies all reason. To use humans to pull the cages of other humans is a waste of valuable resources, when they could have just as easily used horses that would have accomplished the task far more efficiently.· The original POTA had various elements of their society that were sensitive and intelligent. Why make them all appear to be such a raving band of lunatics, particularly their leader?· Does this Mark Wahlberg have any emotion at all? Clearly, he could have emailed his performance in rather than waste our time and money to watch him go through his ridiculous antics.· When in the initial scenes the humans are escaping from their cages, does it make sense for them to dash through bedroom after bedroom rather than simply flee the premises? Clearly, the scenes are a poorly contrived vehicle to bring some humor into this dismal display of MTV chaos that no doubt stimulates the average junior high school student to gape in wonder and awe.· Why in the world would the leader of this unruly zoo seek to destroy all the humans? There are no electronical or other mechanical assets to assist them in their daily living. It seems they would simply be destroying their own major assets.· If the original ancestors of the apes were these chimpanzees contained in the spaceship's cages, where did the gorillas and the orangutans come from?· If as Mark Wahlberg states in the spaceship that the nuclear power of the ship lasts for thousands of years, why is it that it is only good for one thrust to knock out the ape's attack? If that was indeed a blast from the ship's engines, it would surely have fried all the chimps to a crisp, not merely knock them out so they could regain consciousness all at once to resume the attack.· This story has been used so many times and in so many forms that it defies all descriptions of triteness and predictability. I cannot imagine any writer worth his salt turning out such dribble unless severely brain-damaged, high on drugs or alcohol, or simply senile. I further question the inaction of the director Tim Burton when presented with such nonsense. Does he believe all audiences are retarded? Perhaps so.In any event, I've spent far too much of my valuable time with this poor excuse for entertainment. If Hollywood continues to turn out such poor excuses for amusement, we are doomed as the world leader in the entertainment industry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersNo one can expect a remake to equal up to the legendary sci-fi classic even with all the special effects and ape costumes in the world. Well considering that Mark Wahlberg doesn't show a single expression beyond ?stupefied' doesn't help either. It's also his character, Leo Davidson, who gets transported to the future after he dives into a nebula of testosterone.If you need me to explain the plot, go out and rent the 1968 version. But Burton and friends took liberty with adding typical action flick characters and scenes that'd not find home in the 1968 classic. Like General Thade (Tim Roth), who sets himself apart from all other Apes by talking in a series of near incomprehensible grunts. Or Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), who not surprisingly sacrifices himself to save everyone else because he's old (originality?). The movie, like the entire franchise, is hauled into a dark alley and beaten to death, kicking and screaming the entire way.One thing that I loved so much about the original was it's unique score, primarily composed of drums and horns. The opening of the remake has exactly that, even better. I loved the opening score, yet that's the problem; it was only used during the opening. I faintly remember hearing it in the background for about twenty seconds later in the film. But Burton and Elfman decided to follow traditional boring action movie music, the kind that makes you want to attack the screen in a flurry of shotgun blasts.I sat bored through most of the movie. It's really really boring; half the scenes are dominated by General Thade bouncing off the walls and howling `Get the humans!' Or Mark Wahlberg (who can't be surprised by anything, even landing on a planet rules by tyrannical apes) heroically taking the lead with lines such as `Uhh?we've gotta escape?' Scenes invite groans, such as Wahlberg's insta-army. Once the escaped humans, and their ape companions have made if far enough away from the ape city, an army of humans come to join them. What's so terrible about this scene is that the army comes in from all directions simultaneously. In the next five minutes an army of humans are ready to go. Also, the ape city was walled off, with no room for expansion, what are they trying to wall out? Or in?You may remember Charlton Heston's kiss to Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) in the original. Considering that Helena Bonham Carter's character Ari is nearly a spitting image of Dr. Zira (the reason why I liked her the most in the film) it isn't surprising that she gets a little smooch from Mark Wahlberg. This is the big disappointment in Burton's `Apes'. Here is a chance to go over the top and really screw with the audience. Why didn't spaceman Leo Davidson sleep with Ari? Instead of kicking the audience in the ass, he's just invited snickers from the audience moms. If you're making a movie about a planet that's ruled by tyrannical monkey-men, how can you not go over the deep end? The 1968 version was a great movie with mixed satire, the remake fails.From the way I sound, you must think I hate this movie. The remake had some redeeming features I loved. I loved the ape costumes and how director Burton used the apes in a more primordial fashion. In the original the apes stood up and ran straight. In the remake Burton lets them run hunched over and perform bouncing leaps. The greatest thing about the remake? The ending of course, I won't spoil it, but it's genius. It doesn't make sense, it doesn't have to (just look at the title to the movie).The remake should've been titled 'Mark Wahlberg vs. the Planet of the Apes' because that's what it is. Instead of producing a social satire that explores dual bestiality and the inner workings of a nations ruled by apes (which would've been great). Burton throws a summer action movie at us with little redeeming features and wooden characters (except Ari, of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new and "re-imagined" Planet of the Apes is for the most part an extravagant exercise in style over substance. The make-up ( which is the real star) in this movie is good but somehow seems over done. Tim Burton's direction is interesting but his talent can't make up the movies spotty script. The original though dated was a far more focused movie throughout making it's twist of an ending a classic. This "Apes" also has a twist of an ending but is less effective, leaving it's audience with more of a belly laugh than anything else. Also, Marky-Mark is no Charlton Heston...and how those "humans" that speak English as well as anyone seemed a bit silly as well. In fact 'silly' may be the best way to describe "Planet of the Apes-2001." But if you want a nice light night out at the movies without too much thought, perhaps this ones for you. **1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where do we go from here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is my favorite director, he's never made a bad movie...(Mars Attacks! isn't bad, just grossly misunderstood), but I have mixed feelings about some of his decisions. As an aspiring film maker, I understand that in order to get paid, one must first appease the investors, (studio's). Burton however has managed to do this, without compromising his art, up until now. It seemed that Burton wanted to make a...for lack of a better word, darker movie, that addressed some perverse issues, but was forced to back up by a force off camera. (Perhaps the whole bestiality issue would have been interesting?) there were plenty of other issues that could've been explored but weren't. I loved the little details however, the ape with the music box and the human midget as his pet, it was great, you really got a sense of culture, I just wish I saw more of it. Many of the issues in the film were great?but there could've been more. I also felt that the political aspect of the film wasn't addressed. Perhaps a scene that took place in the ape senate would have been interesting. (Or maybe that's just the Sparticus inside me talking?) I really would have liked to see Glen Shadix a bit more. As usual, the film was visually stunning...but for the first time ever, I feel that Burton has sacrificed substance for style. The film was eye-candy indeed, but lacked that human, (or ape...sorry), quality. Marky's character was also lacking. He was the outsider, Burton's on-screen alter-ego...why would Burton not developed him more? Burton's renowned for glorifying the "outsider"...how could he let this one slip? He got Carter's character right, why would he over-look the obvious freak? Last but not least is Elfman. His score was lacking as well. That beautiful sense of pensiveness or melancholy wasn't present in this score. Perhaps I'm getting too picky, but like so many others, I expected so much more. I'm not criticizing Burton for "selling out"?(after-all, isn't that the goal of every director)? And I didn't think this was a bad movie, as a matter of fact, I liked it and thought it was a good movie?I just hope that Burton doesn't compensate his art for the sake of a sequel again.</fullReview>

The rest of the humans are negligible; it is the apes which dominate the screen and the story and all are excellent. The ending chosen was unnecessary; the shock and surprise value was nonexistent. Much better to have gone for something completely original rather than a re-interpretation of Heston's famous last scene which WAS a shock and a surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Burton did well in creating Planet of the Apes for a generation that did not know it, and as well, keeping the ones who did satisfied. The acting by the human-played apes was marvelous, mannerisms such as hoots and grunts in amusement, anger, or excitement were quite well done. Burton was also able to create a scientifically logical theory behind the concept, engineering the thought that the primates were tampered with in the human image, and taught English when they were genetically engineered, which all of course was fantastical but eerily plausible. The ape culture was intriguing as well.There was moments where I was saying, "Wow, that was a really great idea". However, there was also times when I found myself saying, "Jesus Burton, not that!", although the latter was less common.All throughout his career, Tim Burton was trying as hard as he could to balance entertainment with his cinematic vision, and this time he struck gold.All in all, Planet of the Apes is not the kind of remake that people who loathe action films would enjoy, nor people who despise art films, but if you have no preference (Or you can at least stand both), the new Planet of the Apes is truly great science fiction! My only complaints were the blonde supermodel (Paper thin character), and some really lame dialogue(More character developement would have been nice too). Both a B movie and a cinematic marvel (If it's possible).Ah, and on a final note, Helena Bonham Carter (the period-piece-princess) made a rather attractive chimpanzee!</fullReview>

I actually can't believe the overwhelmingly positive response by fans and critics alike to this movie!Okay...it looks great...but there are several major flaws...first, did anyone else notice how a few of the apes (Paul Giamatti's "Limbo" in particular) too closely resembled The Grinch?...second, notwithstanding the great acting by Tim Roth, everyone else seemed stiff as a board...third, and most importantly, and without revealing the ending, did anyone else notice how preposterous it was for that ending to be possible? There is NO possible way that the events at the end of the film could have followed anything that came before it. Instead of a twist ending that meant something, we are left with a sense of confusion that seems to have been tagged on to make jaws drop...until common sense prevails and you realize that they couldn't figure out how to end it in a realistic manner.I guess that the average moviegoer will walk away semisatisfied at what amounts to little more than style prevailing over substance...something we have too long settled for...but as always, most people will forget about it as soon as the next overblown hyped summer blockbuster comes along!</fullReview>

While I wouldn't go as far as saying that, it was still well worth the price of admission!I'm not much in the way or writing long, drawn out comments, but let me just say that the ending MAKES this movie, it was the perfect fit, even if it was a tad predictable, I couldn't help but grin and give a silent "oh, man!" to it.My only major problem with the film is Mark Wahlberg. He is a fine and up and coming actor, but I haven't latched onto him yet. Perhaps one day I will. He's hot right now, and he's certainly better off than his "Marky Mark" days.As far as other standouts, Paul Gianetti is a riot as Limbo, and Charlton Heston is excellent in a cameo apprerance!Highly recommended viewing.***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to get into any of the murky details of the film. I won't talk about the little amounts of acting because i blame that on the writing. I won't get into the details because, like i said, they are murky at best. This is a two hour effects powerhouse except that when you look under the hood for the engine you realize what's running the show is a bunch of monkeys. THe movie fell short in too many areas for me and the cool monkey outfits and such could not overcome this. There were more plot holes than in a slice of Swiss cheese and each and every hole was a dark, endless one. Spinning you deeper into a vast array of nonsense and excuses to get Marki Mark to his next ordeal with the monkeys. I would only recommend this movie to those who love completely mindless action movies and for big fans of Marky Mark walking around breathing heavy and doing nothing much else. Other than that i would not recommend this to my worst enemy. It was a formulaic mess and a shameless attempt at using a classic story that has become part of our culture to make money and make the hollywood big-wigs smile a little wider and their wallets a little fatter. Kudos to them because as i've read now that the movie grossed 70 million over the weekend. They made the perfect, mindless fodder that thousands of kids go screaming to the theaters to watch. They'll think the apes are cool and Marky Mark is cool and in the end that's all that matters. In the end Tim Burton, whom i once cherished as a director, will be regarded as a master mind. Why? Perhaps you should look under the hood and ask him yourself as he tosses your oil filter out and makes a bigger mess. "Hey Tim! Why not a 're-imagining' of 2001 next!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They clearly had a good idea to work with. It was also called Planet of the Apes. Why they chose to take a perfectly good idea and change into a bad idea is beyond me. This movie was designed to please thirteen year olds. Lots of monkeys jumping around and some cool special effects. Those of us who have seen the original and know that it was an intellectually effective movie, should generally be disappointed with this sad re-make. Don't get me wrong, the apes were cool looking and the special effects were decent. In fact, take the monkeys of today and put them in the Charleton Heston film 34 years ago and you'd really have something. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone so I won't, but what is the deal with the end? Those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about. This is a perfect example of poor story telling, from completely undeveloped characters who suddenly play a somewhat surprisingly important role in the protagonists actions, to scenes which have even the most intelligent of critics at a loss (in reference to the end).I gave this movie 6 out of 10 because as I said, the monkeys are cool. I love Tim Roth and they obviously spent a great deal of time teaching the actors to act as apes. However, this is never enough to make up for a bad story (those apes evolved awfully fast). See it if you wish, but if you wish to see an updated Charleton Heston picture, don't bother. Just watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you'll love it or hate it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite many of the earlier comments here, the 2001-model "Planet of the Apes" is very much a Tim Burton movie. If you liked his earlier material, you ought to love this one. All of his usual trademarks are here; wild visuals, freaky settings, great music (courtesy of a slightly-more-restrained-than-usual Danny Elfman), and a sense of atmosphere that borrows from Art Deco, old vampire movies, and a few spectacularly bad acid trips. Of course, his OTHER trademarks are here, too: Minimal (or No) attention to telling a coherent story, one-dimensional characterizations (usually excepting the main character), and undeveloped themes. If you think about it, he hasn't really told a solid story with a beginning, middle, and end since "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" back in 1985! If you're a Burton fan (like me), you've overlooked these weaknesses in his earlier gems like "Edward Scissorhands," "Batman," and "Beetlejuice." And I predict that you'll do so again when you see his newest creation.However, if you're not willing to play ball Burton's way, you'll probably hate this with a passion. SPOILERS FOLLOW!There are more holes in the plot than there are in every other movie you've ever seen combined. (How did Davidson travel from Saturn to Earth so quickly at the end? And in a tiny ship that's apparently built for traveling short distances? And can't possibly have been designed to survive atmospheric entry? Why did everyone who went through the Magnetic field end up in vastly different time periods, while the Planet was always in the same place in its orbit? Doesn't it move? Or does the field move with it? And where did the horses come from? Maybe they were on the ship too? As part of another set of ill-defined experiments?). But these plot problems didn't bother me any more than the origin of the ice blocks that Edward Scissorhands kept in his castle, or the way that Vicky Vale's camera magically appeared every time she needed it. As I said, you can either overlook Burton's lack of attention to the plot, or not.Character developments and motivations are all over the place. Much of the dialogue is cringe-inducing. The only actors who give memorable performances are in the ape costumes (Tim Roth, Helena Bonham-Carter, Michael Clarke-Duncan, and Paul Giamatti in particular); the human characters seemed to be a distant afterthought, almost as if Burton wanted to make a movie with an all-ape cast, then decided much later that it couldn't work. Mark Wahlberg, brilliant in "Boogie Nights" and "Three Kings," seems out of his element here. He doesn't exactly do a bad job, he just seems unclear on what his character is supposed to be doing. The script doesn't even give him a single moment of surprise when he first sees talking apes and the cities they've built.And you'll either love the ending or hate it. I thought it was great, even if it didn't make much sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is a breathtaking spectacle, a technical masterpiece highlighted by Rick Baker's remarkably emotive simian make up. This is an exciting film, one that sets up beautifully at a near future research station in some unidentified area of space. Once Mark Wahlberg arrives en medias res at the Primate Ruled Planet, we are carried through a remarkably other world, a masterpiece of set design. In addition, choreography of primate movements is entirely believable, a foreign yet familiar fusion of primal simian movement and human barbarism. Where the film begins to show its warts is its inability to follow up on the plot premises it establishes. Various mentions and trappings of mysticism, which serve the film well, disappear under the relentless pacing. Wahlberg's prophecied astronaut is not significantly charismatic enough nor spiritually aware enough to be the centerpiece of a film that wants badly to do more than simply be another big, dumb action movie but seldom achieves more than those humble lows.And in the end, an error in editing, direction, writing, or all of the above brings a film to lows that I was perfectly will to accept, warts and all. The last 10 minutes almost ruined the film for me (and I won't spoil it for everyone but ask yourself it makes any sense at all when watching it).

		<shortDescription>Not the best movie I've ever seen, but a darn fine one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton never ceases to amaze me. His eye is second to none and his films have that "look" to them. My neighbor commented that the 2001 version of "Apes" was the best movie he's ever seen in his entire life. While I wouldn't go as far as saying that, it was still well worth the price of admission!I'm not much in the way or writing long, drawn out comments, but let me just say that the ending MAKES this movie, it was the perfect fit, even if it was a tad predictable, I couldn't help but grin and give a silent "oh, man!" to it.My only major problem with the film is Mark Wahlberg. He is a fine and up and coming actor, but I haven't latched onto him yet. Perhaps one day I will. He's hot right now, and he's certainly better off than his "Marky Mark" days.As far as other standouts, Paul Gianetti is a riot as Limbo, and Charlton Heston is excellent in a cameo apprerance!Highly recommended viewing.***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to get into any of the murky details of the film. I won't talk about the little amounts of acting because i blame that on the writing. I won't get into the details because, like i said, they are murky at best. This is a two hour effects powerhouse except that when you look under the hood for the engine you realize what's running the show is a bunch of monkeys. THe movie fell short in too many areas for me and the cool monkey outfits and such could not overcome this. There were more plot holes than in a slice of Swiss cheese and each and every hole was a dark, endless one. Spinning you deeper into a vast array of nonsense and excuses to get Marki Mark to his next ordeal with the monkeys. I would only recommend this movie to those who love completely mindless action movies and for big fans of Marky Mark walking around breathing heavy and doing nothing much else. Other than that i would not recommend this to my worst enemy. It was a formulaic mess and a shameless attempt at using a classic story that has become part of our culture to make money and make the hollywood big-wigs smile a little wider and their wallets a little fatter. Kudos to them because as i've read now that the movie grossed 70 million over the weekend. They made the perfect, mindless fodder that thousands of kids go screaming to the theaters to watch. They'll think the apes are cool and Marky Mark is cool and in the end that's all that matters. In the end Tim Burton, whom i once cherished as a director, will be regarded as a master mind. Why? Perhaps you should look under the hood and ask him yourself as he tosses your oil filter out and makes a bigger mess. "Hey Tim! Why not a 're-imagining' of 2001 next!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They clearly had a good idea to work with. It was also called Planet of the Apes. Why they chose to take a perfectly good idea and change into a bad idea is beyond me. This movie was designed to please thirteen year olds. Lots of monkeys jumping around and some cool special effects. Those of us who have seen the original and know that it was an intellectually effective movie, should generally be disappointed with this sad re-make. Don't get me wrong, the apes were cool looking and the special effects were decent. In fact, take the monkeys of today and put them in the Charleton Heston film 34 years ago and you'd really have something. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone so I won't, but what is the deal with the end? Those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about. This is a perfect example of poor story telling, from completely undeveloped characters who suddenly play a somewhat surprisingly important role in the protagonists actions, to scenes which have even the most intelligent of critics at a loss (in reference to the end).I gave this movie 6 out of 10 because as I said, the monkeys are cool. I love Tim Roth and they obviously spent a great deal of time teaching the actors to act as apes. However, this is never enough to make up for a bad story (those apes evolved awfully fast). See it if you wish, but if you wish to see an updated Charleton Heston picture, don't bother. Just watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you'll love it or hate it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite many of the earlier comments here, the 2001-model "Planet of the Apes" is very much a Tim Burton movie. If you liked his earlier material, you ought to love this one. All of his usual trademarks are here; wild visuals, freaky settings, great music (courtesy of a slightly-more-restrained-than-usual Danny Elfman), and a sense of atmosphere that borrows from Art Deco, old vampire movies, and a few spectacularly bad acid trips. Of course, his OTHER trademarks are here, too: Minimal (or No) attention to telling a coherent story, one-dimensional characterizations (usually excepting the main character), and undeveloped themes. If you think about it, he hasn't really told a solid story with a beginning, middle, and end since "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" back in 1985! If you're a Burton fan (like me), you've overlooked these weaknesses in his earlier gems like "Edward Scissorhands," "Batman," and "Beetlejuice." And I predict that you'll do so again when you see his newest creation.However, if you're not willing to play ball Burton's way, you'll probably hate this with a passion. SPOILERS FOLLOW!There are more holes in the plot than there are in every other movie you've ever seen combined. (How did Davidson travel from Saturn to Earth so quickly at the end? And in a tiny ship that's apparently built for traveling short distances? And can't possibly have been designed to survive atmospheric entry? Why did everyone who went through the Magnetic field end up in vastly different time periods, while the Planet was always in the same place in its orbit? Doesn't it move? Or does the field move with it? And where did the horses come from? Maybe they were on the ship too? As part of another set of ill-defined experiments?). But these plot problems didn't bother me any more than the origin of the ice blocks that Edward Scissorhands kept in his castle, or the way that Vicky Vale's camera magically appeared every time she needed it. As I said, you can either overlook Burton's lack of attention to the plot, or not.Character developments and motivations are all over the place. Much of the dialogue is cringe-inducing. The only actors who give memorable performances are in the ape costumes (Tim Roth, Helena Bonham-Carter, Michael Clarke-Duncan, and Paul Giamatti in particular); the human characters seemed to be a distant afterthought, almost as if Burton wanted to make a movie with an all-ape cast, then decided much later that it couldn't work. Mark Wahlberg, brilliant in "Boogie Nights" and "Three Kings," seems out of his element here. He doesn't exactly do a bad job, he just seems unclear on what his character is supposed to be doing. The script doesn't even give him a single moment of surprise when he first sees talking apes and the cities they've built.And you'll either love the ending or hate it. I thought it was great, even if it didn't make much sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton can deny it all he wants, but Planet of the Apes (2001) really is a re-make... and a poor one at that.But even without comparing it to the original (which is far superior in too many ways to even begin listing here), I can honestly say that this movie left a bad taste in my mouth, and dreams in my head of how I would better spend the 6 dollars I wasted if I ever run into the studio exec who gave this film the green light and demanded that he pay me back.The movie drags on and on, and quickly overstays its welcome. What few special effects are in the movie (make-up, set design, and stunts are totally separate categories, and should never be included under the heading of "visual effects") could have been much better. The ape makeup is Oscar-quality good, and is perhaps the only thing in the movie worth noting.The story seems like someone accidently dropped the screenplay into a wood chipper, randomly taped pieces of it back together, and then tried to shoot the movie from that: The story leaves us wondering too many things that are not explained, and most of what is explained is downright laughable. This movie is funny when it tries to be serious, and never funny when it tries to be humorous. I was so bored watching this, I tried counting (and lost track of) all the plot holes, but the big one at the end completely made me lose faith in this movie as anything but a 99-cent corner store rental to watch with your friends during a night of serious drinking games.Excellent talent like Tim Roth, Paul Giamatti, Michael Clark Duncan, and Charlton Heston (and even the far less-tolerable, media flavors-of-the-month "Marky Mark" Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter, whose names we probably won't even remember in two years) are wasted in this contrived piece of junk. I never once felt anything for any of the characters in the film... except maybe sympathy for being trapped in such a lousy movie.This film is extremely unrealistic (even assuming that you accept the idea that evolved apes have formed a civilization, which itself is an excellent premise for a film, but a premise that could have - SHOULD have - been handled much better than this movie does it).In a summer boxoffice where intelligent dinosaurs roam, a misunderstood ogar finds love, and deceased Egyptians seek vengence, Planet of the Apes (2001) brings nothing of interest or quality to the table. I usually come out of a big-budgeted, heavily-marketed, action/effects movie ready to get right back in line and see it again. But this movie made me wish I'd never gotten in line to see it in the first place.</fullReview>

Luckily I watched it for myself. Whew!!!! What a creepy ending!!! I walked out of the theater thinking about it. It kind of gave me that eerie feeling like the end of the Blair Witch Project. I think Tim Burton took the right direction in going this route with the ending. When I thought about it it made sense to catch us off guard with this version to the end. I mean if you saw the original Planet Of The Apes you already knew what to expect for the remake but Burton fooled us all and I think some of you fan-critics do not like being catched off guard like that. Despite the fact the battle at the end was stop short due to a "MONKEY" arrival and despite the fact that Estella Warren was the only "female human" that looked like she had access to a hair stlylest and a makeup person this movie was AWESOME. You know whats scary....after watching Sleepy Hollow and Planet Of The Apes, Tim Burton is starting to grow on me. Damn!!! I never thought I would say that....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: May contain minor spoilers!( C+ ) I have mixed feelings about this movie, but overall impression is negative. It definitely was not what I thought it would be. and what it could have been if not for some painfully obvious flaws. And despite the `re-imaging' it is still inferior to the original 60's version. Simply, it doesn't offer much more than what I've already seen in the trailer.One thing is true: the movie did have some amazing special effects and the makeup. Both of these crews did a phenomenal job. The make-up effects were simply extraordinary, and of course, far better than in the original. But again, with the budget they had, the high expectations from the public and the special effects and make-up wizardry we've already seen in the movies, we already expected it to be great. I have only one complaint: the artists tried to make the female apes too feminine and human-like. Simply put, the make up for the female apes wasn't as convincing as the make up for the males, but no big deal.When I first saw the trailer, I was astounded. However, one thing bothered me ever since then, and it was the human characters-more particularly, their appearance. They were all. too pretty. Handsome. Beautiful. This had always set off an alarm in my head, especially if I have high expectations for a movie, like I had for the Apes. Such smooth and pretty faces are all right in such small TV shows like The Relic Hunter or Xena: Warrior Princess. But in a huge sci-fi motion picture like Apes, I expect some reasonable detail and realism. And as the movie progressed, I found that the apes were more believable than the humans and that's not necessarily a good thing, since I know I should be rooting for the humans, but I just didn't feel any sympathy towards them. The characters seemed shallow, and the only real feelings and emotions that I encountered in the movie, were those of the apes.Imagine: you find yourself in a word that has been turned upside-down, and suddenly you're a slave to the apes. You eat whatever they give you. You sleep whenever you're not needed. You work hard. You wear the same clothes everyday, and you haven't bathed in a very long time, or haven't had the chance to practice any kind of hygiene for that matter. And to add to the list, you're beaten and kept in an atrocious environment. Then, you happen to stumble upon a mirror. how would you think you'd look like? Well, if you happen to be a male, I can almost guarantee that you wouldn't walk around clean-shaven, with a nice, smooth and bright complexion. And if you're a female, your hair won't be nice and curly (even if the curls are natural, they wouldn't look too good), and you would have light traces of lipstick or any kind of makeup. And here's where Tim Burton really disappointed me, because I've always thought of him as a director who pays attention to detail. However, the slaves almost shine for goodness-sake! The only reasonably believable character was Kris Kristofferson's character, but unfortunately, he's not in the movie long.The human clothes are torn, dirty and so on. But notice the `beauty' in this movie: Daena, played by Estella Warren (I'm not really sure if this character was necessary. I rather think not). Yes, her clothes are dirty and ragged, but conveniently crafted as well. It's as though, these slaves had their own fashion designer that was forced to work with dirty scraps of material, but still managed to create a nice little dress with a cut to show cleavage and nicely narrowed in the waist to accentuate her great body, and cut nice and high to show her great legs. Like I said before, that's all great for a little TV show like Xena or Relic Hunter, but here of course, I expected higher quality filmmaking.Mark Wahlberg was good, but he wasn't great. I didn't think he projected his emotions well, because I didn't feel his pain, or shock. To think that Wahlberg's character encounters not just talking apes, but loud, human-size, scary-looking talking apes. If that's not enough to defecate in your own pants, I don't know what is. But Wahlberg's character gets over this realization unusually quickly.The movie was worth seeing just for the apes. Not only were the makeup and costumes terrific, but also the actors underneath it all. Two apes in particular stick in mind: Thade (played by Tim Roth) and Limbo (played by Paul Giamatti) used effectively as a comic relief. Both roles were very convincing and the makeup on these particular apes was incredible. But Thade, the evil General, impressed me the most. I thought it was a great character, superb makeup and phenomenal acting by Tim Roth.And finally comes the ending. Understandably, there is nothing the writers of this movie, or Tim Burton could have done to overwhelm the ending of the 1968 version-that movie delivered a punch in the gut like few movies have. It was possibly one of the greatest, most powerful endings of all time. But what they have done in this version is simply ridicules. This movie would not have been so bad if not for the last few minutes of the film (which feel incredibly rushed) and a pathetic attempt shock the audience in some new way. I think they failed miserably and I found the ending laughable rather than shocking.Overall, the movie wasn't bad but it was very disappointing. The visuals were great, and so were the apes, but everything else seems to need a lot of work. Too bad-it really could have been something great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one who reveres the 1968 original, I admit to approaching this "reconstruction" with some amount of skepticism, but I was determined to go in with an open mind. I tried to like it but in the end I'd have to deem this attempt at a new "Apes" as a disappointment.Sure, Tim Burton's masterful visual style and Danny Elfman's evocative musical scoring are in full effect as always, but in service to a mediocre script that plays like a typical action movie. The pointed social commentary of the original film, released at the height of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War is not quite as effective here.Sure, there's also a couple of plot twists that rival the final revelation of the original. A couple of classic lines from the original are cleverly worked in, and Charlton Heston, who carried the first picture and made us believe in the story, this time plays an ape. Nice touch!But the bottom line is, there's nothing new here to justify the time and expense of this film. I expected more from Tim Burton!</fullReview>

The continuity problems were a constant, and I do mean CONSTANT distraction.

Hands down, the technical Oscars will be gobbled up by this movie and deservedly so. Despite all of the flaws, the work put in by Mr. Baker and the actors themselves &lt;Tim Roth was, as always, fantastic&gt; to give a complete and realistic image of a talking monkey made 'Apes' worth the trip. Just don't go in there expecting anything more than a technical spectacle and you should be fine. Me? I expected so much more.... and I wish the kid had been left to the apes.

Imagine, taking the three main Star Wars movies, and crushing them all into a two hour movie-would you have any idea of what was going on, or why??? No. This is what Planet of the Apes feels like-rushed. Not to mention, the ending: what was with that??!?!?!?! There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies that I still don't know what happened, or WHY. With this movie, you leave the theater going, "Huh?"

		<fullReview>Well, I'm not going to lie to you but, YES, I did enjoy this movie. The special affects were decent to good, the makeup was excellent, and the scenery had some room for improvement. Characters such as Thade(Roth), Attar(Duncan), and Ari(Carter) were mostly flawless, With my hat going off to Mr. Roth for his more than excellent portrayal of the "Ape General". Leo(Wahlberg) was well... about what I expected from Wahlberg (He was a better Dirk Diggler then Leo Davison), and Daena(Warren) was either to attractive for her part, or should have had more lines, (i may have enjoyed this movie more if her and her family were developed a little more) but whose to complain. This movie also laid good homage to the original '68 version, especially With Heston's small part as Thades father. No matter what others may say, Yes I liked the original just as much, however, i think the whole way the plot unfolded was definitely more complex then its predecessor. This version doesn't only question race(which it may or may not supposed to do), however it definitely questions religion and evolution more. SPOILERS AHEAD I'm not going to bore everyone reading this huge comment on plot summary, because you'll be able to read it in 99% of the other reviews on this movie. SPOILER ALERT On the other hand getting to the ending. Someone please tell me what Burton was thinking. Not that it was bad, but what does he want people to think happened. Some people say it was obvious that it was Earth all along, but could you be sure of it, I distinctly remember seeing two moons ( I even went to see the movie twice just to prove to myself that they were there) It couldn't be earth with 2 moons could it?? So maybe its not earth that they're on the whole time but, first of all where do they get horses, was that the only animal originally there? And how the hell did Thade get to earth and lead a revolution. Does he brake out or is he lead out, and by himself find a way to do space travel to earth, somehow to lead a revolution of apes on earth?Who knows maybe When Leo passed through the electrical storm he passed between parallel universes, or dimensions. Does he even land back on earth? Maybe he lands back on the same planet in the future and they have similar statues to earth??? Am I just looking in to it to far. I wish Tim Burton would just give us a straight answer, Please oh Please, don't ruin it with sequels. Tim if your out there just tell me what you wanted everyone to think, because personally my mind is going in circles trying to pinpoint what the explanation, Hey maybe its just to be left open with the intention to drive us to think about it this much.If any of you see this and have a definite ending reasoning please email it to me.8.5/10 (It had some room for improvement, but it makes you think(For me way to much).)</fullReview>

I think what's so flabbergasting about it's awfulness is it's the same director who brought us Edward Scissor Hands and Sleepy Hollow. How did such cheesy dialog and typical action movie twists and turns get by him. Maybe they should never give large action movies to more artistic smaller budget directors. They get so swallowed up the studio machine protecting it's investment in a franchise and happy meal tie-ins kinda way. I bet someone like John McTiernan might have actually been a better choice. We'll have to see what he does for Rollerball. This movie makes Mighty Joe Young look like a Dickens classic.</fullReview>

I think Tim Burton took the right direction in going this route with the ending. When I thought about it it made sense to catch us off guard with this version to the end. I mean if you saw the original Planet Of The Apes you already knew what to expect for the remake but Burton fooled us all and I think some of you fan-critics do not like being catched off guard like that. Despite the fact the battle at the end was stop short due to a "MONKEY" arrival and despite the fact that Estella Warren was the only "female human" that looked like she had access to a hair stlylest and a makeup person this movie was AWESOME. You know whats scary....after watching Sleepy Hollow and Planet Of The Apes, Tim Burton is starting to grow on me. Damn!!! I never thought I would say that....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with real anticipation considering the great cast, Tim Burton at the helm and thoughts of the classic 1968 original.Anticipation is the only thing this movie offers. It's awful! If they had let me in for free, I would have asked for my "walking in back."The makeup was amazingly good, but 20 minutes into the movie, the great special effects could not make up for what was painfully obvious. The plot and script were just downright laughable!This is a "see jane run" script and plot nearly all the way. Really, it's that bad. No... on second thought, it's worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: May contain minor spoilers!( C+ ) I have mixed feelings about this movie, but overall impression is negative. It definitely was not what I thought it would be. and what it could have been if not for some painfully obvious flaws. And despite the `re-imaging' it is still inferior to the original 60's version. Simply, it doesn't offer much more than what I've already seen in the trailer.One thing is true: the movie did have some amazing special effects and the makeup. Both of these crews did a phenomenal job. The make-up effects were simply extraordinary, and of course, far better than in the original. But again, with the budget they had, the high expectations from the public and the special effects and make-up wizardry we've already seen in the movies, we already expected it to be great. I have only one complaint: the artists tried to make the female apes too feminine and human-like. Simply put, the make up for the female apes wasn't as convincing as the make up for the males, but no big deal.When I first saw the trailer, I was astounded. However, one thing bothered me ever since then, and it was the human characters-more particularly, their appearance. They were all. too pretty. Handsome. Beautiful. This had always set off an alarm in my head, especially if I have high expectations for a movie, like I had for the Apes. Such smooth and pretty faces are all right in such small TV shows like The Relic Hunter or Xena: Warrior Princess. But in a huge sci-fi motion picture like Apes, I expect some reasonable detail and realism. And as the movie progressed, I found that the apes were more believable than the humans and that's not necessarily a good thing, since I know I should be rooting for the humans, but I just didn't feel any sympathy towards them. The characters seemed shallow, and the only real feelings and emotions that I encountered in the movie, were those of the apes.Imagine: you find yourself in a word that has been turned upside-down, and suddenly you're a slave to the apes. You eat whatever they give you. You sleep whenever you're not needed. You work hard. You wear the same clothes everyday, and you haven't bathed in a very long time, or haven't had the chance to practice any kind of hygiene for that matter. And to add to the list, you're beaten and kept in an atrocious environment. Then, you happen to stumble upon a mirror. how would you think you'd look like? Well, if you happen to be a male, I can almost guarantee that you wouldn't walk around clean-shaven, with a nice, smooth and bright complexion. And if you're a female, your hair won't be nice and curly (even if the curls are natural, they wouldn't look too good), and you would have light traces of lipstick or any kind of makeup. And here's where Tim Burton really disappointed me, because I've always thought of him as a director who pays attention to detail. However, the slaves almost shine for goodness-sake! The only reasonably believable character was Kris Kristofferson's character, but unfortunately, he's not in the movie long.The human clothes are torn, dirty and so on. But notice the `beauty' in this movie: Daena, played by Estella Warren (I'm not really sure if this character was necessary. I rather think not). Yes, her clothes are dirty and ragged, but conveniently crafted as well. It's as though, these slaves had their own fashion designer that was forced to work with dirty scraps of material, but still managed to create a nice little dress with a cut to show cleavage and nicely narrowed in the waist to accentuate her great body, and cut nice and high to show her great legs. Like I said before, that's all great for a little TV show like Xena or Relic Hunter, but here of course, I expected higher quality filmmaking.Mark Wahlberg was good, but he wasn't great. I didn't think he projected his emotions well, because I didn't feel his pain, or shock. To think that Wahlberg's character encounters not just talking apes, but loud, human-size, scary-looking talking apes. If that's not enough to defecate in your own pants, I don't know what is. But Wahlberg's character gets over this realization unusually quickly.The movie was worth seeing just for the apes. Not only were the makeup and costumes terrific, but also the actors underneath it all. Two apes in particular stick in mind: Thade (played by Tim Roth) and Limbo (played by Paul Giamatti) used effectively as a comic relief. Both roles were very convincing and the makeup on these particular apes was incredible. But Thade, the evil General, impressed me the most. I thought it was a great character, superb makeup and phenomenal acting by Tim Roth.And finally comes the ending. Understandably, there is nothing the writers of this movie, or Tim Burton could have done to overwhelm the ending of the 1968 version-that movie delivered a punch in the gut like few movies have. It was possibly one of the greatest, most powerful endings of all time. But what they have done in this version is simply ridicules. This movie would not have been so bad if not for the last few minutes of the film (which feel incredibly rushed) and a pathetic attempt shock the audience in some new way. I think they failed miserably and I found the ending laughable rather than shocking.Overall, the movie wasn't bad but it was very disappointing. The visuals were great, and so were the apes, but everything else seems to need a lot of work. Too bad-it really could have been something great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one who reveres the 1968 original, I admit to approaching this "reconstruction" with some amount of skepticism, but I was determined to go in with an open mind. I tried to like it but in the end I'd have to deem this attempt at a new "Apes" as a disappointment.Sure, Tim Burton's masterful visual style and Danny Elfman's evocative musical scoring are in full effect as always, but in service to a mediocre script that plays like a typical action movie. The pointed social commentary of the original film, released at the height of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War is not quite as effective here.Sure, there's also a couple of plot twists that rival the final revelation of the original. A couple of classic lines from the original are cleverly worked in, and Charlton Heston, who carried the first picture and made us believe in the story, this time plays an ape. Nice touch!But the bottom line is, there's nothing new here to justify the time and expense of this film. I expected more from Tim Burton!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was, well, not too good. Okay, I'll admit, the actors did good monkey imitations, but that's about ALL that went well with this film. The characters were unbelievable, seeing as they made stupid, spur-of-the-moment decisions that tended to make no sense whatsoever. The plot was also a mess. Imagine, taking the three main Star Wars movies, and crushing them all into a two hour movie-would you have any idea of what was going on, or why??? No. This is what Planet of the Apes feels like-rushed. Not to mention, the ending: what was with that??!?!?!?! There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies that I still don't know what happened, or WHY. With this movie, you leave the theater going, "Huh?" It's not a great way to spend 2 hours, trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm not going to lie to you but, YES, I did enjoy this movie. The special affects were decent to good, the makeup was excellent, and the scenery had some room for improvement. Characters such as Thade(Roth), Attar(Duncan), and Ari(Carter) were mostly flawless, With my hat going off to Mr. Roth for his more than excellent portrayal of the "Ape General". Leo(Wahlberg) was well... about what I expected from Wahlberg (He was a better Dirk Diggler then Leo Davison), and Daena(Warren) was either to attractive for her part, or should have had more lines, (i may have enjoyed this movie more if her and her family were developed a little more) but whose to complain. This movie also laid good homage to the original '68 version, especially With Heston's small part as Thades father. No matter what others may say, Yes I liked the original just as much, however, i think the whole way the plot unfolded was definitely more complex then its predecessor. This version doesn't only question race(which it may or may not supposed to do), however it definitely questions religion and evolution more. SPOILERS AHEAD I'm not going to bore everyone reading this huge comment on plot summary, because you'll be able to read it in 99% of the other reviews on this movie. SPOILER ALERT On the other hand getting to the ending. Someone please tell me what Burton was thinking. Not that it was bad, but what does he want people to think happened. Some people say it was obvious that it was Earth all along, but could you be sure of it, I distinctly remember seeing two moons ( I even went to see the movie twice just to prove to myself that they were there) It couldn't be earth with 2 moons could it?? So maybe its not earth that they're on the whole time but, first of all where do they get horses, was that the only animal originally there? And how the hell did Thade get to earth and lead a revolution. Does he brake out or is he lead out, and by himself find a way to do space travel to earth, somehow to lead a revolution of apes on earth?Who knows maybe When Leo passed through the electrical storm he passed between parallel universes, or dimensions. Does he even land back on earth? Maybe he lands back on the same planet in the future and they have similar statues to earth??? Am I just looking in to it to far.

		<fullReview>This movie was, well, not too good. Okay, I'll admit, the actors did good monkey imitations, but that's about ALL that went well with this film. The characters were unbelievable, seeing as they made stupid, spur-of-the-moment decisions that tended to make no sense whatsoever. The plot was also a mess. Imagine, taking the three main Star Wars movies, and crushing them all into a two hour movie-would you have any idea of what was going on, or why??? No. This is what Planet of the Apes feels like-rushed. Not to mention, the ending: what was with that??!?!?!?! There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies that I still don't know what happened, or WHY. With this movie, you leave the theater going, "Huh?" It's not a great way to spend 2 hours, trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm not going to lie to you but, YES, I did enjoy this movie. The special affects were decent to good, the makeup was excellent, and the scenery had some room for improvement. Characters such as Thade(Roth), Attar(Duncan), and Ari(Carter) were mostly flawless, With my hat going off to Mr. Roth for his more than excellent portrayal of the "Ape General". Leo(Wahlberg) was well... about what I expected from Wahlberg (He was a better Dirk Diggler then Leo Davison), and Daena(Warren) was either to attractive for her part, or should have had more lines, (i may have enjoyed this movie more if her and her family were developed a little more) but whose to complain. This movie also laid good homage to the original '68 version, especially With Heston's small part as Thades father. No matter what others may say, Yes I liked the original just as much, however, i think the whole way the plot unfolded was definitely more complex then its predecessor. This version doesn't only question race(which it may or may not supposed to do), however it definitely questions religion and evolution more. SPOILERS AHEAD I'm not going to bore everyone reading this huge comment on plot summary, because you'll be able to read it in 99% of the other reviews on this movie. SPOILER ALERT On the other hand getting to the ending. Someone please tell me what Burton was thinking. Not that it was bad, but what does he want people to think happened. Some people say it was obvious that it was Earth all along, but could you be sure of it, I distinctly remember seeing two moons ( I even went to see the movie twice just to prove to myself that they were there) It couldn't be earth with 2 moons could it?? So maybe its not earth that they're on the whole time but, first of all where do they get horses, was that the only animal originally there? And how the hell did Thade get to earth and lead a revolution. Does he brake out or is he lead out, and by himself find a way to do space travel to earth, somehow to lead a revolution of apes on earth?Who knows maybe When Leo passed through the electrical storm he passed between parallel universes, or dimensions. Does he even land back on earth? Maybe he lands back on the same planet in the future and they have similar statues to earth??? Am I just looking in to it to far. I wish Tim Burton would just give us a straight answer, Please oh Please, don't ruin it with sequels. Tim if your out there just tell me what you wanted everyone to think, because personally my mind is going in circles trying to pinpoint what the explanation, Hey maybe its just to be left open with the intention to drive us to think about it this much.If any of you see this and have a definite ending reasoning please email it to me.8.5/10 (It had some room for improvement, but it makes you think(For me way to much).)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been... but it isn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: May contain minor spoilers!( C+ ) I have mixed feelings about this movie, but overall impression is negative. It definitely was not what I thought it would be. and what it could have been if not for some painfully obvious flaws. And despite the `re-imaging' it is still inferior to the original 60's version. Simply, it doesn't offer much more than what I've already seen in the trailer.One thing is true: the movie did have some amazing special effects and the makeup. Both of these crews did a phenomenal job. The make-up effects were simply extraordinary, and of course, far better than in the original. But again, with the budget they had, the high expectations from the public and the special effects and make-up wizardry we've already seen in the movies, we already expected it to be great. I have only one complaint: the artists tried to make the female apes too feminine and human-like. Simply put, the make up for the female apes wasn't as convincing as the make up for the males, but no big deal.When I first saw the trailer, I was astounded. However, one thing bothered me ever since then, and it was the human characters-more particularly, their appearance. They were all. too pretty. Handsome. Beautiful. This had always set off an alarm in my head, especially if I have high expectations for a movie, like I had for the Apes. Such smooth and pretty faces are all right in such small TV shows like The Relic Hunter or Xena: Warrior Princess. But in a huge sci-fi motion picture like Apes, I expect some reasonable detail and realism. And as the movie progressed, I found that the apes were more believable than the humans and that's not necessarily a good thing, since I know I should be rooting for the humans, but I just didn't feel any sympathy towards them. The characters seemed shallow, and the only real feelings and emotions that I encountered in the movie, were those of the apes.Imagine: you find yourself in a word that has been turned upside-down, and suddenly you're a slave to the apes. You eat whatever they give you. You sleep whenever you're not needed. You work hard. You wear the same clothes everyday, and you haven't bathed in a very long time, or haven't had the chance to practice any kind of hygiene for that matter. And to add to the list, you're beaten and kept in an atrocious environment. Then, you happen to stumble upon a mirror. how would you think you'd look like? Well, if you happen to be a male, I can almost guarantee that you wouldn't walk around clean-shaven, with a nice, smooth and bright complexion. And if you're a female, your hair won't be nice and curly (even if the curls are natural, they wouldn't look too good), and you would have light traces of lipstick or any kind of makeup. And here's where Tim Burton really disappointed me, because I've always thought of him as a director who pays attention to detail. However, the slaves almost shine for goodness-sake! The only reasonably believable character was Kris Kristofferson's character, but unfortunately, he's not in the movie long.The human clothes are torn, dirty and so on. But notice the `beauty' in this movie: Daena, played by Estella Warren (I'm not really sure if this character was necessary. I rather think not). Yes, her clothes are dirty and ragged, but conveniently crafted as well. It's as though, these slaves had their own fashion designer that was forced to work with dirty scraps of material, but still managed to create a nice little dress with a cut to show cleavage and nicely narrowed in the waist to accentuate her great body, and cut nice and high to show her great legs. Like I said before, that's all great for a little TV show like Xena or Relic Hunter, but here of course, I expected higher quality filmmaking.Mark Wahlberg was good, but he wasn't great. I didn't think he projected his emotions well, because I didn't feel his pain, or shock. To think that Wahlberg's character encounters not just talking apes, but loud, human-size, scary-looking talking apes. If that's not enough to defecate in your own pants, I don't know what is. But Wahlberg's character gets over this realization unusually quickly.The movie was worth seeing just for the apes. Not only were the makeup and costumes terrific, but also the actors underneath it all. Two apes in particular stick in mind: Thade (played by Tim Roth) and Limbo (played by Paul Giamatti) used effectively as a comic relief. Both roles were very convincing and the makeup on these particular apes was incredible. But Thade, the evil General, impressed me the most. I thought it was a great character, superb makeup and phenomenal acting by Tim Roth.And finally comes the ending. Understandably, there is nothing the writers of this movie, or Tim Burton could have done to overwhelm the ending of the 1968 version-that movie delivered a punch in the gut like few movies have. It was possibly one of the greatest, most powerful endings of all time. But what they have done in this version is simply ridicules. This movie would not have been so bad if not for the last few minutes of the film (which feel incredibly rushed) and a pathetic attempt shock the audience in some new way. I think they failed miserably and I found the ending laughable rather than shocking.Overall, the movie wasn't bad but it was very disappointing. The visuals were great, and so were the apes, but everything else seems to need a lot of work. Too bad-it really could have been something great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pedestrian Planet of the Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one who reveres the 1968 original, I admit to approaching this "reconstruction" with some amount of skepticism, but I was determined to go in with an open mind. I tried to like it but in the end I'd have to deem this attempt at a new "Apes" as a disappointment.Sure, Tim Burton's masterful visual style and Danny Elfman's evocative musical scoring are in full effect as always, but in service to a mediocre script that plays like a typical action movie. The pointed social commentary of the original film, released at the height of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War is not quite as effective here.Sure, there's also a couple of plot twists that rival the final revelation of the original. A couple of classic lines from the original are cleverly worked in, and Charlton Heston, who carried the first picture and made us believe in the story, this time plays an ape. Nice touch!But the bottom line is, there's nothing new here to justify the time and expense of this film. I expected more from Tim Burton!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I won't pretend to be a professional critic... just a guy who saw a terrible movie. I'd been hot to see 'Apes' since it was first announced so I went to see it on opening night. When the lights came back up I sat still, stunned at the atrocity I had just witnessed.Let me see if I have everything right... the days on this planet are what... 100 hours long and the planet itself is sometimes huge, other times somewhat larger than a football field, but not by much. The continuity problems were a constant, and I do mean CONSTANT distraction. The story line was insulting to even the most forgiving sci-fi fan and the acting, well... for the humans it was tepid at best.Now... the apes themselves. Hands down, the technical Oscars will be gobbled up by this movie and deservedly so. Despite all of the flaws, the work put in by Mr. Baker and the actors themselves &lt;Tim Roth was, as always, fantastic&gt; to give a complete and realistic image of a talking monkey made 'Apes' worth the trip. Just don't go in there expecting anything more than a technical spectacle and you should be fine. Me? I expected so much more.... and I wish the kid had been left to the apes.

		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say I liked the film... in spite of all the problems I had with it.The ape make-up rocked! If not for Ari's (Helen Bonham Carter) "too human" make-up, it wouldn't take you too long to forget that they were actors only made up to look like apes. Tim Roth WAS Thade! Both Tim Roth as General Thade and Paul Giamatti as Limbo deserve a nod come Oscar time. Unfortunately the majority of the cast looked as though they were phoning it in.In a couple of scenes you could see that Estella Warren was wearing heavy lip gloss but this could be a cinematography problem as in another scene it appeared as Mark Wahlberg was also wearing lip gloss.As for the story, it is one that a non sci-fi fan would assume was "good" science fiction, however it wasn't. The plot had holes the size of Texas and there was no sign that anyone had tried to fill them. The original movie ended with a "Gosh WOW!" and this one ended with a "what the f..., HUH?" I can still remember coming out of the theatre after seeing the orginal for the first time with a sense of wonder. Of course that was back in a time when the thought of the human race nuking itself to oblivion wasn't that big a stretch. I was thinking about the ending of that film for weeks, I doubt I'll be thinking about the ending of this one tomorrow. One good thing to say about the ending is that it more closely echos the ending the book "Monkey Planet" by Pierre Boulle than the original film did.Having said all these nasty things, there is still much to enjoy about this film. The direction was very good and the score was delightful. The music over the opening credits was very much an homage to Jerry Goldsmith's original score.One can only hope that the inevitable sequel can shed some light on the confusing ending.</fullReview>

How many more chances will this director get to waste money, talent, and effects. Movie is slow, unexciting, uninspiring, improbable and has numerous plot holes.

I liked the movie for the most part, a good 70% of the movie. There are some really bad scenes, but they're mostly countered by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter role as Ari. I dunno, but she's the sexiest Chimpanzee I've ever seen. Almost to the point of contemplating beastiality. But does Ari count? Thank god it was a movie. The best way to enjoy the film is to think of it as a Twilight Zone episode. i think it pays a great homage to Rod Serling (co-writer of the 1968 original) and his strange, almost predictable, but twisted endings. Go see it if you're a Burton fan, and/or if you liked Sleepy Hollow. 7 points.</fullReview>

When I heard that 20th Cent. Fox rushed this movie for a summer release I started to get worried. Out of all the summer movies this year (which has been a horrible year for movies) this ranks up there with The Score. THe make-up is some of the best you will ever see and the one of the fun things to do is to guess who is playing the ape.

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I am a huge Tim Burton fan. I consider his visions on film absolutely fantastic! I see Tim's hand in about the first 2/3rds of this film.The last 1/3rd seems like the work of "suits" rather than "artists. While the film has a certain awesome visual style-give Rick Baker the Academy Award for Makeup right now-we are constantly challenged to suspend disbelief for shallow plot points and trite dialog. Forget character development. Forget logic and check your brain with your ticket stub. The ending (which I will not reveal here so as not to spoil for those who have not seen yet) is a nightmare. I understand that there were possibly 5-7 different endings- maybe a DVD Special Edition or definitive director's cut could make more sense than this "barrel of monkeys." Hollywood get original. Less effects more story. No more sequels - I'm feeling sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No apes were harmed in the making of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of disclaimer I expected in the credits. That's the level of the humor here. The make-up was absolutely incredible. The design of the ape soldiers awesome. The script? Sit in a room for five minutes with a couple of friends. Think of a few everyday human situations. Now think of the same situation with an ape in it. Write down what you think would happen, (try and be funny about it) - Once you've written a few pages you'll no doubt no have your own version of the Planet of the Apes script sitting right in front of you. Basically a bunch of quickly thought up ape jokes and a story that had characters with shifting, mis-placed, heavy-handed or non-existent motivation.Some examples of why I didn't like this film? SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT PLOT AND ENDING MENTIONED - Who really cared when the boy fell off his horse in the battle if he lived or died? His arrogance got him there, his inept horse riding got him stuck. Why was he even in the film? - There seemed to be a thinly veiled attempt at satire and role reversal on animal rights. But when the humans get a chance what do they do? Bash ape heads in as the apes did to them. What's the story point - The strong survive? Violence with superior numbers is the answer? A mixed message especially when the sympathetic 'hippy' ape is seen helping the humans fight. - The humans out number the apes 4 to 1 we are told early in the film. In the battle we see humans and apes fighting fairly equally. Whose going to win? Hmmmm...So what was the point of this bit again? - Bonham-Carters sympathetic ape comes across as a bleeding heart hippy. Not very likeable. And not very smart. If only she'd played a more political role against the main bad guy Thede instead of straight out verbal confrontation and an embarrassing attempt at seduction later in the film. - It was like a comedy, that wasn't funny. The humour involved taking a human situation, replacing them with an ape, and making them a joke about them using their feet instead of hands (this particular joke was used twice in the film!) - The writers never stopped to question why apes, evolving without human influence, would be playing Basketball in T-shirts? - Sci-Fi films need to create a believable world, no matter how fantastic the setting, in which to tell the story. Way too often I would think 'If they can do this then why don't they do this...' and my mind would wander off. Too many inconsistencies. - The sets looked like sets. - Burton's usual visual eye was not apparent until the battle. - The ending is just stupid. Where did all the helicopters and the fire truck come from. If I'd have laughed at the jokes this would have been the punch line. But I didn't laugh at the jokes and this was an insult. Apes in police hats on motorcycles... I'm hoping it was supposed to be a joke. I just didn't find it funny. END OF SPOILERSFrom the director of 'Mars Attacks' not 'Batman'. It's watchable crap, but like Pearl Harbor, it's crap I'll not recommend to you, nor ever sit through again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about having a monkey on your back..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton delivers once again. When talk first began about an update for "Planet of the Apes" I was taken back when it was first reported that Arnold "The Terminator" Schwartzenegger was tapped to play the lead in the James Cameron directed film. Thank all that is wholly that Burton took over. Could anyone really see Arnold delivering such lines as "get your stinking hands off me you damned dirty ape!" Talk about your comedy films.Burton, who is probably best known for his dark and mysterious works such as "Batman" (the first one and only really worthy one) and "Sleepy Hollow", has scored once again with his retelling of "Planet of the Apes" By showing a certain reverence to the original ( the above referenced line by Heston is now spoken by one of the apes ) as well as certain character names (Nova for one) he has given it an original twist and (although I must admit a somewhat confusing) ending that will have people talking in the breakroom for days about it.The actors, story all of it is first class and well worth the admission price. Remember, these aren't your 1968 apes. Burton has them behaving less human and more ape-like, complete with hanging off the ceiling and grunts and squeals. But then again, when a director like Tim Burton takes on a project as daunting as "Planet of the Apes" he must feel the pressure of having the monkey on his back.This is two hours of make believe that will do just that -- make you believe. enjoy.</fullReview>

With the current level of sophistication we enjoy in special effects and advanced makeup/prosthetic applications there is no excuse whatsoever for shabby makeup and crappy effects. What are we left with after the glitz? Stuntmen jumping 20, 30 and 50 feet into the air again and again and again. That particular effect was so overdone throughout the film as to render it completely flaccid by the end of this piece of garbage. Plot? There was none, really.

		<fullReview>I will give this movie some credit; it's not just a remake, which is probably the best thing it has going for it While the make-up is great, the film ends up being too serious to be campy, too silly to be taken seriously, and there are more loose ends than an unraveled sweater. (Which are sure to be tied up by the obviously sequel that the end sets up)Mark Walberg's tries to find his monkey and lands on a planet where Monkeys are superior and humans are the lesser primate. The make-up is astounding, and Mark proves to be a pretty good no-brain action star. Tim Roths is a pretty good monkey-gone-bad, but as I said before, this movies too silly to be taken seriously and his intense performance is kind of lost.After it's revealed how the monkeys got the way they were, (and why their english was so good) the plot just get's silly and builds up too a fairly laughable ending. The blond girl, Estelle, isn't bad as far as models-turned-actresses go, but her character serves no purpose other than to give 14 year old boys something to look at. Plus, even with more makeup than the cast of Cats used for 20 years, the best apes-actor is still the real thing, Mark's chimp Pericles, who gives a better performance than half his human-cousins.It's not a bad movie, it's a style-over-substance movie, but hell, so's most everything else that's at the theater. But underneath the latex it's just a campy monkey movie destined for cult stardom.To quote Troy Mclure "I guess you made a monkey out of me!"</fullReview>

Did you really expect a movie about angry talking monkeys to be a masterpiece? Yes, it has it's flaws, but for the most part was well executed. Tom Rothwas pure evil, some have said that he was "too evil", but isn't that the point of a super-villain? His character was over the top, and I loved it. The only real flaw for me was that Mark Whalberg kept slipping into Dirk Diggler, but I was able to ignore him for most of the film. As for the ending, it was great. I don't think that it was supposed to be logical, so stop whining! It was a great over the top way to end an over the top film/concept. So...go see it, expect to be entertained, not educated and you will love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this is a fine film and deserving of better treatment than its gotten here. Tim Burton brings his unique bag of tricks to a film that is perhaps uniquely suited to them. His dark Gothic visuals blend surprisingly well with the topic. The plot contains much of his trademark satire, which replace the heavy moralising of the first film and makes for lighter, more summereaque fare. The cast has its ups{Helana Bonham Carter and Tim Roth being the standouts} and downs {most of the human actors seem to be chosen for their physical archetypes}. The Danny Elfman music is superb as always, adding to the powerful action scenes which stress the sheer physical strength pf the apes . The only major criticism I have is the bizarre ending, which does come as a small shock to those who haven't had it given away for them by some useless trailer trash. But it doesn't mesh well with the rest of the film and actually to me makes a sequel harder to visuallize. All in all, I think this movie is the most entertaining film this summer {altho' that's not saying a lot}, worth your time and money and deserving of better reviewers {both for and against} than have been shown here so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but.... (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say that I found the original overrated. Not bad, but not a 'classic'. When I heard they were remaking it, with Cameron at the helm, I was extremely worried (I dislike everything the man's done in the 90's, with the exception of True Lies, which was fun). When it turned out to be Tim Burton, I felt that maybe he could make this movie truly 'relevant', with sharp satire, and perhaps a little human development. Alas, it wasn't to be. Understand that I think that Burton is a director who's style often overwhelms the substance of any film he's shooting (note, see Sleepy Hollow). That said, he brings enormous creative energy to the film, and is to be respected for massing the talented crew he has. I'm glad to hear the people mentioned Danny Elfman's score, his best. It hooks you from beginning to end, and has the strength to become a contender at this year's oscars. Thunderous, rousing, brilliant, the score is better written then the script for eliciting a dramatic response. Special credit must be given to Rick Baker, the only Hollywood make-up artist whom I've heard of (he's acheived a celebrity status if you will). His simian creations are remarkable, and allow the actors to act through their make-up. Well, that would be more true if the actors had something to act. The script makes no attempt to achieve any form of nuance or subtlety. It eschews what could have been a satire, and asks us to accept fight scenes and stunt work. Discussing the stunt work, it is phenomenal as well. Again, the technical achievements of this film are not to be ignored. The film is fairly entertaining UNTIL..... The climax. What is supposed to be a pulse-pounding scene proves to be a series of cliches, and a horrible use of deux ex machina, and the ending is fairly silly and unnecessary. As for the actors, many attempt to act, but many have nothing to do (the humans). However, the performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are excellent. No kidding, but I think Roth deserves an oscar nomination (as it stands now). His scenery chewing performance as General Thade is energetic and outstanding. Having said that, expect this to win a make-up oscar, and receive a nomination for best score, but it's not a film to rush out and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton presents a magnificent movie for the eyes, but alas opts for the usual poor screen play. I left the movie feeling that I had been well entertained. The magicpecial effects, make-up, musical score all produce a feast of movie fantasy. The ape-ing is inspired. Tim Roth, as the fanatical Chimp General, is worth the price of admission alone. Paul Giamatti has some nice moments, but no-one else is given much to do except to imitate apes or fearful humans. The female chimps look too much like the original Kim Hunter, bereft of facial hair and facial creases.As usual with these kinds of movies the throw away line is ever present, and some make for a good snicker or two. I wonder how many people caught the irony of Charlton Heston defending gun control!It's really best to see this movie with your inner child on your lap, and leave the critical adult home. This is especially true for the ending which gives a momentary smile of pleasure at it's salute to the original, as long as one doesn't think about how it doesn't make any sense!</fullReview>

Wahlberg justdoesn't have the majesty of Heston in the original, and comesacross as a teenager locked in the monkey cage of the zoo afterdark. Estella Warren may show someday that she can act, but youcould have placed any supermodel in her role (my vote is HeidiKlum...but I digress) and had no ill effect on the movie. A puremoney grab for the spin-off ape dolls and the inevitable sequel. Ijust got the impression that there were a lot more connectingscenes that were lopped off in the interests of time (let's hope so,anyway, otherwise Tim Burton's slipped on a major banana peel).

		<fullReview>Like many I had my hopes up when I went to see this film. Like most, I love the original film because it had a great story along with fabulous camera work, music, makeup and costumes. The remake is nothing like the original and I knew that going into it. Burton's Planet of the Apes has great things (set design, matte' paintings, special effects and makeup) in it, but the story and pacing are disappointing. The mood is too claustrophobic. There are no interesting characters (Markey Mark the underwear model can't fill Heston's loin cloth). Cliche's are abundant. Tim Roth's character is a little too evil and over the top. The humans talk and have nothing to say. It would have been preferable to keep them mute like the original. Maybe my point of view has been warped by the excellent 1968 version. Burton's work ended up being one big jumbled mess. I even took a short nap in the middle. My 12 year old son woke me up by grabbing my shoulder and when he saw I was dozing said "oh my god." I guess he liked it (he actually called it "OK" as we departed the theater).</fullReview>

Tim Burton once again proves just how great and Gothic that he can direct a movie, Burton has the darkest touch of anyone in Hollywood. Being a Bigfoot enthusiast a movie like Planet of the Apes is just a must see for me. This movie is more than just about a human who has to battle an ape for the rights to get along on the planet. Apes are shown and portrayed as being very smart and clever Burton must have done his homework as he well showed in this movie for example apes bury their dead and of course they can't swim, and Bigfoots are the same way! I strongly believe that apes and bigfoots are among us all anywhere that is proven with the ending of this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton slips slightly, but still very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new version (I can't quite call it a remake) of a sci fi classic doesn't seem determined to light up brain cells, question our place in nature, or examine our society and our attitude toward "lesser beasts". It's just a good, exciting science fiction adventure film, and on that level, it succeeds quite well with only a few small stumbles.Tim Burton remains the only director I can name who has never made a film I don't like. You might call me biased, but I do go into every new Burton film afraid that this will be the one. Fortunately, I'm still waiting.So why is this not a remake? Well, there are no characters from the original story (either the novel OR the film), and the situation is significantly altered. While still being the story of an astronaut who lands in a strange new ape-dominated world, very little else is the same. Only a few lines of dialogue intended to evoke the 1968 film remind us.What's good? First, of course, is Rick Baker's absolutely astounding makeup. The original appliances still stand up quite well, so this was a nightmare assignment for any makeup artist. Baker is one of the very few who could handle it, and handle it he does. There has never been such amazingly detailed, expressive work in the history of film; the actors are able to come right through the latex and hair. Too much praise cannot be heaped upon his work. Then there's the patented Tim Burton visual approach; this is easily his best-looking film since "Edward Scissorhands", and really helps to lend the proceedings an otherworldly appearance. The acting from the performers in the roles of apes is uniformly excellent, particularly Tim Roth in one of the most frightening villain roles I've seen in years. He truly gives the impression of being dangerously unpredictable; a genuinely great movie psycho. Mention must also be made of Danny Elfman's score, his most dynamic and interesting in years. It recalls Goldsmith's work just enough to remind us of what we're watching, while also moving into new territory.What doesn't work? Well, the humans. They talk, but have nothing of consequence to say. Why is Estella Warren so much cleaner than everyone else, and where did she get that lipstick? And if she's intended to be a love interest for Wahlberg, shouldn't they have a conversation or two? And sadly, we're given only the barest peek at the ape society before our heroes escape and return to the wilderness. I really would like to have seen more of their culture.Now, the ending has already become much-debated and argued over across the Internet and elsewhere. First off, I like the ending. While it may not have quite the punch of the original's, I think it's a good twist for those going in expecting a twist (and weren't we all?). Without revealing too much, let's just say that the screenwriters have obviously read the novel.In conclusion, this is an entertaining and exciting sci-fi adventure. It won't open up your mind much, and it may not be among Burton's best works, but it's a lot of fun, and has a great deal to admire. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

The original premise was so silly that I thought if there is one movie that did NOT cry out to be remade it was this one. I was incorrect in assuming this. The prosthetic makeup is so much better than the original(you can see the actor's real faces beneath the ape facade)that the biggest hurdle is immediately overcome. Tim Burton excels in working unusual concepts in his film and this is more of the same. Mark Wahlberg fits as the protagonist and while he is not Laurence Olivier the material isn't Shakespeare either. I went expecting little and was pleasantly surprised. With people staying away from the theatre in droves this summer I don't think the film will do that well in the box office but I will recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An good movie with a bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that this version of "Planet of the Apes" is actually pretty good. It's very entertaining. The make-up, the sets, and the battles are all fantastic. The story is also good - up until the end.WARNING!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED!!!!Anyway, when Leo is flying back through the storm and sees earth, THAT is when the movie should've faded to black and rolled the credits. Thade is still alive, and there could be a sequel that begins with what this movie actually ended with.However, this movie ends with a twist that makes no sense. Somehow, we have a statue of Thade in place of the Lincoln Memorial Statue in Washington D.C., and a planet Earth dominated by Apes. It looks like a great ending, but it doesn't add up. We're not given an ounce of evidence that what happened in this ending could've happened at all. It's like, in Back to the Future Part II, how can we NOT see the Doc toss the sports almanac into the trash, NOT see old Biff steal the book, and NOT see old Biff steal the time machine, and yet still have the same plot? It doesn't work unless those three elements are there. Even seeing old Biff just steal the almanac is good enough. But without any elements to explain how in the heck Biff could've changed the present, it would've been poor writing. It's the same with this ending with Planet of the Apes. It's an ending that should've been seen only at the beginning of a sequel, or if there were elements in the movie's plot to explain how in the world Thade could've done what he did. This ending really hurt the movie. Everything was fine up until we see the statue and the Apes wearing police uniforms, handling guns and driving cars. I can accept that this could've somehow happened. But without a sequel, one has to make up numerous stretches to make it work.Sorry Burton, but you never sacrifice substance for style.</fullReview>

I have been waiting to see this film for quite some time. I finally saw it earlier today and I was not disappointed! ***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!!***I really enjoyed almost everything about the film. First, the story was good including the surprise twist ending. The performances from Roth to Wahlberg to Carter to Duncan were all top notch. The special effects were about what I expected with a couple of minor flaws. The settings of the villages were realistic and convincing as well. My one complaint would be that the film was a little dark. I am not referring to the mood either, I mean the actual shots were too dark at certain times but it did not take away from the film overall. Really good movie that I would recommend to any sci-fi fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay by now I'll assume you've heard there is a "surprise" ending for Apes. I mean in the original story it turned out the "planet of the Apes" was Earth all along, so Burton had to avoid that, and he did, nicely, but he then felt obliged to do his own twist ending and that is where the movie falls apart. This movie was an interesting visual journey with a nice background mystery (how did the apes get this way?) although when all is said and done I am left wondering two things: 1- Where did they get all the horses? And 2- Where is Rod Serling in the end shot? I can almost hear him saying "Picture a man far from home..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original Planet of the Apes even though i've been meaning to.I just saw the new version brought out 10 minutes ago and I think it was very well done. I'm sure some changes are made for the reason, unfortunately i've seen the ending of the original.Mark Wahlberg was pretty believable as an astronaut who lands on a planet inhabited as Apes who rule it. Tim Roth's character probably ruled the film as an awesome Tim Burton Villain since the Joker with the original Batman. Nothing alike but still wonderfully played.So far one of the best movies of the summer no doubt.I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fantastic film, the best of the year...so far. I say that because Lord Of The Rings hasn't been released yet. This one had it all, great visual and special effects, and a wise choice to use costumes instead of CGI for the apes. A fantastic cast, great script, and some of the best directing by the one and only Tim Burton, one of my all time favorite directors. I give this film an 8 out of 10, go see it at any price, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

The story is also good - up until the end.WARNING!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED!!!!Anyway, when Leo is flying back through the storm and sees earth, THAT is when the movie should've faded to black and rolled the credits. Thade is still alive, and there could be a sequel that begins with what this movie actually ended with.However, this movie ends with a twist that makes no sense. Somehow, we have a statue of Thade in place of the Lincoln Memorial Statue in Washington D.C., and a planet Earth dominated by Apes. It looks like a great ending, but it doesn't add up. We're not given an ounce of evidence that what happened in this ending could've happened at all. It's like, in Back to the Future Part II, how can we NOT see the Doc toss the sports almanac into the trash, NOT see old Biff steal the book, and NOT see old Biff steal the time machine, and yet still have the same plot? It doesn't work unless those three elements are there. Even seeing old Biff just steal the almanac is good enough. But without any elements to explain how in the heck Biff could've changed the present, it would've been poor writing. It's the same with this ending with Planet of the Apes. It's an ending that should've been seen only at the beginning of a sequel, or if there were elements in the movie's plot to explain how in the world Thade could've done what he did. This ending really hurt the movie. Everything was fine up until we see the statue and the Apes wearing police uniforms, handling guns and driving cars. I can accept that this could've somehow happened. But without a sequel, one has to make up numerous stretches to make it work.Sorry Burton, but you never sacrifice substance for style.</fullReview>

I have been waiting to see this film for quite some time. I finally saw it earlier today and I was not disappointed! ***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!!***I really enjoyed almost everything about the film. First, the story was good including the surprise twist ending. The performances from Roth to Wahlberg to Carter to Duncan were all top notch. The special effects were about what I expected with a couple of minor flaws. The settings of the villages were realistic and convincing as well. My one complaint would be that the film was a little dark. I am not referring to the mood either, I mean the actual shots were too dark at certain times but it did not take away from the film overall.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but.... (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say that I found the original overrated. Not bad, but not a 'classic'. When I heard they were remaking it, with Cameron at the helm, I was extremely worried (I dislike everything the man's done in the 90's, with the exception of True Lies, which was fun). When it turned out to be Tim Burton, I felt that maybe he could make this movie truly 'relevant', with sharp satire, and perhaps a little human development. Alas, it wasn't to be. Understand that I think that Burton is a director who's style often overwhelms the substance of any film he's shooting (note, see Sleepy Hollow). That said, he brings enormous creative energy to the film, and is to be respected for massing the talented crew he has. I'm glad to hear the people mentioned Danny Elfman's score, his best. It hooks you from beginning to end, and has the strength to become a contender at this year's oscars. Thunderous, rousing, brilliant, the score is better written then the script for eliciting a dramatic response. Special credit must be given to Rick Baker, the only Hollywood make-up artist whom I've heard of (he's acheived a celebrity status if you will). His simian creations are remarkable, and allow the actors to act through their make-up. Well, that would be more true if the actors had something to act. The script makes no attempt to achieve any form of nuance or subtlety. It eschews what could have been a satire, and asks us to accept fight scenes and stunt work. Discussing the stunt work, it is phenomenal as well. Again, the technical achievements of this film are not to be ignored. The film is fairly entertaining UNTIL..... The climax. What is supposed to be a pulse-pounding scene proves to be a series of cliches, and a horrible use of deux ex machina, and the ending is fairly silly and unnecessary. As for the actors, many attempt to act, but many have nothing to do (the humans). However, the performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are excellent. No kidding, but I think Roth deserves an oscar nomination (as it stands now). His scenery chewing performance as General Thade is energetic and outstanding. Having said that, expect this to win a make-up oscar, and receive a nomination for best score, but it's not a film to rush out and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film the day it came out with high hopes. My friends told me how great the original was and i could only think of how awesome a writer must be to create such an original story. Oh, i was a fool.Burton has had a successful streak, hasn't he? Batman, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow, and the cult favorite Nightmare Before Christmas. Yes it is an awesome life. But every career has a hitch. This is his. Mark Wahlberg's career has also been rising. From the innovative Boogy Nights, to the highly rated Three Kings and The Perfect Storm with another blockbuster (Rock Star) on the way. Maybe this can be an oversight.No matter the director or the stars, our hero, Leo Davidson cannot see that his ape costars are real actors. Whenever speaking to them, he inserts a short pause, as if trying to prove to himself that these are real people. His eyes are blank and emotionless. He plays a hero just as well as Steven Seagal, take that as you will.The apes are frighteningly lifelike, but you can't base a movie on its makeup. The film is dark, very dark (visually) for the first 3/4. As if these future apes couldn't figure out lightbulbs, or even gas lights. The film also uses the rope and pulley system made popular by the Matrix. While it looked new and exciting in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and even Romeo Must Die, seeing apes jumping vertically eight feet (from a sit down) is just silly.None of the "human" characters, beside Leo, play an important role. It makes you wonder why he's trying to save them. Apes have evolved into intelligent, thought processing individuals over thousands of years... but what happened to the humans? Did we just stop at a certain point in time, and someone said, "This is enough for you"? The ending is so confusing it's physically impossible. Burton rearranges time so much i think HE get's lost. Overall, it's a 4/10- saved by the makeup and the ape's acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton presents a magnificent movie for the eyes, but alas opts for the usual poor screen play. I left the movie feeling that I had been well entertained. The magicpecial effects, make-up, musical score all produce a feast of movie fantasy. The ape-ing is inspired. Tim Roth, as the fanatical Chimp General, is worth the price of admission alone. Paul Giamatti has some nice moments, but no-one else is given much to do except to imitate apes or fearful humans. The female chimps look too much like the original Kim Hunter, bereft of facial hair and facial creases.As usual with these kinds of movies the throw away line is ever present, and some make for a good snicker or two. I wonder how many people caught the irony of Charlton Heston defending gun control!It's really best to see this movie with your inner child on your lap, and leave the critical adult home. This is especially true for the ending which gives a momentary smile of pleasure at it's salute to the original, as long as one doesn't think about how it doesn't make any sense!</fullReview>

We're not given an ounce of evidence that what happened in this ending could've happened at all. It's like, in Back to the Future Part II, how can we NOT see the Doc toss the sports almanac into the trash, NOT see old Biff steal the book, and NOT see old Biff steal the time machine, and yet still have the same plot? It doesn't work unless those three elements are there. Even seeing old Biff just steal the almanac is good enough. But without any elements to explain how in the heck Biff could've changed the present, it would've been poor writing. It's the same with this ending with Planet of the Apes. It's an ending that should've been seen only at the beginning of a sequel, or if there were elements in the movie's plot to explain how in the world Thade could've done what he did. This ending really hurt the movie. Everything was fine up until we see the statue and the Apes wearing police uniforms, handling guns and driving cars. I can accept that this could've somehow happened. But without a sequel, one has to make up numerous stretches to make it work.Sorry Burton, but you never sacrifice substance for style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton Delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say first that I am a huge fan of the original Planet of the Apes. When I first heard that Tim Burton was directing the "remake", I was a little concerned. I have been waiting to see this film for quite some time. I finally saw it earlier today and I was not disappointed! ***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!!***I really enjoyed almost everything about the film. First, the story was good including the surprise twist ending. The performances from Roth to Wahlberg to Carter to Duncan were all top notch. The special effects were about what I expected with a couple of minor flaws. The settings of the villages were realistic and convincing as well. My one complaint would be that the film was a little dark. I am not referring to the mood either, I mean the actual shots were too dark at certain times but it did not take away from the film overall. Really good movie that I would recommend to any sci-fi fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a movie with a textbook example of horrible writing, acting and directing, this is it. This film is packed to the hilt with cliches, unrealistic reactions of characters to their situations, and completely uninteresting characters, with the exception of a couple of the apes. The makeup and production design is of course, very good, but, LESSON TO HOLLYWOOD:::: IF THE SCRIPT AND THE CHARACTERS SUCK, NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO MATTER, NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY AND TECHNICAL TALENT YOU DUMP INTO IT. Whew, glad I got that off my chest. The real tragedy here is that James Cameron was going to direct this at one point. What a shame to think of what could have been....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay by now I'll assume you've heard there is a "surprise" ending for Apes. I mean in the original story it turned out the "planet of the Apes" was Earth all along, so Burton had to avoid that, and he did, nicely, but he then felt obliged to do his own twist ending and that is where the movie falls apart. This movie was an interesting visual journey with a nice background mystery (how did the apes get this way?) although when all is said and done I am left wondering two things: 1- Where did they get all the horses? And 2- Where is Rod Serling in the end shot? I can almost hear him saying "Picture a man far from home..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, let me say that I found the original overrated. Not bad, but not a 'classic'. When I heard they were remaking it, with Cameron at the helm, I was extremely worried (I dislike everything the man's done in the 90's, with the exception of True Lies, which was fun). When it turned out to be Tim Burton, I felt that maybe he could make this movie truly 'relevant', with sharp satire, and perhaps a little human development. Alas, it wasn't to be. Understand that I think that Burton is a director who's style often overwhelms the substance of any film he's shooting (note, see Sleepy Hollow). That said, he brings enormous creative energy to the film, and is to be respected for massing the talented crew he has. I'm glad to hear the people mentioned Danny Elfman's score, his best. It hooks you from beginning to end, and has the strength to become a contender at this year's oscars. Thunderous, rousing, brilliant, the score is better written then the script for eliciting a dramatic response. Special credit must be given to Rick Baker, the only Hollywood make-up artist whom I've heard of (he's acheived a celebrity status if you will). His simian creations are remarkable, and allow the actors to act through their make-up. Well, that would be more true if the actors had something to act. The script makes no attempt to achieve any form of nuance or subtlety. It eschews what could have been a satire, and asks us to accept fight scenes and stunt work. Discussing the stunt work, it is phenomenal as well. Again, the technical achievements of this film are not to be ignored. The film is fairly entertaining UNTIL..... The climax. What is supposed to be a pulse-pounding scene proves to be a series of cliches, and a horrible use of deux ex machina, and the ending is fairly silly and unnecessary. As for the actors, many attempt to act, but many have nothing to do (the humans). However, the performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are excellent. No kidding, but I think Roth deserves an oscar nomination (as it stands now). His scenery chewing performance as General Thade is energetic and outstanding. Having said that, expect this to win a make-up oscar, and receive a nomination for best score, but it's not a film to rush out and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton does a great job on the new Planet of the Apes. He manages to make a film that will not offend the traditionalists who enjoyed the original (like me), while at the same time creating something new that audiences of today will appreciate.First and foremost, this movie looks great. Even if all other components of the movie were weak (and some are), I would still be partial to this picture. The costumes, makeup, and sets are rich and extremely authentic-appearing, and really bring to life the apes and their culture. In a movie about a different culture, this is important. (There is by no means a comprehensive vision of a simian society, but enough is touched on to give us a good taste.) Without giving away the finer details, the plot is equal to the original, and the same interesting philosophical qualities of the 1968 version are here, with the social commentary on animal treatment, tensions in communities over diversity, the place of religion within the state, etc. There is enough action to make things interesting on a primal level (the initial capture scene is much more intense in the new Apes, the apes themselves being much more intimidating), and some personal relationships also add an element to the story.Even though many of the actors are covered in convincing makeup (with the possible exception of Carter, who looks a little too cosmetic), their personalities come through, and you can buy the idea of a speaking simian. Roth is especially good--his character plays a constant game of testosterone repression that he doesn't win often. His rage is palpable. Mark Wahlberg does a much better job as protaganist than Charleton Heston could ever have done. Overall, a good job by the cast.It's still not a perfect movie, not by a long shot. The comic relief, as with all action/serious(?) movies, gets a little distracting (although, by comic relief standards, Giamatti does a pretty good job). The humans seem a little too articulate to be so "primitive", and the entire explanation as to how/when/where Wahlberg's character gets where he is is never really reasonably explained. The final scenes of the movie are downright confusing, maybe close to ridiculous (if they mean what I think they're supposed to mean), and the film would have been better had it stopped five minutes sooner.I give the movie a 7.</fullReview>

I'm sure some changes are made for the reason, unfortunately i've seen the ending of the original.Mark Wahlberg was pretty believable as an astronaut who lands on a planet inhabited as Apes who rule it. Tim Roth's character probably ruled the film as an awesome Tim Burton Villain since the Joker with the original Batman. Nothing alike but still wonderfully played.So far one of the best movies of the summer no doubt.I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film the day it came out with high hopes. My friends told me how great the original was and i could only think of how awesome a writer must be to create such an original story. Oh, i was a fool.Burton has had a successful streak, hasn't he? Batman, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow, and the cult favorite Nightmare Before Christmas. Yes it is an awesome life. But every career has a hitch. This is his. Mark Wahlberg's career has also been rising. From the innovative Boogy Nights, to the highly rated Three Kings and The Perfect Storm with another blockbuster (Rock Star) on the way. Maybe this can be an oversight.No matter the director or the stars, our hero, Leo Davidson cannot see that his ape costars are real actors. Whenever speaking to them, he inserts a short pause, as if trying to prove to himself that these are real people. His eyes are blank and emotionless. He plays a hero just as well as Steven Seagal, take that as you will.The apes are frighteningly lifelike, but you can't base a movie on its makeup. The film is dark, very dark (visually) for the first 3/4. As if these future apes couldn't figure out lightbulbs, or even gas lights. The film also uses the rope and pulley system made popular by the Matrix. While it looked new and exciting in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and even Romeo Must Die, seeing apes jumping vertically eight feet (from a sit down) is just silly.None of the "human" characters, beside Leo, play an important role. It makes you wonder why he's trying to save them. Apes have evolved into intelligent, thought processing individuals over thousands of years... but what happened to the humans? Did we just stop at a certain point in time, and someone said, "This is enough for you"? The ending is so confusing it's physically impossible. Burton rearranges time so much i think HE get's lost. Overall, it's a 4/10- saved by the makeup and the ape's acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton presents a magnificent movie for the eyes, but alas opts for the usual poor screen play. I left the movie feeling that I had been well entertained. The magicpecial effects, make-up, musical score all produce a feast of movie fantasy. The ape-ing is inspired. Tim Roth, as the fanatical Chimp General, is worth the price of admission alone. Paul Giamatti has some nice moments, but no-one else is given much to do except to imitate apes or fearful humans. The female chimps look too much like the original Kim Hunter, bereft of facial hair and facial creases.As usual with these kinds of movies the throw away line is ever present, and some make for a good snicker or two. I wonder how many people caught the irony of Charlton Heston defending gun control!It's really best to see this movie with your inner child on your lap, and leave the critical adult home. This is especially true for the ending which gives a momentary smile of pleasure at it's salute to the original, as long as one doesn't think about how it doesn't make any sense!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has shown many things in his life as a filmmaker: a knack for gloomy atmosphere; a real sense of empathy for the lonely and different ones; a wicked sense of humor; he's even shown that he can play by the rules of the studios, delivering not only once but twice, even making a sequel and pulling it off.Sadly, none of that shows in "Planet...". The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect ("Sleepy Hollow" and "Batman" come to mind) and his "wicked sense of humor" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through "Planet..." with his best "Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PLANET OF THE NYUK NYUK's, or: "I Waited 25 YEARS for THIS??!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!) God in Heaven, where does one begin? I became an APES freak around 1973 and collected the toys, memorabilia, and all. I even made a fan magazine on PLANET OF THE APES. This franchise was lost in the dust for a few decades and I prayed it would return one day. Well, it FINALLY has - and I'm not so sure it's for the better.Yes, the kids will love this film, and yes, the toys and Ape Popularity will soar once again. But Lord, what an AWFUL motion picture - heartbreaking, really, after suuuccch a long wait. When I heard that Tim Burton and Rick Baker were involved I had some hopes. As I saw magazine articles, trailers, and makeup shots I said "yeah, this may actually work!" But then I saw the finished product...and my worst fears were confirmed, my few hopes were shot down, and once again I knew that there is no escaping the wrath of today's lousy movies.As the last 25 years or so passed before my eyes during the movie, I got disgusted, angered, and bored. Now, it's too easy to charge me with being too biased toward the 1968 original; I fully accepted some changes. Too bad every one was for the WORST. Well, enough preliminary stuff; let's get on to the movie, shall we? ---It's treated as a silly, dumb, stupid, lame joke. It's like watching Looney Tunes on acid or something. Tim Burton reportedly had much fun with this film, even laughing after yelling "Cut!" after each shot - and it shows. Burton has NO respect for this subject and thinks the APES are funny monkeys to be snickered at. And tossing in some lame variations of classic lines from the 1968 version only hinders, and seem forced. Though the unfunny and aching silliness is what peeves me the most, there's more:Where's the script? What little story there is is full of convoluted and illogical situations. The so-called "story" merely zips in and out of perfunctory APES scenarios: A convenient hunt scene as soon as the astronaut lands, and an obligatory escape attempt, for example. The characters are totally uninteresting. ALL of the humans, that's the first thing. Michael Clark Duncan looks good, but offers nothing. Marky Mark is by-the-numbers and not much of an actor. People are speaking highly of Helena Bonham Carter as the girl chimp, but her character just squeals a lot and is afraid of her own shadow. Her Animal Activist potential is hinted at but dropped quickly. When she falls for Marky, it's absurd. I mean, she loves animals but does she want to sleep with them?? When she kisses the astronaut at the end of the movie, who cares, it's another loan from the original, except that at least there had been more involvement and caring between Taylor and Zira. THEY seemed to spend weeks and weeks getting to know and understand each other; this time, Carter and Mark seem to have only been introduced an hour or two beforehand. And her makeup (as with the other females) is VERY POOR. John Chambers runs circles around Rick Baker there, with his original Zira makeup from the first version.Yes, by the way, the other makeup is very good. Particularly Tim Roth's evil-looking Thade. Pity that Roth's idea of portraying a villain here though is to snarl, grunt, hiss, and swing around the room. I was looking forward to Roth's performance most of all, but he blew it.I don't much care for the beastial savagery and more "primitive" apes of this new feature, either. To me, the Apes were more like spoiled Monkeys, and far too irrational and animalistic to run the planet. And how does this make them so superior to the humans, anyway? These talkative homo sapiens look capable enough to plan their own revolt.The character of Limbo was an annoying and unfunny Jar Jar Binks-type, and we needed him out of there ASAP. What a stooge. Assasinate him, please.Charlton Heston's cameo could have been decent, had it not been destroyed by his classic "Damn Them All To Hell!" line that came off as desperate and embarrassing. It could have worked in a skit from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, but in what should be an intense and intelligent sci-fi film.And the ending? What can you say? It is closer to the book, but comes off as confusing in its execution. It looks Stupid, obligatory, and conveniently sets up for a (gulp) sequel. Man, what a dumb excuse for a movie!!!! Whether there ever was another version or not, this is one limp knee-slapper. Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk!Damn You to Hell, Tim Burton!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are bad because of low budget. Some movies are bad because of a bad plot. Some movies are bad by design, i.e. quickie, cheesy exploitation movies. And some movies are bad because a director goes hopelessly out of control... pounding home his vision with the force of a gorilla's fist in an iron glove. Joining the ranks of "Water World", "The Wild, Wild West" and "Battlefield Earth", "Planet Of The Apes" comes yelping and screaming to the screen as a comic book come to life. The trouble is, it doesn't know what it is. A science fiction thriller? A horror story? A comedy? High Camp? Unintentionally funny. Stilted. Stupefying. Kris Kristofferson is left hung out to dry as a sort of latter-day Tumak from "One Million Years B.C.;" loincloth-clad Estella Warren appears baffled throughout and although a love interest, has surprisingly little to do . Various human characters are introduced only to later stand around and gawk. Some great ape makeup is wasted on some of the sorriest, most hapless ape villains in movie history. Apes snarl. They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses. We have comic(?) relief in the form of a Gilbert Gottfried patterned ape slave trader who is one moment sadistically brutal, the next moment a wise-cracking borscht-belt comedian who may be the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar Binks. Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description. Tim Burton slips on a Kong-Sized banana peel. A stupendous, colossal, preposterous yawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember the 1968 original Planet of the Apes? Now imagine an updated version of that same movie without the creativity, witty social commentary, and entertainment value and that's what you get out of Apes circa 2001. This year has proven to be a wasteland of one bad movie after another, and Apes 2001 will most likely be looked at as a contributor to this wasteland, at least by me.The original and subsequent versions had social commentary that mirrored the current events of those times, such as the Watts riots and the Vietnam War. Apes 2001 was just a lame attempt to make a blockbuster movie by trying to capture lightning in a bottle a second time with name recognition, cliches, and special effects. I started looking at my watch well before the halfway mark of the movie.The movie insults the intelligence of the moviegoer by having the apes give that annoying, piercing, headache-inducing shriek everytime they get excited, mad, happy, etc. I suppose that director Tim Burton wanted to drive the point home that they are in fact apes in case we couldn't figure that out from the title of the movie and that they call themselves "apes" a lot. It felt more like being at a zoo than a movie theater.Let's not forget the touch of absurdity too. Apes teases a love triangle between Capt. Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), a native human woman, and Ari the bleeding heart ape. Yes, you read it correctly. Thank goodness it was only a PG-13 movie.Nothing noteworthy about the acting. Wahlberg struts around as the hero, which is par for the course. Tim Roth as Gen. Thade came across as more of an annoyance than as ruthless. Kris Kristofferson contributes little, other than to continue his own streak of being offed in a movie before it's over. Of all the actors here, I felt bad for Michael Clarke Duncan. After his breakthrough performance in The Green Mile, he was typecasted as a dimwitted giant ape in most other later movies. I never expected for him to be literally typecasted as that to boot, but Apes 2001 does just that by feeding him the limited role as the stooge/friend of Gen. Thade.The ending - which by the way many will see coming a mile away - leaves the door open for a sequel, and if Apes 2001's undeserving blockbuster numbers hold up, sadly that's what we will get.Stay far, far away from this movie, even if you're a diehard fan of all the original Apes movies, have all the episodes of the TV series and cartoon on tape, have back hair, and crave bananas constantly. Rent the original and just leave it at that. (1/10)</fullReview>

But hey, at least the Apes looked better...which I believe was the entire reason they decided to remake this movie in the first place. If you're thinking about shelling out the money to see this movie, save your money and buy the original on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A painfully contrived, good-looking mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 may well be memorable as the prime year for really stupid movies. Tim Burton's ambitious attempt to remake a dubious classic is certainly not the worst offender of the summer, but it may be the one that wastes the most potential. In trying to avoid the pitfalls of most remakes, Burton and his scripters have tortured logic to contravene the "surprise" ending of the original to the point that their story makes little dramatic or logical sense. With decent make-up (the lady apes are a little silly-looking), cool sets, and impressive stunt-actor acrobatics, the movie has great visual appeal, but the story veers between an allegory of man's inhumanity to man-like beings and an epic action film without ever managing to be entertaining. See coincidence stretched once again to the breaking point, lame one-liners that no one laughs at, meaningless characters who serve no dramatic or thematic purpose, all in the service of a story with no real point. Have to applaud the hilarious scene where perennial NRA pimp Charlton Heston as a dying father ape reveals that the secret family treasure is a hand-gun, and some of the ape cultural touches (loved the way they mounted horses) are really neat, but generally this movie left me feeling like I had wasted over two hours of my life and several points of my IQ. And after this summer, I don't have much left. Easily Tim Burton's worst movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY!! A Summer Movie That Doesn't Disappoint!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apes are here at last!! Bravo! Boy, are they "mad, bad, and dangerous to know."Planet of The Apes is one of several movies that I earmarked to see this summer season. It is the first that did not disappoint...in fact it actually exceeded my expectations. Let's get something straight, right off the bat, I did not go to the theater expecting to be enlightened. I went to be entertained and Planet of the Apes is extremely entertaining. The costumes and makeup are first rate. Rick Baker should, deservedly so, garner another Oscar for his work. The apes are REAL...more real than the dinosaurs in the disappointing Jurassic Park 3. The actors were great. Tim Roth is menacingly elegant as General Thade. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Tagawa are excellent in the student/sensei roles. Helena Bonham Carter...ah well, is it me or does she actually look and perform better as an ape? Paul Giamatti almost steals the movie as the human slave trader, Limbo. The human actors were...well...human. The movie isn't called Planet of The Humans is it?I'm a fan of the first Planet Of The Apes. This film is as good in some parts and much, much better in others. Go see the movie, sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

Burton's trademark eye candy is still there, but there is absolutely no soul or authentic emotion anywhere. Marky Mark is clueless, and therefore Ari's crush on him is inexplicable. Tim Roth plays 'psycho' for the whole film. In fact, except for Bonham-Carter and Tagawa (Krull, the disgraced soldier gorilla), the acting is horrendous for a movie this expensive. And did we really need a wise-a** character like Limbo? The original film was great because it was played straight; this one feels like "Scary Movie 3", without the bathroom humor.

		<shortDescription>Another Disappointment in a Summer Replete With Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone else out there fondly remember summers past when James Cameron would wow us with intelligent action flicks like "True Lies" or "Terminator 2," or Steven Spielberg would show us the true measure of his genius with an Indiana Jones adventure or the original "Jurassic Park"? Much to my dismay, those days are long gone."The Mummy Returns" was an exercise in overkill. "Pearl Harbor" was a tedious bore. "Tomb Raider" and "Swordfish" were both so thoroughly awful they don't even merit discussion. Spielberg's "A.I." was a pretentious mish-mash of vague concepts. And you know things are bad when the usually reliable Disney delivers an uninspired dud like "Atlantis: The Lost Empire." Only slightly better were "The Score" (buoyed by its actors) and "Jurassic Park III," whose makers were wise enough to give us only 90 minutes of a rapidly tiring novelty.Which brings us to this disgrace. While I am not a huge fan of the original, I am sure this version is sure to enrage those who are. The writers of "Planet of the Apes" have substituted a series of lame jokes and puns for an actual plot, while subjecting us to a bunch of bland, one-dimensional characters and familiar action sequences. The incessant screeching and growling of the apes stands as the most annoying redundancy in a film since the depth charges of "U-571." Only the superb make-up by Rick Baker et al. make this film worthy of a one-time viewing.Finally, some thoughts on the director, Tim Burton. For the life of me I cannot figure out why so many people adore his work. Yes, I love "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure," and the original "Batman," while no masterpiece, is one of the best comic book movies to date. But his track record of late is atrocious: "Sleepy Hollow" was awful, and until I saw "Mars Attacks!" I never thought I'd see Jack Nicholson give a truly bad performance in a film. I will give "Beetlejuice" full marks for comedic value and originality, but "Edward Scissorhands" is a cheesy sentimentalist abomination.I find it interesting that "Ed Wood," far and away Burton's best film, is the one least remembered or mentioned by his legions of acolytes. The talent of which he is capable shines through that film, but it appears he has sacrificed it for the allure of big-budget bombast like "Planet of the Apes." Chalk Mr. Burton up as another casualty of Hollywood's war on artistic filmmaking.</fullReview>

However, it boggles me why he must express his depression through film, because, frankly, even though a movie can be melodrama, I don't want to be depressed.Well, if YOU want to be depressed on a rainy day, go see this movie NOW.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has shown many things in his life as a filmmaker: a knack for gloomy atmosphere; a real sense of empathy for the lonely and different ones; a wicked sense of humor; he's even shown that he can play by the rules of the studios, delivering not only once but twice, even making a sequel and pulling it off.Sadly, none of that shows in "Planet...". The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect ("Sleepy Hollow" and "Batman" come to mind) and his "wicked sense of humor" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through "Planet..." with his best "Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PLANET OF THE NYUK NYUK's, or: "I Waited 25 YEARS for THIS??!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!) God in Heaven, where does one begin? I became an APES freak around 1973 and collected the toys, memorabilia, and all. I even made a fan magazine on PLANET OF THE APES. This franchise was lost in the dust for a few decades and I prayed it would return one day. Well, it FINALLY has - and I'm not so sure it's for the better.Yes, the kids will love this film, and yes, the toys and Ape Popularity will soar once again. But Lord, what an AWFUL motion picture - heartbreaking, really, after suuuccch a long wait. When I heard that Tim Burton and Rick Baker were involved I had some hopes. As I saw magazine articles, trailers, and makeup shots I said "yeah, this may actually work!" But then I saw the finished product...and my worst fears were confirmed, my few hopes were shot down, and once again I knew that there is no escaping the wrath of today's lousy movies.As the last 25 years or so passed before my eyes during the movie, I got disgusted, angered, and bored. Now, it's too easy to charge me with being too biased toward the 1968 original; I fully accepted some changes. Too bad every one was for the WORST. Well, enough preliminary stuff; let's get on to the movie, shall we? ---It's treated as a silly, dumb, stupid, lame joke. It's like watching Looney Tunes on acid or something. Tim Burton reportedly had much fun with this film, even laughing after yelling "Cut!" after each shot - and it shows. Burton has NO respect for this subject and thinks the APES are funny monkeys to be snickered at. And tossing in some lame variations of classic lines from the 1968 version only hinders, and seem forced. Though the unfunny and aching silliness is what peeves me the most, there's more:Where's the script? What little story there is is full of convoluted and illogical situations. The so-called "story" merely zips in and out of perfunctory APES scenarios: A convenient hunt scene as soon as the astronaut lands, and an obligatory escape attempt, for example. The characters are totally uninteresting. ALL of the humans, that's the first thing. Michael Clark Duncan looks good, but offers nothing. Marky Mark is by-the-numbers and not much of an actor. People are speaking highly of Helena Bonham Carter as the girl chimp, but her character just squeals a lot and is afraid of her own shadow. Her Animal Activist potential is hinted at but dropped quickly. When she falls for Marky, it's absurd. I mean, she loves animals but does she want to sleep with them?? When she kisses the astronaut at the end of the movie, who cares, it's another loan from the original, except that at least there had been more involvement and caring between Taylor and Zira. THEY seemed to spend weeks and weeks getting to know and understand each other; this time, Carter and Mark seem to have only been introduced an hour or two beforehand. And her makeup (as with the other females) is VERY POOR. John Chambers runs circles around Rick Baker there, with his original Zira makeup from the first version.Yes, by the way, the other makeup is very good. Particularly Tim Roth's evil-looking Thade. Pity that Roth's idea of portraying a villain here though is to snarl, grunt, hiss, and swing around the room. I was looking forward to Roth's performance most of all, but he blew it.I don't much care for the beastial savagery and more "primitive" apes of this new feature, either. To me, the Apes were more like spoiled Monkeys, and far too irrational and animalistic to run the planet. And how does this make them so superior to the humans, anyway? These talkative homo sapiens look capable enough to plan their own revolt.The character of Limbo was an annoying and unfunny Jar Jar Binks-type, and we needed him out of there ASAP. What a stooge. Assasinate him, please.Charlton Heston's cameo could have been decent, had it not been destroyed by his classic "Damn Them All To Hell!" line that came off as desperate and embarrassing. It could have worked in a skit from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, but in what should be an intense and intelligent sci-fi film.And the ending? What can you say? It is closer to the book, but comes off as confusing in its execution. It looks Stupid, obligatory, and conveniently sets up for a (gulp) sequel. Man, what a dumb excuse for a movie!!!! Whether there ever was another version or not, this is one limp knee-slapper. Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk!Damn You to Hell, Tim Burton!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are bad because of low budget. Some movies are bad because of a bad plot. Some movies are bad by design, i.e. quickie, cheesy exploitation movies. And some movies are bad because a director goes hopelessly out of control... pounding home his vision with the force of a gorilla's fist in an iron glove. Joining the ranks of "Water World", "The Wild, Wild West" and "Battlefield Earth", "Planet Of The Apes" comes yelping and screaming to the screen as a comic book come to life. The trouble is, it doesn't know what it is. A science fiction thriller? A horror story? A comedy? High Camp? Unintentionally funny. Stilted. Stupefying. Kris Kristofferson is left hung out to dry as a sort of latter-day Tumak from "One Million Years B.C.;" loincloth-clad Estella Warren appears baffled throughout and although a love interest, has surprisingly little to do . Various human characters are introduced only to later stand around and gawk. Some great ape makeup is wasted on some of the sorriest, most hapless ape villains in movie history. Apes snarl. They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses. We have comic(?) relief in the form of a Gilbert Gottfried patterned ape slave trader who is one moment sadistically brutal, the next moment a wise-cracking borscht-belt comedian who may be the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar Binks. Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description. Tim Burton slips on a Kong-Sized banana peel. A stupendous, colossal, preposterous yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was horrible and here's why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not read about movies before they come out nor do I watch the previews. (I remain in the lobby until the film begins.) I walk into the theatre with a clean slate. I sit down wanting to be entertained and for about two hours my imagination should flow. With Planet of the Apes this is what I saw. 1) A beginning credit sequence? On a summer movie? 'Take it easy,' I said, 'you're just anxious for it to begin'. 2)After the credit sequence concludes we see a space station. A title appears stating that it's 2029, a mere 28 years from now. I squirm, the future date should have been left to my imagination 2)On the space station we see Mark Wahlberg interacting with his comrades. Nameless, numberless comrades. It dawns on me that Wahlberg maybe the only major lead. 'Oh no, he's good but he's not that good.' 3)After a monkey is shot out into the unknown in a space probe, Wahlberg, who was against this idea, straps himself in a pod of his own and states, "Don't send a monkey to do a man's job." My heart sinks. 4)Wahlberg crashes into a very fake looking sound stage jungle set. I'm instantly taken out of the movie. 5)But then I perk up when the apes appear. They jump through the air and leap through the trees with wreckless abandon just like I hope monkeys do. I like this. 6)Upon his capture Wahlberg grabs onto an apes legs. The ape responds with a knowing wink, "Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!" I'm out of the movie again. 7)The apes and their captives arrive to another claustrophobic sound stage which they warmly know as their city. 8)Darn near every shot is a close up further inducing my claustrophobia. My best defense is to fall asleep. 9)I wake up sometime later. It turns out that the apes are afraid of water so to get away from them Wahlberg suggest to his merry crew to cross the river. Ari, the friendly she-ape is afraid. Wahlberg says, 'Don't be afraid you silly nit, we'll be on horses and horses are good swimmers.' She submits and they proceed to cross the five feet deep river. Question: When the apes see the horses safely swimming to the other side why don't they follow? 10)We discover along with the main characters that Wahlberg's space station passed through the same time warp he did but crash landed 3,000 years before and that, presumedly, the smart little monkeys aboard went crazy and killed all the humans. And then I take it they evolved into the warlike big apes we now see. In only 3,000 years of evolution??? 11)As for the trick ending that everyone has now heard about. Can someone please tell me because I fell asleep again. I'd like to state for the record that I loved Starship Troopers.</fullReview>

And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PLANET OF THE NYUK NYUK's, or: "I Waited 25 YEARS for THIS??!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!) God in Heaven, where does one begin? I became an APES freak around 1973 and collected the toys, memorabilia, and all. I even made a fan magazine on PLANET OF THE APES. This franchise was lost in the dust for a few decades and I prayed it would return one day. Well, it FINALLY has - and I'm not so sure it's for the better.Yes, the kids will love this film, and yes, the toys and Ape Popularity will soar once again. But Lord, what an AWFUL motion picture - heartbreaking, really, after suuuccch a long wait. When I heard that Tim Burton and Rick Baker were involved I had some hopes. As I saw magazine articles, trailers, and makeup shots I said "yeah, this may actually work!" But then I saw the finished product...and my worst fears were confirmed, my few hopes were shot down, and once again I knew that there is no escaping the wrath of today's lousy movies.As the last 25 years or so passed before my eyes during the movie, I got disgusted, angered, and bored. Now, it's too easy to charge me with being too biased toward the 1968 original; I fully accepted some changes. Too bad every one was for the WORST. Well, enough preliminary stuff; let's get on to the movie, shall we? ---It's treated as a silly, dumb, stupid, lame joke. It's like watching Looney Tunes on acid or something. Tim Burton reportedly had much fun with this film, even laughing after yelling "Cut!" after each shot - and it shows. Burton has NO respect for this subject and thinks the APES are funny monkeys to be snickered at. And tossing in some lame variations of classic lines from the 1968 version only hinders, and seem forced. Though the unfunny and aching silliness is what peeves me the most, there's more:Where's the script? What little story there is is full of convoluted and illogical situations. The so-called "story" merely zips in and out of perfunctory APES scenarios: A convenient hunt scene as soon as the astronaut lands, and an obligatory escape attempt, for example. The characters are totally uninteresting. ALL of the humans, that's the first thing. Michael Clark Duncan looks good, but offers nothing. Marky Mark is by-the-numbers and not much of an actor. People are speaking highly of Helena Bonham Carter as the girl chimp, but her character just squeals a lot and is afraid of her own shadow. Her Animal Activist potential is hinted at but dropped quickly. When she falls for Marky, it's absurd. I mean, she loves animals but does she want to sleep with them?? When she kisses the astronaut at the end of the movie, who cares, it's another loan from the original, except that at least there had been more involvement and caring between Taylor and Zira. THEY seemed to spend weeks and weeks getting to know and understand each other; this time, Carter and Mark seem to have only been introduced an hour or two beforehand. And her makeup (as with the other females) is VERY POOR. John Chambers runs circles around Rick Baker there, with his original Zira makeup from the first version.Yes, by the way, the other makeup is very good. Particularly Tim Roth's evil-looking Thade. Pity that Roth's idea of portraying a villain here though is to snarl, grunt, hiss, and swing around the room. I was looking forward to Roth's performance most of all, but he blew it.I don't much care for the beastial savagery and more "primitive" apes of this new feature, either. To me, the Apes were more like spoiled Monkeys, and far too irrational and animalistic to run the planet. And how does this make them so superior to the humans, anyway? These talkative homo sapiens look capable enough to plan their own revolt.The character of Limbo was an annoying and unfunny Jar Jar Binks-type, and we needed him out of there ASAP. What a stooge. Assasinate him, please.Charlton Heston's cameo could have been decent, had it not been destroyed by his classic "Damn Them All To Hell!" line that came off as desperate and embarrassing. It could have worked in a skit from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, but in what should be an intense and intelligent sci-fi film.And the ending? What can you say? It is closer to the book, but comes off as confusing in its execution. It looks Stupid, obligatory, and conveniently sets up for a (gulp) sequel. Man, what a dumb excuse for a movie!!!! Whether there ever was another version or not, this is one limp knee-slapper. Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk!Damn You to Hell, Tim Burton!!</fullReview>

And some movies are bad because a director goes hopelessly out of control... pounding home his vision with the force of a gorilla's fist in an iron glove. Joining the ranks of "Water World", "The Wild, Wild West" and "Battlefield Earth", "Planet Of The Apes" comes yelping and screaming to the screen as a comic book come to life. The trouble is, it doesn't know what it is. A science fiction thriller? A horror story? A comedy? High Camp? Unintentionally funny. Stilted. Stupefying. Kris Kristofferson is left hung out to dry as a sort of latter-day Tumak from "One Million Years B.C.;" loincloth-clad Estella Warren appears baffled throughout and although a love interest, has surprisingly little to do . Various human characters are introduced only to later stand around and gawk. Some great ape makeup is wasted on some of the sorriest, most hapless ape villains in movie history. Apes snarl. They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses. We have comic(?) relief in the form of a Gilbert Gottfried patterned ape slave trader who is one moment sadistically brutal, the next moment a wise-cracking borscht-belt comedian who may be the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar Binks. Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description. Tim Burton slips on a Kong-Sized banana peel. A stupendous, colossal, preposterous yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was horrible and here's why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not read about movies before they come out nor do I watch the previews. (I remain in the lobby until the film begins.) I walk into the theatre with a clean slate. I sit down wanting to be entertained and for about two hours my imagination should flow. With Planet of the Apes this is what I saw. 1) A beginning credit sequence? On a summer movie? 'Take it easy,' I said, 'you're just anxious for it to begin'. 2)After the credit sequence concludes we see a space station. A title appears stating that it's 2029, a mere 28 years from now. I squirm, the future date should have been left to my imagination 2)On the space station we see Mark Wahlberg interacting with his comrades. Nameless, numberless comrades. It dawns on me that Wahlberg maybe the only major lead. 'Oh no, he's good but he's not that good.' 3)After a monkey is shot out into the unknown in a space probe, Wahlberg, who was against this idea, straps himself in a pod of his own and states, "Don't send a monkey to do a man's job." My heart sinks. 4)Wahlberg crashes into a very fake looking sound stage jungle set. I'm instantly taken out of the movie. 5)But then I perk up when the apes appear. They jump through the air and leap through the trees with wreckless abandon just like I hope monkeys do. I like this. 6)Upon his capture Wahlberg grabs onto an apes legs. The ape responds with a knowing wink, "Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!" I'm out of the movie again. 7)The apes and their captives arrive to another claustrophobic sound stage which they warmly know as their city. 8)Darn near every shot is a close up further inducing my claustrophobia. My best defense is to fall asleep. 9)I wake up sometime later. It turns out that the apes are afraid of water so to get away from them Wahlberg suggest to his merry crew to cross the river. Ari, the friendly she-ape is afraid. Wahlberg says, 'Don't be afraid you silly nit, we'll be on horses and horses are good swimmers.' She submits and they proceed to cross the five feet deep river. Question: When the apes see the horses safely swimming to the other side why don't they follow? 10)We discover along with the main characters that Wahlberg's space station passed through the same time warp he did but crash landed 3,000 years before and that, presumedly, the smart little monkeys aboard went crazy and killed all the humans. And then I take it they evolved into the warlike big apes we now see. In only 3,000 years of evolution??? 11)As for the trick ending that everyone has now heard about. Can someone please tell me because I fell asleep again. I'd like to state for the record that I loved Starship Troopers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A painfully contrived, good-looking mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 may well be memorable as the prime year for really stupid movies. Tim Burton's ambitious attempt to remake a dubious classic is certainly not the worst offender of the summer, but it may be the one that wastes the most potential. In trying to avoid the pitfalls of most remakes, Burton and his scripters have tortured logic to contravene the "surprise" ending of the original to the point that their story makes little dramatic or logical sense. With decent make-up (the lady apes are a little silly-looking), cool sets, and impressive stunt-actor acrobatics, the movie has great visual appeal, but the story veers between an allegory of man's inhumanity to man-like beings and an epic action film without ever managing to be entertaining. See coincidence stretched once again to the breaking point, lame one-liners that no one laughs at, meaningless characters who serve no dramatic or thematic purpose, all in the service of a story with no real point. Have to applaud the hilarious scene where perennial NRA pimp Charlton Heston as a dying father ape reveals that the secret family treasure is a hand-gun, and some of the ape cultural touches (loved the way they mounted horses) are really neat, but generally this movie left me feeling like I had wasted over two hours of my life and several points of my IQ. And after this summer, I don't have much left. Easily Tim Burton's worst movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY!! A Summer Movie That Doesn't Disappoint!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apes are here at last!! Bravo! Boy, are they "mad, bad, and dangerous to know."Planet of The Apes is one of several movies that I earmarked to see this summer season. It is the first that did not disappoint...in fact it actually exceeded my expectations. Let's get something straight, right off the bat, I did not go to the theater expecting to be enlightened. I went to be entertained and Planet of the Apes is extremely entertaining. The costumes and makeup are first rate. Rick Baker should, deservedly so, garner another Oscar for his work. The apes are REAL...more real than the dinosaurs in the disappointing Jurassic Park 3. The actors were great. Tim Roth is menacingly elegant as General Thade. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Tagawa are excellent in the student/sensei roles. Helena Bonham Carter...ah well, is it me or does she actually look and perform better as an ape? Paul Giamatti almost steals the movie as the human slave trader, Limbo. The human actors were...well...human. The movie isn't called Planet of The Humans is it?I'm a fan of the first Planet Of The Apes. This film is as good in some parts and much, much better in others. Go see the movie, sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of the Suits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the same problem as all the other big-budget flicks these days - it was made from a recipe instead of a screenplay. Burton's trademark eye candy is still there, but there is absolutely no soul or authentic emotion anywhere. Marky Mark is clueless, and therefore Ari's crush on him is inexplicable. Tim Roth plays 'psycho' for the whole film. In fact, except for Bonham-Carter and Tagawa (Krull, the disgraced soldier gorilla), the acting is horrendous for a movie this expensive. And did we really need a wise-a** character like Limbo? The original film was great because it was played straight; this one feels like "Scary Movie 3", without the bathroom humor. What a disappointment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disappointment in a Summer Replete With Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone else out there fondly remember summers past when James Cameron would wow us with intelligent action flicks like "True Lies" or "Terminator 2," or Steven Spielberg would show us the true measure of his genius with an Indiana Jones adventure or the original "Jurassic Park"? Much to my dismay, those days are long gone."The Mummy Returns" was an exercise in overkill. "Pearl Harbor" was a tedious bore. "Tomb Raider" and "Swordfish" were both so thoroughly awful they don't even merit discussion. Spielberg's "A.I." was a pretentious mish-mash of vague concepts. And you know things are bad when the usually reliable Disney delivers an uninspired dud like "Atlantis: The Lost Empire." Only slightly better were "The Score" (buoyed by its actors) and "Jurassic Park III," whose makers were wise enough to give us only 90 minutes of a rapidly tiring novelty.Which brings us to this disgrace. While I am not a huge fan of the original, I am sure this version is sure to enrage those who are. The writers of "Planet of the Apes" have substituted a series of lame jokes and puns for an actual plot, while subjecting us to a bunch of bland, one-dimensional characters and familiar action sequences. The incessant screeching and growling of the apes stands as the most annoying redundancy in a film since the depth charges of "U-571." Only the superb make-up by Rick Baker et al. make this film worthy of a one-time viewing.Finally, some thoughts on the director, Tim Burton. For the life of me I cannot figure out why so many people adore his work. Yes, I love "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure," and the original "Batman," while no masterpiece, is one of the best comic book movies to date. But his track record of late is atrocious: "Sleepy Hollow" was awful, and until I saw "Mars Attacks!" I never thought I'd see Jack Nicholson give a truly bad performance in a film. I will give "Beetlejuice" full marks for comedic value and originality, but "Edward Scissorhands" is a cheesy sentimentalist abomination.I find it interesting that "Ed Wood," far and away Burton's best film, is the one least remembered or mentioned by his legions of acolytes. The talent of which he is capable shines through that film, but it appears he has sacrificed it for the allure of big-budget bombast like "Planet of the Apes." Chalk Mr. Burton up as another casualty of Hollywood's war on artistic filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well what do we have here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton, Tim Burton, Tim Burton, why does anybody like this guy? After viewing several of his films, I am CONVINCED that he is eternally depressed. However, it boggles me why he must express his depression through film, because, frankly, even though a movie can be melodrama, I don't want to be depressed.Well, if YOU want to be depressed on a rainy day, go see this movie NOW. Yes, it is a clever spin on the premise created by the original "Planet of the Apes" and the book, but that's like saying "a spoonful of sugar makes the hemlock go down."Instead of telling you about this depressing story, let me show you: humans are beaten, whipped, and mistreated; crying little girls are kept as pets; heads are removed; necks are snapped, need I say more.So, in conclusion, I make no recommendations for you. All I'll tell you is that the action is fun, the execution of the idea is depressing, and the ending will make you feel like you just swallowed poison.Have fun at the movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has shown many things in his life as a filmmaker: a knack for gloomy atmosphere; a real sense of empathy for the lonely and different ones; a wicked sense of humor; he's even shown that he can play by the rules of the studios, delivering not only once but twice, even making a sequel and pulling it off.Sadly, none of that shows in "Planet...". The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect ("Sleepy Hollow" and "Batman" come to mind) and his "wicked sense of humor" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through "Planet..." with his best "Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A painfully contrived, good-looking mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 may well be memorable as the prime year for really stupid movies. Tim Burton's ambitious attempt to remake a dubious classic is certainly not the worst offender of the summer, but it may be the one that wastes the most potential. In trying to avoid the pitfalls of most remakes, Burton and his scripters have tortured logic to contravene the "surprise" ending of the original to the point that their story makes little dramatic or logical sense. With decent make-up (the lady apes are a little silly-looking), cool sets, and impressive stunt-actor acrobatics, the movie has great visual appeal, but the story veers between an allegory of man's inhumanity to man-like beings and an epic action film without ever managing to be entertaining. See coincidence stretched once again to the breaking point, lame one-liners that no one laughs at, meaningless characters who serve no dramatic or thematic purpose, all in the service of a story with no real point. Have to applaud the hilarious scene where perennial NRA pimp Charlton Heston as a dying father ape reveals that the secret family treasure is a hand-gun, and some of the ape cultural touches (loved the way they mounted horses) are really neat, but generally this movie left me feeling like I had wasted over two hours of my life and several points of my IQ. And after this summer, I don't have much left. Easily Tim Burton's worst movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY!! A Summer Movie That Doesn't Disappoint!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apes are here at last!! Bravo! Boy, are they "mad, bad, and dangerous to know."Planet of The Apes is one of several movies that I earmarked to see this summer season. It is the first that did not disappoint...in fact it actually exceeded my expectations. Let's get something straight, right off the bat, I did not go to the theater expecting to be enlightened. I went to be entertained and Planet of the Apes is extremely entertaining. The costumes and makeup are first rate. Rick Baker should, deservedly so, garner another Oscar for his work. The apes are REAL...more real than the dinosaurs in the disappointing Jurassic Park 3. The actors were great. Tim Roth is menacingly elegant as General Thade. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Tagawa are excellent in the student/sensei roles. Helena Bonham Carter...ah well, is it me or does she actually look and perform better as an ape? Paul Giamatti almost steals the movie as the human slave trader, Limbo. The human actors were...well...human. The movie isn't called Planet of The Humans is it?I'm a fan of the first Planet Of The Apes. This film is as good in some parts and much, much better in others. Go see the movie, sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the same problem as all the other big-budget flicks these days - it was made from a recipe instead of a screenplay. Burton's trademark eye candy is still there, but there is absolutely no soul or authentic emotion anywhere. Marky Mark is clueless, and therefore Ari's crush on him is inexplicable. Tim Roth plays 'psycho' for the whole film. In fact, except for Bonham-Carter and Tagawa (Krull, the disgraced soldier gorilla), the acting is horrendous for a movie this expensive. And did we really need a wise-a** character like Limbo? The original film was great because it was played straight; this one feels like "Scary Movie 3", without the bathroom humor.

		<shortDescription>Another Disappointment in a Summer Replete With Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone else out there fondly remember summers past when James Cameron would wow us with intelligent action flicks like "True Lies" or "Terminator 2," or Steven Spielberg would show us the true measure of his genius with an Indiana Jones adventure or the original "Jurassic Park"? Much to my dismay, those days are long gone."The Mummy Returns" was an exercise in overkill. "Pearl Harbor" was a tedious bore. "Tomb Raider" and "Swordfish" were both so thoroughly awful they don't even merit discussion. Spielberg's "A.I." was a pretentious mish-mash of vague concepts. And you know things are bad when the usually reliable Disney delivers an uninspired dud like "Atlantis: The Lost Empire." Only slightly better were "The Score" (buoyed by its actors) and "Jurassic Park III," whose makers were wise enough to give us only 90 minutes of a rapidly tiring novelty.Which brings us to this disgrace. While I am not a huge fan of the original, I am sure this version is sure to enrage those who are. The writers of "Planet of the Apes" have substituted a series of lame jokes and puns for an actual plot, while subjecting us to a bunch of bland, one-dimensional characters and familiar action sequences. The incessant screeching and growling of the apes stands as the most annoying redundancy in a film since the depth charges of "U-571." Only the superb make-up by Rick Baker et al. make this film worthy of a one-time viewing.Finally, some thoughts on the director, Tim Burton. For the life of me I cannot figure out why so many people adore his work. Yes, I love "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure," and the original "Batman," while no masterpiece, is one of the best comic book movies to date. But his track record of late is atrocious: "Sleepy Hollow" was awful, and until I saw "Mars Attacks!" I never thought I'd see Jack Nicholson give a truly bad performance in a film. I will give "Beetlejuice" full marks for comedic value and originality, but "Edward Scissorhands" is a cheesy sentimentalist abomination.I find it interesting that "Ed Wood," far and away Burton's best film, is the one least remembered or mentioned by his legions of acolytes. The talent of which he is capable shines through that film, but it appears he has sacrificed it for the allure of big-budget bombast like "Planet of the Apes." Chalk Mr. Burton up as another casualty of Hollywood's war on artistic filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton, Tim Burton, Tim Burton, why does anybody like this guy? After viewing several of his films, I am CONVINCED that he is eternally depressed. However, it boggles me why he must express his depression through film, because, frankly, even though a movie can be melodrama, I don't want to be depressed.Well, if YOU want to be depressed on a rainy day, go see this movie NOW. Yes, it is a clever spin on the premise created by the original "Planet of the Apes" and the book, but that's like saying "a spoonful of sugar makes the hemlock go down."Instead of telling you about this depressing story, let me show you: humans are beaten, whipped, and mistreated; crying little girls are kept as pets; heads are removed; necks are snapped, need I say more.So, in conclusion, I make no recommendations for you. All I'll tell you is that the action is fun, the execution of the idea is depressing, and the ending will make you feel like you just swallowed poison.Have fun at the movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has shown many things in his life as a filmmaker: a knack for gloomy atmosphere; a real sense of empathy for the lonely and different ones; a wicked sense of humor; he's even shown that he can play by the rules of the studios, delivering not only once but twice, even making a sequel and pulling it off.Sadly, none of that shows in "Planet...". The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect ("Sleepy Hollow" and "Batman" come to mind) and his "wicked sense of humor" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through "Planet..." with his best "Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PLANET OF THE NYUK NYUK's, or: "I Waited 25 YEARS for THIS??!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!) God in Heaven, where does one begin? I became an APES freak around 1973 and collected the toys, memorabilia, and all. I even made a fan magazine on PLANET OF THE APES. This franchise was lost in the dust for a few decades and I prayed it would return one day. Well, it FINALLY has - and I'm not so sure it's for the better.Yes, the kids will love this film, and yes, the toys and Ape Popularity will soar once again. But Lord, what an AWFUL motion picture - heartbreaking, really, after suuuccch a long wait. When I heard that Tim Burton and Rick Baker were involved I had some hopes. As I saw magazine articles, trailers, and makeup shots I said "yeah, this may actually work!" But then I saw the finished product...and my worst fears were confirmed, my few hopes were shot down, and once again I knew that there is no escaping the wrath of today's lousy movies.As the last 25 years or so passed before my eyes during the movie, I got disgusted, angered, and bored. Now, it's too easy to charge me with being too biased toward the 1968 original; I fully accepted some changes. Too bad every one was for the WORST. Well, enough preliminary stuff; let's get on to the movie, shall we? ---It's treated as a silly, dumb, stupid, lame joke. It's like watching Looney Tunes on acid or something. Tim Burton reportedly had much fun with this film, even laughing after yelling "Cut!" after each shot - and it shows. Burton has NO respect for this subject and thinks the APES are funny monkeys to be snickered at. And tossing in some lame variations of classic lines from the 1968 version only hinders, and seem forced. Though the unfunny and aching silliness is what peeves me the most, there's more:Where's the script? What little story there is is full of convoluted and illogical situations. The so-called "story" merely zips in and out of perfunctory APES scenarios: A convenient hunt scene as soon as the astronaut lands, and an obligatory escape attempt, for example. The characters are totally uninteresting. ALL of the humans, that's the first thing. Michael Clark Duncan looks good, but offers nothing. Marky Mark is by-the-numbers and not much of an actor. People are speaking highly of Helena Bonham Carter as the girl chimp, but her character just squeals a lot and is afraid of her own shadow. Her Animal Activist potential is hinted at but dropped quickly. When she falls for Marky, it's absurd. I mean, she loves animals but does she want to sleep with them?? When she kisses the astronaut at the end of the movie, who cares, it's another loan from the original, except that at least there had been more involvement and caring between Taylor and Zira. THEY seemed to spend weeks and weeks getting to know and understand each other; this time, Carter and Mark seem to have only been introduced an hour or two beforehand. And her makeup (as with the other females) is VERY POOR. John Chambers runs circles around Rick Baker there, with his original Zira makeup from the first version.Yes, by the way, the other makeup is very good. Particularly Tim Roth's evil-looking Thade. Pity that Roth's idea of portraying a villain here though is to snarl, grunt, hiss, and swing around the room. I was looking forward to Roth's performance most of all, but he blew it.I don't much care for the beastial savagery and more "primitive" apes of this new feature, either. To me, the Apes were more like spoiled Monkeys, and far too irrational and animalistic to run the planet. And how does this make them so superior to the humans, anyway? These talkative homo sapiens look capable enough to plan their own revolt.The character of Limbo was an annoying and unfunny Jar Jar Binks-type, and we needed him out of there ASAP. What a stooge. Assasinate him, please.Charlton Heston's cameo could have been decent, had it not been destroyed by his classic "Damn Them All To Hell!" line that came off as desperate and embarrassing. It could have worked in a skit from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, but in what should be an intense and intelligent sci-fi film.And the ending? What can you say? It is closer to the book, but comes off as confusing in its execution. It looks Stupid, obligatory, and conveniently sets up for a (gulp) sequel. Man, what a dumb excuse for a movie!!!! Whether there ever was another version or not, this is one limp knee-slapper. Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk!Damn You to Hell, Tim Burton!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are bad because of low budget. Some movies are bad because of a bad plot. Some movies are bad by design, i.e. quickie, cheesy exploitation movies. And some movies are bad because a director goes hopelessly out of control... pounding home his vision with the force of a gorilla's fist in an iron glove. Joining the ranks of "Water World", "The Wild, Wild West" and "Battlefield Earth", "Planet Of The Apes" comes yelping and screaming to the screen as a comic book come to life. The trouble is, it doesn't know what it is. A science fiction thriller? A horror story? A comedy? High Camp? Unintentionally funny. Stilted. Stupefying. Kris Kristofferson is left hung out to dry as a sort of latter-day Tumak from "One Million Years B.C.;" loincloth-clad Estella Warren appears baffled throughout and although a love interest, has surprisingly little to do . Various human characters are introduced only to later stand around and gawk. Some great ape makeup is wasted on some of the sorriest, most hapless ape villains in movie history. Apes snarl. They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses. We have comic(?) relief in the form of a Gilbert Gottfried patterned ape slave trader who is one moment sadistically brutal, the next moment a wise-cracking borscht-belt comedian who may be the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar Binks. Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description. Tim Burton slips on a Kong-Sized banana peel. A stupendous, colossal, preposterous yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was horrible and here's why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not read about movies before they come out nor do I watch the previews. (I remain in the lobby until the film begins.) I walk into the theatre with a clean slate. I sit down wanting to be entertained and for about two hours my imagination should flow. With Planet of the Apes this is what I saw. 1) A beginning credit sequence? On a summer movie? 'Take it easy,' I said, 'you're just anxious for it to begin'. 2)After the credit sequence concludes we see a space station. A title appears stating that it's 2029, a mere 28 years from now. I squirm, the future date should have been left to my imagination 2)On the space station we see Mark Wahlberg interacting with his comrades. Nameless, numberless comrades. It dawns on me that Wahlberg maybe the only major lead. 'Oh no, he's good but he's not that good.' 3)After a monkey is shot out into the unknown in a space probe, Wahlberg, who was against this idea, straps himself in a pod of his own and states, "Don't send a monkey to do a man's job." My heart sinks. 4)Wahlberg crashes into a very fake looking sound stage jungle set. I'm instantly taken out of the movie. 5)But then I perk up when the apes appear. They jump through the air and leap through the trees with wreckless abandon just like I hope monkeys do. I like this. 6)Upon his capture Wahlberg grabs onto an apes legs. The ape responds with a knowing wink, "Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!" I'm out of the movie again. 7)The apes and their captives arrive to another claustrophobic sound stage which they warmly know as their city. 8)Darn near every shot is a close up further inducing my claustrophobia. My best defense is to fall asleep. 9)I wake up sometime later. It turns out that the apes are afraid of water so to get away from them Wahlberg suggest to his merry crew to cross the river. Ari, the friendly she-ape is afraid. Wahlberg says, 'Don't be afraid you silly nit, we'll be on horses and horses are good swimmers.' She submits and they proceed to cross the five feet deep river. Question: When the apes see the horses safely swimming to the other side why don't they follow? 10)We discover along with the main characters that Wahlberg's space station passed through the same time warp he did but crash landed 3,000 years before and that, presumedly, the smart little monkeys aboard went crazy and killed all the humans. And then I take it they evolved into the warlike big apes we now see. In only 3,000 years of evolution??? 11)As for the trick ending that everyone has now heard about. Can someone please tell me because I fell asleep again. I'd like to state for the record that I loved Starship Troopers.</fullReview>

Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied.

		<shortDescription>PLANET OF THE NYUK NYUK's, or: "I Waited 25 YEARS for THIS??!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!) God in Heaven, where does one begin? I became an APES freak around 1973 and collected the toys, memorabilia, and all. I even made a fan magazine on PLANET OF THE APES. This franchise was lost in the dust for a few decades and I prayed it would return one day. Well, it FINALLY has - and I'm not so sure it's for the better.Yes, the kids will love this film, and yes, the toys and Ape Popularity will soar once again. But Lord, what an AWFUL motion picture - heartbreaking, really, after suuuccch a long wait. When I heard that Tim Burton and Rick Baker were involved I had some hopes. As I saw magazine articles, trailers, and makeup shots I said "yeah, this may actually work!" But then I saw the finished product...and my worst fears were confirmed, my few hopes were shot down, and once again I knew that there is no escaping the wrath of today's lousy movies.As the last 25 years or so passed before my eyes during the movie, I got disgusted, angered, and bored. Now, it's too easy to charge me with being too biased toward the 1968 original; I fully accepted some changes. Too bad every one was for the WORST. Well, enough preliminary stuff; let's get on to the movie, shall we? ---It's treated as a silly, dumb, stupid, lame joke. It's like watching Looney Tunes on acid or something. Tim Burton reportedly had much fun with this film, even laughing after yelling "Cut!" after each shot - and it shows. Burton has NO respect for this subject and thinks the APES are funny monkeys to be snickered at. And tossing in some lame variations of classic lines from the 1968 version only hinders, and seem forced. Though the unfunny and aching silliness is what peeves me the most, there's more:Where's the script? What little story there is is full of convoluted and illogical situations. The so-called "story" merely zips in and out of perfunctory APES scenarios: A convenient hunt scene as soon as the astronaut lands, and an obligatory escape attempt, for example. The characters are totally uninteresting. ALL of the humans, that's the first thing. Michael Clark Duncan looks good, but offers nothing. Marky Mark is by-the-numbers and not much of an actor. People are speaking highly of Helena Bonham Carter as the girl chimp, but her character just squeals a lot and is afraid of her own shadow. Her Animal Activist potential is hinted at but dropped quickly. When she falls for Marky, it's absurd. I mean, she loves animals but does she want to sleep with them?? When she kisses the astronaut at the end of the movie, who cares, it's another loan from the original, except that at least there had been more involvement and caring between Taylor and Zira. THEY seemed to spend weeks and weeks getting to know and understand each other; this time, Carter and Mark seem to have only been introduced an hour or two beforehand. And her makeup (as with the other females) is VERY POOR. John Chambers runs circles around Rick Baker there, with his original Zira makeup from the first version.Yes, by the way, the other makeup is very good. Particularly Tim Roth's evil-looking Thade. Pity that Roth's idea of portraying a villain here though is to snarl, grunt, hiss, and swing around the room. I was looking forward to Roth's performance most of all, but he blew it.I don't much care for the beastial savagery and more "primitive" apes of this new feature, either. To me, the Apes were more like spoiled Monkeys, and far too irrational and animalistic to run the planet. And how does this make them so superior to the humans, anyway? These talkative homo sapiens look capable enough to plan their own revolt.The character of Limbo was an annoying and unfunny Jar Jar Binks-type, and we needed him out of there ASAP. What a stooge. Assasinate him, please.Charlton Heston's cameo could have been decent, had it not been destroyed by his classic "Damn Them All To Hell!" line that came off as desperate and embarrassing. It could have worked in a skit from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, but in what should be an intense and intelligent sci-fi film.And the ending? What can you say? It is closer to the book, but comes off as confusing in its execution. It looks Stupid, obligatory, and conveniently sets up for a (gulp) sequel. Man, what a dumb excuse for a movie!!!! Whether there ever was another version or not, this is one limp knee-slapper. Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk!Damn You to Hell, Tim Burton!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are bad because of low budget. Some movies are bad because of a bad plot. Some movies are bad by design, i.e. quickie, cheesy exploitation movies. And some movies are bad because a director goes hopelessly out of control... pounding home his vision with the force of a gorilla's fist in an iron glove. Joining the ranks of "Water World", "The Wild, Wild West" and "Battlefield Earth", "Planet Of The Apes" comes yelping and screaming to the screen as a comic book come to life. The trouble is, it doesn't know what it is. A science fiction thriller? A horror story? A comedy? High Camp? Unintentionally funny. Stilted. Stupefying. Kris Kristofferson is left hung out to dry as a sort of latter-day Tumak from "One Million Years B.C.;" loincloth-clad Estella Warren appears baffled throughout and although a love interest, has surprisingly little to do . Various human characters are introduced only to later stand around and gawk. Some great ape makeup is wasted on some of the sorriest, most hapless ape villains in movie history. Apes snarl. They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses. We have comic(?) relief in the form of a Gilbert Gottfried patterned ape slave trader who is one moment sadistically brutal, the next moment a wise-cracking borscht-belt comedian who may be the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar Binks. Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description. Tim Burton slips on a Kong-Sized banana peel. A stupendous, colossal, preposterous yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A painfully contrived, good-looking mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 may well be memorable as the prime year for really stupid movies. Tim Burton's ambitious attempt to remake a dubious classic is certainly not the worst offender of the summer, but it may be the one that wastes the most potential. In trying to avoid the pitfalls of most remakes, Burton and his scripters have tortured logic to contravene the "surprise" ending of the original to the point that their story makes little dramatic or logical sense. With decent make-up (the lady apes are a little silly-looking), cool sets, and impressive stunt-actor acrobatics, the movie has great visual appeal, but the story veers between an allegory of man's inhumanity to man-like beings and an epic action film without ever managing to be entertaining. See coincidence stretched once again to the breaking point, lame one-liners that no one laughs at, meaningless characters who serve no dramatic or thematic purpose, all in the service of a story with no real point. Have to applaud the hilarious scene where perennial NRA pimp Charlton Heston as a dying father ape reveals that the secret family treasure is a hand-gun, and some of the ape cultural touches (loved the way they mounted horses) are really neat, but generally this movie left me feeling like I had wasted over two hours of my life and several points of my IQ. And after this summer, I don't have much left. Easily Tim Burton's worst movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY!! A Summer Movie That Doesn't Disappoint!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apes are here at last!! Bravo! Boy, are they "mad, bad, and dangerous to know."Planet of The Apes is one of several movies that I earmarked to see this summer season. It is the first that did not disappoint...in fact it actually exceeded my expectations. Let's get something straight, right off the bat, I did not go to the theater expecting to be enlightened. I went to be entertained and Planet of the Apes is extremely entertaining. The costumes and makeup are first rate. Rick Baker should, deservedly so, garner another Oscar for his work. The apes are REAL...more real than the dinosaurs in the disappointing Jurassic Park 3. The actors were great. Tim Roth is menacingly elegant as General Thade. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Tagawa are excellent in the student/sensei roles. Helena Bonham Carter...ah well, is it me or does she actually look and perform better as an ape? Paul Giamatti almost steals the movie as the human slave trader, Limbo. The human actors were...well...human. The movie isn't called Planet of The Humans is it?I'm a fan of the first Planet Of The Apes. This film is as good in some parts and much, much better in others. Go see the movie, sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the same problem as all the other big-budget flicks these days - it was made from a recipe instead of a screenplay. Burton's trademark eye candy is still there, but there is absolutely no soul or authentic emotion anywhere. Marky Mark is clueless, and therefore Ari's crush on him is inexplicable. Tim Roth plays 'psycho' for the whole film. In fact, except for Bonham-Carter and Tagawa (Krull, the disgraced soldier gorilla), the acting is horrendous for a movie this expensive. And did we really need a wise-a** character like Limbo? The original film was great because it was played straight; this one feels like "Scary Movie 3", without the bathroom humor. What a disappointment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disappointment in a Summer Replete With Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone else out there fondly remember summers past when James Cameron would wow us with intelligent action flicks like "True Lies" or "Terminator 2," or Steven Spielberg would show us the true measure of his genius with an Indiana Jones adventure or the original "Jurassic Park"? Much to my dismay, those days are long gone."The Mummy Returns" was an exercise in overkill. "Pearl Harbor" was a tedious bore. "Tomb Raider" and "Swordfish" were both so thoroughly awful they don't even merit discussion. Spielberg's "A.I." was a pretentious mish-mash of vague concepts. And you know things are bad when the usually reliable Disney delivers an uninspired dud like "Atlantis: The Lost Empire." Only slightly better were "The Score" (buoyed by its actors) and "Jurassic Park III," whose makers were wise enough to give us only 90 minutes of a rapidly tiring novelty.Which brings us to this disgrace. While I am not a huge fan of the original, I am sure this version is sure to enrage those who are. The writers of "Planet of the Apes" have substituted a series of lame jokes and puns for an actual plot, while subjecting us to a bunch of bland, one-dimensional characters and familiar action sequences. The incessant screeching and growling of the apes stands as the most annoying redundancy in a film since the depth charges of "U-571." Only the superb make-up by Rick Baker et al. make this film worthy of a one-time viewing.Finally, some thoughts on the director, Tim Burton. For the life of me I cannot figure out why so many people adore his work. Yes, I love "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure," and the original "Batman," while no masterpiece, is one of the best comic book movies to date. But his track record of late is atrocious: "Sleepy Hollow" was awful, and until I saw "Mars Attacks!" I never thought I'd see Jack Nicholson give a truly bad performance in a film. I will give "Beetlejuice" full marks for comedic value and originality, but "Edward Scissorhands" is a cheesy sentimentalist abomination.I find it interesting that "Ed Wood," far and away Burton's best film, is the one least remembered or mentioned by his legions of acolytes. The talent of which he is capable shines through that film, but it appears he has sacrificed it for the allure of big-budget bombast like "Planet of the Apes." Chalk Mr. Burton up as another casualty of Hollywood's war on artistic filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has shown many things in his life as a filmmaker: a knack for gloomy atmosphere; a real sense of empathy for the lonely and different ones; a wicked sense of humor; he's even shown that he can play by the rules of the studios, delivering not only once but twice, even making a sequel and pulling it off.Sadly, none of that shows in "Planet...". The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect ("Sleepy Hollow" and "Batman" come to mind) and his "wicked sense of humor" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through "Planet..." with his best "Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Something About Monkey....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And with that comment goes the first, last, and only bad primate pun in this review.Leave it to Tim Burton to take a familiar franchise or story, keep enough of the source material to make it familiar, then add his own unique twist. "Planet of the Apes" is much like "Batman" or "Sleepy Hollow" in that respect. You know what you're getting, but not sure of how it's going to be told, or what surprises lie along the way.This is "B movie" fun at its finest. Of course, you're dealing with a film about talking monkeys, so if you're going into this film expecting something overtly serious, you're not going to find it. It's a very surreal film, both in its ideas and in watching the human-like apes, swing, beat their chests, ride horses, and carry on conversations. It's fascinating and a little scary at the same time. Burton's quirky sense of humor is definitely apparent in the ape cities. The make-up in this film is great, especially the gorilla soldiers. The actor cameos are fun to spot (Watch for Heston - Burton does a good job in paying homage to the original series), and the twist in meaning of the original film's dialogue is definitely worth a laugh or two.The story was an interesting take on the original series. At times it was silly (and seems aware of this), but not necessarily in an unpleasant way. The biggest problem that I had with the story was in the resolution (I thought a lot of the conflict issues were too neatly and conveniently tied up). Burton also did a nice job providing a new spin on the classic film's infamous "Statue of Liberty" scene. There definitely seems to be plans in the works for a sequel by the way it ended.I think this film will get some criticism for what it is, but you know, this isn't the type of film that is going to teach you something about yourself, nor will it provide the solution to all the world's problems by the time the end credits roll. I had fun with this. It was wild, it was campy, the acting performances were good for this type of film, and the special effects were entertaining. I enjoyed this film for what it set out to do, and I'm glad it's not simply a rehash of the original film.Burton has still been unable to let me down, and still remains one of my favorite directors. I'll definitely add this to my "Burton DVD" collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with a lot of the commenters. The apes and their clothes were fabulous. But the sets and the plot weren't. Actually, I thought this movie was boring. There was no characterization. Motives for actions were hard to discern. (Maybe the idea of the Mark Wahlberg character was: What happens when a basically shallow, dumb person ends up as the key man in a complicated situation? Answer: He becomes a vehicle for action --- of which there was a lot.) I think that this movie is summed up in the credits which were somber and elegant all by themselves --- the film is about great costumes and the power of design. But That's All, Folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has shown many things in his life as a filmmaker: a knack for gloomy atmosphere; a real sense of empathy for the lonely and different ones; a wicked sense of humor; he's even shown that he can play by the rules of the studios, delivering not only once but twice, even making a sequel and pulling it off.Sadly, none of that shows in "Planet...". The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect ("Sleepy Hollow" and "Batman" come to mind) and his "wicked sense of humor" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through "Planet..." with his best "Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PLANET OF THE NYUK NYUK's, or: "I Waited 25 YEARS for THIS??!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!) God in Heaven, where does one begin? I became an APES freak around 1973 and collected the toys, memorabilia, and all. I even made a fan magazine on PLANET OF THE APES. This franchise was lost in the dust for a few decades and I prayed it would return one day. Well, it FINALLY has - and I'm not so sure it's for the better.Yes, the kids will love this film, and yes, the toys and Ape Popularity will soar once again. But Lord, what an AWFUL motion picture - heartbreaking, really, after suuuccch a long wait. When I heard that Tim Burton and Rick Baker were involved I had some hopes. As I saw magazine articles, trailers, and makeup shots I said "yeah, this may actually work!" But then I saw the finished product...and my worst fears were confirmed, my few hopes were shot down, and once again I knew that there is no escaping the wrath of today's lousy movies.As the last 25 years or so passed before my eyes during the movie, I got disgusted, angered, and bored. Now, it's too easy to charge me with being too biased toward the 1968 original; I fully accepted some changes. Too bad every one was for the WORST. Well, enough preliminary stuff; let's get on to the movie, shall we? ---It's treated as a silly, dumb, stupid, lame joke. It's like watching Looney Tunes on acid or something. Tim Burton reportedly had much fun with this film, even laughing after yelling "Cut!" after each shot - and it shows. Burton has NO respect for this subject and thinks the APES are funny monkeys to be snickered at. And tossing in some lame variations of classic lines from the 1968 version only hinders, and seem forced. Though the unfunny and aching silliness is what peeves me the most, there's more:Where's the script? What little story there is is full of convoluted and illogical situations. The so-called "story" merely zips in and out of perfunctory APES scenarios: A convenient hunt scene as soon as the astronaut lands, and an obligatory escape attempt, for example. The characters are totally uninteresting. ALL of the humans, that's the first thing. Michael Clark Duncan looks good, but offers nothing. Marky Mark is by-the-numbers and not much of an actor. People are speaking highly of Helena Bonham Carter as the girl chimp, but her character just squeals a lot and is afraid of her own shadow. Her Animal Activist potential is hinted at but dropped quickly. When she falls for Marky, it's absurd. I mean, she loves animals but does she want to sleep with them?? When she kisses the astronaut at the end of the movie, who cares, it's another loan from the original, except that at least there had been more involvement and caring between Taylor and Zira. THEY seemed to spend weeks and weeks getting to know and understand each other; this time, Carter and Mark seem to have only been introduced an hour or two beforehand. And her makeup (as with the other females) is VERY POOR. John Chambers runs circles around Rick Baker there, with his original Zira makeup from the first version.Yes, by the way, the other makeup is very good. Particularly Tim Roth's evil-looking Thade. Pity that Roth's idea of portraying a villain here though is to snarl, grunt, hiss, and swing around the room. I was looking forward to Roth's performance most of all, but he blew it.I don't much care for the beastial savagery and more "primitive" apes of this new feature, either. To me, the Apes were more like spoiled Monkeys, and far too irrational and animalistic to run the planet. And how does this make them so superior to the humans, anyway? These talkative homo sapiens look capable enough to plan their own revolt.The character of Limbo was an annoying and unfunny Jar Jar Binks-type, and we needed him out of there ASAP. What a stooge. Assasinate him, please.Charlton Heston's cameo could have been decent, had it not been destroyed by his classic "Damn Them All To Hell!" line that came off as desperate and embarrassing. It could have worked in a skit from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, but in what should be an intense and intelligent sci-fi film.And the ending? What can you say? It is closer to the book, but comes off as confusing in its execution. It looks Stupid, obligatory, and conveniently sets up for a (gulp) sequel. Man, what a dumb excuse for a movie!!!! Whether there ever was another version or not, this is one limp knee-slapper. Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk!Damn You to Hell, Tim Burton!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>preposterous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are bad because of low budget. Some movies are bad because of a bad plot. Some movies are bad by design, i.e. quickie, cheesy exploitation movies. And some movies are bad because a director goes hopelessly out of control... pounding home his vision with the force of a gorilla's fist in an iron glove. Joining the ranks of "Water World", "The Wild, Wild West" and "Battlefield Earth", "Planet Of The Apes" comes yelping and screaming to the screen as a comic book come to life. The trouble is, it doesn't know what it is. A science fiction thriller? A horror story? A comedy? High Camp? Unintentionally funny. Stilted. Stupefying. Kris Kristofferson is left hung out to dry as a sort of latter-day Tumak from "One Million Years B.C.;" loincloth-clad Estella Warren appears baffled throughout and although a love interest, has surprisingly little to do . Various human characters are introduced only to later stand around and gawk. Some great ape makeup is wasted on some of the sorriest, most hapless ape villains in movie history. Apes snarl. They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses. We have comic(?) relief in the form of a Gilbert Gottfried patterned ape slave trader who is one moment sadistically brutal, the next moment a wise-cracking borscht-belt comedian who may be the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar Binks. Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description. Tim Burton slips on a Kong-Sized banana peel. A stupendous, colossal, preposterous yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Something About Monkey....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And with that comment goes the first, last, and only bad primate pun in this review.Leave it to Tim Burton to take a familiar franchise or story, keep enough of the source material to make it familiar, then add his own unique twist. "Planet of the Apes" is much like "Batman" or "Sleepy Hollow" in that respect. You know what you're getting, but not sure of how it's going to be told, or what surprises lie along the way.This is "B movie" fun at its finest. Of course, you're dealing with a film about talking monkeys, so if you're going into this film expecting something overtly serious, you're not going to find it. It's a very surreal film, both in its ideas and in watching the human-like apes, swing, beat their chests, ride horses, and carry on conversations. It's fascinating and a little scary at the same time. Burton's quirky sense of humor is definitely apparent in the ape cities. The make-up in this film is great, especially the gorilla soldiers. The actor cameos are fun to spot (Watch for Heston - Burton does a good job in paying homage to the original series), and the twist in meaning of the original film's dialogue is definitely worth a laugh or two.The story was an interesting take on the original series. At times it was silly (and seems aware of this), but not necessarily in an unpleasant way. The biggest problem that I had with the story was in the resolution (I thought a lot of the conflict issues were too neatly and conveniently tied up). Burton also did a nice job providing a new spin on the classic film's infamous "Statue of Liberty" scene. There definitely seems to be plans in the works for a sequel by the way it ended.I think this film will get some criticism for what it is, but you know, this isn't the type of film that is going to teach you something about yourself, nor will it provide the solution to all the world's problems by the time the end credits roll. I had fun with this. It was wild, it was campy, the acting performances were good for this type of film, and the special effects were entertaining. I enjoyed this film for what it set out to do, and I'm glad it's not simply a rehash of the original film.Burton has still been unable to let me down, and still remains one of my favorite directors. I'll definitely add this to my "Burton DVD" collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2nd night the movie opened, i went to the drive-in (along with Kiss Of The Dragon) and watched it with a good friend. We both thought the movie was awsome. He had already seen the older Planet Of The Apes films and stuff, but all I knew about it was Talking Apes Controlling Humans, but it is so much more. I would love to tell you all about but I don't want to give it all away. Everyone "BOW YOUR HEADS!" cause you MUST see this movie, and go see it again. See it till you're eyes bleed. The make-up makes the actors really look like monkeys ("No! We Are APES!") It really is amazing, but don't take my word for it, go see it for yourself! Again &amp; Again &amp; Again &amp; Again...Plus, go see it again, haha</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has gone steadily downhill since Beetlegeuse. I thought directors were supposed to get better with experience. This movie is a waste. The special effects, makeup and costuming are fine. But the plot has holes large enough for several large semis loaded with gorillas. The character development is weaker than Schreck...its just a waste of actors and money. I would go see almost anything else if you are in a movie mood.</fullReview>

There was no characterization. Motives for actions were hard to discern. (Maybe the idea of the Mark Wahlberg character was: What happens when a basically shallow, dumb person ends up as the key man in a complicated situation? Answer: He becomes a vehicle for action --- of which there was a lot.)

		<shortDescription>The monkey fell out of the tree....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was terrible. It blows my mind that all that effort on makeup could be spent without someone realizing that the screenplay sucked. It's like overhauling an engine on a car that's missing the chassis!This movie stunk for the same reasons that so many other movies like it stunk: two many things going on in the plot. Ari falling for Leo. Daena falling for Leo. Leo falling for....well....I dunno. Leo trying to get away. Leo realizing he has to help his fellow humans. The humans believing Leo and realizing they can fight the apes. The apes in the beginning are bickering over whether or not to kill off humans, while Thade and his armies are trying to kill the humans. Attar in the end, of course, suddenly changes his mind. Also, there's this underlying story of how the apes got there. Oh yeah, and somewhere in the beginning, there must have been something going on with Thade and Ari. I've left out some other aspects of this flick, but you get the point. The plot had too much going on for a two-hour movie. When there are too many things going on, i.e. too many aspects, there's not enough time to develop the these individual aspects, and that's when things start getting cheesy. Daena lovingly placing her hand on Leo's face after saying virtually nothing to him throughout the movie is one such example.----SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT, DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!--- Leo kissing Ari after the battle is yet another such example of cheesiness that occurred from lack of development. Just think, entire movies have been spent developing the formation of love between two people (When Harry Met Sally), yet we are somehow expected to appreciate it when it abruptly happens in Planet of the Apes? It was much, much more cheesy when Daena kissed Leo.This movie was sloppy. Worse than Pearl Harbor, worse than a lot of movies I've seen. It truly seemed as though the screenwriter was creating the plot as he went along writing the screenplay. Tim Burton ought to realize that good costumes and sets don't make up for a lowsy screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry everyone, this reinvention of the 1968 classic just isn't up to par. Mark Walhberg as the astronaut is awful. His acting ruined what might have been a strong male lead. He is not believable in his role. The ape make up is Oscar worthy, though at most times it distracts from the already weak plot and make most dialogue incomprehensible. This film parodies the previous "Ape" film with several one-liners. This is not supposed to be a comedy or satire, it is a "message" movie on how we treat and behave towards other beings. At least that was what the novel and 1968 version was about. I think another problem was that the director did not know whether to have the apes behave like apes or humans. Dd they evolve and become human like or retain there ape behavious and just learn to speak? So many questions? Goofs? Disjointed plotlines and other errors that cannot be detailed without giving away the plot. Enjoy the make up and effects but that's it!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first 100 minutes of the movie even though it doesn't even compare to "Batman" or "Edward's Scissorhands". I liked the ending because I thought it was a good and interesting departure from the original. Only one thing ruined everything for me:WARNING: SPOILER AHEADThe only thing that made me mad was seeing Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan's character) turn his back on his best friend because of what Leo tells him. Come on! The guy is in the army, is the best friend of the great General who hates every human, has believed in his religion his whole life, a religion that has existed for a long time and that everyone believes in, and the guy is ready to listen and BELIEVE what a human has to say?!?! And by the way, it takes about 3 seconds to Attar to reject everything he has ever believed in during his entire existence and accept and believe the exact opposite concerning humans and his god.Nonetheless, the beginning was good because of makeup, costumes and simian attitudes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Striking visual and philisophical feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from a sneak showing of this film and it's still running through me. First of all the film moves so quickly and is edited so smoothly that the force of the ruling apes pulses through each frame. Thade, the fierce leader played by Tim Roth, intimidates the viewer and flies through the air to viciously end any who oppose him. I found myself recoiling everytime he took flight to horrify and kill a human. His is a villain I was truly afraid of, which is a first in a long while. The visual style of this film is uncanny, the colors and the tones of each scene and setting a complete feast for the eye. I could spend my life looking at this film and never tire of it. The sets and costumes are absolutely stunning and gorgeous - alot of it looks like it was designed by costume designer Eiko Ishioka (Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) and The Cell). Lisa Marie as Nova was hysterical. Miss Helena Bonham Carter is very pleasing to watch as always, and surprisingly Estella Warren, the blonde beauty, has very, very few lines and a very small part. An unnamed child who tags along has more lines than her. The film's pace is so brisk I thought by the first twenty minutes they were almost halfway through the movie, but then more and more happened and began to unfold. Some of the best discussions about religion, politics and slavery can be found in this film, making such a bold and correct statement about how though species may differ, their ideas that allow them to live due to belief in a higher power are all the same, on this planet or elsewhere. Religion is an invention of higher intelligence, though that's not to say that religion itself is intelligent - in fact it's rather illogical and nonsensical for a "higher" species such as ourselves. We consider our species so much "better" and "perfect" that we assume that if there is, in fact, a God, it made us in its likeness. If you think about it, we have never even entertained the notion that the higher power may in fact be something of a different species, if any at all. No, THAT'S absurd. (Roll of eyes). The action sequences were powerful and well directed, but that goes without saying, seeing as this IS a Tim Burton movie. I rather enjoyed that it wasn't Sleepy Hollow 2. Although that film is genius and Tim Burton's trademark, I'm glad he stretched his creative muscles and ventured into a different territory of filmmaking, at least in its style. Although his films carry a very similar theme - someone lost in a world of absurdity with very few but existing traces of sympathizers and saviors. Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes stands as its own film, and not a remake. It's powerful, philisophical, moving and fierce. It will leave its mark. In me it already has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some great performances squares out the unnecessary use of violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inevitably you must compare the 1968 original with the 2001 reimagining. What I missed the most was the scientific approach that the original had. Showing why the apes' beliefs were covered in lies and why humans actually were intelligent.In this Tim Burton movie it seems he has to add the violence and fighting needed to get the big movie producing budget from 20th Century Fox.In one sequence Leo (played by Mark Wahlberg) points a gun at an ape, but is told to not sink to his level (the ape was a trader-in-humans) by Ari (magnificently played by Helena Bonham-Carter). Yet in the end there is no problem to fight the Ape army in Braveheart-style.The whole magic usually included in Tim Burton movies is never there, and somehow he falls for the blockbuster-syndrome: a cool action-hero and a lot of incredible stunts.And the ending, without spoiling anything, must be the worst ever displayed on the screens.However, the costumes and make-ups are incredible, but they are in line with modern movie-technology. They could give one or two Academy Awards next year. But I don't understand why apes covered in body-hair/fur would want to wear clothing or uniforms. Overall, the great performances by Helena Bonham-Carter as a Senators daughter and revolting youth preaching humanism and equality and Tim Roth as the dangerous and evil general Thade makes this movie a pretty good entertainment and raising the Rating to 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Didn't "Rule the Planet", but give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film industry has been fortunate enough, over the years,to see the God of Odd, Tim Burton, work his magic on-screen. However, Planet of the Apes isn't the best work he's accomplished in his career, but despite my gripes, it's worth a viewing. One complaint I've heard is that it was "nothing like the original", but nor was it supposed to be. It is a "revisiting", not a "re-make." Visually, I found the movie stunning. The costumes (compliments of Burton's long-time collaborator Colleen Atwood)were innovative in distinctive, Rick Baker's ape make-up was absolutely incredible, and the special-effects were very up-to-date and realistic (and see this in a theatre with a good sound system, ladies and gentlemen; the sound is rich and full). And last but certainly not least, Tim Burton certainly polished it with his wonderfully unmistakable style, and I'm glad the movie (I write this on the official release date) seems to be raking in the bucks, for Burton's sake. He is an underappreciated artist, and there's nothing like a Burton movie.My complaints? Well, first of all, I was upset the Danny Elfman's score got virtually buried under the sound of explosions and such, although from what I heard, it wasn't his best work either. The characters were grossly underdeveloped and the good aspects of the plot were those taken from the original, like the watered-down metaphor it creates of society in general. The screenplay was really nothing special, and I wonder how the writers sat down and wrote such unoriginal drivel when their point in going about this film was to adapt the story their own way but make it as good as the original film. They should consider themselves lucky (the writers, that is) that Twentieth Century Fo hired Burton to convey the story to film in his own vision and that the actors were, for the most-part, fine artists. Although I found Mark Wahlberg's (Leo Davidson) acting wooden and unfelt, there wasn't much one could do with the character, I suppose. Estella Warren as Daena was nothing more than a pretty face and her acting was not impressive in the least, but what can be expected of a model turned "actress"?. It was refreshing to see Helena Bonham Carter in a role where there are no parasols and corsets, and she was fairly impressive in the role of the sympathetic ape Ari. Paul Giamatti (Limbo) was hilarious and added a nice touch to the heavy plot, but he couldn't redeem the screenplay, and Michael Clark Duncan (Attar) was just big and scary! Finally, Tim Roth, as always, gave an exquisite performance as the villainous Gen. Thade. His bad guys are always wonderful, but he was so delightfully sinister in this one (I think it may have been the prosthetic make-up, too, but he's a superb actor!) My MAJOR criticism would have to be the ending. I wondered what it would be like, since the original film's end was so ingenious, and I had heard that Burton filmed 5 versions before the filmmakers chose this one. I would be interested in seeing the remaining 4, seeing as I didn't care much for this one. I won't give it away, but it really confused the HELL outta me for a long time, and after discussing it with lots of different people, we came to a conclusion, but it is still unimpressive. There will never be an ending like seeing the Statue of Liberty right there on the beach...it's chilling. If this version's ending had been explained a bit better, maybe it could have been received better, but the general concensus in the theatre was, "Huh??" I guess the producers just want to see if they can milk a sequel out of this one too so they can make a quick buck...I hope to God Burton doesn't direct it, for his own sake. I would hate to have him mixed up in something that would definitly be so awful if those writers remained. Ugh. ANYWAY, I know my complaints seem more passionate than the things I LIKED about this movie, but I did enjoy it, actually. I recommend it, and if you don't like it, yippee for you, but at least you opened your mind (and your wallet, too, but oh, well.) I never thought I'd give a Burton movie anything but a 10 out of 10, but I give Planet of the Apes a 7 1/2 out of 10. Hats off to Burton for trying to redeem the lamentable script, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The little movie that could... but didn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes has many things going for it. The first three are the creative minds of Tim Burton (director), Rick Baker (Make-up), and Danny Elfman (Music). The sets and locations work well with the costuming and make-up to give this an original look and an authentic feel even though it is a remake. The cinematography and music work well together because neither one overshadows the other making the combination very powerful.The acting was good and I must take my hat off to Helena Bonham Carter and to Tim Roth who did exceptional in their portrayals. The supporting cast didn't stand out like Carter or Roth, but they did a good job of holding their own ground. Mark Wahlberg's character, Leo Davidson, is the classic military hero who never shows too much emotion because he is trying to stay in control of the situation. It almost seems that if Wahlberg weren't an actor, he would have actually been this guy. Estella Warren's character could have easily weighed down the movie by being the typical sexy woman, but thankfully Burton never really draws attention to her in that way: we know she's beautiful, but we don't need to waste 20 minutes of the movie proving it. She doesn't have any dense lines bent at attracting Wahlberg or any slow motion shots of her character taking a hot bath. Instead Estella Warren does a good job of playing a character simply caught in the story and reacting in a realistic way. A personal favorite part of mine was the cameo appearance of Charlton Heston, who almost has the same classic line that he had in the original.The story, though shaky at the beginning, quickly regains its composure and holds the audience's attention. Once upon the actual planet, there are many satirical references to the way our society has treated animals, the environment, and each other (in cases of slavery). It is this ability of holding a mirror to society that has made Burton a genius in his craft. Even though the storyline is a tad simple and any audience member can guess or just about guess how the whole story transpired, it doesn't matter because we are trapped in this world and we become interested in the characters interaction with each other.The ending is what could have wrapped up the entire experience into a good movie? but didn't. The last ten minutes of the movie was a horrible attempt at a twist ending. If you watch closely you can see the movie end, but for some reason, another whole ending is added. The problem with the second twist ending is that there is no bridge that connects this ending with the rest of the movie, so instead of discovering an ending you didn't even know you were looking for, you leave the theater thinking `Ummm? ok, that doesn't make very much sense.' The storyline should take you from point A to point B, but the ending tells you that you are actually at point C and doesn't attempt in any way, shape, or form to explain how you got there.I gave this movie a 5 because it has the attempt, it just doesn't have the follow through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some great performances squares out the unnecessary use of violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inevitably you must compare the 1968 original with the 2001 reimagining. What I missed the most was the scientific approach that the original had. Showing why the apes' beliefs were covered in lies and why humans actually were intelligent.In this Tim Burton movie it seems he has to add the violence and fighting needed to get the big movie producing budget from 20th Century Fox.In one sequence Leo (played by Mark Wahlberg) points a gun at an ape, but is told to not sink to his level (the ape was a trader-in-humans) by Ari (magnificently played by Helena Bonham-Carter). Yet in the end there is no problem to fight the Ape army in Braveheart-style.The whole magic usually included in Tim Burton movies is never there, and somehow he falls for the blockbuster-syndrome: a cool action-hero and a lot of incredible stunts.And the ending, without spoiling anything, must be the worst ever displayed on the screens.However, the costumes and make-ups are incredible, but they are in line with modern movie-technology. They could give one or two Academy Awards next year. But I don't understand why apes covered in body-hair/fur would want to wear clothing or uniforms. Overall, the great performances by Helena Bonham-Carter as a Senators daughter and revolting youth preaching humanism and equality and Tim Roth as the dangerous and evil general Thade makes this movie a pretty good entertainment and raising the Rating to 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton doesn't Monkey Around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got up this morning with one goal in mind, and that was to go see Planet of the Apes. The math was Simple, I love Tim Burton and I loved the original Ape movies. I have been drooling over this movie for quite some time now, eagerly awaiting it's release. Was I disapointed? Nope. The movie was truly amazing to watch. Tim Burton truly knows how to put his movies together, in this case hiring amazing actors for their roles, from Tim Roth whose eyes just scream Evil, to Micheal Clark Duncan, who let's face it, already looks somewhat like a Gorilla. It's the makeup by Rick Baker though, that really makes this movie what it is, Gone are the rubber masks from the classic sixties and seventies films. This is truly state of the art mask techniques, with ape faces that movie with the human faces, from frowns, to smiles. The one part of this movie that I DON'T think was any good, was the ending!! I'm not going to discuss too much about it because I don't like to give Spoilers, but let me just say that the first Ape movie, the ending made sense, and it fit to the rest of the plot. The ending of THIS ape movie, comes out of nowhere, and makes absolutley no sense with the rest of the plot. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sky Messiahs and Conqueror Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie weighted with the planet-sized immensity of the original series of Ape films, which I grew up on. All part of an education in a time, the '70s, where men could be reflected in evolved apes, their penchant for cruelty and misunderstanding, horror and revolt, subjugation, was still poignant. In Tim Burton's film, there's no deeper meaning to the situation, not many today under the age of thirty and living in America have any true idea of the danger of being human, of being the superior creature on the planet, whose drive for self-destruction might just give birth to a new world order, run by man's genetic ancestor, the ape.Tim Burton doesn't concern himself with reflecting the human race. He just sets out, along with Tim Roth and Helena Carter, to show just how awesome an intelligent, weapons-using, armored gorilla is. Also, there's an entire Ape psychology to go along with the advancements, the 'human' qualities. Apes explode in frenzies of blurred animal movment when startled, they smell at one another to perceive lies or fear, they use touch as a constant reminder of their closeness, just as they did when they didn't use tongues or swords as weapons.So for your money, you get a bunch of stiff, annoying 'humans', all of whom speak perfect English (a plotless point, since in the original film humans were animals, speechless--here, despite being subjugated for thousands of years, humans talk but don't say anything at all, no different than they do today, when the fact is these humans living as squalid jungle rats should have devolved over time to about idiot level, about the same as your average high schooler, say) and its obvious that Burton could give a hoot about any of the human characters outside the hero Davison, an astronaut who falls from the sky and becomes a messiah. All the rest of the humans squeak protest and get crushed by Apes. And good riddance, because it's the Apes that the movie is about. How cool is it to be able to jump twelve feet in the air, use your feet as hands, and be stronger than three or four big strong men, with the fighting ferocity of a primal beast? That's why Burton made this flick.Tim Roth also gives probably his best performance, as zealous military commander Thade trying to hide the truth of the Ape Planet's origin. Helena Carter's Ari simply is the sexiest woman with facial hair and chimp hands you will ever see. And there is the fantastic ending.For me, the ending 'shock' works like I wouldn't have thought it would. Fact is, the story behind the ending, the implications, the actual love and appreciation shown for Rod Serling's 1968 script, is what makes it work. And sequels can be made, just like in the 70s, because it is the APES' story, just like it always was. If I'd seen this movie when I was a kid, I'd be loping on all fours like a charging gorilla or jumping out of trees and off furniture for weeks, all while emulating Thade's savage up-from-under glare. What Burton does is make me remember how great I thought Cornelius and Dr. Zeus was when I was an ankle-biter. Apes ruled then, and they rule now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great effects, bad story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(A spoiler or two) First off I haven't seen the original so I can't compare this psuedo remake to the '68 "cult classic." But even so, I must say that Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" is a mess of great effects, especially makeup, shoddy story-telling and with two exceptions badly written characters. The story consists of Mark Wahlberg as an Air Force pilot named Leo, in the near future, on a space station where he ends up getting time warped to an alternate universe where apes rule humans. Of course Leo gets caught but not to worry, thanks to an sympathetic ape (Helena Bonham Carter), he and several humans, along with Carter and another ape, escape and try to find a way to a place where Leo thinks his ship is waiting for him (he has a device, that he got from his crashed pod, that is leading them along the way to wherever the place might be). But of course apes find them and a huge battle ensues. That's pretty much it for the plot, now to the characters. Carter does a good job as the human loving ape Ari, but Wahlberg is a bore as the film's hero Leo, Estella Warren ("Driven") isn't very good either but Michael Clarke Duncan is okay as a Gorilla general though his brain pattern seems to be, "growl, yell, beat someone up, yell again..." and so on. The standout in the movie has to be Tim Roth's character General Thade, the film's main villain. Thade is the most animated and fascinating of all of the characters and Roth gives the role plenty of emotional power, which basically blows away anyone else on screen with him. I'd actually be interested to see a spinoff movie centering on the Thade character is explained more in depth. Most of the characters are a bore and some are killed off so fast we (the audience) never know who the are. Lastly, the makeup effects are very well done. The actors actually look like apes or gorillas or whatever. Again, Roth does the most with his character and the makeup fits the Thade character very well. Overall it's not a good movie, the choppy story and mostly bad characters take away what little good stuff the film had to begin with. To finish up, Roth is good but the rest of the flick is bad. Oh and the ending (which doesn't make a lot of sense, compared to the rest of the film) is silly and leaves this one wide open for a sequel, oh goody (note the heavy sarcasm here). I give it *1/2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You're Remaking Classics, Here's How to Do It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has the right idea here. This isn't just "let's shoot the same movie all over again with different actors", it's actually a fairly different take on the same material. The basic concept remains the same, but it's most definitely a different movie.One of the most noticeable differences is in the apes themselves. They're a great deal more bestial, athletic and...well, ape-like than their 1968 counterparts. Charlton Heston was threatened by the apes because they had guns. Mark Wahlberg is threatened by the apes because they are, as one might rightly expect, much more than a physical match for a human. I did miss the caste system that ruled the simian society in the original, but that probably has more to do with the script overall being much less allegorical than Rod Serling's 1968 screenplay.Mark Wahlberg is an appealing enough hero, though there's not really much of a character to play. Tim Roth is, as always, a terrific villain and probably the most convincing of any of the apes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Didn't "Rule the Planet", but give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film industry has been fortunate enough, over the years,to see the God of Odd, Tim Burton, work his magic on-screen. However, Planet of the Apes isn't the best work he's accomplished in his career, but despite my gripes, it's worth a viewing. One complaint I've heard is that it was "nothing like the original", but nor was it supposed to be. It is a "revisiting", not a "re-make." Visually, I found the movie stunning. The costumes (compliments of Burton's long-time collaborator Colleen Atwood)were innovative in distinctive, Rick Baker's ape make-up was absolutely incredible, and the special-effects were very up-to-date and realistic (and see this in a theatre with a good sound system, ladies and gentlemen; the sound is rich and full). And last but certainly not least, Tim Burton certainly polished it with his wonderfully unmistakable style, and I'm glad the movie (I write this on the official release date) seems to be raking in the bucks, for Burton's sake. He is an underappreciated artist, and there's nothing like a Burton movie.My complaints? Well, first of all, I was upset the Danny Elfman's score got virtually buried under the sound of explosions and such, although from what I heard, it wasn't his best work either. The characters were grossly underdeveloped and the good aspects of the plot were those taken from the original, like the watered-down metaphor it creates of society in general. The screenplay was really nothing special, and I wonder how the writers sat down and wrote such unoriginal drivel when their point in going about this film was to adapt the story their own way but make it as good as the original film. They should consider themselves lucky (the writers, that is) that Twentieth Century Fo hired Burton to convey the story to film in his own vision and that the actors were, for the most-part, fine artists. Although I found Mark Wahlberg's (Leo Davidson) acting wooden and unfelt, there wasn't much one could do with the character, I suppose. Estella Warren as Daena was nothing more than a pretty face and her acting was not impressive in the least, but what can be expected of a model turned "actress"?. It was refreshing to see Helena Bonham Carter in a role where there are no parasols and corsets, and she was fairly impressive in the role of the sympathetic ape Ari. Paul Giamatti (Limbo) was hilarious and added a nice touch to the heavy plot, but he couldn't redeem the screenplay, and Michael Clark Duncan (Attar) was just big and scary! Finally, Tim Roth, as always, gave an exquisite performance as the villainous Gen. Thade. His bad guys are always wonderful, but he was so delightfully sinister in this one (I think it may have been the prosthetic make-up, too, but he's a superb actor!) My MAJOR criticism would have to be the ending. I wondered what it would be like, since the original film's end was so ingenious, and I had heard that Burton filmed 5 versions before the filmmakers chose this one. I would be interested in seeing the remaining 4, seeing as I didn't care much for this one. I won't give it away, but it really confused the HELL outta me for a long time, and after discussing it with lots of different people, we came to a conclusion, but it is still unimpressive. There will never be an ending like seeing the Statue of Liberty right there on the beach...it's chilling. If this version's ending had been explained a bit better, maybe it could have been received better, but the general concensus in the theatre was, "Huh??" I guess the producers just want to see if they can milk a sequel out of this one too so they can make a quick buck...I hope to God Burton doesn't direct it, for his own sake. I would hate to have him mixed up in something that would definitly be so awful if those writers remained. Ugh. ANYWAY, I know my complaints seem more passionate than the things I LIKED about this movie, but I did enjoy it, actually. I recommend it, and if you don't like it, yippee for you, but at least you opened your mind (and your wallet, too, but oh, well.) I never thought I'd give a Burton movie anything but a 10 out of 10, but I give Planet of the Apes a 7 1/2 out of 10. Hats off to Burton for trying to redeem the lamentable script, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Apeland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember that the original Planet of the Apes frightened me badly the first time I saw it- the first image of gorillas on horseback bearing firearms was an effective attention-getter. If nothing else, Tim Burton's new APES carries the torch in this respect- even though I knew what was coming, the gorillas, orangutans and assorted other talking simians repeatedly raised the hair on my own neck, especially Tim Roth's incredibly athletic and menacing Thade. On top of that, Burton manages to throw in quite a bit of humor, including some goofball nods to the original APES. The sets of course are magnificent, and so are the makeup and effects. The SciFi sensibility of this version, however, is lacking (especially compared to how far ahead of its time the original was). The beginning of the film has a rushed feel to it, and there are some plot holes regarding space travel and basic physics that will turn off many hardline SciFi fans. All in all, though, summer audiences don't ask too much of their summer blockbusters, and this one delivers on that count. Never a dull moment, lots to look at, and the simians in this version are a LOT more ape-like. The acting achievements of Roth and Bonham-Carter are amazing, and steal a lot of thunder from the human co-stars, including Wahlberg (who unfortunately for his female audience never appears bare-chested... sorry girls). 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

The ending is also completely out in left field; come on, would the apes really have evolved EXACTLY like we did? I don't think so. Okay, I've just listed all of the flaws with this movie that I can think of. Otherwise, it was well choreographed and had a decent plot. Even Mark Wahlberg did a good job.

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is a good popcorn movie, but certainly no betterthan the original. While the 1968 version was a biting commentary on the socialupheaval of the times it was created in, the 2001 version has noneof the insight of the original (possibly because of the comparativelack of social upheaval of our times), nor is it as creative. In fact,this film forgoes a lot of the elements that made the original socompelling and interesting.SPOILERS BELOW!!I won't give away the conclusion, which turns out to be apredictable and PALE immitation of the power of the original, butthe "sub-simian" humans can talk (and miraculously know how toapply makeup, as is evidenced by one of the human actressesimpeccable lipstick job!), which ruins some of the dramaticpossibilities. It seems as if Tim Burton took from the original intitle only, and only came up with half a vision... it also seems as ifthe studio had it's way with Burton before the film was released,since he is far too talented a director to have his vision turn out thisway.I wouldn't say not to see this movie, but I would say that you'llclearly see the plot turns long before they happen. Go in with anopen mind, don't expect to see a remake of the original, and it's notsuch a bad way to waste a couple of hours.</fullReview>

Most of the characters are a bore and some are killed off so fast we (the audience) never know who the are. Lastly, the makeup effects are very well done. The actors actually look like apes or gorillas or whatever. Again, Roth does the most with his character and the makeup fits the Thade character very well. Overall it's not a good movie, the choppy story and mostly bad characters take away what little good stuff the film had to begin with. To finish up, Roth is good but the rest of the flick is bad. Oh and the ending (which doesn't make a lot of sense, compared to the rest of the film) is silly and leaves this one wide open for a sequel, oh goody (note the heavy sarcasm here). I give it *1/2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has the right idea here. This isn't just "let's shoot the same movie all over again with different actors", it's actually a fairly different take on the same material. The basic concept remains the same, but it's most definitely a different movie.One of the most noticeable differences is in the apes themselves. They're a great deal more bestial, athletic and...well, ape-like than their 1968 counterparts. Charlton Heston was threatened by the apes because they had guns. Mark Wahlberg is threatened by the apes because they are, as one might rightly expect, much more than a physical match for a human. I did miss the caste system that ruled the simian society in the original, but that probably has more to do with the script overall being much less allegorical than Rod Serling's 1968 screenplay.Mark Wahlberg is an appealing enough hero, though there's not really much of a character to play. Tim Roth is, as always, a terrific villain and probably the most convincing of any of the apes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Didn't "Rule the Planet", but give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film industry has been fortunate enough, over the years,to see the God of Odd, Tim Burton, work his magic on-screen. However, Planet of the Apes isn't the best work he's accomplished in his career, but despite my gripes, it's worth a viewing. One complaint I've heard is that it was "nothing like the original", but nor was it supposed to be. It is a "revisiting", not a "re-make." Visually, I found the movie stunning. The costumes (compliments of Burton's long-time collaborator Colleen Atwood)were innovative in distinctive, Rick Baker's ape make-up was absolutely incredible, and the special-effects were very up-to-date and realistic (and see this in a theatre with a good sound system, ladies and gentlemen; the sound is rich and full). And last but certainly not least, Tim Burton certainly polished it with his wonderfully unmistakable style, and I'm glad the movie (I write this on the official release date) seems to be raking in the bucks, for Burton's sake. He is an underappreciated artist, and there's nothing like a Burton movie.My complaints? Well, first of all, I was upset the Danny Elfman's score got virtually buried under the sound of explosions and such, although from what I heard, it wasn't his best work either. The characters were grossly underdeveloped and the good aspects of the plot were those taken from the original, like the watered-down metaphor it creates of society in general. The screenplay was really nothing special, and I wonder how the writers sat down and wrote such unoriginal drivel when their point in going about this film was to adapt the story their own way but make it as good as the original film. They should consider themselves lucky (the writers, that is) that Twentieth Century Fo hired Burton to convey the story to film in his own vision and that the actors were, for the most-part, fine artists. Although I found Mark Wahlberg's (Leo Davidson) acting wooden and unfelt, there wasn't much one could do with the character, I suppose. Estella Warren as Daena was nothing more than a pretty face and her acting was not impressive in the least, but what can be expected of a model turned "actress"?. It was refreshing to see Helena Bonham Carter in a role where there are no parasols and corsets, and she was fairly impressive in the role of the sympathetic ape Ari. Paul Giamatti (Limbo) was hilarious and added a nice touch to the heavy plot, but he couldn't redeem the screenplay, and Michael Clark Duncan (Attar) was just big and scary! Finally, Tim Roth, as always, gave an exquisite performance as the villainous Gen. Thade. His bad guys are always wonderful, but he was so delightfully sinister in this one (I think it may have been the prosthetic make-up, too, but he's a superb actor!) My MAJOR criticism would have to be the ending. I wondered what it would be like, since the original film's end was so ingenious, and I had heard that Burton filmed 5 versions before the filmmakers chose this one. I would be interested in seeing the remaining 4, seeing as I didn't care much for this one. I won't give it away, but it really confused the HELL outta me for a long time, and after discussing it with lots of different people, we came to a conclusion, but it is still unimpressive. There will never be an ending like seeing the Statue of Liberty right there on the beach...it's chilling. If this version's ending had been explained a bit better, maybe it could have been received better, but the general concensus in the theatre was, "Huh??" I guess the producers just want to see if they can milk a sequel out of this one too so they can make a quick buck...I hope to God Burton doesn't direct it, for his own sake. I would hate to have him mixed up in something that would definitly be so awful if those writers remained. Ugh. ANYWAY, I know my complaints seem more passionate than the things I LIKED about this movie, but I did enjoy it, actually. I recommend it, and if you don't like it, yippee for you, but at least you opened your mind (and your wallet, too, but oh, well.) I never thought I'd give a Burton movie anything but a 10 out of 10, but I give Planet of the Apes a 7 1/2 out of 10. Hats off to Burton for trying to redeem the lamentable script, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Apeland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember that the original Planet of the Apes frightened me badly the first time I saw it- the first image of gorillas on horseback bearing firearms was an effective attention-getter. If nothing else, Tim Burton's new APES carries the torch in this respect- even though I knew what was coming, the gorillas, orangutans and assorted other talking simians repeatedly raised the hair on my own neck, especially Tim Roth's incredibly athletic and menacing Thade. On top of that, Burton manages to throw in quite a bit of humor, including some goofball nods to the original APES. The sets of course are magnificent, and so are the makeup and effects. The SciFi sensibility of this version, however, is lacking (especially compared to how far ahead of its time the original was). The beginning of the film has a rushed feel to it, and there are some plot holes regarding space travel and basic physics that will turn off many hardline SciFi fans. All in all, though, summer audiences don't ask too much of their summer blockbusters, and this one delivers on that count. Never a dull moment, lots to look at, and the simians in this version are a LOT more ape-like. The acting achievements of Roth and Bonham-Carter are amazing, and steal a lot of thunder from the human co-stars, including Wahlberg (who unfortunately for his female audience never appears bare-chested... sorry girls). 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The little movie that could... but didn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes has many things going for it. The first three are the creative minds of Tim Burton (director), Rick Baker (Make-up), and Danny Elfman (Music). The sets and locations work well with the costuming and make-up to give this an original look and an authentic feel even though it is a remake. The cinematography and music work well together because neither one overshadows the other making the combination very powerful.The acting was good and I must take my hat off to Helena Bonham Carter and to Tim Roth who did exceptional in their portrayals. The supporting cast didn't stand out like Carter or Roth, but they did a good job of holding their own ground. Mark Wahlberg's character, Leo Davidson, is the classic military hero who never shows too much emotion because he is trying to stay in control of the situation. It almost seems that if Wahlberg weren't an actor, he would have actually been this guy. Estella Warren's character could have easily weighed down the movie by being the typical sexy woman, but thankfully Burton never really draws attention to her in that way: we know she's beautiful, but we don't need to waste 20 minutes of the movie proving it. She doesn't have any dense lines bent at attracting Wahlberg or any slow motion shots of her character taking a hot bath. Instead Estella Warren does a good job of playing a character simply caught in the story and reacting in a realistic way. A personal favorite part of mine was the cameo appearance of Charlton Heston, who almost has the same classic line that he had in the original.The story, though shaky at the beginning, quickly regains its composure and holds the audience's attention. Once upon the actual planet, there are many satirical references to the way our society has treated animals, the environment, and each other (in cases of slavery). It is this ability of holding a mirror to society that has made Burton a genius in his craft. Even though the storyline is a tad simple and any audience member can guess or just about guess how the whole story transpired, it doesn't matter because we are trapped in this world and we become interested in the characters interaction with each other.The ending is what could have wrapped up the entire experience into a good movie? but didn't. The last ten minutes of the movie was a horrible attempt at a twist ending. If you watch closely you can see the movie end, but for some reason, another whole ending is added. The problem with the second twist ending is that there is no bridge that connects this ending with the rest of the movie, so instead of discovering an ending you didn't even know you were looking for, you leave the theater thinking `Ummm? ok, that doesn't make very much sense.' The storyline should take you from point A to point B, but the ending tells you that you are actually at point C and doesn't attempt in any way, shape, or form to explain how you got there.I gave this movie a 5 because it has the attempt, it just doesn't have the follow through.</fullReview>

Okay, I've just listed all of the flaws with this movie that I can think of. Otherwise, it was well choreographed and had a decent plot. Even Mark Wahlberg did a good job.

		<shortDescription>Great effects, bad story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(A spoiler or two) First off I haven't seen the original so I can't compare this psuedo remake to the '68 "cult classic." But even so, I must say that Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" is a mess of great effects, especially makeup, shoddy story-telling and with two exceptions badly written characters. The story consists of Mark Wahlberg as an Air Force pilot named Leo, in the near future, on a space station where he ends up getting time warped to an alternate universe where apes rule humans. Of course Leo gets caught but not to worry, thanks to an sympathetic ape (Helena Bonham Carter), he and several humans, along with Carter and another ape, escape and try to find a way to a place where Leo thinks his ship is waiting for him (he has a device, that he got from his crashed pod, that is leading them along the way to wherever the place might be). But of course apes find them and a huge battle ensues. That's pretty much it for the plot, now to the characters. Carter does a good job as the human loving ape Ari, but Wahlberg is a bore as the film's hero Leo, Estella Warren ("Driven") isn't very good either but Michael Clarke Duncan is okay as a Gorilla general though his brain pattern seems to be, "growl, yell, beat someone up, yell again..." and so on. The standout in the movie has to be Tim Roth's character General Thade, the film's main villain. Thade is the most animated and fascinating of all of the characters and Roth gives the role plenty of emotional power, which basically blows away anyone else on screen with him. I'd actually be interested to see a spinoff movie centering on the Thade character is explained more in depth. Most of the characters are a bore and some are killed off so fast we (the audience) never know who the are. Lastly, the makeup effects are very well done. The actors actually look like apes or gorillas or whatever. Again, Roth does the most with his character and the makeup fits the Thade character very well.

Oh and the ending (which doesn't make a lot of sense, compared to the rest of the film) is silly and leaves this one wide open for a sequel, oh goody (note the heavy sarcasm here).

Well, first of all, I was upset the Danny Elfman's score got virtually buried under the sound of explosions and such, although from what I heard, it wasn't his best work either. The characters were grossly underdeveloped and the good aspects of the plot were those taken from the original, like the watered-down metaphor it creates of society in general. The screenplay was really nothing special, and I wonder how the writers sat down and wrote such unoriginal drivel when their point in going about this film was to adapt the story their own way but make it as good as the original film. They should consider themselves lucky (the writers, that is) that Twentieth Century Fo hired Burton to convey the story to film in his own vision and that the actors were, for the most-part, fine artists. Although I found Mark Wahlberg's (Leo Davidson) acting wooden and unfelt, there wasn't much one could do with the character, I suppose. Estella Warren as Daena was nothing more than a pretty face and her acting was not impressive in the least, but what can be expected of a model turned "actress"?. It was refreshing to see Helena Bonham Carter in a role where there are no parasols and corsets, and she was fairly impressive in the role of the sympathetic ape Ari. Paul Giamatti (Limbo) was hilarious and added a nice touch to the heavy plot, but he couldn't redeem the screenplay, and Michael Clark Duncan (Attar) was just big and scary! Finally, Tim Roth, as always, gave an exquisite performance as the villainous Gen. Thade. His bad guys are always wonderful, but he was so delightfully sinister in this one (I think it may have been the prosthetic make-up, too, but he's a superb actor!) My MAJOR criticism would have to be the ending. I wondered what it would be like, since the original film's end was so ingenious, and I had heard that Burton filmed 5 versions before the filmmakers chose this one. I would be interested in seeing the remaining 4, seeing as I didn't care much for this one. I won't give it away, but it really confused the HELL outta me for a long time, and after discussing it with lots of different people, we came to a conclusion, but it is still unimpressive. There will never be an ending like seeing the Statue of Liberty right there on the beach...it's chilling. If this version's ending had been explained a bit better, maybe it could have been received better, but the general concensus in the theatre was, "Huh??" I guess the producers just want to see if they can milk a sequel out of this one too so they can make a quick buck...I hope to God Burton doesn't direct it, for his own sake. I would hate to have him mixed up in something that would definitly be so awful if those writers remained. Ugh. ANYWAY, I know my complaints seem more passionate than the things I LIKED about this movie, but I did enjoy it, actually. I recommend it, and if you don't like it, yippee for you, but at least you opened your mind (and your wallet, too, but oh, well.) I never thought I'd give a Burton movie anything but a 10 out of 10, but I give Planet of the Apes a 7 1/2 out of 10. Hats off to Burton for trying to redeem the lamentable script, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Apeland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember that the original Planet of the Apes frightened me badly the first time I saw it- the first image of gorillas on horseback bearing firearms was an effective attention-getter. If nothing else, Tim Burton's new APES carries the torch in this respect- even though I knew what was coming, the gorillas, orangutans and assorted other talking simians repeatedly raised the hair on my own neck, especially Tim Roth's incredibly athletic and menacing Thade. On top of that, Burton manages to throw in quite a bit of humor, including some goofball nods to the original APES. The sets of course are magnificent, and so are the makeup and effects. The SciFi sensibility of this version, however, is lacking (especially compared to how far ahead of its time the original was). The beginning of the film has a rushed feel to it, and there are some plot holes regarding space travel and basic physics that will turn off many hardline SciFi fans. All in all, though, summer audiences don't ask too much of their summer blockbusters, and this one delivers on that count. Never a dull moment, lots to look at, and the simians in this version are a LOT more ape-like. The acting achievements of Roth and Bonham-Carter are amazing, and steal a lot of thunder from the human co-stars, including Wahlberg (who unfortunately for his female audience never appears bare-chested... sorry girls). 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The little movie that could... but didn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes has many things going for it. The first three are the creative minds of Tim Burton (director), Rick Baker (Make-up), and Danny Elfman (Music). The sets and locations work well with the costuming and make-up to give this an original look and an authentic feel even though it is a remake. The cinematography and music work well together because neither one overshadows the other making the combination very powerful.The acting was good and I must take my hat off to Helena Bonham Carter and to Tim Roth who did exceptional in their portrayals. The supporting cast didn't stand out like Carter or Roth, but they did a good job of holding their own ground. Mark Wahlberg's character, Leo Davidson, is the classic military hero who never shows too much emotion because he is trying to stay in control of the situation. It almost seems that if Wahlberg weren't an actor, he would have actually been this guy. Estella Warren's character could have easily weighed down the movie by being the typical sexy woman, but thankfully Burton never really draws attention to her in that way: we know she's beautiful, but we don't need to waste 20 minutes of the movie proving it. She doesn't have any dense lines bent at attracting Wahlberg or any slow motion shots of her character taking a hot bath. Instead Estella Warren does a good job of playing a character simply caught in the story and reacting in a realistic way. A personal favorite part of mine was the cameo appearance of Charlton Heston, who almost has the same classic line that he had in the original.The story, though shaky at the beginning, quickly regains its composure and holds the audience's attention. Once upon the actual planet, there are many satirical references to the way our society has treated animals, the environment, and each other (in cases of slavery). It is this ability of holding a mirror to society that has made Burton a genius in his craft. Even though the storyline is a tad simple and any audience member can guess or just about guess how the whole story transpired, it doesn't matter because we are trapped in this world and we become interested in the characters interaction with each other.The ending is what could have wrapped up the entire experience into a good movie? but didn't. The last ten minutes of the movie was a horrible attempt at a twist ending. If you watch closely you can see the movie end, but for some reason, another whole ending is added. The problem with the second twist ending is that there is no bridge that connects this ending with the rest of the movie, so instead of discovering an ending you didn't even know you were looking for, you leave the theater thinking `Ummm? ok, that doesn't make very much sense.' The storyline should take you from point A to point B, but the ending tells you that you are actually at point C and doesn't attempt in any way, shape, or form to explain how you got there.I gave this movie a 5 because it has the attempt, it just doesn't have the follow through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems the actors in this movie were so busy portraying apes that they forgot how to deliver a line. Tim Roth over-acted completely, start to finish, and Michael Clarke Duncan under-acted. The ending is also completely out in left field; come on, would the apes really have evolved EXACTLY like we did? I don't think so. Okay, I've just listed all of the flaws with this movie that I can think of. Otherwise, it was well choreographed and had a decent plot. Even Mark Wahlberg did a good job. I think, given the ending, a sequel will be ridiculous, but there's not much that can be done there. Go see the movie, though. 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed The Planet of The Apes, if for nothing more than the dark and brilliant world created by Tim Burton. Every frame is packed with so much detail and so much action you won't want to blink. What Burton paints with images, Danny Elfman matches with sound, with yet another excellent score. But it's clear from the get-go that the real stars here are the apes who look and move so wonderfully realistically, you'll forget that they're not. The makeup is so good in The Planet of The Apes, it's hard to see the actor behind the mask. But this seems more an asset than a liability for the ape actors who all put in very strong performances. Unfortunately the 'human' actors are another story: Mark Wahlberg is clearly out of his league and depth here and really struggles to carry the lead. There's a scene where Wahlberg tries to rally the troops and he was so bad, it's funny. Estella Warren looks great but does very little in a role that is really not much more than window dressing.As with many visually stunning films, more care and attention was paid to the look of The Planet of The Apes than the script, so we're asked to make some pretty big leaps of faith. The Planet of The Apes it's definitely NOT a movie to think a lot about when you leave the theater, as many plot points don't hold up well on re-examination. That said, I recommend The Planet of The Apes; it's a very enjoyable movie with a look you won't soon forget!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from screening Planet of the Apes at the theater I work at. What I was most afraid of was whether or not the movie had SDDS sound. It does, thank god. I am a fan of Tim Burton's. He makes great movies. When I heard about this movie, I thought, although a bad idea, that it might be an interesting movie. I'm not too familiar with the original "Apes" movies, so I can't compare, but this movie does have a surprise ending similar to the original's, minus the surprise.I noticed the movie was written by William Broyle's Jr., as well a two other guys. I got worried after that considering he wrote the horrible "Castaway". I can't really give him credit for making this movie bearable, though. Burton and his crew pretty much deserves the credit for that. This movie's plot is riddled with cliches from a General who was outcasted getting revenge only to die to an old Ape guy dying RIGHT AFTER telling Thade (Roth) what WE need to know. It's as if the writers were afraid their slightly unique version was too unique and was becoming unrecognizable.SPOILER WARNING:I thought some of the ideas in the movie were intriguing and scary. Not so much the idea that apes COULD become the leaders of a planet due to time travel and evolution from experimental monkeys, but that they DID. I felt the whole play on equality was too preachy and phony, however. Planet of the Apes is far from being the best movie of the summer - that title still belongs to The Mummy Returns - but it's a decent movie, although it lacked any humor whatsoever.</fullReview>

You should really rent and watch the original film first, which I think was still better than this new one but just as enjoyable. While the original 1968 film was more a statement against nuclear war, Tim Burton's 2001 version focuses more on racism and religion. Still, it's the best popcorn movie of this summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn Dirty Remakes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damn dirty remakes!Ooops. Don't call it a remake. Director Tim Burton (Sleepy Hollow) prefers words such as "reenergizing," "reimagining," or "reinventing." He even went so far as to request of Fox Studios that the name of the movie be changed to The Visitor. That request was vetoed, as well as the hot monkey love scene between ape and human that was in the original "reinventing" of the 1968 sci-fi classic (which was written by Rod Serling, based upon a much-lauded novel by Pierre Boulle). In this version, Mark Wahlberg (A Perfect Storm) plays the Charlton Heston role, sans loincloth (nope, not what you're hoping for ladies -- Marky-Mark insisted on being fully clothed from head to toe here). He's Leo Davidson, an astronaut who crash-lands on the mysterious, dangerous planet inhabited and ruled with an iron paw by intelligent apes. Helena Bonham-Carter (Fight Club) plays Ari, the "human rights activist" type chimp who risks her life to help the astronaut, and buxom blonde Estella Warren (Driven) completes the strange, almost love triangle. Tim Roth (Lucky Numbers), who excels in playing the villain, goes bananas here with furry malice as the militant human-hater, Thade. I'm reluctant to use the word disappointment here (I'm sure Burton could help me come up with a more imaginative one), and I wouldn't were this not a Tim Burton Film. I hold him to a higher standard than I do most other directors, and I was expecting to see his quirky stamp all over this movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't there. The landscapes and overall look of the film are relatively Burtonesque (thanks to his Sleepy Hollow production designer, Rick Heinrichs and the excellent cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, who is a first-timer to the Burton camp). But the feel of the movie, the heart of it, was not what I have come to expect from Burton. Had this version of Planet of the Apes come out by any other director, I would have judged it less harshly. The ape makeup, aside from the too-glamorous females, is expertly done by Rick Baker, who is no stranger to the celluloid simian. He did the makeup effects for Gorillas in the Mist and Mighty Joe Young. I predict he'll be at least nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Planet of the Apes. The atmosphere of this film is darkly fantastic -- from the makeup, to Danny Elfman's score, to Heinrichs' sets -- it's just too bad the atmosphere does nothing more than shroud a pretty standard story and stock characters. There was some cheesy dialog and tired stunts (for example, a young boy who insists on fighting against the ape army is pinned beneath his horse -- for no apparent reason -- as the enemy closes in upon him. Don't even bother wondering how horses evolved on the planet from the original stock of apes and humans.). Don't get me wrong: Planet of the Apes is definitely a worthy popcorn flick, and will surely be one of this summer's biggest blockbusters. The money is all up there on the screen (Burton wriggles out of saying just how much by stating it cost "More than X-Men, less than Titanic"). There's great action and super-exciting chases and battle scenes, and the actors are fine despite the fact their characters are pretty one-dimensional (the most fully-realized character is Bonham-Carter's, though her Cosmo-ape looks threw me off a bit). Perhaps the most engaging roles are the cameos: Lisa Marie is the sexy chimp trophy-wife of an orangutan senator, and Charlton Heston makes a memorable appearance saying the word "damn" as only he can, and holding a gun. Overall, I recommend Planet of the Apes for fun. Just don't expect anything more than a remake (sorry, Tim).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this movie was not directed by Tim Burton I would concluded as just plain stupid. I mean the original did not cost no 100 million dollars to make and was very original. This time it is the same story with just a few twist which I will not give away. Basically it's about a man who crashes onto a planet which is totally flipped in the ecosystem where the apes are the rulers and the humans are the savages. Sounds Familiar right. Like I said Tim Burton is a great director he does do a good job of trying to make his mark in visuality ,but it's the same old story. Now the only real good thing was Paul Geomanti(Sorry if I miss prenounced his name)he brought a little bit of humor to the story.

This film starts off fast and keeps moving. Burton's dark avant-garde style of film making does not interfere with this flick. And yet his style is all over. This film has witty dialogue, GREAT special effects, and great ape performances from all. The "monkeys" in this version are so much more menacing here that I just may have nightmares. Mark Whalberg's debut into super-stardom is also noteworthy. His mile a minute, never stop attitudes is refreshing and brings his character to life.I won't go into the story but I will say I didn't think Burton could offer an ending as creative and shocking as the original... but guess what?

		<shortDescription>Not Tim Burton's Best, Certainly Not His Worst...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will always be much debated amongst Tim Burton fans. The original idea of the movie was not to re-make the classic film, but to "re-imagine" it. At first, this seemed like a brilliant idea. Who better to direct a new version of Planet of the Apes than the odd yet brilliant Tim Burton?Well, great ideas often do not lead to great finished products.And that is what this film really is. It is not a great movie. It is an average, sometimes funny(especially Paul Giamatti), sometimes thrilling(battle sequences are amazing) film. But as a whole? Average.The problems with the movie all come from the fact that Burton did not know exactly how he wanted to re-imagine the movie. Should it be a serious, sci-fi version? The last 20 minutes seem to point in this direction. Should it be a "spoofesque" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously? The entire middle section of this movie seems to point in this direction.In the end, this film is confused and awkward. Tim Burton wants you to like this movie, it's clear the entire time. Unfortunately, the acting is strained and the movie too muddled to ever develop into a classic.I am suggesting that this movie is worth renting or going to the theater, but it's not worth owning(unless you are a huge Burton fan). This movie is better than Mars Attacks and Sleepy Hollow, but it does not even approach Batman or Edward Scissorhands.I give this movie ** out of **** stars. Add one star if you are a dedicated Tim Burton fan.</fullReview>

It's funny, fast and loud; the special effects don't overpower the story, and Rick Baker's ape make-up is amazing - after a while you believe you're watching an advanced race of apes, rather than actors buried beneath layers of latex and fake fur. The whole cast is very good, especially Helena Bonham Carter, whose performance as the ape-woman Ari is witty, sharp and sweet. Two things: Chuck Heston should retire from films after this, since I can't imagine a better exit than the one this movie gives him, and the film's final gag is funny, but doesn't really make sense (especially in light of the story we've just seen). Other than that, though, big Hollywood summer popcorn flicks don't get much better than this. Viva la Movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much Promise Turned To Waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what happens: human crash lands on planet ruled by apes that can talk and think humans are beneath them, human has to fight to survive, twist ending. Blah, Blah, Blah.This new "Planet Of The Apes" is probably the most-hyped and most-anticipated summer release for 2001. You've got extremely dark and stylish director Tim Burton paired back up with scoring buddy Danny Elfman. Cool ape costumes and Marky Mark out in front. How could any of this go wrong you ask? Well, it does.Now, don't get me wrong, I did like this movie. That was until the last ten minutes of the film. The ending is so ridiculous that it cause the rest of the movie to make NO SENSE at all. The ending is terrible and I cannot express enough how much sense it does not make! I'm not going to give anything away, but you aren't missing anything life-changing. The movie was good, except for this contrived and senseless plot twist that is completely tacked-on.Besides the fact that the movie ends up not making any sense after it was on the right track, the musical score, I hear, had to be completely redone mere days before release. So, the new score has no resemblance of Danny Elfman at all. It's your generic action movie score. Thanks, studio executives! That's why you guys collect the money to back the film and you leave the movie-making to the movie makers! What an original concept.I don't need to go into the story or the plot, you know it. The only thing you don't know about is the new ending, which causes the whole movie to be worthless. Oh, and did I mention that there is no resemblance of Tim Burton's style anywhere? Then I'll say it here: nada on the Burton style.I was really, really excited about seeing this movie. I really was. But then the ending made no sense, which I cannot repeat enough, and it all went to hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Apes more than scrapes by as an entertaining and provocative film-going experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While retaining some of the source novel's and original picture's themes, Tim Burton's version of Planet of the Apes is a very different movie. The subtext, however, remains largely intact. Religious, social and political themes abound, as a distorted funhouse mirror is held up to our own culture.There are plenty of good performances, notably by actors portraying apes--Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and David Warner. Helena Bonham Carter manages to be oddly appealing and even winsome through the chimp makeup.While my initial reaction was highly favorable, I'm not sure this new film will posit the longevity of the first one. It breaks no new ground to become a classic.It does feature more simian-like behavior. The apes exhibit physical characteristics of their respective species as they move about and react emotionally. The makeup is extraordinary. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should polish up another Oscar award for the brilliant Rick Baker.The movie also seems to be missing a few scenes of motivation or development. I know it was supposed to have been re-edited at the last minute. It would be interesting to view some of the deleted scenes. Here is to hoping for a wealth of bonus material on the DVD.Viewing the 1968 film is not necessary but beneficial to pick up all the intentional references, both in dialogue and situation. Some of them are rather humorous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this recently at a preview show in Japan and I have to say that, despite being an affectionardo of the first series of films, this one rocks!The special effects are what you expect these days, special, and the make up is a true work of art (it's really difficult to tell who's who, though I think the main guy might be Mark Whalberg under all that stuff.) and the writing is crisp, if obvious.A special mention has to go to Tim Roth here, because he pulls off one of the most original, deeply motivated, frightening villains I've seen for a long time and manages to sound nothing like himself. If this were an eighteen film it'd be Silence of the Apes! He won't, but should be up for an oscar.And for effectionardo's off the first movie and it's glorious ending, don't panic. I have to say that (despite the improbability of it) the writers have managed to come up with a nice play on the original.I have to say that of all the summers movies so far this is the one I'd want to see again, and while Tim Burton can't resist getting cheezy for a moment or two with us throughout the movie, it won't make you gag as much as most of his others.Go, enjoy, ape it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton was behind this big-budget, but ultimately pointless, and unsatisfying "re-imagining" of the classic 1968 original. Here, Mark Wahlberg takes over the lead astronaut role, as he finds himself(through a muddled set of circumstances) thrust into a future earth where(no surprise) apes now rule over men, and he must find a way to survive this ordeal, and get back to his own time, assuming he ever can...Good makeup F/X and supporting cast(including Charlton Heston, in a knowing cameo) cannot redeem such an otherwise uninspired and purposeless film, which really has nothing new to offer, and provokes no new insight.Final twist at the end is so arbitrary and crass, that it may make you scream, or at least say "Huh? What the Heck..." A sixth film in the original series would have served more purpose than this mess!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keep it short and snappy for anyone who cares enough to read this. Being a remake of the 1968 original I didn't know what to expect from this film. To kick things off I do have to say that this film does have a a fairly exceptional cast in Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham-Carter, Michael Clark Duncan, and Tim Roth. I thought that Wahlberg was a good fit for his role considering he usually takes up a daring, adventurous role quite well, and that Tim Roth was a bit out of his element I felt but he took on the Role of Thade quite well. As for Clark- Duncan and Helena Bonham-Carter I don't really want to get into my opinions as to how they fit into their parts, but I will say they performed satisfactorily. I liked how the story developed and I enjoyed most of it. Special Effects are lacking, and the ending was kind of lame. But overall I can give this movie a solid six.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's take on this franchise is really appallingly bad. The characters are uninteresting and the dialogue is virtually non existent.I especially hated the scenes where Wahlberg leads his merry men through the jungle. Now, this guy has just fallen from the sky unto an unknown planet. You would think that he would take it slowly as he is not familiar with his surroundings, but no. He instead walk as if it's his daily road to work and not once do you get a sense that they are being chased. There's a scene where all the soldiers are ready to march and at the last minute the general played by Tim Roth, gets called away because his father is dying. Yes it was perhaps a pivotal scene (which isn't saying much as there aren't any pivotal scenes) but why place it just before marching off? The movie is just not worth watching. Really watch the original if for nothing else than the famous lines by Heston.And for those of you who think the makeup is good...well...maybe I've gotten accustomed to better things because I was not impressed. I mean...The Lord of the Rings had way better makeup than this one, and they premiered at roughly the same time. No, watch the original or if you want the more modern take on the franchise go watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes - now THAT'S an epic movie largely because of an excellent Andy Serkis.</fullReview>

I watched it a number of times in my life and it always was fascinating to me.This....I just don't know how to describe it. It has nothing to do with the original story. This Tim what's his name seems to think that because he directed a few notable films (never liked him by the way) that he has the right to basically.... well, rewrite the Bible! The film has no plot, no character development, no direction. It's just a simple fill in the screen for two hours of monkey business. NONSENSE! My apologies to this current generation. Please do not rate the Planet of the Apes story on this (cough, cough) film. As backwards as it might seem, watch the originals. Yea, I know that films that old may not appeal to this age of film making, but watch it as a history lesson in film then. You will not be disappointed.I will, however, say that The Rise of the Planet of the Apes film is a great movie. I hope one day that a REAL director will produce a faithful rendition extrapolating from this film. One can only hope.Please, please, please, please.

		<fullReview>I count myself very fortunate I did not see this on the big screen. I had watched snippets before and was very unimpressed. I'm one of the many that loved the original. So when Burton attempted yet another remake (and I still can't get into Alice in Wonderland as my family can), I treaded very carefully. This movie came on TV, non letterbox, not that it would matter for the piece of junk it is. Bland story, uninteresting characters....oh what a waste of time. I got about 50% of the way through, then realized I had much better things to do and wasn't going to waste my time. So I did jump to the last 10-15 minutes to catch the infamous ending. The worst Burton film of all time. He doesn't have anything close to the wretchedness of this film. Thank goodness! He's one of my all time favorites. Can't believe the total current rating is 5.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But are looks enough?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always with Tim Burton, you know the film is going to look good even if it is rubbish. Well his remake of Planet Of The Apes does indeed look good, but is it rubbish? Although it has vastly different bookends to the 1968 original (in which respect it is, perhaps, closer to Pierre Boulle's original novel) it treads broadly similar grounds in terms of a spaceman from Earth whose arrival disrupts ape society in a big way.There is much to savour. There are quite a number of very well-known faces which you don't see because they are covered in ape makeup. That ape makeup, and the ape physicality of the actors, are both fantastic, and far superior to their 1968 equivalent. And Tim Roth's chimpanzee General Thade is a stunning performance - very physical, and very intense. On the other hand Mark Wahlberg was not, at this point in his career, the right man to play the lead, Helena Bonham Carter's society gal chimp doesn't work visually, and the final twist scene is a downright cheat.The fact remains that although the remake is not a disaster by any means, the original didn't really need remaking. Even so, there is something poignantly pleasing at witnessing Charlton Heston, at the very end of his career, revisiting his classic line from 30-odd years earlier from the other side of the species divide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So ditzy, even an ape-man wouldn't sit through it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was this film a joke? Or did Burton lose his mind?Let's start with the few positives first: the ape characters were rendered well. The make-up, costuming, characterization, even the quadrupedal movements by some apes; excellent stuff. Bonham-Carter's work was fine, although she looks like she just had a wardrobe malfunction or something. By the way, she's in so many Burton films, you'd almost think she knows the guy. Anyway, all positives are lost amidst a big, dumb, growling, lumbering primate of a flick.Some astronaut ends up in a post-Apocolyptic world filled with evolved primates, directly adapted from the original. But, after that, the story resorts to Sunday afternoon serial tactics, and throws cerebral thought into the tar pits. A battle scene where bodies are constantly being tossed in the air: come on. The whole battle scene is just a mass of extras shouting, grunting, and slashing each other to bits. But no meaning to why it's being fought, or what the outcome means.Loud stupid, unintentionally campy. The director's paycheck was unearned. Beware the farcically moronic ending; it's so utterly ridiculous that it's sidesplitting. It's also a brazenly obvious set-up for sequels (that were never made, lol).Good to laugh at with friends.</fullReview>

From make-up that was no better...and in some cases worse...than 1968's version to destruction of a creative plot line in the original, to screaming, jumping violence that makes it inappropriate for seeing as a bonding experience with children, to the blatant &amp; sophomoric political commentary against opposing political &amp; religious views (clever &amp; subtle in the '68 original) this thing is a hairy, stinky mess. The only reason I "stuck with it" through to the end was thinking there had to be some redeeming value. Rrmembering the shocking ending of the original I'd hoped something similar would happen here. But they mucked up even that. Why I expected more from people with so little creativity that they got paid for mimicking (like chimps?) the wardrobe design of '68, too, instead of doing something new. If you go to the zoo you may see primates throw their poop at you. This movie is why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure proof of the coming idiocracy was this pointless, pathetic remake and the fact that it has a rating higher than 2 stars.The title should be changed from "The Planet of the Apes" to "The Planet of Tim Burton Collecting a Paycheck."I am stunned that so many reviewers focus on the mindless ending to this movie, when the entire movie is mindless.One gets the impression that the scriptwriters were writing under deadline duress, panicked, and decided to do drugs instead. Meanwhile, if you watch the behind the scenes making of this film, you also get the distinct impression that Tim Burton knew the script was crap and so he gave up on it and treated it like a joke that he was getting big bucks for delivering. Which it is.But having said all that, I have a suggestion for a sequel. In the sequel, Wahlberg, Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Burton play themselves. They all get into a spaceship and try to go back in time to change the future where no remake of the Planet of the Apes will appear on their resume. After 2 1/2 hours of mindless hijinks and special effects, they emerge in modern day to find they didn't change a thing, because as Alec Baldwin's character states so glibly in Glengarry Glen Ross: "a loser is a loser!"And anyone who read the script for this film and didn't walk away was -at least in this instance - a loser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A planet full of nasty apes is a great idea. Someday somebody will make a great movie about it. Until then you'll have to watch this one:Wahlberg is lost on a strange planet and who of all people does he encounter? Kris Kristofferson! Complete with his groomed beard portraying some kind of a caveman. One wonders why he isn't wearing cowboy hat and boots. Then we have little Tim Roth as a British(?) chimp. Burton orders: "You're a chimp! Act like one! Make at least 10 grimaces a second!" And Roth obeys. He is the bad chimp, so he tries to look really mean, but doesn't. Roth also hops around a lot. It's real method acting, you know. As if the bad apes aren't, well, "bad" enough, there are also "good" apes, who talk like liberals, so the kids who watch this mess hopefully will turn out as "good" citizens one day. Of course they won't listen to the drivel of the good apes. It's too boring. Talking of boring: Wahlberg gets captured by the bad apes in a boring way and soon escapes in a boring way. Then he's on the run and has to talk a lot to the other humans and a female chimp (Carter) which has the desire to be just as smart as him. Sometimes we see Roth the chimp, who wants Wahlberg back. he gives orders to his favorite gorilla, then hops out of frame for the most time. At the end he and a lot of other apes get whacked in the head by Wahlberg and his feel-good-posse. Some big apes roll around on the floor in deadly combat. The final duel belongs to Wahlberg and Roth the little chimp, which leaves the monkey completely bonkers. Finally a real chimp saves the day and shows Roth and the others how to act. Obviously Burton had no influence on the animal. The last minutes gives us a tiny impression what this remake maybe should have been about, would it have been made by a director with a vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake That Assumes You Don't Know It's a Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of the few people out there that made the mistake of seeing Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes a good while before seeing the original. What kept on making me look away from the 1968 original more or less was the fact that it's over twice as old as me, which I guess you could attribute to me as being ignorant. And after hearing so much complaining about this remake with me and my best friend not seeing why (who also had never seen the original), we decided to just rent both this and the original and see what the fuss was all about.I think after seeing the ending alone you know how I feel.If I'm not mistaken, this film was handed down to several directors before Tim Burton was finally "credited" as the main director (and towards the end of the film's production unless I've misread something). Either way this film really doesn't feel like a Burton film to me, if it did I'd be calling this film "gritty" or "dark"; at least, for a few of the scenes. But other than some great visual style and excellent make-up on the apes it's tough for me to mention Tim Burton along with this film, it just doesn't feel like something he actually directed; not the whole way at least.It's funny that this film is supposed to be a "remake" when the only things it has in-common with the original are the name and the fact that the apes are superior to the humans. This is another odd thing that another reviewer pointed out; the apes don't seem to have that much over the humans other than brute strength most of the time. Whereas in the original the apes were both tougher and far more intelligent than the humans.Outside of this the film has little to nothing in-common with the original. The plot, characters, location(s) and even the ending are all different from the original. The only similarity you might be able draw is that one of the apes (a female that sees the humans as more than the other apes give them credit for) decides to help a few of them escape the ape city and go to the lands of their origins. Beyond this, and maybe a select few throwbacks to the original (the scarecrows part was pretty clever) you might be wondering if this is really a remake or just a very different re-imagining.As I mentioned earlier, this version has some great art/visual style and excellent make-up on the apes, which are even better than those of the original (even though in this day and age it's really a given for that to be the case if enough effort is put in). Really this is the film's biggest strength because outside of all the excellence visually there isn't much of a film to be had. The performances from almost everyone is average at best. Mark Wahlberg really isn't given too much to work with and you'll get plenty of his typical "shocked" stares. Tim Roth as General Thade actually does pretty well with his character and is arguably the most effective character. Needless to say, Helena Bonham Carter was intentionally given a bit more of a human look than the other apes, possibly to reflect her character's views on the humans in the film. Michael Clarke Duncan does well with what he's given and while he likely won't stand out for many he is a very convincing character given his size and voice (hopefully that doesn't sound too odd). Everyone else just feels like they're tagging along so there really isn't much to praise in the characters or actors other than that two of the main ape characters were handled very well. Oh, and I thought the cameo with Charles Heston was neat.Aside from this, a fun battle towards the end with the rebel humans and apes and an ending that'll likely leave those that haven't seen it puzzled as to what exactly happened, there really isn't too much to the film. My biggest problem with the ending is that we likely will never get an answer or resolution to it because of how negative the reception has been towards the film. I hate it when movie studios and the crew make a movie and leave room for a sequel but they never fully take into account possibility that the film will flop or just not do well. And in this film's case we're stuck with a film that had and in a sense still does have potential but are left asking "when" and "what".This film is very, very different from the '68 classic it's based on and as a result, it assumes you haven't seen the remake; or at least hopes you didn't. Since I saw this one before the original, my views on this remake were defensive and while I think it's far from as bad as some might make it out (and even as I myself might have made it out as well), it's very tough to fully appreciate it after seeing the original. So if you haven't seen this film yet (or even the original for that matter), I would personally see this one first so you can make a verdict on the film itself, then see the original and then make up your mind. As for those that have seen the original but not this, just go into it with an open mind and don't expect the same movie. And if anyone has seen both and wants to at least try and like this movie, try and watch it without having the original in mind. Keep the original in mind, and this film stinks. See this as its own film, and you should be able to find some redeeming values.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right, I give up - why was this film ever made?I tolerated Burton's Batman and Chocolate Factory remakes, because he demonstrated real respect for the original materials - the Bob Kane comic book, the novel by Roald Dahl. But this ape film not only undercuts the original (while trying to look oh-so-much-more impressive), it also trivializes the novel by Pierre Boulle.Pierre Boulle's novel was a fable exploring the post-WWII problems of racism, nationalism, war and nuclear war. The world had already danced close to the brink of self-extermination in WWII: if we believe all the reports (and alas, there's no reason to doubt any of them), some 150 million people lost their lives during ten years of one major conflict after another, from the invasion of Manchuria and the Spanish Civil War to VJ day. That was a larger number than that of the population of the US at the time.Military-Industrial Complex profiteers notwithstanding, it became clear to intelligent people across the globe that ethnocentrism was not healthy for children and other living things, and it was a decent person's duty to say so as clearly and decisively as possible. "Planet of the Apes" may not be a great classic of literature, but it's no throwaway for a rainy day.To rip the heart and mind out of Boulle's story - well, what is the point? The world doesn't need yet another "alternate universe" comic book display of flexing ape muscle and tasteless jokes masquerading as wit. If all this is merely taking place in an "alternate universe", just so we can have a peek at a possible "alternate universe", then the "adventure" is nothing more than the protagonist's daydream.All we can do is shout "Wake up!" at protagonist and film-makers alike, and hope never to see such a self-indulgent waste of money on a theater screen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst remakes. Although it is very spectacular, the main thought of the original story is lost in it. This thought was that the humans became animals and the apes are the superior species. Humans are not only unable to speak but even to think. They are driven by their instinct. Apes are not only able to speak and to think but they even walk righted. The only "good" thing in this film is the ending that gives back the ending of the book. Although the ending of the original movie was not bad as well. It made the possibility to make some sequence for it. This movie can not be continued (Thanks for the Lord for all the small miracles!) and has a very stupid story with a very stupid beginning. Don't waste your time, watch the original instead. 0.1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that Planet of the Apes was coming to theaters I was excited. I had vague memories of the T.V. show from when I was a kid, but not enough to give me any real high expectations of the movie. Now, even with no high expectations, and not knowing what the eventual outcome would be, I was still disappointed.This movie was really predicated upon action and suspense, but little other content value. The standoff at the end was OK minus the incredibly stupid and cliché stunt by the young boy. The story just lacked creativity, especially in light of my having seen the original Planet of the Apes. There was absolutely no comparison. The story, the dialogue, and even the ending was so cutting edge and socially relevant. Planet of the Apes 2001 did not do justice to its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another pointless remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly, Burton didn't direct this one with the enthusiasm that he put into his previous movie, "Sleepy Hollow" (or "Ed Wood", for that matter). I may be wrong, but I get the impression that he was simply hired as a replacement for Cameron who was wise not to direct it. Visually disappointing, except in the scenes showing various landscapes; all of Burton's post-Batman movies are visually superior to this one.The apes look quite unspectacular; I had expected more in this regard from a 21st century movie. (But then again, they're just apes, aren't they, so how thrilling can they really be?) The apes are too similar to the silly-looking ones from the original, or perhaps it's just that the whole premise of talking apes is too stupid to work, period. This is the one time they should have really taken advantage of computerized special-effects and used them on creating the apes, instead of having humans in silly make-up. Burton must have confused apes with kangaroos or grasshoppers or even frogs, for this movie's apes leap very high into the air; the planet doesn't appear to have such low gravity. In fact, the apes practically glide through the air. I don't know why they simply didn't give them wings; after all, the ape-soldiers' costumes are right out of "Wizard Of Oz", so they might as well have stolen the winged-apes shtick, too.The aggressive "bad guy" apes don't even look so bad - when compared to the "good" ones like Bonham-Carter. Her make-up is awful. I never thought that she could be made to look more unattractive than she already does - but they succeeded here. I don't know if I should be grateful that she wears an ape-mask so I didn't have to watch her mug for the duration, or whether I should be disgusted that she looks worse than ever. Still, I guess that to cover a face that resembles man-boy Billy Armstrong from Green Day is always a good thing. Then there is that character she plays: the same one from the original, plus the very trite and obligatory politically-correct, pacifistic, left-wing aspects thrown in.Time is wasted in making obvious and predictable allusions to race problems, when there should have been more time and effort spent on other areas. The movie is watchable enough, but nothing more. It lacks energy, and there is a constant "seen-it-all-before" streak running through it, and I am not only referring to the obvious similarities with the original. The ending is stupid; makes no sense.For a truly unpopular IMDb comment (0 out of 90 votes or something like that!) see my review of the original "Planet of the Apes"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apes sequel and planet thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie and Mark Wahlberg's performance in particular.Many people have wondered if there will be a sequel, well I did a google search and found this article entitled "No Apes sequel, says Burton": http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1496974.stm If this article is true, then someone other than Tim Burton would be directing it. Here we are 5 years later and still no sequel. It's unfortunate, because amidst all of the speculation about the meaning of the ending - it certainly screams SEQUEL! Another observation - a lot of people seem to think the ape planet that Leo crashes on (in beginning of the movie) is Earth. But Tim Burton's ape planet has two moons - it can't be Earth. However, the planet he crashes on in the end of the movie is Earth - it has one moon and the correct continents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Solid Reworking Of A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of summer 2001's big event pictures, it had lots of hype and lots of people talking but everyone in a fashion knew that this reworking would never top the original even with a solid director and good cast. They were right! Leo Davidson (Mark Whalberg)who works on a large space station goes out in a spacecraft to save his chimp that has gone into a mysterious cloud formulating in space, he too is sucked in and lands in a planet ruled by apes where humans are the prey and are tortured and are pets to the apes.Davidson must get back to his main ship and along the way finds friendship in a female ape called Ari (Helena Bohnam Carter) who helps him and he helps her. But General Thade (Tim Roth) is intent on destroying all humans and Davidson and his band of rebels are top of his list.The film as a whole is very good and i was much surprised at how much i enjoyed it, i was very skeptical with it being that i really didn't get the original film but this film i got.I really got Burtons vision and really saw this as a good attempt at a reworking from the man i like to call a hero of mine, i did think in places his usual directing skills lacked in some places but for the most part he did an ace job.Mark Whalberg put in a very good performance as the hero of the picture, in places i found him to be slightly annoying but like with Burtons direction for the most part he put in a very good performance as did Tim Roth who comes across very evil in his portrayal as a bitter and twisted ape which i don't think would be an easy feet for any actor.The dialog i have to say in parts is poor as is some of the character interpretation. One of the best and great things about this picture is the production design and once you watch the film you really see where the money for this film went and it really is a well deserved effort of the production designers part. Job well done! For the most part this film has spectacle and awe and this is needed for a summer event picture and i wasn't unhappy with the final product at all. Burton gave his usual unique vision to a classic film that many regard as the ultimate Sci-fi film and in comparison many may feel that this film is no where near as good as the original, but if were honest when are they ever!

		<shortDescription>A strange and Wonderful Love Letter to Insane Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sci Fi- It's often scolded by most in this world, and sadly now such Sci-Fi films are most viciously attacked by their own fans! The fact it that this is a flawed movie, saved by Tim Burton's fantastic Visual Style and Danny Elfmans terrific score. The Cultural references are terrific: but once they are scrutinized further- sure it's unlikely that Apes would develop beautiful armour reminiscent of Ancient Armour worn by Turkish Knight in their religious wars, but man they look terrific and fill this strange world with a rich history and culture! While most merely see "REMAKE" up in lights and scoff at Hollywood- the film is more of a tribute to The concept of what Planet of the Apes has become, evolved with the help of fans through a horde of crappy sequels and weak spin off television series to the point where Pierre Boulle and what we know as Planet of the Apes are actually worlds apart. Bravely however, the films controversial finale is not to be taken seriously in any way! The ending which I will not give away, is an homage to many things.It's a tribute to Insane Sci- Fi, The deliberately profound endings to both the original film and Boulle's novel, and having a bit of a chuckle.It's like the Twilight Zone without taking itself seriously in any way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, seriously now, why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking the original Planet of the Apes was always going to be a big challenge for any director. The 1968 classic was a fantastic sci-fi vision with a bubbling undercurrent packed with issues at the forefront of the era like race-relations and the ever-gnawing fear of nuclear devastation. On top of that, it had a gripping and involving storyline and quite rightly ensured its place in cinema history. However, with Tim Burton attached to this new version you could be easily forgiven for imagining it would be a taut, character-driven new film with much to commend it. After all, it's not like Paul W. Anderson was handed the reigns was it? So it comes as a massive disappointment to say that the 2001 Planet of the Apes is a disaster on every level. The normally reliable Mark Wahlberg is terrible but considering what he was given to work with it'd be unfair to place all the blame on his shoulders. As Captain Leo Davidson he takes on the equivalent to Charlton Heston's lead from the 1968 version but has none of the gritty determination that his predecessor had and spends most of the movie looking utterly bemused, possibly because he's found himself running around a world ruled by apes, possibly because he's been given such a terrible script to work with.The rest of the cast are no revelation either. Tim Roth is an unrestrained monster, but rather than being a credible villain is simply yet another cardboard cut-out Hollywood bad guy whose only separation from cinema's other dastardly Brits is the fact he's done up in a chimpanzee outfit. Burton's squeeze Helena Bonham Carter meanwhile turns in an especially cringe-worthy and highly irritating performance as the daughter of a lead ape senator who helps the humans escape. Funny how it's always family members of incredibly extreme politicians who believe in what's right isn't it? And as she spends most of the film running around talking about how unfair her kind treat the humans, fawning over Mark Wahlberg or screeching wildly, it's very hard to give her any kind of sympathy. Looks like the attempt at making an ape sexy back-fired spectacularly there fellas.It also suffers from Hollywood's tendency to move things along as quickly as possible in case the audience gets bored, for no sooner has Marky-Mark set off on his trek to find a human spacecraft than he's arrived at his destination and is ready to lead a resistance movement. The climax is a huge let down as the ruck between the apes and humans is over within minutes and before you know it, Wahlberg's jetting off into space and returning to Earth for the much talked about ending.Elsewhere, the clichés and general sense of corporate film making abound. Ape suppression of humans means they hit them with sticks and talk like the Uruk Hai from out of Lord of the Rings an awful lot and the script is packed with cringe-worthy tributes to the original ("Get your filthy paws off me you dirty stinking human," urrgh). The finished product is nowhere near the film you could imagine Burton making unless you'd seen it and the whole thing feels like an extended episode of a fourth rate science fiction show that takes itself too seriously. Poor, very poor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is ALLOT different than the original, it follows the same premise. An astronaut crash lands on a planet ruled by apes but other than that this is a different type of film. Mark Wahlberg stars as Captain Leo Davidson in this Tim Burton directed sci-fi thriller.It is the year 2029: Astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) boards a pod cruiser on a Space Station for a "routine" reconnaissance mission. But an abrupt detour through a space time wormhole lands him on a strange planet where talking apes rule over the human race. With the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter) and a small band of human rebels, Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Gorilla Army led by General Thade (Tim Roth) and his most trusted warrior Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). Now the race is on to reach a sacred temple within the planet's Forbidden Zone to discover the shocking secrets of mankind's past - and the key to its future.Don't be expecting anything award winning, this vis simply a good action film with excellent special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are a hazardous business. Shown not least by all the completely wasted remakes floating around out there. And it seems remakes are all the rage today, considering how many movies are actually based on previous works. Right now the Asian industry is the one being plagued the worst by this trend.When it comes to unnecessary remakes i would have to rate this 2001 remake of the classic "Planet of the apes" as one of the foremost. This version of the movie is not without it's qualities, but in general it's a step down from the original in many ways. The social pathos is more or less completely removed, replaced instead with a focus on action and comedy. While the original movie commented on segregation in society and the arbitrary treatment of certain groups as lower standing, this movie doesn't deal with the themes at all. Of course there is a general discussion going on through the movie, and a tension between liberal and conservative powers, but it never feels like more than window dressing.The qualities here lie mostly in the sure-handed visual style that is director Tim Burtons hallmark. The effects as well as the set designs are top notch, as is the sound and music. The acting leaves a mixed impression. Tim Roth is quite astounding as the evil ape commander Thade, Mark Wahlberg is his usual pale self as the protagonist. The acting from the rest of the cast is decent enough.The qualities of this remake fall tragically short of making up for it's weaknesses. I feel that a remake should always have something new to offer if there is to be a point in remaking a movie in the first place. Not only does this movie have nothing new to offer, it even deducts many of the points of the original. And that makes this one of the most pointless, and even degrading, remakes ever. I rate it 3/10 for the entertainment it still provides despite it's obvious weaknesses as a remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think there are more than enough plus points in POTA to make it well worth watching. Firstly I think the make-up of the apes and the way they move is outstanding, the whole look of the film is excellent. The music by Danny Elfman is great. Tim Burton does a great job directing the action. I thought all the actors were great, apart from Wahlberg who I find a little wooden, I thought the same about him in The Italian Job but he's not that bad. Tim Roth is the best and makes a great villain, one of his best performances since Rob Roy I feel. I'm actually surprised how many of the IMDB users seem to hate this film, probably because the ending doesn't seem to make sense. I too found the ending baffling but I enjoyed the ride in getting there. I must say It took me a long time to get round to seeing this movie, I eventually picked it up very cheaply in a supermarket and I'm glad I bought it. Sadly I think the overall reaction to this film has killed any chances there were of there being a Planet of the Apes II. Pity because I would have loved to have to seen how they would have tried to explain the ending. Also I must say I enjoyed this Tim Burton film a lot more than some of his others namely Batman Returns and Mars Attacks, I think he delivered a great movie here. Oh well each to their own ***7/10***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really not much I can say that hasn't already been said except this:To those of you who have nothing good to say about this movie - especially "it was awful and didn't make any sense" - I'm so very sorry that Tim Burton, Pierre Boulle, William Broyles Jr., Lawrence Konner, and Mark D. Rosenthal put together a movie with too high-brow of a plot for you to understand. I'm one of the first people to nit pick away at movies for defying the laws of physics and continuity but most of the complaints I've read in the reviews have no basis whatsoever. You simply didn't understand what you were watching.Now that that's said; Wahlberg's acting skills needed a lot of polishing before trying a role like this. Granted, we all know he's no Charlton Heston, but come on... he's worse in this movie than most and that's saying something. Beyond that - and having the lead role that poorly cast does, I'll admit, have a huge impact on the overall movie - it's hard to fault this picture. The story was a refreshing departure from the original series without being completely foreign and the rest of the acting, special effects and makeup were all wonderfully done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton disappoints again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of "Beneath the Planet of the Apes". Here's how I would have written it:An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The difference is this; the makers took a little from all 5 prior Ape films, plus the TV series. Any reference to the original novel is non-existent.All that hard work recreating the (improved?) makeup has come to naught when the movie doesn't ride on a good script. At least the 1968 original took its time to pace the story properly to create some sort of suspense. The 2001 remake jumps from one scenario to the next in episodic fashion that leaves no room for the viewer to really care what happens to anyone. And except for the last half hour, you never get the feeling that you're out in the open air. Everything feels claustrophobic; like being on an over crowded sound stage.I still appreciate many of Burton's other films, but this is a misfire with too many cliches that most of us have seen before. And it seems that so much time was taken with the makeup; so much time was taken with paying visual homage to the original and its sequels; that they forgot to let a proper narrative flow take over the story and at least include a LITTLE logic (and I'm not even referring to the ending). The homages? 'Ari'...spell it backwards and put a 'Z' in front. Any more, I'd rather not spoil...you might have fun spotting them on your own when referencing 'Planet..', 'Beneath..', Escape..', 'Conquest..' and 'Battle..' (and the short lived TV series and cartoon).Stick with the original...as long as it is in wide screen (the pan &amp; scan sucks to the point that you miss half the movie, especially when there are characters and events taking place on both ends of the wide screen).Perhaps the writers should have spent a little less effort calling this a 're-imagination' and instead used some 'real imagination' to create a compelling staple in the sci-fi genre that this deserved.5 out of 10</fullReview>

I am not a huge fan of Wahlberg, but he still seems to do well in this film. I also agree that the effects were extremely impressive. And if you need help figuring the end, it is easy. What happened is that you don't see that the General was able to travel back and take over and change the planet. You are not meant to see it when it happens.

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong; Tim Burton has a lot of talent. Most of his films have some eerie, dark atmosphere and quirkiness that's irresistable to most viewers.Something that this film doesn't have.The only impressive aspect of this remake are the elaborate set designs and convincing make-up (watch out for Michael Jackson's cameo as Ari).At first, the film impressed me. It looked cool, the score was good. Then I noticed a pattern in the film.Dialogue scene to running, to more running, back to dialogue, more running, rinse, wash and repeat.Mark Wahlberg is a good actor but he's quite laughable here. Wait until you see his speech about rising up against the apes. This one suffers from the age-old cliche of the band of people too afraid to fight back for the freedom with no choice otherwise. Well, unless they want to die and be put in slavery (at least that would take off the running time a bit).The female character (insert model's name here) is simply used for the sex scene, but there isn't one. The big budget is used for the cool battles that couldn't be done on a small budget. But there is no big cool, entertaining battle. It goes on and on. Should I talk about the ending? If you enjoyed the film you'll say "Wow! What a smart, intelligent ending! Now, if I just knew what it means..." and weeks later you're still puzzling over it until you realize Tim Burton has wasted even more of your time thinking it actually makes sense. Hey, if you're going to have a huge twist at the end most won't figure out, at least make what came before it interesting and atmospheric like Mulholland Drive or something.</fullReview>

Visually, it's incredible. Everything else was just OK. For what it is, I think the movie is awesome, but I like everything Burton has done. People need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b/c of this movie. It wasn't supposed to be a remake, and it's not. The ending was cool. .

		<fullReview>This is a bit of a first for me, the first time I have ever been disappointed in a Tim Burton film. POTA isn't a bad film (great sets, costumes and the odd great performance) but it could have been made by any off-the-shelf hollywood director. The pacing was very odd, the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end, by myself and the cast. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film. Come back Tim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really have to wonder sometimes about big studio decision making. Do they screen movies like this and pat each other on the back, hand the director a cigar and crawl off to bed thinking how incredible smart they all are? Or is it that halfway through production, it all begins to fall apart and money already spent cannot be recovered and the project becomes a salvage effort. The balloon ego of an overrated director is pricked, and although he must still put his signature to it, decides to punish the studio for its blindness to his genius vision, by handing them a bomb that they all hope people wont recognizes. Who knows, I actually believe that while movies in the past have been miscast, this is an example of a movie having been misdirected. Burton's world creation just doesnt work here. Its completely claustrophobic, and unrealistic. Contrast to the original classic, which utilized all open panoramic scenery that was disturbingly too realistic. Burton creates a Gilligans island atmosphere, and coupled with the horrible story - you get a bad bad movie. So lets recap, you have a good book to work with, a great original movie to study, and the end result is this piece of junk that ignores both. Again, its not Burtons fault. He is a one trick pony, and some of his movies are great. But selecting him to make this was stupid, and allowing him to actually complete and release it, dumber still.</fullReview>

I actually saw this movie in theaters because a friend asked to see it (I only wanted to see Jurassic Park III). Turns out it could almost be called one of my favorites!I have never seen the original. I'm sorry to say this, but I don't know if I ever will since this remake was so good. I am satisfied with the way this one was done. I am afraid of disappointment if I watch the original.The plot is excellent, first of all. There's a nice plot twist at the end involving the origins of all apes that puts everything together and just feels right. There is plenty of action and, in a way, romance, too. It's a great sci-fi flick with plenty of action.The storyline isn't too original--escape, then get reinforcements to fight off the antagonists. But it still does its job. It keeps you watching.The music is composed by Danny Elfman. He has a certain militaristic flare in this movie which really sounds good. The music is excellent, taking on tribal drums at some points and bombastic themes that whirl together perfectly.The costumes are great. The apes look just like they should. The graphics are decent, but not overall groundbreaking.I was and am still really impressed with this movie. It has a lot of things that kept me going and makes me want to watch it again and again. But I can't compare it to the original. I wouldn't even if I had seen it. I can only say that this movie is really great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>unfortunate that someone must explain things to a viewer... is this a flaw with the movie, a fault of the director... or just a lack of intelligence and imagination on the part of the viewer...?the ("much-controversial") ending makes complete sense and does not deserve the discredit it has received-- remember "...alternate futures...?" "...multiple contexts...?" "...infinite time-loops...?" As long as CPT Leo Davidson keeps re-launching into the "electro-magnetic storm,"(--their terms--), he will encounter random, possible futures... As suggested by the encounter with the "unknown" "Mayday" which is, infact,by the Oberon commander (Lt Gen. Vasich???). That's HIM(!!!) in the mayday, in case you didn't get it... But since it hasn't happened yet, it's a clue as to the time-dispatial aspect of the "cloud" in space... (Not to mention the "chimp" appearing AFTER Mark Wahlberg int the "future"... Were you sleeping...? Or did film just get too difficult for you...?" less imaginative viewers continue to complain... I thought it was a good movie, overall, although I don't like the use of close- to medium-shots during the chase&amp;capture scenes in the first few minutes of the film... This is the only point where I find this re-make markably inferior to its predescessor (which I saw in the theaters on it's initial run as a child...) The first film shined superior here with its use of long shots and suspension of clear "ape-"shots... But then we all knew what this second film was about, didn't we? A congratulations to Tim Burton... Continue the good work...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say it held my interest but only when the apes were on screen-the only well developed characters were Tim Roth's Thade and Helena Bonham Carter's Ari. The "human" cast was weak beyond words and what in God's name inspired someone to cast Kris Kristofferson-of ALL PEOPLE-in this flick? This group deserved to be enslaved simply because they were so pathetically vapid, they'd have a hard time surviving on their own. Mark Wahlberg showed as much emotion and sensitivity as a toilet seat and one just can't imagine him as David leading the robotic humans over the Goliath apes. It also seemed way beyond the bounds of reason that ALL the apes would suddenly become tolerant and glad to consider their former slaves their equals-as we all know too well, racism and bigotry are not so easily erased. And the ending was just plain asinine, and all you Mensans out there who say oh, it makes crystal clear sense, fits right in with the plot,are just thinking too much. I get free cable so it didn't cost me anything and for that I'm grateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, entertaining update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie studio decides to remake a motion picture that is a classic of its genre, many people give an inward groan and cynically wait for it to fail. When I heard that 20th Century Fox were making a new version of Planet of the Apes, I admit I felt the same way. But then I heard that Tim Burton was directing, and I was encouraged. And thankfully, he does not disappoint. While comparisons are inevitable with the 1968 original, this is of course not a remake or sequel as such, but a new take on Pierre Boulle's original novel; one that actually manages to be closer to the original source material than Franklin J. Schaffner's classic interpretation. As a result of course, the audience had certain expectations - and they were fulfilled. Linda Harrison (Nova) makes a very brief, and of course silent, cameo; Charlton Heston (Taylor) makes a memorable appearance as Thade's father, his single scene offering one of the turning points of the narrative, as well as a chance for him to once again to utter his most famous line from the 1968 version. With that aside, how does Tim Burton's "re-imagining" of Planet of the Apes hold up as a movie? Very well, in my opinion. First of all we should mention Rick Baker's excellent ape makeup, which is as much of a quantum leap forward as John Chambers' in the orignal film. Not only does the make up look extremely effective, but the actors can actually express themselves through it, enhancing their performances. Coupled with Colleen Atwood's solid costume designs, their appearance is almost too effective. As for the cast, I thought Mark Wahlberg was a interesting choice as lost astronaut Leo Davidson - one that echoed, at least for me, the controversial casting of Michael Keaton as Batman. Like Keaton, and indeed like Heston, Wahlberg is not a hero-type, all muscles and steely determination; that is what makes his performance all the more realistic. Tim Roth excelled as Thade, a truly great cinematic villain; Michael Clarke Duncan made an extremely convincing performance as Thade's friend, the gorilla Attar; Helena Bonham-Carter's Ari was a kooky, off-the-wall ape heroine, and didn't waste a moment of screen time. This is more than can be said of Estella Warren as Daena, unfortunately. She may be a champion swimmer and model, but I can't help thinking she was cast more for her stunning beauty than any modicum of acting ability. Watching her performance, and the amount of screen time and dialogue allocated to her, I was left wondering if maybe she had some lines cut. Finally, of course, there is the movie's ending. I thought it was fantastic. I didn't think it was confusing at all, and on a par with that of the original version. Then, there was that single, shocking image, and a chilling realisation. Of course, repeating that would have been pointless here; so now we get a much more controversial conclusion, one that raises a great many questions. I hope we get the chance to find out the answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry Tim, I've enjoyed most of your other films, but this was disappointing. I just couldn't work out if this was supposed to be a parody of the original version or to be taken serious adventure/drama. I loved the old Charlton Heston movie, but this was not anywhere near those standards.So what was wrong with it? The make up and special effects weren't what you expect to see in 2002. Perhaps better than the original, but not that much better.There were so many logical lapses that I just kept shaking my head at it. Yes I know that it is a sci-fi movie, but there has to be some realism in it anyway.The acting was on many parts poor. Mark Wahlberg as Leo could have been replaced by a log. What Estella Warren was doing there except running around looking confused and pretty I just don't know. Certainly not acting. Helena Bonham Carter as the ape Ari was Ok, but no more. The same goes for Tim Roth as Thade.The ending just seemed to be glued on. Left-overs from the cutting room perhaps? It didn't add to the story, but just left you confused. Worst of all it was a clear opener for a sequel. Shudder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen such a beautiful piece of crap since Armageddon. Being a big fan of the original POA film &amp; TV series (&amp; cartoons), I was looking forward to this film, though with some apprehension. I kind of enjoyed the parallels to the originals: "Get your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty human!" My favorite was C. Heston: "Damn them...Damn them all to Hell!" and of course, he had a gun in his room.While watching this film, I had a problem with almost everything. From the gigantic halls of the space craft to the pathetic sound stage of Ape City. Don't you think that by the 22nd century, people who work with primates would figure out the difference between apes &amp; monkeys? How many USAF captains would disobey a direct order from a 4-star general by flying out into danger? Probably half of the ape actors really walked correctly (as an ape's pelvis would allow). It sure was great that the spaceship worked after so many thousand years. Boy, they don't make 'em like that anymore. At least the apes bungee jumping around didn't look as pathetic as Crouching Tiger.I still can't tell if this was supposed to be a serious sci-fi drama or a spoof on the original. I guess I should have guessed what was in store when I saw in the opening credits "Based on A novel by Pierre Boule" and not "Based on THE novel by Pierre Boule."On the plus side, Helena Carter was excellent, the ape costumes were fantastic and the cinematography was very good. However, they didn't save the movie or the world. Avoid this film unless you are a hopeless Apes fan...like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton isn't all what he used to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of Tim Burton's movies are unchallenged masterpieces ("Edward Scissorhands", "Ed Wood"...) but I can't say it from his latest films. I do like stylish "Sleepy hollow" and amusing "Mars attacks!" and I think "Planet of the apes" is quite watchable too but maybe I just expect miracles from him nowadays. Only thing that's always spectacular in Burton's movies are the outstanding settings.His movies have always been extremely visual, every last one contains a fantastic world created for the screen - that's a guarantee. (Who could forget for example "Beetlejuice" or "Batman"?) Like Tim Burton himself said this is not a remake of 1968 "Planet of the apes" - this is just his version of the story. I read Pierre Boulle's book when I was a kid and I have to say that this film really doesn't remind me of it.I think Franklin J. Schaffner's 1968 version was better in every way. Of course it looks lame from today's point of view but that's just part of the fun of it. Burton's film contains lots of thrilling action and make-up's are simply phenomenal work of art but still - something highly important is missing. That glamour of the old film is gone. Outwardly Burton's version is truly an impressive movie but there's nothing inside of it.Funny detail about the cast: I read Tim Roth's interview from a Finnish newspaper couple of years ago and he explained how enormously he hates Charlton Heston and declared that he will never appear in a same movie with him. And look what happened, here he's playing Thade - Heston's loyal son. Maybe Roth didn't recognize him behind his ape mask...Well, I loved him anyway. Roth is magnificent in his entertaining role as a furious ape general. Other actors are great too but no doubt especially Roth. Mark Wahlberg played his role splendidly even though I got the feeling like it's only a routine to him. He's an excellent actor but I wonder if he's ever gonna get another chance to really show it like he did in "Boogie nights".Helena Bonham Carter isn't bad either but why didn't they give her role of Ari to Michael Jackson - there would have been great savings in a make-up department since she looks a lot like Jackson with her ape mask on. At one point I read somewhere (that was way before they started the production of "Planet of the apes") that they planned the role of Leo Davison for Arnold Scwarzenegger. Then, of course, this would have been a totally different film because Schwarzennegger's movies are always pretty much written for him.But maybe they realized that they can't put a man with such an ape-like features to represent a human in a film like this. (No disrespect to Arnie!) A useful suggestion to everyone who didn't like "Planet of the apes" (and maybe for the ones who liked it too): forget this movie, go to your nearest library and read one of my favorite novels - Will Self's "The Great apes". It deals with the same "apes rule the earth/humans are the primitive race" -idea but with much more intelligence and profundity.</fullReview>

The cast as a whole is reasonable without achieving a lot.One to catch when it's on the telly, but given the hype this is a bit disappointing.</fullReview>

Roll over Heston, as Mark Wahlberg now rules the planet as head human.The story is different from the original movie, however, director Tim Burton did a very credible job in this film. The movie begins with Mark Wahlberg going after his lost chimpanzee into an electrical storm in space. This electrical storm sends our hero hundreds of years into the future, where he crash lands onto the planet of the apes. I will stop with the summary here, as there are many unexpected occurences throughout the movie.The greatest part of this film, is the casting of Tim Roth as Thade, the ape general. This is definately the best acting job he has ever done.Take a chance on this one, I really do not think that you will be disappointed with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES (2001) Rating: 8/10Whoa, I think I'm all geeked out now, having just seen what has to be one of the most fun movies out of summer 2001. I wasn't expecting to like it so much, with the reviews being mixed and with some fanboys raging about disappointing this new episode of the Apes saga is. Indeed, the movie has its problems, namely how it eschews the Pierre Boulle novel and the first movie adaptation's political and social allegory. You can still read some commentary on racism, animal rights, or the issues of religion versus science throughout Tim Burton's "reimagined" Planet of the Apes, but it's superficial and inconsequential at best. For better or worst, what we got here is another go at the archetypical story of the loner who rode into town and inspired the weak to stand up against their oppressors. This is the outlaw Josey Wales helping the villagers fight off the Yankees, or Mad Max joining the bunkered people as they strike back at the road warriors, or Braveheart leading the Scots against the English army...The film was written by William Broyles, Jr. (Cast Away) and Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner (Mighty Joe Young) and though they don't delve into much thought-provoking material, their script is relatively tight and engaging enough. It swiftly goes from A to B, simply setting up oppositions and characters along the way, and it pays off with an exciting action climax and a hilarious Bizarro twist ending. In any case, as in most of Tim Burton's movies (except Edward Scissorhands), storytelling and character development are secondary to splendid production design and moody, stylish direction. I loved this new planet, the more complex and detailed Ape City, with chimps everywhere playing b-ball or music, having a drink, getting laid... And what chimps they are! As impressive as the Oscar winning make-up was in the original, it never felt as organic, as natural as what FX whiz Rick Baker has pulled here. His apes not only look great, they also move and act great.I like that the actors are still able to convey emotions through facial expressions despite all the latex and faux fur. It also paid off to have them go through "Ape School", as they now walk, breathe and behave like true animals; even they talk, they'll sometimes revert to groans and high pitch screams. Of course, you also have to credit the cast itself for this. There's Michael Clarke Duncan as a gorilla army goon who conveys real brute force, but also has an interesting character arc that has him questioning his religious beliefs and his loyalties. There's Paul Giamatti's orangutan slave trader, who brings some comic relief. Or what about Helena Bonham-Carter's human rights activists chimp lady and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's conflicted gorilla friend, who decide to side with the humans? Last but not least is Tim Roth's rage-fuelled portrayal of General Thade, a cruel and vicious chimpanzee who really loathes humans. Roth's performance is all animal aggressiveness, and his Thade has got to be the coolest movie villain we've seen all year.In the end, maybe that's what it comes down to: if you're as much of a sucker for apes as I am you're in for a treat, but if you're looking for compelling human characters and challenging subtext, you've got the wrong movie. Mark Wahlberg is really good in this movie, I totally believed that he was this Leo guy. More so then the original's badass, Taylor, who was played by Charlton Heston (who, incidentally, has a cameo in the new film, as an ape!). We get really cool looking apes, many tense moments, some funny ones, a thrilling battle between human tribes and the simian army and that funny, funny ending. All that made it so I wasn't bothered by the pedestrian plot and the holes in logic. Burton's Planet of the Apes is not without its flaws, but neither were the films of the original series. What we have here is an expertly crafted adventure just a bit quirkier than your conventional popcorn movie, and I was entertained by it. I mean apes, man, a whole planet of them, how can you not dig this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the movie was great. Being a big fan of the first movies. I was happy wish the new version. I can't wait for a sequel. It was different then the first in that it gave a great leads into sequels. Like why was the planet uninhabited at first and the end had a great twist to start right there. The Apes themselves were outstanding. I love that Charlton Heston was in the movie and thought all of the main characters were great. I would say that everyone should own a copy of this DVD. It will make you wish you had seen it on the big screen (I did so I am happy). The only bad thing is that instead of being 2 hours long it should have been four.... lol... then i wouldn't have to start it over so soon and have a larger story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hated it! I terribly disliked the original so I thought this new version would be different. It was in a way but it still has a disappointing ending. After viewing it I had to do some reading the rest of the night to get it off my mind. The point of humans and apes living in harmony was appealing but it should have stopped right there. It was very disheartening to get away from one nightmare and crash land into another.Save your money, save your electricity. Don't bother! Humans rule!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good, Original Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movies deserves a rating of 8 just for the surprise twist at the end, about which I will say no more.I hadn't really been expecting that much from this when I rented the video; I rather thought that the "Apes" franchise had been done to death back in the late 60's - early 70's, with a collection of movies and a TV series that went progressively downhill and became more nonsensical with each installment. But I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, which was very entertaining and - if I recall correctly (although it's been many years since I read it) is more consistent with the story of Pierre Bouille's original novel. So, my advice is that if you're either avoiding this or watching it because you expect it to be like the "Apes" movies of thirty years ago, plan to watch it on its own merits instead.The cast was in general very good. Mark Wahlberg did a fine job as the astronaut Leo Davidson, stranded on this nightmare of a planet (for him) with no obvious way of getting home. Tim Roth as his primary ape antagonist, General Thade, was also very good. I had a mixture of reactions to Helena Bonham Carter's role as Ari, the human-loving ape. Her performance was quite good, but, frankly, I found her character to be rather irritating. It's a necessary role. We have to see these divisions in ape society, but the character just didn't appeal to me in the same way as, say, Cornelius and Zera did in the original movie. I also thought the ape makeup was rather weak. Frankly, they did a better job thirty years ago.But those minor criticisms aside, I really did enjoy this movie. It was a fast-paced story that held my attention, there was enough humour to make it fun, and enough drama to make me wonder how Davidson was ever going to get out of this. And - as I said at the start - the end itself is worth watching the whole movie.I rate this as an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't compare to original, don't hold against it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This reimagining is sheer eye candy, but through the surreal direction of Tim Burton's past features, what is wrong with this? The original 1968 film was heavy on themes of social tension, the hierarchy of class systems, and evolution. In my opinion, there is no need to improve on the first film simply because there was no room for improvement. It seems that this film is designed for popcorn summer entertainment and it does not sell short of this intention. Tim Burton's dark vision is one of the strongest directorial forces of all time. Whether it's the dark comedic tone of "Beetlejuice" or the ethereal romanticism of "Edward Scissorhands", the man is genius and "Planet of the Apes 2001" is no exception. I do forgive him for "Mars Attacks" though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's worst film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job. They would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) Except this time around, the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe.As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. Luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.And alas, the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. And the "haha, we're so clever, aren't we?" way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one. Sigh...Instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman', or even to a lesser extent 'Sleepy Hollow', and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule.</fullReview>

All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting, he is just in the movie, looking stupid. The other actors are also not very good.But the worst point of all, is the story. It is absolutely ridiculous! For example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground, but the humans don`t attack them, no, they wait until they are up again! This is just one example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's hard not to like a Tim-Burton-film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ATTENTION, SPOILER!Many people told me that «Planet of the Apes» was Tim Burton's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film. So I decided not to see it. Another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet, advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a Tim-Burton-movie is still a Tim-Burton-movie'. I decided to do it, and I found that he was right.It's clear that a remake of such a famous film as `Planet of the Apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Still, Tim Burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as `Beetlejuice' or `Batman'. If you are already fond of Burton-movies, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it has some flaws: nerve-racking monkey squeals, over-dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been, without difficulties, replaced by anbody else.What the film gives us in the first place, is an answer to the question: What's the result when Tim Burton is instructed to create a remake? First of all, Burton wouldn't be Burton, if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start; it's a `re-imagining'. On the other hand, Burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring Charlton Heston (as human), and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared. So all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referencing to quotes. Concerning the story-line, Burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first, and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with ? AND HERE IS THE SPOILER ? Leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever. Now, this is the burtonesque answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing, shocking ending of the first `Planet of the Apes'. An ending, even more unexpected, more astonishing and: completely confusing, because ? and here I'm disagreeing with various `Planet of the Apes'-homepages and -platforms ? it does not make any sense. There cannot be a meaning to it, or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective. Tim Burton is playing his cruel games, he does it with a grin and he does it well. Burton fans will sure like it, others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism. Well, and I don't think producers will ever ask Burton to direct a remake again?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say it isn't so, Tim!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard all the critics bitching about how terrible the new Planet of the Apes movie was, I was unfazed. I knew that there would at least be the signature Burton touches I love so much to get me through a poor script. Imagine my distress when I found none. The movie had great potential; I don't know what went wrong! Mark Whalberg, Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are all spectacular actors, but here they were either cardboard cutouts, or merely annoying. Sleepy Hollow, for example, was not a great movie by any means, but at least it had Burton's flair and imagination. I'm sorry to see that one of my favourite directors of all time has now jumped on the Gus Van Sant bandwagon (I'm referring, of course, to that normally amazing director's stinker of a Psycho remake). If there was anything good to be said about this movie, I would tell you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, but the money is wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it turned out as I expected: visual overload but nothing else added to the original. What did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick. Initially this awoke my interest, but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns (a) were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical Hollywood-like product and (b) made the whole storyline improbable! The 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward, and included no time-storms or any bogus of that sort: it just stated that when you come home after a long journey, things might have changed a bit. Earth might have fallen in the hands of apes, for example. Like many 'old' movies, it's main ingredient was suspense (hell, does anyone understand that word these days?). In this Burton movie, an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie, but at what cost? Surely, the images are overwhelming, and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape-culture (even ape-music!), but what's wrong?First, the suspension of disbelief is made very hard, because the apes have a lot of Hollywood-human traits. I refer especially to Ari and the slave-trader. These traits include emotional skills like irony, sarcasm, and an overtly displayed array of 'subtle' emotions. It makes you forget that the apes are apes, which is essential.Second, the humans TALK. Of course, we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak, but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape/human role-switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version. The wound in the throat that Charlton Heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that Dr. Zira has in him (so, no need for things like human rights activists or ape-human love in order to explain things).Third, the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility, but is a necessary twist in the new movie, since Capt. Davidson has to play the Hollywood-let's-save-the-whole-world- and-have-a-good-ending-for-everyone- and-still-make-it-to-the-lounge-bar- for-a-cool-diet-coke character. Oh my god, will they never learn? I new it from the start, when there was only one guy who got lost! They were in need of a hero! And then the script writers go on reasoning: we need one guy... so, why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible! But it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes! Since, in these modern and politically correct times, we can't have a xenophobic ape-hater like Charlton Heston's 68 character loose on the screen: let's give them a bubblegum version!Fourth, okay, the general twist of the original 'discovering the truth' of the 1968 film to the modern version (he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab-apes developed their society, where Heston simply discovered that just, somehow, the apes overtook the earth while he was away) is nicely done. The second, battle-part comes as an anti-climax. That's because this movie has added the first two Planet Of The Apes movies in one plot. Nice try, but the chill you feel when Davidson and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle-part.Fifth: the ending!!! For chrissakes, who came up with that?! (a) Davidson crashes TWICE with his escape pod, which seems an unsteerable object, while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully? Come on, who'd believe that? If the pods are really small space crafts (Davidson simply flies off into space at the end) and not merely escape vessels, he might have managed a safe landing at least once, no? And what about that ending???? I mean, in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth. But here: the whole movie takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same (there's a Thade statue) ape culture is on earth??? How come? Did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically, flew into the time storm and colonised earth before Davidson's mission took off? Why is Thade worshiped? Stupid stupid stupid.Helena Bonham Carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape, but I'd expected no less. I preferred her ape above Estella Warren as a human, but maybe I got some loose wire in my head. Nevertheless, the only convincing apes were Tim Roth as Thade (wonderful!) and Ari's household ape (the ex-general, but I forgot his name).Nonono, a lot of things could and should have been added/altered to the 1968 pic, but not the plot, at least not in that way. It was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining. It was nicely tongue-in cheek and caricatured. Don't stylize everything...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton spins the boredom out of the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only seven years old when the original "Planet of the Apes" was released in 1968 and, compared to other films of that era ("2001, A Space Odyssey," "Bullitt," "You Only Live Twice," etc.) I was able to recognize "Planet" for what it was: pure, unadulterated schlock, and boring schlock at that. The sorry parade of Ape movies that followed into the '70s was my first experience with Hollywood's "Sequel System" of pumping as much revenue as possible from any spavined idea that is a hit with audiences. This may, in fact, have been an early iteration of that now-standard practice.Needless to say, I had no expectation of anything more than a mild diversion when I wandered into a matinee showing of Tim Burton's take on this shriveled old chestnut. To my surprise, and despite the fact that Mark Wahlberg sleep-walked his way through the entire movie, it worked a lot better than the original. General Thade (Tim Roth) is by far the most engaging character in the movie, and the only one that overcomes his ape makeup with an identifiable personality. I was almost rooting for HIM by the end of the movie.Burton's portrayal of the preening, officious Ape Elite and their personal habits is a sly look at some of our own human foibles. I recognized a couple of ex-bosses during those scenes. Original cast member and current NRA President Charleton Heston has a cameo that becomes hilarious when he shows son Thade his "proof" of human ingenuity. I wonder how many viewers missed the humor in that because they are ignorant of Heston's NRA activities? It's refreshing to see an actor of his age and station who is able to poke fun at himself.Happily, this "homage" to the original carries enough originality to keep it interesting (let's just say there was never a Statue of Liberty on this planet) and has better pacing and a lot more action than the original. The effects are seamless and there is enough humor to break up any monotony.The movie climaxes about 10 minutes before it ends, which is too bad. The last few scenes are a total throwaway (and perhaps a foreshadowing of the dreaded Sequelitis), but hey, we can't all be Shakespeare all of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The miseries, believes and thoughts of our planet Earth are shown in another planet where higher apes rule. This is a good film for entertainment. The major deficiency is that the apes speak English and the hero, an astronaut is not coming from Russia, Germany, United Kingdom or Japan. No, as usual is another Flash Gordon-like North American. The end of the film is perhaps its best moment when the hero back to Washington D.C. discovers that during his absence the planet was invaded and governed by the same apes.</fullReview>

They made the usual brainless standard action stuff that you can see every day on TV: the bad "guys" are ugly and mean and the good "guys" are pretty and nice and the usual things happen.

When Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) gets out of the electrical storm and gets ready to land on the "planet of the apes" you can see that the planet has three moons orbiting it. And when he takes off you kan see four moons, so apparently it was not Earth. Now the question is, how kan the planet be populated with three species of apes, when the space ship only brought imps? And how can the apes have taken over Earth when the hole movie has taken place on another planet?The Original was by far better.</fullReview>

I HAVE NO COURISMA.Then there are the technical issues regarding the pod, able to fly about like a space ship in and out of the atmosphere? At least Charlton Heston had a real ship to crash into the earth with. And then there are the plot holes and contrivances I could drive a Mack truck through.

		<shortDescription>Burton provides an entertaining yet flawed ape escape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has a unique, dark style that sets him far apart from other filmmakers of his generation, and he has a knack for getting the best efforts from his crews and actors.His "reimagining" of "Planet of the Apes" is a rare instance in which those qualities never come to the fore. I won't bother with prattle comparing this to the 1968 original, simply because I haven't seen it and don't plan to anytime soon.He brings back nearly the entire crew he worked with on the superior "Sleepy Hollow" ? costume designer Colleen Atwood, production designer Rick Heinrichs, editor Chris Lebenzon, and composer Danny Elfman, but this formidable unit fails to fully click this time around.Makeup guru Rick Baker (the "Nutty Professor" series) is responsible for the impressive simian facades, but most of the time they look instead like very expensive Halloween masks that muddle the actors' voices. The diction left much to be desired; some characters speak too low and fast (I sat in the fourth row and the theater had THX sound), and some baritone-voiced males sound as if they're talking with their mouths full.The acting is adequate but sometimes as stiff as the monkey mugs, starting with a wooden Mark Wahlberg as the centerpiece of the film, Leo Davidson. He is an Air Force captain, yet he works way up in space. The setup for his eventual crash landing onto the Planet of the Apes is flimsy and rushed. When that time comes, he doesn't look too concerned about being alone and stranded, and eventually imprisoned, in a strange new world, and he goes through the film as if this is all small potatoes to him.Thanks to bad dialogue, he inadvertently forges what may turn out to be the new pickup line of the 21st century: "I can show you something that will change your world forever."Needless to say, the simians are the best thespians, and that's not saying much. Tim Roth hams it up to the hilt as the villain Thade, but he can only do so much in a movie of this style. His chief henchman, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, verbally berates and knocks a few humans around here and there, and snarls lines such as, "Get your stinkin' hands off me, you filthy human!" and "Bow your heads!" And, that's it.Helena Bonham Carter is solid as Brit-accented human sympathizer Ari. Coincidentally, out of all the Apes, she looks the most human as well (and is nearly a dead ringer for Michael Jackson). Paul Giamatti, on the other hand, is annoying as Limbo the orangutan, the film's thin attempt at comic relief.The weakest link, as if it isn't too obvious, is Leo's gang of human fugitives, especially an annoying teenage boy and the token Black man whom we all know will get knocked off at some point in the film. They have no personality and serve no purpose in the plot whatsoever except to chip in with a cheesy line here and there. Supermodel Estella Warren, playing a slave girl whose father (Kris Kristofferson) is killed by the Apes, is as pointless as a broken pencil. Her skimpy outfit contained more depth than her screen presence. Most of her activity consists of staring into space with her mouth agape.By the way, I didn't realize the Planet of the Apes contained any beauty salons, because she manages to look like she just stepped out of one whenever she appears on screen.Oh, and Burton brings aboard his squeeze Lisa Marie once again for no apparent reason. This time around, she's buried under an Ape mask. As usual, she has nothing to do here except display her one-dimensional feminine wiles.The cinematography, courtesy of Phillippe Rousselot, does a nice job of stressing the foreboding, moonlit jungle environment. It's the only saving grace of the lackluster action sequences, especially in the beginning just after Leo crash-lands and finds himself in the middle of a wild huntdown of humans by Ape soldiers. Elfman comes through on the music front; because of his powerful score, I loved the opening credits sequence.Unfortunately, while Heinrichs' sets are always a visual treat, they aren't as gripping as his Oscar-winning work from SH. They are small and constricted due to the fact that there are sometimes too many characters cavorting on the screen. Upon seeing the Apes' village for the first time, I couldn't help but think of the planet Endor from "Return of the Jedi." The wreckage of Leo's USAF space station, however, is fantastic. It's also the location of a surprising twist in the story.Now to the plot. The reason why it falters for the most part is what ultimately crippled "Shrek": it has an unpleasant air of preachiness to it. By itself, the plot is as thin as Wahlberg's music career, but in a twist that seems rather uncharacteristic of Burton, "Apes" plays the race card. This I didn't care for. I'm aware that this angle is in the original, but it's a white elephant in Burton's version.And yes, an Ape actually utters those infamous six words...I'm sure you know what they are.The suspense factor is all but nil, and the plot twists leave behind numerous holes, such as, for example, the controls on the destroyed space station being able to work despite the wreck apparently being thousands of years old. (Plus, where did all those horses, the Apes' sole means of transportation, come from?)Then there is the well-publicized "love triangle" between Wahlberg, Carter and Warren that Burton hinted at in interviews. To make a long story short, if you plan to watch this solely on the basis of seeing this angle, you're in for a disappointment.Sorry, but I won't waste my breath on Charlton Heston's forgettable pot-and-kettle cameo.Save for the aforementioned chase sequence after Leo's crash landing, the action and fight scenes are pathetic. Simple punches send both humans and Apes flying a few dozen feet into the air. And don't ask the Apes to hit targets in the water that are two feet from the shore. The huge Apes-humans showdown near the end is a yawner.The much-ballyhooed ending is both surprising and ambiguous. Though Burton has vehemently denied any rumors of his helming a sequel, the conclusion is like that of a comic book and does leave the door wide open for a second installment.The film's most comical moments occurred offscreen. Before shooting began, the actors had to undergo "ape training" to learn primate mannerisms, and spent hours in makeup before stepping in front of the cameras. On "failing" ape school, Bonham Carter quipped, "I was told I had AADD ? Ape Attention Deficit Disorder." On becoming an Ape: "It's flattering to be cast as a chimp, because you know they haven't cast you for what you look like." Duncan hurt his ankle while filming a pivotal scene with Kristofferson, who slipped, fell, crashed into Duncan and wound up having to get stitches. Duncan was rushed to the hospital (yes, rushed for a turned ankle ? that's Hollywood for ya), in full makeup, no less. When he announced himself to a room full of patients, they burst into applause.While "Planet of the Apes" has some major flaws, it doesn't mean it's not entertaining, which it indeed is, but it just doesn't have that signature Tim Burton look and feel to it. It's ultimately just another Hollywood action flick.After all is said and done, his best effort to date still remains "Sleepy Hollow." 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An adequate summer blockbuster, but a very poor film nonetheless. Poor attempts at comedy, designer apes and an inexplicable ending. Wahlberg looks like he's on drugs, and the film is a mess. Burton has done much better, and this is not a vintage effort.Check out the 1968 original. Aside from the great ending, it offers a much better intelligent angle on race and the nuclear weapons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The least you could say about that remake is it's poorly scripted and it lacks of tempo. Did they need Tim Burton to shoot this? The story is flat with no real tension created in line with most of the characters. Mark Wahlberg is a dull paleface astronaut and Tim Roth is great, unfortunately his character is so foreseeable it adds little to an already poor suspense.The beginning is neither creative nor tense and the subsequent chase scene is hardly impressive. Two points that could have been easily improved from the original. Hence the film is never working so as to have you get into it. The novel was a good material to make something different if not better. I do think a human massacre as the one right after the chase described by Pierre Boule would have helped to write a good scene. And seal the audience right in! Unfortunately the lazy penbums focused on how to match the 1968 version's ending so they only read the very end of the book. And they adapted it to issue an ending halfway between the book and the Schaffner film.(spoiler ahead) Halfway is never the right way (sat half-buttocks between two chairs as we say in French) and the Burton ending looks more like a quick way for him to get to an end with such a painful script. Burton reportedly shot 5 different endings (to pack the DVD with some supposedly creative stuff). Eventually they decided to stuck that one. It's all the less clear and eludes the fact that to impress audiences in the end it should at least be easily understood. So it only aims to revive the image of general Thade (as for King Scorpion in the Mummy) for a possible sequel. With the Abe Thade Memorial the explanation lies somewhere in the imagination of some scriptwriting genius.Be right back next season and we'll let you know if Marky Mark is to mary Ari or to go damned with Daena. Well frankly, we don't know yet. Have a nice holiday!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this film is Planet of the Apes in name alone. Well, and the fact that it's about a Planet. With Apes on it. For anyone who has read the book, the original book, you'll know what I mean. It bares no relation whatsoever to the original premise. The humans talk (wtf?) and the apes appear to have evolved from genetically modified chimps in a few thousand years (yes, all of them. Including the Orangs and Gorillas. There are two types of chimp too). The defined political structure has also been chucked out the window. And the ending? What the hell is that meant to be?Anyway, if you haven't seen the originals (been on Soror for 100 years or something) and haven't read the book, then you might as well see this. The acting is good, and it's semi decent if you don't care about the original stuff. There are some good moments and nice SFX. But, it's tripe. Next thing you know there will be a Star Wars film set in 1960's Chicago...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING*** SPOILER ALERT*** While the special effects and makeup in this movie are very well done, the ending of the film leaves you with a sense of "WHAT THE HECK?" I love a good twist and I did like the concept that Marky's character ultimately caused the whole thing. THAT made at least some sense. What troubled me, however, was the ending where we see Leo heading home supposedly BACK in time. Now, if he went back in time, how did Tade become a hero being that he didn't even exist until the future? This makes no sense at all and I think is a major flaw. The original ending is much better. I did like the little monkey showing up in his pod, that made me smile although it was totally predictable. I also did enjoy the references to the original movie with the ape saying to him "Take your filthy hands off of me you damn, dirty human" and then later on when Charlton Heston, in his cameo apparance, repeats his famous line from the end of the original movie "Damn it all to hell" or something to that effect, I don't remember the exact line now. Overall, I would say it was OK. I'd wait to see it on DVD. Maybe there's some explaination with an interview with Tim Burton (who I usually love). In any case it will be interesting to see the behind the scenes stuff. I give it a 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Show of hands...how many of you were secretly ecstatic over the thought of A. Marky Mark, er, Mark Wahlberg (excuse me) all muddied up running around a Tim Burton set and B. that they were even remaking this accidental classic, which easily is near the top of America's Cheesiest Films Of All Times list (right below Blackula, Killer Tomatoes and Jon Waters' purposely cheesy farces of course).For those too young to remember, Planet of the Apes first appeared in 1968. It was a sensation with audiences and panned by critics. The costumes were state-of-the-art for the times and the sets were as other worldly as they could portray in a sixties Star Trek quazi-realism way.Those who enjoyed the first version(s) even passed up the concession stand goodies for fear of losing that comfy close-up seat. The suspense of what the apes would look with all the modern gizmos the FX folks have at their disposal nowadays was almost unbearable. Like with The Grinch's recent successful transformation into 21st century-gadget- hoopla- infused- bing- bam box-office magic, TPOA does not disappoint on that level.As for the the rest of the film? Well, the plot is as deep as Green Eggs and Ham and the "human" cast is about as exciting as an instructional video on an anal polyp removal from the lower bowel of a brown field mouse, yet still, mad-director Tim Burton left just enough camp to keep it, surprisingly, enjoyable.The story goes...Astronaut; Leo Davidson (Mark "softly spoken" Wahlberg) is aboard a space station USS Oberon, training primates to play Astronaut. One starry night he is told to send one of these Chimps out to research a menacing energy field approaching fast on their starboard side.The "canary in the coal mine" never returns...So, Leo, bored with his mundane duties anyhow, jumps into a delta pod to rescue the fellow, and, surprise, gets transported through time to a place ruled by...He crash lands safely in an eerie swamp. But, before he can shake his banana dry, he is over run by a group of fear-for-their-lives types ricocheting through the forest being pursued by dressed, orating, violent apes. Leo is trapped, along with these ratty anorexic -Mad Max looking- extras each with a perpetual glaze over their faces like deer locked on headlights (or Nick Cage in an emotional scene), and sent to market. The market is run by Limbo (brilliant Paul Giamatti) a sleazy Orang creep.Leo and a boopsie faced tribe gal, Deana (Estella " be careful of bimbo typecasting dear" Warren), meet in one of Limbo's human slave holding cells. She's smitten, but he's focused on his personal inner dialog, his sequel, "Exit El Quicko from the Planet Of The Apes."They end up working together and gather a few others including, human rights activist girly ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). They all escape the city and head to "rendezvous" with Leo's space colleagues who have been sending out a signal to him via his space age transmitter he rescued from his sunken space pod. The humans hope Leo is their savior fallen from the sky to save them from the mini-Kongs that suppress them. Leo hopes his friends are waiting for him, just over the mountain range?The fleeing party faces some pretty mean mother-apers en route to Shangri-La! One ape in particular, General Thad, (Tim Roth) hates humans in a Hitler- southern plantation owner-circa 1800 way. He wants the filthy creatures (humans) completely annihilated and is schmoozing with the ape senate to get his wish. Leo is just what the nefarious Thad ordered when praying to their almighty Semos for a sign the humans must all go. With Leo's frightening display of intelligence and back bone, the senate will be scared bananaless into giving Thad the Marshal Law decree he so desires.Will Leo and his new tribal friends make it to the space command center before Thad's wicked army finds and crushes them? Is Leo the god they have waited for all these years? Could the last fight scene be tackier?Don't worry, I'm not ruining anything here for you...It's so telegraphed G.W. Bush would know the ending half way through. Okay, maybe right before the credits at least.The story is a tad blasé. You may find yourself adrift about the screen, looking for something to busy your brain when Mark and crew aren't battling the Apes. Which brings up a kind of humorous point of observation, Wahlberg's "Leo" has like three sentences of dialog in a scene, then smacko, he's immediately in primal combat again; like an odd ballet of film you watch and keep a mental metronome swaying in your head?1-2-3 fight, 1-2-3 fight.TPOA is really all about the visual treats; like watching intense thespian Tim Roth bounce about like an extra at Ringling Bros. &amp; Barnum Bailey Circus of the Cruel in his cute little money, er, ape suit. Tim Roth's "Thad" was super creepy. Hate oozes from his furry little pores to the point were you feared he may really have gone rabid. Even with all the schtuffamagal Roth had burying his features, the feeling and depth from the actor beneath came through. Or Helena Bonham Carter, all made up in ten pounds of latex, a far cry from the West End beauty she is, for sure. Still a lady, even as an ape.Then there's MM Wahlberg. His picture is in Compton's Encyclopedia under "example of the Male Homo Sapiens " -In my version anyway? The man's body is, simply, dare I say, perfect. He's a double cream serving of Pistachio Ice cream with a hidden layer of marshmallow fluff. Scrumptious. Leo was a dull character so MM's signature "whisper" delivery worked. I think I need a Boogie Nights fix...TPOA has quite a few exciting moments. Enough to recommend it. Those nostalgic for the original take heart- there's still only one Cornelious (Roddy McDowall) and this is not a replacement, it's just another look at a pretty wild concept , modernized for the new generation to enjoy.An aside: Danny Elfman, Timmie Burtonski's favorite music man, is back incahoots producing the film's score. As always, Elfman delivers a catchy, flowing gently ominous orchestration of notes.Snack recommendation: Banana nut pound cake and Pistachio ice cream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of the Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. I went into it with high expectations, only to get a sneaking suspicion that something had gone terribly awry after the opening credits. These are some of the elements which made viewing this excruciating:1) The set: it looked like a cross between the Wizard of Oz's flying monkeys, the Ewok Adventure and Willow. I know we're dealing with Tim Burton here, but I just couldn't take it seriously. And, it always looked like a SET.2) The cast: Mark Wahlberg, whom I normally like, just seemed too flat and not commanding enough of a character to lead any insurrection. Estella Warren, who plays the 2001 equivalent to the original film's Nova, is so bad it's comic. Check out the first scene in which she's introduced side by side with the Kris Kristofferson character. The look on her face is so vacuous, you wonder how she's supposedly survived this long on the run. And speaking of Kris Kristofferson: why is he in this movie at all? His character is completely wasted.3) Danny Elfman's swollen, distracting score: I felt like I was watching Batman all over again.4) The character development: The human characters are not developed at all. We're supposed to buy that there's chemistry between the Mark Wahlberg character and Daena (Estella)? One doesn't even really know the human characters' names by the end of the film. I had to look them up on IMDB. I didn't care about any of the characters, and hoped they were all killed by the time the movie ended.5) The tacked-on, twist ending: Send this ending back for a rewrite! Let's make some sense here, people.In addition to the points listed above, the dialogue was corny. There were also numerous plots holes and distractions. One of the distractions was how Daena got lip gloss and managed to shave her armpits while living such a primitive lifestyle. It's also a wonder that the enslaved and nomadic humans spoke English so well.Helena Bonham-Carter does what she can with the terrible script. The make-up effects were mixed. The look of the female primates was not to be believed. I assume this was done for Burton's lame satiric elements in the film. The make-up effect on Tim Roth's Thade was more believable. Tim Roth's scenes fare better than others, although he goes way over the top at points.Don't waste your time with this movie. Do yourself a favor and rent the original 1968 classic instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations prior to this film were high. Being a big fan of the original film I hoped that this new version would come some way near its excellence. In my opinion it came nowhere near. Many key elements of the original were changed, but why? To cater for today's audiences? So as not to be accused of copying the original? If Tim Burton or anyone else could make a decent copy of the original that would be great. Why were all the humans able to speak? The actors who played humans didn't even have anything decent to say so it would have been preferable to have had them mute. Yeah the script was that bad and surely the muteness was an integral part of the original. The film had some 'to be expected' special effects but no substance while the original had very little in the way of special effects and so much more substance. It seems that Tim Burton used the cover of special effects (like so many other film directors these days) to hide a poor script. There are many other aspects of the film which I could comment on but I don't want to give any of the plot away so I'll refrain. I suppose you must expect a remake to be of inferior quality, you only need to look at the vast majority of remakes to know this. This film, unlike its predecessor, will not stand the test of time. Hire out the original and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunningly Awful and Empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the original but was looking forward to Burton's take on it. Ive enjoyed many of Burton's other films: Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands were imaginative, beautiful and clever. Sleepy Hollow was gorgeous and had wonderfully creepy moments but the wrap-up of the story was clumsy and rushed. But, THIS, THIS thing he has stitched together is so god awful that I was shocked. First off, yes, he has shot it well, he always will, but the script (HA!) just stunk of guys pitching various "let's think out of the box" type ideas that just lay there like some well-intentioned pot-soaked student film. I'm a huge fan of Tim Roth and I felt he was terrible. All he did, over and over and over, was glare up at the camera from under his "brow" snarl and do a villianous voice out of a Scooby Doo cartoon. It was so one-note. Wahlberg just played it monotone and flat. I thought he accepted the idea of being in a cage being pulled by other humans while being beaten by talking apes - pretty well. All in a day's work as a chimp-studying space man. And (SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS***********this so called twist ending was like out of a SCTV sketch. I expected it to read Apraham Lincoln for goddsake!) And I know I'm really in the minority on this one - but I kept thinking the make-up wasn't that great. The gorillas were amazing, probably the best of the bunch, but the way they tried to make the chimps look a tad more human with that strange nostril configuration was just bizarre and hokey. And I congratulate Estella Warren for giving TWO AWFUL DEAD EYED performances in the same year: first the Stallone stinker"Driven" and now "Apes". My god, yes, she's beautiful, the blond hair, the bee-stung lips, the model's body, but talk about the lights are off and no one is home!!!! NOTHING behind her eyes. Ever. At any point in the movie. She walks badly, she rides a horse badly and the way we're supposed to FEEL anything when her and the female chimp are eyeing each other with jealousy over Wahlberg was ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It all sounded so good, a "reimagining" of Planet of the Apes. Richard Zanuck returned to helm production and Tim Burton was brought on board to direct. We were so optimistic. The original was a landmark film, could they do it justice? The sequels were so juvenile and simplistic surely they had learned, alas it was not to be. This movie is a train wreck. Poorly concieved, poorly written, poorly acted, preposterous in logic and impossible to follow it defies our hopes and dreams. Even without comparison to the original it fails miserably. But we can't view it without remembering. The fundamental mistake I think is that this is more than just a story about Apes. Its about one mans odyssey, his journey through time and space searching for .... well shall we say the perfect world, only to arrive in a nightmare. The remake conveys none of that. Its a chase movie aimed at the 12 to 18 yearolds who dominate the market. All the critics gush about the wonderfull makeup and effects, really? They are all in denial. They assume that because of the technical advances in the last 30 years it must be better. Well its not. The gorillas are pretty good, but we are forced to watch closeups of Helen Bonham Carter who looks ... well looks like she has a mask on. The sets look like ...sets and the Ape village in the original is 10 times more realistic than the graphic in this version. The ending? it defies any and all explanations. I remember after watching the 68 version staggering out of the dark theater with the rest of my stunned human companions, well I staggered out of the theatre again......in disbelief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea how people could bash a movie like this. Movies like these (ESPECIALLY Sci-Fi movies) are very rare, and i must admit, when I was walking into the theatre, I thought this was going to be an awful movie ripping off the previous "Planet of the Apes". I was so wrong.The movie starts off with Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) in a USAF Starbase that experiences a strange nebula. The captain sends out one of Leo's monkeys to explore the nebula, but they lose contact with the monkey. Leo jumps in another spaceship and goes looking for the monkey (Which was very strange in the beginning, but they had to get him on the planet somehow, I guess). When he gets trapped in the nebula, he goes forward in time and lands on an alien planet (Unlike the previous movie, where Leo lands on a futuristic earth). He encounters a group of humans who are running from the apes. Leo is very confused, which becomes a major point for the beginning of the movie.The film is a direct remake from the original, but is much darker, thanks to the wonderful directing of Tim Burton. He captured the atmosphere from the previous film perfectly, but he also added a bit of an extra touch by making the apes seem much more menacing. The performances aren't Oscar-worthy, but they aren't bad (Including Mark Wahlberg, who I think was always a good actor since his starring role in the movie "Boogie Nights), and the make-up by Rick Baker is sure to get him an Academy Award. The music by Danny Elfman is amazing (Including the opening theme, which in my opinion is probably one of my top 5 themes) and it perfectly captures the atmosphere in the movie. But probably the most controversial point in the movie is the ending. It was either you understood it, or you didn't. Luckily, I was one of the people that understood it, and it almost made the movie for me. But without spoiling any of the ending, let me just say this: It's very sequel-friendly (Which in my case is a good thing)Review: ****1/2 / *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just returned home from viewing this film, I remain stunned. I expected much better from such a fine director and cast, complete with what seems to have been an unlimited budget.Main beef - where's the plot? This movie was so predictable and lifeless, I don't know where to begin. The so-called "plot", was rife with absolutely fantastic leaps of logic (ie. an accidental one-button location of a space/time warp - puhleeeeze!). Such a pity.The film offered no surprises, other than the guffaws of disbelief from many in the crowded theater. I'm still trying to understand why somebody felt the original movie, deserving of much praise, had to be remade.The primate characters looked like actors wearing rubber masks. Nearly every set looked like... well, a set. Several characters (ie. young warboy), invisible during the development of the story, somehow become important near the end of the film. But without character background, I felt nothing for them. The requisite buxom blonde was easy to look at, but left me wondering why she was even there. Any romance angle between man/blonde or man/girl-illa was undeveloped and anemic, and shouldn't have even been attempted.This was one lame waste of a Friday night, and my hard-earned money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Stunk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I had too high of expectations for this movie. Tim Burton has made some great films -- Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. He also made some turkeys in Batman Returns and Mars Attacks! Put Planet of the Apes down as another turkey, one of his worst.This movie is billed as of the Sci-Fi Action genre, but there is little science in it. We are supposed to believe that a chimp and later Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) flies through a cosmic storm and is instantaneously transported through time into the future. Not only that, the ship that tries to save the insubordinate Davidson ends up crash landing on the same planet but in the present time. They were carrying a cage full of chimpanzees and one of them starts a colony on the planet. Some of the humans who survived start a human species, but yet on this future parallel world, for some unexplainable reason the chimpanzees evolve faster and become masters over the humans. The air and water is equal to that of our own Earth but mysteriously the planet was uninhabited before.Given the chance, Burton can make some great character driven and imaginative movies such as Batman, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. In Apes, he doesn't have a chance with the poorly written script and weak direction. The movie instead focuses more on the action and we don't see a buildup of Wahlberg's character except towards the end. Other characters are introduced, but there are few connections with the audience. Helen Bonham Carter's performance as Ari is worthy, but we don't know exactly why she feels a connection to humans enough to risk losing her life. Kris Kristofferson is there to be killed off. Tim Roth does a creditable job as the angry and malevolent General Thade, one of the descendants of first chimpanzees on the planet. Both Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are good as Attar, General Thade's friend and trusted warrior Krull who is Attar's foil and Ari's guard.The cinematography, set designs, and technical aspects of the movie are fabulous. Rick Baker and Colleen Atwood does superb and remarkable work as the make up and costumes. Danny Elfman, who won an award for the Batman score, does a fantastic job again with Apes. This was a big budget picture and money was well spent in these areas.The ending made no sense whatsoever. If you get that far, suffice it to say the final scene looked as if it was added just so there would be some storyline in order to make a sequel. I truly hope the producers of this stinker lost so much money, they won't dare try again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First there was New Coke 1985, Then Godzilla 1998, And now Planet of the Apes 2001. What was Tim Burton on when he was making this awful remake of the 1968 classic? Wasn't Cabin Boy,Mars Attacks &amp; Sleepy Hollow bad enough for us movie goers? This film makes Planet of the Ape fans wanna cry! Why is it that new movies nowadays with great makeup and special effects has to have an awful plot? They just don't make them like they use to! Tim Burton obviously can't afford good movie writers. That's probably why his latest movies were so weak. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an exception. At least it has a lot of plot. All though I haven't seen Big Fish yet! I just hope that Corps Bride does well. Even better than James and the Giant Peach. But Planet of the Apes, Forget it! Don't waste your time for this movie. It just ain't worth it! It's not a movie you wanna go ape over.</fullReview>

I am sure that many of the actors are thankful that their faces cannot be seen, as it perhaps spares them from the shame of being recognized on the street as having been a part of this wretched, awful, poorly-contrived movie.And I won't even begin to discuss the trite ending.Avoid this movie at all costs.

		<shortDescription>Grimly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Charlton Heston fell to the first planet of the apes, it offered something profound. It neatly and cleverly captured much of the social climate of the late 60s. Though not without its antecedents, it certainly has to stand as one of the more important social commentary films posing as sci-fi. Burton's remake, however, doesn't even seem to have a coherent story line. I first saw the Burton film upon its release and found it sorely lacking then. But I worried that my reaction might be too colored by my affection for the original. Remakes are frequently hated by fans of the original, and I didn't want to spout off with an unexamined emotional outburst. But I just sat through it again (this time on TV) and my loathing hasn't diminished. Wahlberg's performance still strikes me as wooden and lacking in purpose. From the very moment of his arrival to the ape world, his only objective is to escape from the planet. So why did he travel out to the planet in the first place? Heston's character of more than 30 years past at least went to explore (to see if there was anything better than man out there). Baker's ape makeup in the remake was good, but effects alone can't make a movie. The humans were no doubt the worst characters in the remake. Like Wahlberg they lacked any depth, and their passivity to ape domination produced more annoyance instead of sympathy. In the original the humans were primitive mutes whose mannerisms were bestial. They brought on pity one might feel for a hunted animal, which they were supposed to be. Another strikingly annoying element in the Burton film was the strange love triangle formed by Helena Bonham Carter as a chimp (albeit a very cute chimp), the collagen-lipped Estella Warren as a primitive human, and Wahlberg. I have no idea what Burton was going for there. While Burton's early films didn't wow me, they nonetheless didn't annoy me. My first impression was simply that he could churn out glitzy Hollywood pablum. Then he made Ed Wood and I suddenly wondered if I had overlooked a film genius. But the profound lack of substance in Apes convinces me that I was right the first time. (And Big Fish hasn't caused me to alter that view).</fullReview>

It's being sent to see what that storm is, but it doesn't come back so our hero takes a little spacecraft and heads in the same direction as the ape. When he hits the storm, his spacecraft goes nuts/out of control and suddenly a planet appears. Too late, he regains control, just to crash down into a lake in a rainforest. After he has rescued himself out of the craft, the movie first really begins! He has crashlanded into a world where apes are like humans and humans are like apes, locked up in cages. He get caught, but after a short time, he finds out that there is this one ape that's not like the other apes...I've heard people asking me if this really just ain't either a follow-up or a remaking of the original planet of the apes - the answer is definately no!

		<fullReview>This movie couldn't be any more bad. Clearly, the creators of this fill were more worried about how to grunt, look, and walk like an ape, than in conveying a story. The dialog is, for the most part, grunts on the part of the apes, and practically non-existent on the part of the humans, with the exception of the lead (male) character. The lead female character has perhaps no more than 3 or 4 lines during the entire movie.As for the story, its ridiculous and unbelievable. Yes, yes, I know -- we're talking about a sci-fi movie where apes rule the world -- how realistic can it be? My answer is this: when we see a movie, we allow the writers/directories to withdraw a certain amount of fantasy from our fantasy bank account. Subsequent withdraws are at the cost of the movies believability. Continual withdraws, as this movie does, have us thinking the writers are idiots and the movie ridiculous. In the case of Plant of the Apes, this couldn't be any more the case.Rating: 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great New Visualisation of the "Planet of the Apes" Idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the original Planet of the Apes movies, I really enjoyed this new motion picture.Normally, remakes suffer from the fact that they are just copies of the original movie, mostly without the excitement or fun of it.Planet of the Apes is a new attempt to use the idea behind Planet of the Apes. Thus, it is worth to be seen even by die-hard fans of the original movies.Mark Wahlberg can never match the quality of Charlton Heston, and was probably not a good choice, but the Apes are even more realistic and differentiated than in the old movies, as far as their characters are concerned. The girl which was Nova in the 1968 movie is also much more intelligent and has more to offer than just to look good.All the cruelty of manhood is being shown to as like in a fable on the example of the monkeys - sorry, apes! This content alone makes it really hard to create a bad movie upon it.Planet of the Apes (2001) is really worth the money, it has impressive shots to offer, a smooth storyline, interesting characters and an idea which should make us think about ourselves and our history.Only the end is really poor and doesn't fit the rest of the movie. It looks as if this was only added to ensure future sequels. It is very primitive and doesn't match the quality of the actual movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only an adequate outing by Burton...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this particular effort by Burton to be not quite up to par with Batman, etc. But, hey, Burton is allowed to falter somewhat occasionally. These comments, however, are not directed at the movie, but at the posters who complain about illogical and inconsistent events in the movie. Some of these are valid such as the engine of the USAF ship being operational years after it crashed. Sure nuclear powered engines can last for hundreds of thousands of years, however, everything else around it would have decayed (circuitry, wires, etc). It's a minor problem, however. The other "problems" can be explained I believe though. SPOILERS AKERT(1) I'll begin with the "origin of the apes" point first. Clearly, the apes (chimps, orangs, gibbons, gorillas) on the planet Leo crashed landed on were not descended from Leo's chimp. They were descended from the apes which were on the USAF ship. After the crash of the USAF ship, the apes (being genetically engineered to be smarter than normal) ran amok and took over. (2) The second point is about the time gap between the sending of the mayday message by Leo in the future and its reception in the past by his crew. Now for those of you who were not paying attention, there is a point in the movie where the USAF ship receives a message emanating from the time warp. It was sent by the captain of the ship, only he appears much, much older. Clearly, it was sent from the future. It's a time warp folks!!!!(3) The third and final point has to do with the conclusion. I have to admit, it was a bit contrived, but like the previous 2 points, I think I can come up with an explanation. The only one I can come up with is that Thade somehow regained control on the ape planet and used perhaps Leo's crashed pod or salvaged pods from the USAF ship, went through the time warp back into Earth's past and conquered the Earthlings. Yeah, I know -- it's a stretch. I can't wait for its elucidation in the sequel, and you know that was a classic sequel setup.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton could've done better, but instead he chose to do this, a remake of a movie that didn't need to be remade (could the reason for the remake possibly be for, oh dare I say, MONEY? Maybe Fox didn't have enough yet?). And while I guess if by some dumb luck Burton is the right choice for a re-telling, but that's not the point. He has made many fine re-makes (Batman the topper, also Mars Attacks, and Sleepy Hollow) but this isn't one of them. This is in the overall view over-flashy, conventional (much, much more than the first if that one had any convention in the first place) and confusing. I mean, at least the ending in the first one was exciting and questioning. This one just almost says the point of this film was Back to the Future (or past) with primates. Dumb logic. Also the characters have less charm, humor and coolness that came with the first one; Wahlberg has nearly no emotions in scenes that parallel the ones in the first, and I can see why Heston is now Sir Heston.Only things to possibly watch for- a hilarious cameo from Sir Charleton Heston himself (I'd just as well sneak in the film for that one scene again), makeup that nearly matches the first one, although the first one was a breakthrough, and some OK visual effects. Some Die-hard Burton fans will find some use here (once in a while it gave a thrill or two), but other than that, keep your damn paws off of this damn, dirty film! Between C- and D+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes (2001) ** (out of 4) Lackluster remake of the 1968 film has an astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) crash landing on a planet where apes are kings and humans are slaves. Even though I had heard nothing but negative things about this film I went in with an open mind because most of the bad reviews I heard were from die-hard fans of the original but the film turned out to be a major dud. The most shocking thing is that Burton didn't bring any energy or excitement to the film. The first hour drags by so bad that I was having a hard time staying awake. The film picks up during it's final act but even then the battle scenes aren't as good as they should have been. I did like the ending though. Wahlberg sleepwalks through his role but I enjoyed the supporting cast. I thought Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter were very good in their roles and I also enjoyed Michael Clarke Duncan. Kris Kristofferson and Charlton Heston also come off good in their small roles. The screenplay is rather weak and the reworked lines from the original film come off very lame. Burton tries a lot of things in the film but I think he's held back by the PG-13 rating. I think the director should have delivered an R-rated movie and went all out on the various messages that are hinted out throughout the film and made the battle scenes real battle scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, am I glad to have missed this movie in cinema. Just saw it on TV now. I rarely get upset about a movie, but I am now: Terribly uninspiring, un-original and one-dimensional, one-way story, terrible acting, especially Wahlberg (who looks and talks like an idiot most of the time) and the blond chick (Warren?). Actually she is not acting at all but only trying to look good all the time. The only decent performances come from Bonham Carter and her big hulky gorilla companion during the escape (missed his name, some ex-General). Tim Roth is too one-dimensionally "bad" to be of any compelling interest. He should have declined this lame role.Terrible, senseless and completely out-of-the-blue ending after the (very poor and thin) "story" is concluded already. The costumes/make-ups and production design are good (2001, so no surprise) but do not save this movie at all.Tim Burton clearly can do better than this. I can't understand what he found in this script as he had a very heavy and uninspired hand here. Complete waste of time and money... utterly disappointing. For me, this Apes is one of the worst Sci-fi movies ever made, and to compare it in any way to the 1968 movie is an offence to the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the WORST I have ever had the Discomfort of Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Tim Burton movies. I have been a ravenous fan of his since the first of the Batman movies (as we know them today) came out in 1989 (there is another movie made in the 60s based of the classic TV show, starring the one true Batman, Adam West). Furthermore, I loved the original Planet of the Apes. It was one of the most well known, recognizable, and thought provoking movies of all time, with one of the greatest twists in cinematic history. Not only that, but if you look at the series of `Apes' movies, as a whole, you will most likely find that they are one of the greatest, most well fitting together with respect to continuity (if that is even possible to say) franchises ever. So with that being said, could this movie possibly go wrong?Oh it did. It went WAY wrong. This movie is righteous garbage. The twist at the end (not a spoiler) makes absolutely no logical sense, independently. But if it sets up a plot that will be explained in the sequel, then I don't want to know, and have no desire to see it. But what is my major grievance with this movie:Marky Mark. In this movie, he single handedly gives a horrible performance, AS ALWAYS, and disgraces the name of models gone actors, which if you think about it is pretty bad considering they have a bad reputation to begin with. One of the more subtle problems that I have with him, besides his pitiful excuse for acting, is that throughout this and seemingly all of his other movies he has the same facial expression, which is something of a mix between constipation and just got done running a marathon. Even moreso is the fact that throughout the whole movie, he never seems to be surprised at the fact that not only is he in a world completely different than his, nor the fact that it is primarily populated by gigantic, walking, talking apes, nor does he ever seem to ponder, even ask, or want to find out, `hey, what in the righteous heck is going on here?'Here is my breakdown of the other key players in the movie:Helena Bonham Carter ? brilliant actress ? waste of her talent.Charlton Heston ? cultural icon ? waste of his talent.Tim Burton ? one of the greatest and most imaginative, and visually impressive moviemakers of all time ? completely shot himself in the foot for making this garbage.Anyone else remotely involved in the making of this movie - waste of their collective talent.The only redeeming factors of this movie is that Danny Elfman once again provides a good score to the movie and the shot where they look back upon the city (it's the only shot in the movie that is signature Tim Burton). Now I have seen some BAD movies in my day, and not only does this one take the taco, but to categorize it as only a bad movie would be an insult. This is beyond a bad movie. This is a complete waste of your life if you watch it. Please, please, please if you want to see Planet of the Apes, look past the fancy special effects, good makeup and prosthetics job, and the fact that it is a newer movie, and go watch the lower budget, older original. Save yourself the agony.</fullReview>

Sleepy Hollows is excellent for example.This movie however, has a really really bad script. There are plotholes all over and the ending is terrible. One would think that since he based it on a idea very well covered before that the script would be easy to make into something marvelous. But instead it was predictable and full of plotholes. I will not mention them here since a few of you might not have seen to movie, but trust me on this one.The actors taking the shapes of apes are excellent, and they do a good enough job. Mark Wahlberg is stiff and doesn't really feel like he is in a perilous situation, but that is mostly because of his lack of lines, he says very little, asks almost nothing it doesn't really fit in what a person would do in his situation. You don't really get to know any of the characters.So, pretty good effects, lousy script, a typical burton movie, but in this case, the script is so bad and the effects not good enough to make watching it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE Tim Burton. He's original, he's smart, and his movies are usually visually inventive. I guess you can't win 'em all.The story in this waste of time is close to non-existant and doesn't give the talented cast any chance at all of projecting any kind of character. There is one mildly entertaining action sequence, and there is the odd in-joke that works (most notably Charleton Heston's cameo), but that's about it as a MOVIE.As a technical exercise, this film displays little of Burton's usual brilliance, but Rick Baker's makeup definitely deserves special mention. The ape characters are incredible, and show remarkably subtle facial expressions. Had the characters themselves be better written, there's some chance this wouldn't have been a total waste.3/10 for outstanding makeup and a few cool in-jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most visually stunning god awful piece of tripe you will ever encounter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Tim Burton, this has all the things that you would normally associate with him - fabulous costumes, gothic scenery etc etc. These are visually stunning and serve as an excellent background to the movie. What's missing is a good storyline, good dialogue or (apart from a few notable exceptions which I will come to later) decent actors. It takes the plot of the original film and "updates" it (although why it needed updating, I don't know).Why do I think it is so awful - let's start with the dialogue. From the moment Mark Wahlberg utters the line "I'm going to get my monkey" the script is laughable.Now on to the storyline - well as I said, did it need updating? Take the original, add in some human talking (although it was mostly Wahlberg) and a truly cringe making ending and you have the disaster that was this movie.The acting - I've watched a couple of Wahlberg movies now and I really don't rate him. He seems to think a perma frown relays a pensive side and that if he stomps, he will appear powerful. As a main player, he doesn't convince. Tim Roth - love him but overdone. Helena - don't get me started - ape sensitivity, I don't think so! Michael Clarke Duncan - hang your head in shame. And Estella Warren - god love her, she didn't have a chance. She gets so few lines and is blatantly there as eye candy alone.The human characters who deliver the lines don't even have the decency to look embarrassed. The one exception is Kris Kristofferson who I can pass off without comment, mainly because he wisely keeps his mouth shut for most of the time. The ape actors are well hidden and we won't know if they were embarrassed or not - and they should be. I really respect Tim Roth as an actor but this was ape ham that I was watching - overdone evil, a flat performance. The only decent ape performances that I saw were by Paul Giamatti as the slave trader and the brilliant minute or so that Charlton Heston was on the screen.If you choose to watch this movie, remember you will never get the time it took to watch it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's vision is a marvel: exciting, thrilling and explosive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, how good can a film be? Well, when Tim Burton (the genius behind the secrets of the masterpiece THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) signs on to do a project like PLANET OF THE APES, you just know it's going to be good. The actors are very well cast and everyone fit into their parts perfectally. But, for some very odd reason, most people found this wonderful version to PLANET OF THE APES to be a disappointment. I can't see why, because I enjoyed the film to no end. In my opinion, it couldn't have been made better. This really doesn't seem to me like a project that Tim Burton would sign on to direct, but hey, he did it. And did it well.Mark Wahlberg is tremendous here, and so are remaining cast members: Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Helena Bonham Carter, David Warner, Kris Krisstoferson, Chris Ellis and lots more. If you haven't figured it out already, I was entranced by this film.The usual action-adventure will place you in an environment with a highly intelligent creature that will then procede to roam around and kill you off one by one. But, here, Mr. Tim Burton has given us something better. He throws our typical cast of "survivors" into an environment where they are being hunted by a species just about as intelligent as they are. It actually almost resembles the apartheid of the 1930s in a way, only it is in reverse. Instead of the whites in control of the blacks, it is the apes (black people) in control of the whites (but in this case, it would be all humans).The story is well-told and is actually more of another sequel than it is a remake, but either way, Tim Burton's visual gem will be a fun to stun people for generations to come.PLANET OF THE APES: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad remake of a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, here we have Tim Burton's latest opus. No, not a short fat penguin, but I'm sure he has a unsettlingly dark and creepy film adaptation of Bloom County up his sleeve somewhere. After all, you saw what he did to poor Batman, once a proud superhero who often found himself in goofy contrived plots fighting pastel colored villains, he now is a dark, scary, menacing type inhabiting the now perpetually nocturnal Gotham City.On the other hand, Tim Burton actually isn't that bad of a director when he's working with original material. I rather liked Ed Wood and I thought that Edward Scissorhands had some good moments. But when it comes to doing remakes of older movies, or film adaptations of television shows, he just plain sucks. Case in point, Planet of the Apes. What once was a fascinating film with a biting, socially relevant anti-war message has become a "Taco-Bell commemorative cup free with purchase of a large soda" kind of movie. Imagine if this kind of thing catches on, someday we may see a remake of Dr. Strangelove with Gary Oldman playing the base commander, Bill Pullman as the president, Tom Arnold as the Joint Chief of Staff, and Will Smith riding the bomb to his death in blazing color, followed by a hip-hop remix of "We'll Meet Again" playing over the closing credits.Anyhow, getting back to the movie. There is one particular scene in this movie I find particularly troubling. Toward the beginning, when the whistle/spaceship thing the hero was flying crashed on the planet, it came in at an acute angle through the trees and crashed in a swampy, wooded area. The ship then subsequently sank. This is a BLATENT rip off of Star Wars. When I saw this scene, I forgot what movie I was watching and was temporarily disoriented when I didn't see Yoda shortly afterward. Now, I know that ideas are sometimes borrowed from other movies, and that's okay. But I would appreciate it if they could at least TRY to change it around a little, or give it a new twist. But no, they didn't. They could have saved some money if they had just reused the scene from Star Wars (which probably cost one-tenth as much to film).Well, it happened, they remade Planet of the Apes, leaving a nasty stain on the rich tapestry of western culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so bad that the only thing that could adequately describe it would be a particularly-foul-smelling, one-hundred-minute fart. The producer, director, and screen-writer should all win 'Chumpies' (or should that be 'Chimpies'?) at the Anti-Oscar Awards.The acting is so bad that, no doubt, Kris Kristofferson pleaded to be killed early in order to escape the locale. Most of the other actors were mainly trained to say, "Grrr!" and leap about like demented chimps.The attempts at humor are pathetic, being mostly banal take-offs on modern stand-up one-liners. The hero is a blockhead space pilot who can't fly as well as a trained chimp, and whose face is far less expressive.If you're going to rent this movie, be sure to rustle up a biiig bag of popcorn, 'cuz you're going to want something to put over your head to escape the worst remake, ever!</fullReview>

In the original film many issues were addressed, such as Darwinism versus religion, the problem of the environment, the impending menace of nuclear war, the downsides of scientific progress, etc. Here, the main issues seem to be the dichotomies good/evil, power/slavery. Charlton Heston made a wonderful tragic hero and the ending was so shocking that it still gives me the shivers just thinking about it. Mark Walhberg's acting is wooden and the new ending is absurd, although it seems it can be explained... but by such twists and turns of logic and probability that - frankly - why bother?A total miss 1/10</fullReview>

My number one pet peeve in a movie is when a character does something that makes no sense, but gets the writer out of a jam. This movie is filled with that kind of action.The mixed metaphors of animal rights and civil rights, where humans fill each role as the script demands, are full of cliches, ultimately making this B-O-R-I-N-G. And while I like much of Tim Burton's sense of humor, the over-the-top jokieness here was the saddest, right down to a female ape complaining of a 'bad hair day'--Yuk yuk yuk.Icing on the cake was the 'twist' ending, which would have been cool HAD IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY BEFORE IT.

		<shortDescription>"Apes" gone Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the original quite well, it having made a great impact on me as a 10 year-old boy. I remember awaiting each sequel as it arrived in theaters in the 70s. Tim Burton's film comes as totally different take on POTA, and this time with mind-blowing makeup and outrageous action sequences.Movie-goers who cannot appreciate the joys of "Planet of the Apes" have become too mired down in investigating plot-points and errors in logic -- all of which could be explained away by any talented sci-fi writer. Tim Burton (surely one of today's greatest film makers) isn't concerned with exposition and plot contrivances -- only in entertaining his audience like a great showman would. And that he does in a big way with this epic-scale adventure, which hardly resembles the original 1968 movie in character or theme, so pre-conceptions best be left at the door.Burton's "Planet of the Apes" supplies more black comedy than the first, often jumping over-the-top in its ability to constantly amaze and amuse the viewer. The scene of a "mixed" ape dinner party has to have the most outrageous and amazing makeup effects ever created. Tim Roth as bad-to-the-bone chimpanzee General Thade is terrifying, evil and ugly and probably gives the best performance among excellent company. Mark Wahlberg makes for a perfect leading man, understated in manners and voice as a contrast to the bizarre and outlandish apes. And Paul Giamatti as Limbo (a stand-in for old orange Dr Zais?) gives one of the best comic performances ever seen.This is "popcorn" style cinema, and it really bends over backwards to amaze and amuse the viewer. Credit must be given to Burton and his art department for the campy sets, costumes and obviously the convincing makeup jobs which trumped any similar ones ever on film. Rick Baker (the great makeup up artist) has taken his art to a higher plane in this monumental effort, and really should be acknowledged for giving audiences such thrilling creatures to view. They're like no others ever seen on the screen, and to watch the expressive faces of these apes is a remarkable experience in viewing. The faces appear so life-like that you begin to believe you're watching actual apes.Kids should love this outing, with the violence all being decidedly PG and usually occurring off-screen. Parents can also sit back and enjoy the trip to this wild planet since its loaded with symbolism and cultural references all cleverly packaged in Hollywood's best style.</fullReview>

Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet movies but Estrella Warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. Tim Burton could have sexed up this simian saga &amp; given the adults in the audience something to look at. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. She's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks &amp; a little bitty kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots &amp; humans but never delivers - Planet of the Apes hints at inter species romance between the humans &amp; the apes but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors Tim Roth, Ms. Carter &amp; Paul Giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes &amp; they are fun to watch. Superlative make up (a certain Oscar) costumes, sets, music make this the hit summer movie of 2001.</fullReview>

I don't think anyone should criticize this movie unless this is the kind of movie they like. Also, all you old POTA fans, you can't compare this one to the original. The only thing in common is the basic plot....it's not the same movie!!!

		<fullReview>Burton has always been one of those directors whose films tend to fall apart in the third act... the exception being "Ed Wood" and "Sleepy Hollow", although "Sleepy Hollow" just about gets by on the "Scooby-doo" style of ending. If my memory serves me, I think Dick Zanuck, who at one time was running mighty 20th century fox, was sitting around and thought to himself, why don't we remake planet of the apes and get an A-list director for it? It's not a bad idea... problem is, the script isn't up to par. In fact, it's pretty bad. Secondly, Mark Walberg is way out of his league trying to carry the lead in this film. I remember reading all the publicity for the film and laughed when Burton and Zanuck tried to compare Walberg to Steve McQueen. Look, I like Walberg, I think he's a decent enough actor, but he's not at the point where he has the emotional gravitas to carry the lead in a film. The story has no emotional pathos. It's just a simple A to B to C, nonstop chase film. And what was the point of trying to keep the ending secret? It doesn't even make sense. They were trying to bring back that feeling of the "oh my god, they were on earth the whole time" feeling from the original POTA, but here it's just absolute rubbish.</fullReview>

This turned out to be a loose remake of the 1968 original. It was nice to see Charlton Heston (uncredited) as the iconic Dr. Zaius. Mark Wahlberg did a fine job, as did Helena Bonham Carter. Paul Giamatti's character felt like comic relief to me, slightly out of place, but not unwelcome. It was well made, the acting was good and it kept me interested throughout the movie, but no spectacular 'whoa!' moments.

With the new release of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), I feel like I need to watch all previous ones first (modern versions), even though they are not really connected with each others, at least as far as I know!This movie currently has a low rating of 5.7 and normally I would skip it... but it is was made by Tim Burton and I love this guy's work! Let's see if it's really as bad as people rate it!11 minutes - here we go... and I thought it was so nice... I mean it still is but the logic is out of its place... I can handle it, not a big thing.17 minutes - hooray! Kris Kristofferson! so what that I thought this is Jeff Bridges at first lol, it's always a pleasure to see a familiar face, especially on another planet!23 minutes - so far it's really interesting, kind of disappointed though... I thought they are going to be high tech apes, but they are totally opposite... It's still interesting to see an alternative life.27 minutes - the typical Tim Burton's background music starts being annoying... It's too distinctive, loud and it eclipses the movie...40 minutes - I am not racist or anything but... damn those apes looks fugly as hell! + Mark Wahlberg's facial expressions look like he really need to take a massive dump but he holds it instead...52 minutes - the movie is certainly not as bad as people rate it... and I have to honestly admit that the actors playing apes are doing a hell of a good job.1h - so much hard work has been put in all these nice make-ups, environments etc. but still, it doesn't make up for the movie which is a bit dull...1h 37 minutes - the apes can kill every human in half of a second but apparently Mark Wahlberg is special... LAME...God damn! The ending was really unexpected and nice! This movie is certainly not as bad as people rate it on IMDb but I understand that most of them just didn't like the remake... If the apes would have been high tech, I would enjoy it more :) tgchan's rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I will admit I love Tim Burton and most of his work but I too was shocked and fearful of his agreement to take the helm of this sci-fi action flick revamp/re-imagining. Many directors were considered and to be honest I think many of them would have been perfect for the film but Burton does add his usual unique artistic style which can be glimpsed throughout the film in armour design, landscapes sets etc..So straight to the point I actually liked this Burton version of 'Apes' mainly because its a fun romp which is both silly entertaining cheese and has that classic semi serious sci-fi element to it. First up the visuals in the film are tremendously good and really make the film stand out, total kudos to Rick Baker and his team, the man totally nails the ape look for all the characters to a tee. The best clearly being Roth as Thade with a fantastic makeup job, next up must be Duncan in his gorilla makeup but how about Shadix and Giamatti in their orangutan (I think) makeup...amazing!The film wins with the look for sure, not only is the makeup excellent but the sets are nicely worked, location is well suited, the apes costumes and battle gear is well designed and the space sequences also look and work well. All in all its pretty much like a top class Star Trek film...I mean a good Star Trek film by the way.Casting choices were good accept for Wahlberg who wasn't quite right for me. Thankfully we had no Depp to endure here but the use of many solid character actors such as Warner and the imaginative use Tagawa really help lift the film, who could imagine Tagawa as a gorilla.I really enjoyed the film on my second viewing, my first was on release at the cinema, and I believe its because the 'Apes' classic plot can be made many ways and is open to interpretation from different angles, its not a case of it only works one way like a lot of classic films, 'Apes' is a franchise that you can seem to mould and recreate without upsetting the originals. This Burton vision is simple yet highly enjoyable as a fun sci-fi romp, not too heavy, not just copying the original, touch of artistic license and the attempt at a twist ending which was brave but rather illogical, trying to equal the original but failing there I'm afraid. Still the little use of CGI for much of the film is always nice in my book.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton re-imagines Planet of the Apes. To put it simply, I enjoyed watching it. The original Apes films are masterpieces of cinema to be sure. So Burton decided that instead of merely retelling the original story, he would put his own spin to the tale. As such, it should be appreciated as a film in its own right and not a mere rehash. The cast, namely Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, etc., gave pretty impressive performances. One of my favorite bits has to be Charlton Heston's cameo. In ape makeup, no less. I will not spoil the ending here. it has to be seen to be believed, but I can assure you, you won't forget it. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film. Bad ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, if you don't know... the original Planet of the Apes movie was hailed as a classic. Despite being basically a B-movie with a load of men in rubber masks, it had a unique ending which will be remembered throughout cinema history (if you don't know what it is, then I won't spoil it by telling you). Therefore, now we have the remake (or 're-envisioning' as the film-makers like to call it), it had two choices: either copy the original ending and leave everyone saying they ripped off the first, or try to match it for shock value.I don't think they would have won doing either. They tried 'shock value' and failed.However, if you ignore that, Planet of the Apes (the remake) isn't actually a bad movie. If you like sci-fi (and can forgive the blasphemy of remaking such a classic) you should at least enjoy the make-up - which is awesome for creating new and varied races of apes.Not counting the ending, there are other negatives, too. There are more human characters, most of which don't get the screen time they deserve to be fully developed (and any fans of Kris Kristophen will feel short-changes as his addition is basically an extended cameo). Plus the action isn't that action-packed (but then Tim Burton is hardly an 'action director').However, despite the negatives, it's still not a bad movie. It'll never be the classic that the original was and it was a disappointment at the box office (meaning the ending will never get the explanation it deserved). Don't expect too much and enjoy the grisly performance of Tim Roth as the evil ape leader and not being able to recognise Helena Bonham Carter in her make-up.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

Another great addition was casting Mark Wahlberg as the leading character Leo Davidson and Helena Bonham Carter as the ape, Ari who assists him to escape the ape village along with her bodyguard.

And this movie did change things up a lot compared to the original but it took a lot away from what made the original good. The movie felt like it was more about racism than sci-fi ideology and theory which I found to be interesting in the original. And it lacked the creepy and mysterious sci-fi elements that was in the original. It's a watchable movie but it just goes in a very narrow and direct direction and not in a good way either. Nothing is really imaginative and it just didn't get me immersed or interested on what was going on. I was just going along with it until it ended. The original "Planet of the Apes" was far-fetched but this was is more non-believable and even absurd. Also maybe if it tried to modernize it in a cool sci-fi direction it might have been at least somewhat entertaining but it lacked that as well while having the similar corniness of the original. The apes being apes didn't even play a crucial part in the story.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this has any spoilers, so...Let me start out..the visuals were stunning. It is more action-packed than the original in many ways. That's it.I saw the original again a few weeks ago and I thought, just because, let me pull out my dusty 2001 version. They have two things in common, period. They both have apes, they both have humans at a lower level.The incredible drama and interplay of conflicting beliefs such as racism, nuclear holocaust, intolerance, animal vivisection never appear in the newer version, so...and now I ask the obvious...WHY remake a classic with something only created for green screen shots?I can only come up with one answer and it saddens me. Very few of today's younger generations don't have the same attention span as "us" older folk. I can't imagine them sitting through (let's face it) the rather boring action-wise first few minutes of the film:but, the problem is, those first few minutes help to set up the entire movie; something the remake doesn't. I can imagine it would be like making a 16 year old sit through "2001." No zooming spaceships, no lasers, no action or fighting.I am vehemently opposed to most remakes. Granted, there might be a handful at most that improved upon the original, "Dracula" pops to mind, but very, very few. I wish directors would get some imagination and try to think of something PARTIALLY new. I know the Bible, Ecclesiastes 1:9, said, "there is nothing new under the sun," but come on. If you can't do any better than a remake it's time to hang up your directing hat and go fishing until retirement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reason why I don't like Tim Burton anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this film, I was a fan of Tim Burton's famous work such as Beetle juice, Batman, Edward Scissor hands, and Mars Attacks! When I learned that this move was directed by him (I didn't see the film until 3 years after it came out), I was dying to see it. I had watched the 1968 original and was familiar with the original novel. After seeing it, in all honesty it was the biggest waste of garbage I had ever seen. Oh sure the make up and special effects were good, they always are, that's why they spend so much time working on that stuff rather than writing a good plot or developing characters. The dialogue was cheap and the acting was more wood than a redwood tree! Mark Wahlburg's acting was so out of place for this film, throughout the entire film, he really shows no emotion and when he does it's only for a split second. I wasn't expecting something like that of Charleston Heston's epic role in the original (heck his role in this film was only minor yet beats the crap out of the rest of the cast), but I'd at least expect some effort to be put in it. All the characters really just filled out the stereotypical roles seen in the real world today from the war mongering general, the peaceful animal loving hippie, the rebellious doubtful sergeant, the ignorant leaders, the royal waitress, and the bumbling idiots the humans. The plot was as straight forward as a derailed train. Everything was just hoping around and far fetched even for a movie like this. It is basically this, guy lands on planet, gets caged, frees a bunch of prisoners, goes through a chase in the desert, rounds up prisoners, rebels, uses rocket buried in the sand for centuries to blast away charging army. Than monkey comes from the sky and everyone is best friends with each other. h yeah, Apes can not swim, because... well that's never explained. And the end was the worst attempt at a twist I have ever seen. And it's bad when the director in the commentary couldn't even make heads or tails out of it. I was relieved when the end credits came. That was the last Tim Burton film I have seen and since seeing this utter failure I avoid all his films, even the ones I liked before. If you don't want to take my word for it, fine, but don't blame me for wasting your time with this sad excuse for a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be one of the few to say that this movie is not as bad as everyone makes out. I often feel that people just jump on the bandwagon when they slate it, especially the hardcore Burton fans. It's certainly not a great movie, nor is it a bad one.Visually it's amazing, as with any Burton film. The sets are spectacular, the CGI is convincing and not burdensome and the ape make-up/costumes look truly realistic and in some cases, menacing, particularly the character of Thade. Danny Elfman's musical score is suitably brooding and savage and I think the slew of weird percussion sounds is inspired. The acting is good, with stand-out performances from Tim Roth, who is the perfectly grotesque Burton villain, and Paul Giamatti, providing light relief.The story and script seem to be the main culprits for all the controversy. I actually like the fact that there is little dialogue. Sometimes movies suffer when there is too much dialogue, as it just becomes convoluted. Although Planet of the Apes is nowhere near as profound as Kubrick's 2001, this is the perfect example of 'pure cinema'. There is not one word of dialogue until 40 minutes into the film. Not everything needs to be explained with dialogue, a picture paints a thousand words, as the saying goes. As for the ending, it's more true to the novel. I will say that the Ape Lincoln memorial makes a mockery of the film, which is a fabrication and NOT in the novel. Although there is humour throughout the film, the ending loses its impact as a result of Burton's outlandish joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without the zippers and the masks it is funnier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version is a remake of an older film that was not exactly one of the best films under the sun. Here Tim Burton manages to give some new life to the main story and to add a punching line that is most surprising.In 2001 Tim Burton played with black holes and he could since the famous 2010 the Space Odyssey had come out some time before, exactly seventeen years before and everyone started knowing that in space we have these black holes of highly concentrated anti-matter that maybe lead to another time or space dimension, if we believe Stephen Hawking and his Brief History of Time published thirteen years earlier. It starts a little bit romantically since a monkey, an ape if you want, is being trained to go in a special space shift into one of these highly tormented and agitated areas to see what is in there. Unluckily he is lost within minutes. So his trainer decides against his own superior officers to follow suit to recuperate the monkey or share his lot.He falls onto a planet that is dominated by apes which enslave humans who are living in some forbidden zone. The description of slavery is just banal in many ways except that we are dealing with apes dominating humans, and of course no matter how intelligent these apes can be or may be they of naturally, like most slave masters, neglect the simple fact that these humans are maybe intelligent. You will not be surprised of course that everyone speaks English, including the apes who must have gone through a lot of mutations since their normal anatomy has never made them able to pronounce more than three vowels and four or five consonants assembled in seven or eight frozen signals. They can't pronounce more sounds and they have never been able in their many hundred thousand years of life as a species and evolution to even come close to the rotation of consonants or vowels that produce series like bat-cat-dat-fat-gat-hat-lat-mat-nat-pat-rat-sat-vat-wat-yat-zat, some of which words do not exist in English but do in other languages and some being spelled differently in English like "what." Note with three vowels and five consonants you can produce fifteen consonant-vowel words, fifteen vowel-consonant words and seventy-five consonant-vowel- consonant words. In other words monkeys have the sounds necessary to invent at least 105 words and these monkeys only have seven or eight frozen calls. And in this film they speak fluent English. All the humans do to and they are hundreds on this planet. Where are they coming from?Note the hunt for human slaves looks a lot like the Morlocks against the Eloi in H.G. Wells' Time Machine. But that is all as for this resemblance.The new comer, the astronaut, space man if you prefer, Captain Leo Davidson, gets a human psycho-mechanism working again, resistance, rebellion and escape, and then an all out battle. In the mean time he will have found the space ship that brought all these humans or all these apes, or both on this planet. Why and How is beyond any real explanation. It is a fairy tale after all. And the humans will win when a monkey ghost appears from the vast sky and is at once considered as a god by the apes. Lucky Leo Davidson who is saved since he will leave the monkey with the apes and use its space craft to go back home! Well back home will be a long trip in ten seconds back to Washington DC where he crashes smoothly on the steps of the Lincoln Monument. And there a surprise is waiting for you.Of course Tim Burton could not resist and have two women fall in love with the handsome Leo Davidson, an ape woman and a human woman, and as a normal human male, he leaves both of them behind on the now pacified planet of the apes that has become the planet of the apes and the humans.Gosh it is sweet and honey-sugar-pie-licorice. Luckily the punching line gives some humor, very black somber humor, to this Hollywood-picaresque fable of war and love.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see why people hate this film. In fact, the first time I saw this, I hated this film and I rarely hate films. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. I'm reviewing this movie after viewing it for a second time. I thought it was OK. Tim Burton certainly made much better movies.Leo Davidson lands on a planet with the humans the minority race. The majority race is none other than evil gorillas. Now, Leo needs to help the humans and escape while he can.The acting is so so. Mark Wahlberg is a decent actor. Tim Roth played a great villain. Estella Warren needs to quit acting(maybe she did). Her character is awful.The special effects were pretty good even though there are lots of movies with better effects. The makeup is solid, nothing extraordinary. The ending- well, I didn't like the ending too much. I really hope the prequel is better than this. I rate this film 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an ape,A DOG! The stench should have put an end to awful remakes forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The saddest observation(s) on this lame-dog, utterly unnecessary remake are that it managed to squander the contributions of three alumni from the classic original: RICHARD ZANUCK-responsible for green-lighting the 1968 version when he headed 20th Century Fox in 1967,was also at the helm of this travesty of cinema-- it also wastes CHARLTON HESTON, the great mega-star who so effectively inhabited the character of GEORGE TAYLOR (here in ape-make up panting through a clichéd, embarrassingly written cameo/death scene), and once again poor LINDA HARRISON (Nova in the first two APES entries) is reduced to a token 3 second cameo shot,essentially lampooning her original character.This film's announcement created a huge buzz in Hollywood, and among the fan-base of the original classic APES franchise. Instead what audiences receivedwas a pathetic, unengaging,poorly executed load of overblown B.S Tim Burton seemed to very removed from his usual hands-on approach that made his best work so imaginative. The make-up is pretty well done, but unappealing and the actors sure had their work cut out for them, trying to reinvent the genius of former characterizations made by Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans.--but all was for naught with such a lame-ass script, lead character and senseless "action".I will say that H Bonham Carter did do a respectful job at her character, and gave a noble performance. But she was conducting it aboard a sinking ship.Weeks after this 2001 version opened (to 120 MILLION dollars worth of box-office!) the tragedy of 9/11 occurred, and it was quickly forgotten-where it has remained at the very bottom of Tim Burton's resume.And judging from most every other comment on this board, the bottom of the barrell-period!It never should have been made-plain and simple</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but doesn't live up to its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's remake of "Planet of the Apes" may well be a disappointment to fans of the original and perhaps even an abomination. However, it is an entertaining film which is not one of Burton's finest, but is decent blockbuster fare.The plot clicks along at a cracking rate, so it is never dull, although a bit more time dwelling on the central character and the world of the film would not have gone amiss and would have injected a bit more interest into the film. Burton cannot make up for this lack of development, but he does provide the film with his excellent breed of design which does make this, at times, an interesting visual spectacle.The characters are also fairly thinly sketched, although there are some good lines in this film, particularly those that reference the original. However, some of the performances, most of which are done through extraordinary make-up, are very good. Tim Roth chews the scenery and most of his prosthetics as he delights in the part of the villain, Thade. Helena Bonham Carter is pretty good, and Mark Wahlberg is fine, although this performance gave no hint of what he would achieve later in his career.However, the wayward climax and somewhat bewildering conclusion let the film's solid base slip and this reviewer was left satisfied, but felt that this could have been so much more. This is a bit of a blip by Burton's standards, but, as blockbusters go, this is pretty good entertainment.3 stars out of 5</fullReview>

Although I haven't read all of the reviews here, I didn't see anyone mention how all of the actors SOUNDED like they had masks on. It was painfully obvious that their speech was being impeded by the prosthetic teeth that they had to wear, which I found to be ultra-annoying. I have liked about half of Tim Burtons movies but this one knocked him down a few notches in my mind. Do yourself a favor, avoid this crappy remake and watch the far superior original 1968 film. The Charlton Heston film is better in every way, except maybe in the special effects department, but the original holds its own from start to finish against This mess. Viewer beware!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 great movies from my youth have been remade into more modern versions and both are horrible. First is Poseidon adventure. Second is this Planet of the Apes remake. Its almost like Burton went out of his way to make a totally bad movie from the original. Just making the humans able to speak in this newer version was a major mistake. Not to mention almost every actor in this movie is miscast. Giamatti had to go out and make a movie like Sideways after this bomb. If they are going to make another movie in this series, maybe make one in the period between Beneath the Planet of the apes and Escape when the 3 apes go back to modern times. Curious how they manage to fly back when from what i remember, Heston's space craft sank and the one Brent used was pretty much blown up. Either way, a bad remake. Message to Hollywood - stop making remakes, aren't there enough good scripts available over there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I might be the only person in the world that loves this movie. I found it to be an immensely entertaining, compelling blockbuster with an interesting story. I love the tale of how the apes came into control and how everything is so shocking at first but then warps around on itself in the end; it all relates. The epic battle at the end was very well-done and just plain badass. The makeup for the apes and the art direction were just sensational (as these two aspects always are in Tim Burton's films). The style is pretty un-Burton (there's no Gothic elements or anything like that) but it still immerses the viewer and Danny Elfman's score does a great job of putting us into the world. In blockbusters you're never really looking for great performances, but Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth were both very good. Burton's decision on the ending creates one of the biggest stunners I've ever seen. It's chaotic, confusing and immensely terrifying. Unlike the rest of the world, I love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Do This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton proves in this one that improving a modern sci-fi classic is nearly impossible. When remaking the 1960's classic, it created some ticket sales because of the original franchise. The trouble with this remake is that the golly-gee whiz special effects of today are put in as replacements for the original dramatic script of the past epic film.The result is definitely mixed, and skewed towards the lower end of the scale. The remake is so focused on using these new special effects, they create a new ending for this film which is truly horrible compared with the original Rod Sterling epic.The story of reverse evolution theory is classic with Ape evolving from man, and Tim Burton's legion of fans might get a kick out of this, but my take is to see the original. It tells the story better and is dominated by drama more than special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roddy Mcdowell didn't live to see this movie? Unfortunately Kim Hunter probably heard about it &amp; got sick to her stomach.What in the name of God??????? All the Ape faces brings to mind Halloween masks with the backs out. Shoulda recycle "Nightmare before Christmas" &amp; "Corpse Bride" puppets or told it in CGI/animation. &amp; again the low-lighted sets? Memo 2 all involved in film financing &amp; distribution movie: keep his man away from remakes of any type especially musicals &amp;, except for "Mars Attacks", this genre. &amp; and talk of too many humans. The original two Apes films kept the human numbers to less than 20 to my recollection.I thought I'd never say this--The role of Captain Leo Davidson SHOULD HAVE WENT TO JOHNNY DEPP! He's got more versatility; will at least try to stretch his acting (Although for my taste he's being more and more horribly miscast in Timmy films). He was excellent in "Astronaunt's Wife"--Pretty Boy Wooden on Kazoo Wahlberg? Oh please! Or how about this casting Michael Keaton if not Depp??? Timmy B don't know how to cast a male lead to save his life! In terms of female leads he does better with HB-C but her in this???? IMO she should have been skipped over for casting in this flick at any &amp; all levels. Elegant &amp;/or down the down to every woman, whatever the character type or past &amp; present, is her forte. As much as I hate her squat screen time role in "Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory", it wasn't a SCI-FI Film! Get Veronica Cartwright, Robin Curtis, Terry Ferrell any experienced sci-fi actress who could rise above the level of unbelievable.The reasons I believe Timmy B had Chalty Heston doing his little bit here are 2 fold: 1) thought it would wow fans of the 1st movie ergo they'll come in droves trying to find what scene he's in; &amp; 2) promised he'd pad Heston's bankroll. In case of reason #1, next time he wants to draw in fans of a media icon to a cinema adaptions, especially in the area of sci-fi, talk to Michael Bay regarding his casting of a main robot character 2007 movie adaption, for crying out loud!Oh wait a sec, just remembered--"The Astronaunt's Wife" wasn't directed by Timmy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unbelievable as it may sound, the actors sound like they're speaking... from behind masks. I mean, some of them were paid millions of dollars to do nothing but talk - you can't recognize them and their faces don't move - yet their voices are muffled and their pronunciation is inhibited. It gets worse - they each move in a different style, as if none of them went to the same monkey school. Thirty years after the first realistic monkeyman prosthetics were developed for A SPACE ODYSSEY comes this incredible failure, featuring makeup as bad as that in the original PLANET and its weak TV-budget sequels, and movement training that so far from helped the actors, they seem neither monkey nor man, but simply fake.And that's just the monkeys. Every set looks like a set. Every costume looks like a costume. Every line of dialog screams, "Written for a summer picture!" The lapses in logic, and the errors of taste and judgment, are among the most egregious in film history. And yet this is about as much money as you can spend on a movie. I mean, they really tried. Tim Burton, a bunch of good actors, top of the line fx, expensive writers... and it is really about as bad as movies get.</fullReview>

The shock ending to the original was so well known that Burton knew he had to come up with something different, and to tell you the truth I can't even remember what it was; that might give you an indication as to how effective it was.The opening credit sequence is this film's high point, and it all goes downhill from there.Grade: C</fullReview>

Coming from a younger generation of Film viewers, watching movies with 30 year old plots and FX isn't as captivating as newer renditions with updated technology and plots. The Hatred towards humans feels more genuine especially from Thade as well as the fear shown when the apes realize the power marky has. Obviously the makeup and effects are a lot more advanced which helps remove some of the silliness of the notion of a planet ruled by apes. I enjoyed the ending, it makes you think and left me wanting to see more, perhaps the ending meant nothing whatever the case it left people thinking and debating.

		<fullReview>Dear Readers,The Starship Oberon is investigating an anomaly in space. First they see if it's safe to travel through by sending in a monkey named Pericles. Insulted by having a monkey do a man's job, Captain Leo Davidson goes after Pericles in his own ship. As he enters the anomaly, he is transported and crashed on a mysterious planet. While investigating the planet, Leo is captured by intelligent apes and imprisoned with a group of fellow humans. He is taken to a city and sold into the service of an ape named Ari. Leo, however, wants to get back to his ship and decides to escape. To his surprise, Ari helps him. This enrages the ruthless General Thade and galvanizes him into declaring martial law and rallying the ape army to destroy the humans.I watched the first Planet of the Apes movie when I was a kid. It was dull and boring. I was worried when I bought the new version that it'd be as bad as people said it was. However, I enjoyed it. Director Tim Burton completely holds back his dark Gothic method of filming and instead creates a rich, detailed world on how apes would live if they were as smart as humans. The Apes are different in this movie. They are more ape-like while the humans were intelligent and can speak, extremely different from the original Planet of the Apes.Acting-wise, the film is golden. Leo Davidson is played excellently by Mark Wahlberg while Tim Roth is brutally awesome as General Thade. Even under heavy ape makeup, Helena Bonham Carter is beautiful as Ari. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa bring in a brooding presence as Attar and Krull. Paul Giamatti is quite funny as Limbo the Human trader and Estella Warren is beautiful as the human girl Daena. One of the best performances goes to Charlton Heston, who plays Thade's father in an unforgettable scene.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

And that's how I feel about Tim Burton's remake of the classic "Planet of the Apes". Maybe it's just one of those movies that shouldn't be remade, or maybe Burton just didn't want to make the movie, or something like that. But whatever the case, it wasn't a very pleasing movie.First off, it's just plain boring. The storyline is worked pretty weakly and much of the acting is terrible. True, the apes were portrayed pretty good and the film did have its moments. But still, about sixty or seventy percent of this movie was just dull and full of unnecessary parts and characters.At first, I refused to believe this was a Tim Burton movie, but then again, like I stated earlier, even the greatest of the great in any business make their mistakes here and there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumph! Why I believe 'Planet of the Re-Makes' IS better than the original 'Planet of the Fakes'... !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Original: 3/10. Remake: 7/10.)Firstly, let me warn readers that this will be more of a rant than an even-minded critique; so if balance and objectivity are what you're searching for, you'd be better served by seeking out a positive review of the '68 version... I'm in the mood to make possibly unfair comparisons, and I'll make no attempt to hide that - so if you don't find yourself disgusted with me at this point, then read on...* I watched the original last night; Heston put a black mark on the film for me straight away. He has the sense of authority and presence only of a poor man's Clint Eastwood; and he looks like he would be better suited to working in Infomercials, with his manner of gazing earnestly into the camera and intoning gravely. OK, to be fair; Wahlberg is no better here, but it makes for a more believable crew and surroundings if the 'leading man' has gone AWOL and you don't have someone who carries his reputation before him constantly looking to unduly milk significance from the script. Wahlberg makes a better Everyman, so you see him more 'in character' than when you watch Heston, who typifies a Hollywood landmark.* You don't think of Kubrick and his Odyssey, when you watch this update. The sinister overlords are revealed much more stealthily. Unfortunately, Stanley cornered the market for 'primate roaming barren landscape' imagery just a few months after Schaffner's work opened, and there's no doubt which is the more memorable image in these modern years. Such is life. Burton doesn't even try to approach from such an angle, and it works. I suppose that's one reason I can get aboard the 're-imagination' train, because at least we get a newer look...* There's less 'blithe imperialism' tossed about in our politically correct days. "Give it a few weeks and you could own this place", someone mentions to Heston on our first trip. OK, now I as the audience think you DESERVE to be subjugated for your arrogance! All our modern young explorers want to do is repair their mistakes, though; so yep, they're the winners of my sympathy vote. Chalk up another 'moral victory'...* A bigger budget and more 'experimental' supporting cast may mean we get better makeup; but what's much more crucial is the improved interpretation of speech. No more do we have to put up with creatures who intimidate and horrify us with their appearance, but nevertheless all have voices that remind us uncannily of the nearest fishmonger from down the high street. Happily, this time our villains manage to sound unfamiliar and scary, to boot!* The forefather possibly started a flagellation fetish for those would be conquerors of brave new frontiers, further exploited by "A Man Called Horse", amongst others... Luckily, Burton opted for uneasy laughs instead; hanging our human friends in cages as an in-joke. It would thankfully be another few years before "The Passion of The Christ" caused some squirming in seats and revived masochism as the cinematic trend of the age...If you ask me; it looks like the passage of time does favours for ALL civilisations... !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A horrid, hateful, hash of a movie. A totally needless exercise. What is the point of remaking a perfectly good film made less than 30 odd years ago? Put simply, it's because Hollywood has run out of ideas. Why waste effort trying to create something new when it can simply rehash superb older movies and create garbage.For all you people out there who've never seen the original I urge you to. It's a wonderful and powerful film with a truly exciting and surprising ending, which if you don't know will come as a startling shock.I saw this 2001 abomination when it first opened I was hoping that perhaps Burton might be able to do something with it - sadly, Burton did. He took a fantastic film and turned it into a turkey, filling it with tedium, nonsense, overblown effects and Walhberg. It's so obviously a film made by committee - 'we can't have the humans silent! We need a sexy, strong female freedom fighter, we need massive war! We need sexy female apes! And we need to out-shock the original film's ending with an ending so shocking, the audience will leave their seats shocked by the shocking revelation of it all!' Boy, was I shocked.There's so much wrong with this film I'm not going to even try.Don't waste your time with this, don't waste your money.It was shown on TV recently and I thought I'd give it another go and work out when it goes off the rails. Actually it's not difficult to spot. It's happens just after the main credits have finished rolling.I'm surprised the entire film isn't just listed in the goof list.Goof - the entire film.Avoid and save a precious couple of hours of your life. Because when you're lying on your death bed wishing you had a few more hours of life left, you're gonna wish you hadn't wasted them with this trash. I know I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word comes to mind: Stinker! I waited thirty years for this freak show. Numbingly disappointing. A gargantuan gas bag of celluloid claptrap. Tim Burton's dreadful spin on a four-star classic renders off a slickly produced, but lethal aroma of a movie, that, when looked at closely, would have even the gorillas at the Bronx Zoo scratching their heads in disbelief. Burton's big mistake (I think) was creating a different, unfamiliar ape universe from the previous series. Strangely, I believe the film he achieved in remaking here was the Wizard of the Oz. Mark Walberg, the lead, is no Charlton Heston. He's too short and grim. Someone needed to tell him to lighten up. He spends the entire film behaving like "Dorothy." I know. I know. He wishes to go home despite meeting two potential love connections--one human, one ape. AND he starts a global civil war for good measure. Nice fellow. He mopes around the planet like some kind of self-centered jerk. Tim Roth's character is the worst kind of evil: boring. He jumps around the cheap sets as if he was suffering from a terminal case of ants-in-his-pants. I did, however, enjoy Danny Elfman's pulsating score. And Rick Baker's make-up for the apes deserved more recognition and some awards. Also, I felt the Christo-like red tents, that the ape army used on their march across the wasteland, were beautiful and abstract. There are occasional stabs at social commentary--but they fall flat. Rod Serling and Pierre Boulle must be turning over in their graves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there a Part II Planet of the Apes for the year 2001 or beyond?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen and greatly enjoyed the 2001 version of "The Planet of the Apes". At the end of the movie, Walburg goes forward in time whereby the Apes are now more educated in modern times. Was there a part II that was made starting where the movie left off at? If there was and I missed it, it should be on video, correct? if it is, can you tell me where it is being sold? The movie appeared to continue with General Thaed sitting within the memorial that Lincoln would normally sit. So this tells me that a Part II was made but I think I missed it. Mark Walberg took the space ship that his chimp landed with on the Planet of the Apes and took off back into outer space through the time cloud, then went into earths atmosphere, crashed landed on the Lincoln Memorial, and saw General Thaed as the father of the civil war. Really got to have the second part. I wish there were a part II. If not will there be one to come?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good, worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Planet of the Apes' (2001) should be watched as a separate film and not as a re-make of the original film because the two films are completely different. I think that a lot of people did not enjoy this film because they tried to compare it to the original 1968 film. In truth, the stories and characters are different. Remaking the original film would not have been a good idea because most people know the ending; this film takes a different approach. The human lands on the planet, and he is taken hostage with some other humans, and together, they learn the history of the planet. In this film, however, the presence of a villain character is an important part of the film. No, this film is not as good as the 1968 one, even though they are different stories, but it is still enjoyable. The script was done well, but it was not as engaging and not as memorable. It's captivating as an action/adventure film with some science fiction elements, even though it does not go the extra way to create a true classic. Still, it's good if you're looking for something fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hum Drum and Conventional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" was a surprisingly conventional, if entertaining, sci fi movie, complete with references to the "Star Wars" and "Star Trek" movies, as I expected more imagination from director Tim Burton. Mark Wahlberg was also surprisingly bland, as I'd liked him in other dramas and I was about the only female in the audience so I guess he's not that much of a chick draw, though I go to about all sci fi movies anyway.I'm a big fan of Tim Roth but would absolutely never have been able to tell that he was the chief bad guy general without seeing his name in the credits. The ape actors could have been doing voice-overs for animatronics for all the make-up let them emote, which I hadn't felt in the original movie, and Roth's voice really got into the role (he'd turned down the Snapes role in the Harry Potter movie for this?).But sound was the best part of the movie, and it was really loud. Danny Elfman's score was so good, sounding like those Japanese drums a lot of the time, that I paid more attention to the music than to the special effects.(originally written 8/21/2001)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bleh, not even worth renting the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was initially quite interested in hearing there was a remake of this venerable classic movie. I wasn't really very happy to find out Mark Wahlberg was starring in it, but I've been wrong before about how someone can hold up a role so I decided to give it a go.As others have said, Tim Roth does a good job, Helena Bonham Carter is pretty decent, and most of the others are basically blase. Marky Mark, however, was a disaster. He has absolutely ZERO on-screen presence, he can't act well enough to even convince me that he is a human being, much less a astronaut, and the movie suffered badly because of this. I didn't care about his lead character, I had no idea what was going on in his head at any time, he never showed fear, anger, happiness, or any of the myriad emotions that most real people have. It was truly awful. Charleton Heston may have overacted in the 1968 version of this movie, but at least you could associate the word "act" with his performance. And Charleton had the on-screen presence that was so lacking in this version.Others have mentioned some of the various plot problems, including the ending, so I won't go into them except to say they are there and they make a number of plot events implausible. I would also like to point out that, once again (just as in the original POTA), the presence of horses on this "planet" is yet another obvious plot problem.As a straightforward action film the movie is pretty decent. The ape makeup and the ape movement is pretty damn good.Overall, I was considerably disappointed in this version of "Planet of the Apes" It had no originality, they chose the wrong leading actor, and the plot had huge holes. If you want to experience "Planet of the Apes" rent the original...it's so much better that there isn't really any comparison (except for the title). That's too bad, too, because this movie needed to be technologically updated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever I hear the name of "Tim Burton", I always cringe. Severely! I knew this movie was doomed from the word go. I could have made a better Planet of the Apes movie myself, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind my ankles. After having seen this movie I am truly convinced that for Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands is about as good as it gets. I don't understand how the industry continues to applaud and lavish this director with accolades. He just simply isn't all that good of a director. And he proves it time and time again. I remember when this movie came out in theaters. I knew better than to waste my time or money to go see it or to even rent it on DVD later on. I just got done watching it on TV a few moments ago. It's about adequate for TV, but only just barely. However, I've seen TV shows better than this movie. So that should say something. I won't waste anymore time critiquing this movie other than just to say this: don't bother with this re-make, do yourself a big fat favor, go and rent the 1968 original instead, or better still, buy it. You'll be glad you did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good writing r.i.p.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a 43yr old former screenwriter, who now teaches writing science fiction, and screen/play writing so forgive my bitterness! I was a kid when the POA movies came out(I read the book at age 7, and saw the movie(Heston's version) at age 6. I marveled at the apes, and their culture, but even then I knew there was some dumbness in the script. Like why didn't Taylor place one of his 2 other crewmen on guard duty while they were swimming? They each had a gun in their survival backpack(and didn't all my friends and I want those cool metal packs with guns and stuff inside!)? So my dad and I groaned at that one! But the rest of the movie was cool, and had some important sociological stuff to say. Tim Burton's movie has none of the coolness or important stuff to say!(IMHO). It DOES have what I call "idiot disease"---the current(since 1980 or so) brain rot of writers and filmmakers, which says "let's assume the audience all has double digit IQ or even single digit IQ !" Well, maybe the writers and money men in Hollywood DO have single and double digit IQ, but unless all of my generation and the one before it(and slightly immediately after it) are all dead, and I'm a dinosaur who forgot to extinct, some people who drop large amounts of money for a night at the movies, DEMAND Smart(read that common sense-ical and intellectually adult) writing in our movies. Burton took a totally "let's make money" aim with this "re-imagining" of what was a beloved series. He went for:boobs,babes,interspecies sexual encounters,cgi headache giving animation,and stupidity masquerading as "Art". How in the hell does the spaceship remain "dormant but operational" after what has been declared "a couple thousand yrs"? why not arm the humans with the guns STILL IN THE SHIP? Uh, if the recording said they were fighting, and only holding the apes off because they had the guns, then the guns in THEIR RACKS, must have had AMMUNITION! OR, why doesn't Leo wait till the bulk of the rampaging army of apes is RIGHT IN THE BLAST RANGE? Uhm, shouldn't the apes have been bar-b-qued? Military trained people just DO NOT behave like Captain Marky Mark did in this film! These may seem bitterness driven quibbles, but I'm an English Professor darn it, I cannot see wasting my life trying to educate people who are happy with a world in which there is no common sense, no intellectual discourse, and no intelligence in their choices of reading(?) materials, music, movies, Art. Burton should be spanked for making this trash--He's a brilliant visionary, and a talented thinker--where was his head during this? As for actors, Marky Mark hit the high point in FEAR, with Reese Witherspoon. Helena Bonham Carter threw Lisa Marie from her place in Tim's bed(i was there as a fly on the wall), and Estella--dear, you need to get a life, honey! Only Roth and Heston saved this gawdawful idiot's parade!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this remake of "Planet of The Apes" would have been made anyone else than Tim Burton I'd would have given it a better score, an 8/10 even, because it actually is not that bad as a movie. It had potential, Tim Burton is one of the greatest directors of modern cinema and what does he do? Totally unoriginal version of the POTA. There's nothing in this film, that gives out impression, that it has been made by one of the greatest and visual directors of today. And that was the main reason for me to give only 6/10.AS a movie I actually do find this better than the original POTA, tough the original had more depth in the script, I've always disliked it because of the horrible soundtrack they used on it. I always did find it very difficult to watch the movie because of that. This Tim Burton's version is far more easier for the ears and basically the plot tries to handle same issues with the original. But the problem remains: This was not Tim Burton movie. I don't know what possessed him. He just blurted out this uninspired thing and went on doing something he does best: Tim Burton movies.I wouldn't recommend this for Tim Burton fans. And I don't know will fans of original like this either. But if you are new on the whole subject, then maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been following Mark W since The Corrupter, and I had low expectations about this film and his portrayal of a classic role and classic film ... even though this film has supposedly "star power" behind it.At the end of the day, I was very pleasantly surprised in the director's take on the character. Mark W's character is developed as fairly short-sighted, selfish, and egotistical, and it's his faults the ultimately doom the people/Earth/etc.Some might say that it was Mark W's lack of depth (in that Tom Cruise fashion) rather than true acting that gives the character his two dimensional feel (which works), but I think the actor and director sculpted the character in this fashion with intent.While I don't care much for the other actors (including Heston's cameo, which was foolish, and the model who very Arnold/Terminator like had about 14 words), they didn't entirely detract from one's enjoyment of the film.</fullReview>

But as Sleepy Hollow taught us, Tim Burton can make a stinker! And guess what? You found another one. Even if (Especially if) you are a fan of the original starring the NRA's Heston, you will hate this movie. All the good actors are dressed like monkeys, so good luck taking them seriously. Then there is Marky Mark. Fortunately he left the funky bunch out of this one. He is good when he plays an idiot being sucked into the porn industry, he is bad as action star. He just is. Rent The Italian hand Job and you will know what I am talking about. He is just not SMART enough to be an astronaut or thief. He is more.... Dirk Diggler. Perfect role. Anyway, if you had to watch this crap (airplane or someone who said its SOOO good) you know that it only gets worse. If you catch the beginning and think, maybe it will pick up, those monkeys look cool. WRONG! Here is a spoiler for you, that part at the end when the monkey saves Marky, is the most contrived predictable piece of doody I have ever seen. Collective groan at the end.</fullReview>

The new movie is more visually intriguing (Thank God for Tim Burton),the makeup and costumes are far better, but it misses the things that made the original so good and famous: originality (After all, it is a remake), Charlton Heston in the main role, and that "Somewhere in space must be something better than a man" concept. Supporting actors, however, are better (especially Tim Roth as General Thade) and it's very entertaining to watch. All in one, it is a good movie, but not something you would like to put on your top-list, especially next to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was dreading it, but contrary to most of the commentators, I rather liked Burton's remake. I was expecting the worst (especially since I had originally heard that Arnie was to star) but I was pleasantly surprised. Remaking such an icon is a big ask at the best of times, and Burton does his best, bringing his typical dark edge to the film, but he apparently had to battle the studio every inch of the way, and the interference shows in the lack of overall cohesion.That being said, the film has many great aspects. Danny Elfman, as always, excels with his score, and the opening title music is superb (turn it up LOUD!); this is no mean feat since the POTA1 score by the great Jerry Goldsmith is one of THE great film scores.If for no other reason, this film is worth seeing for Tim Roth's bravura performance. He steals the picture as the ape general, Thade, imbuing the character (and the excellent makeup) with a performance of such mailicious psycopathy that he'd have undoubtedly been nominated for an Oscar it he had been playing a character in a gangster film.Mark Wahlberg is a likeable screen presence and getting better, though hardly a 'great' actor, but with talent like Roth and Bonham Carter alongside him, even in the ape makeup they tend to dominate. He's a somewhat stolid performer and as noted elsewhere, he pretty much plays the angry-intense thing most of the time, but that's basically all he has to do here, and the real stars are the apes anyway.Design, makeup and SFX are great, much lusher and more detailed than the rather spartan California look of the original. Some people were obviously very disappointed by the ending, and there's no way even Burton could have topped the original in that respect. There's a lot of humour too, and some very funny references to the original (Chuck Heston's uncredited cameo is great).No, it's not the greatest sci-fi film ever made, and no, it's obviously not even the film Tim Burton wanted to make, but in spite of all the fiddling and the disappointing aspects, it's still a diverting and often entertaining watch. I've certainly seen MUCH worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES **1/2The remake of the classic is actually quite good. The story evolves around a space mission that goes wrong when a space pilot is transported into the future to a place where human beings are ruled by the apes. The dilemma for the pilot is simple in that he wants to get back to his original era but to do so he must put his faith in those he knows little about, not least a female ape who has rebelled against the brutal treatment of humans. Wahlberg's performance is a little stilted for my money and the typical gung-ho swashbuckling American hero comes through in trumps but he cares little for the land he leaves behind. The scenery is superb and the way the apes move and react and indeed look is amazing. There are a number of sub plots, but the most interesting one evolves around the whole scenario of totalitarian ape rule. Helena Bonham Carter's performance is excellent and I felt a sense of real urgency about her personal quest. The film all boils down to the stand off near the end whereby some of the militaristic apes learn the truth about their existence in that they were once controlled by humans. All in all a good movie that was enjoyable, but could have focused more on the inter-race relations and a little less on the selfish quest of Wahlberg's character to just get the hell out of there!</fullReview>

I myself can see why it doesn't compare with the original, and I agree, it is NOT as good as the first Planet of the Apes.All that being said, I must say that taken by itself, this version of Planet of the Apes is actually quite good. The make-up effects were GREAT as were the other special effects. As for the story, I didn't it was bad. The dialogue could have been better, but what do you really want from Burton? As for the acting, so Wahlberg needs some acting lessons? Tim Roth was very good, as was Michael Clarke Duncan. And even though she had all that make-up on, Helena Bonham Carter was STILL sexy as hell. Although not exactly up to the original classic, this version is a fun movie. I also, hope that there is a second one. This time maybe get somebody other than Burton to direct it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happened? Tim Burton assembled most of the key elements for science fiction success; outstanding makeup, good actors, excellent score, himself directing. But he left out one critical ingredient, a good, tight script. And that omission, in my opinion, sinks the movie. I salute the filmmakers for not wanting a total remake of the original (and better) "Planet of the Apes", and that they wanted to put a different spin on the story. And they did, changing many key plot points including the ending. But there are serious problems with the script, among them: (1) Humans speak English, but don't have much to say. There's not even a hint as to why they think they're in the position they're in. (2) The movie has a blatant political/social message that is forced-fit in to key dialogues. (3) The ending is so bad as to be laughable. The makeup alone is worth the price of a rental, but the movie really never takes off. It's certainly not as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS***Ok, if you are a classic POTA fan, this does not mesh with the previous movies. I see it as a new interpretation of an already established success.This new version falls short of the original, which lended itself to explanation through some sequels. Although the ending does leave enough mystery to maybe give birth to a sequel, it is not as straight forward as the original. Where in the original when we see it we get the idea right away, the ending of POTA 2001, most of us are saying "What was that?"I still liked seeing it though. General Thade is as sinister as sinister could be. "Ape can not kill ape" was definitely not in effect in this movie, where he cold-bloodedly deep-sixes two of his lieutenants in the swamp where they reveal the site of Whalberg's spacecraft crashing.And Charlton Heston's cameo appearance is intriguing as well. A bigwig of the NRA (in real life) in a movie decrying the evils of the humans and their development of firearms. I realize this is just a role that Heston is playing, but the irony is glaring to all of us that know Heston's position in the NRA. Make no mistake, I took this with a grain of salt.The film overall is worth seeing, but taking it within the concept of the original POTA is not the way to see it. Hopefully this will regenerate an interest to the younger generation to see the original POTA series. What the original lacked in technological resources definitely made up with a compelling story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, but the same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally saw this film recently. I was expecting another duplicate of Planet Of The Apes '68 with hyped-up special effects and celebrity actors (well it did, but they where apes). Acting was ok, Wahlberg was not that great (loosen up man, it's just a movie), but found Tim Roth, Paul Giamatti, and Carter to be very entertaining. We got a completely stand-alone movie that went in a different direction than the other five films with the same namesake (or maybe not, we may see...). I can see where alot of people may not like this movie. For one, I think too many people went into the movie thinking it was going to be more closely related to previous films, from what I understand they where not even going to call it "Planet Of The Apes". Overall it is nothing spectacular, a few nice surprises on the way, but equal to most action/sci-fi movies out there nowadays. As for the ending, come on people, not every single big-budget movie has to have a happy, close-minded, all mysteries solved ending. It's refreshing to have a thought-provoking ending. Although, I did find that the apes driving cars and all that a little awkward looking, not because they are apes, but something just did not look right, and somehow if this whole thing was supposed to be a two-way time travel deal and the apes took over years and years ago, I would think that cars, buildings, and so on would look slightly different, then again maybe they took over a few years before he got there in the end, who knows? In most cases, sequels can kill a series of movies, but in this case I think it can only get better if written and directed correctly. One thing is for sure, I am sure they could get the audience and sales for a second movie just based on people wanting a resolution to that ending! I got stuck watching the crappy pan &amp; scan version and to me the shots where framed way to contrived for a movie like this, then again maybe I just need to see the widescreen version. Overall I gave this a 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, in my opinion (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the original Planet of the Apes and its sequels. But the new version does tell a different story and therefore not a remake of the original. Here, Mark Wahlberg plays Captain Leo Davidson aboard the space station Oberon in the year 2029. After routine simulated test flights with chimps, the station's sensors detect an ion storm (a term familiar to Star Trek fans). Despite Davidson's protests, his chimp is sent out to take scans of this storm up close. Greatly concerned for his well-being (you just gotta love his compassion for animals), Leo goes on an unauthorized shuttle launch in efforts to rescue him only to get caught up in the storm himself. Sure enough, he goes forward in time and crash lands on a jungle-like planet. Before he knows it, he's caught in a conflict where humans are running for their lives against an army of huge, talking gorillas. He, along with the rest of the people are captured, imprisoned, and sent into slave quarters in a civilization run by these intelligent apes.Unable to accept life as a slave, Davidson organizes an escape with his fellow humans and a few ape sympathizers, including Helena Bonham Carter's character, Ari. After returning to his wrecked ship, Leo is able to recover a few devices that detects a signal indicating his crew is searching for him. The ensuing 2-day hike leads to some shocking revelations for Leo once they find the signal's origin. It's from this point that Davidson is thrusted into the role of the reluctant hero as more and more humans become inspired by the quest to escpae slavery from the apes. The ending of the movie also provides a major twist that most certainly indicates a sequel. After what happened in those last scenes, I'm quite looking forward to it.Overall, I thought this was pretty well-done. Many of the lead characters undergo significant development. Mark Wahlberg goes from being a happy-go-lucky animal-loving pilot to the role of reluctant hero to a bunch of rag-tag humans. Carter's Ari becomes more of an activist for humans knowing that they are capable of being more than slaves. Of course, you have the main troublemaker in the form of Tim Roth's General Thade, who's willing to murder even his own kind to maintain the status quo on the jungle planet. Of all the character developments, my favorite was that of Michael Clarke Duncan, whose Attar character goes from being one of Thade's lackeys to a free-thinking ape who realizes the truth as to whom the real enemy is once he's presented the proper insight. Duncan was a pretty good choice for this movie, especially considering how big he is. Some might say he's really part-gorilla, and thereby born for the role. I got the DVD of the movie and liked the process he went through with the make-up people. They were still applying his fur and make-up as Mark Wahlberg comes in for a brief touchup, which lasts less than a minute. The two actors trade jokes and in an instant Wahlberg's back out shooting scenes while Duncan's still changing into ape form. A good funny bit here!Again, we have a good story that goes from basic science fiction to the main theme of the battle for freedom. At the end, it goes back to the element of sci-fi with a major twist. Hopefully, the sequel will help to provide some revelations as to how this twist occured. Mark Wahlberg has proven to be a good actor in previous film roles, as he did in this movie. With the numerous trashings of this new Planet of the Apes movies, it's very likely he'll do a good job for the upcoming sequels. I'm definitely looking forward to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, at least after Sleepy Hollow and the incredible waste of celluloid that is Planet of the Apes it should be clear to everybody that Tim Burton is one of the two most overrated directors of our time (the other one is called David Lynch). Apart from some mildly scary effects there is nothing interesting at all in this film. The actors walk around like zombies, and who can blame them for not being terribly interested in what's going on. The original Planet of the Apes was certainly no masterpiece, but then again: compared to this, maybe it was. Avoid by all means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop trying to compare it to the original. This is a good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am at a loss as to why so many reviewers disliked this movie so much. I wonder if it's because everyone seems to be comparing it to the original, and that's probably not fair, as the original is one of the world's all-time classics. I think this new version deserves to be judged on its own. I rather liked it. It did get off to a bit of a slow and predictable start, but the second half of the movie was excellent. I must, however, agree with some of the other reviewers here in that I did not understand the ending!About the ending (MAJOR SPOILER TO FOLLOW): At first I was thinking that something Davidson did somehow changed the past, and hence he returned to Earth to find the apes in charge. But on reflection, Thade's face &amp; name replacing Lincoln's has its own meaning -- not just the apes in charge, but Thade in particular. When and how did Thade come to Earth? Or was the other planet really Earth, too, just in the distant future? I am still confused about this. I would welcome hearing anyone's theories (my e-mail address is shown above). All in all, I think this was a great movie, and very undeserving of all the criticism I'm reading here. Give it a try with an open mind and don't try to compare it to the original, and I think you'll enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Tedious Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing how mediocre directors like Tim Burton are hailed as something invigorating and imbued with genius when actually all they give us are tired and banal films. Planet of the Apes was marketed as something "new" but all parts of it were stolen from classic science fiction films from the 1950's. Bascially there is no plot in this film and if you were a European director, it wouldn't matter but Burton has the capabilities of a 12 year old teen and those qualities are evident here. He uses "movements" from the first film (ex: the apes catching a human with a neck container) which are part of our collective conscience except this time around, there is no energy in them. The cartoonish film has terrible sets, which look like some cheap soap opera and there is no realist sustainabilty. The characters walk around the same sound set covered with plastic ferns and trees and it seems like they are going nowhere, even worse is the 'ape city' which is so ridiculous that one doesn't even think that it is populated. Problem after problem punctuates what we see. Walhberg is so boring as a rebellious captain that he doesn't seem real but the "humans" are worshipping him as a leader? Give us a break. The humans themselves are ludicrious, because they are clean, and have a perfect communication skill and the women are half naked with big breasts. Ghee Tim, are you trying to market your film to horny 11 year olds? What else? Everything, uneven acting, even worse, cliche that puts us to sleep. All we see is how 'evil' the chimp general is, and how 'good' the humans and sanctimonious chimp peace lover is. Yawn, yawn. Even the special effects begin to wear thin, notice how cheap the crash landing on earth looked. I wouldn't see this film again, ever. Burton, grow up and give us something decent to watch, you make enough money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More of a reworking of the idea rather than a remake of the original. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by this effort. Of course, it was never going to be as good as the original, the ending to the Charlton Heston classic has to be one of the best endings to a film in movie history. I was satisfied that things were well enough explained throughout this film, for example, the talking humans, and how the apes got to inhabit the planet in the first place. What I couldn't work out was the ending, I wont go into details for those who haven't seen it, but I do feel that because the 1968 classic had such a shocking and thought provoking ending, the writers of this version almost `felt obliged' to try and live up to that and as a result it doesn't really make any sense and tie in with the story you have just followed for the past 2 hours ? or maybe it does and I just missed the point!, either way ? FAR too confusing! (Although it screams "sequel!" - how convenient!!). Wahlberg is okay as astronaut Leo Davidson, while Tim Roth is wickedly good fun as cruel military ape `General Thade'. Charlton Heston appears unbilled as Thade's dying father, who's character name is `Zaius' ? is there a doctor in the house?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the 1968 Planet of the Apes and afterwards I was amazed how well I liked it. It was sent on TV and I thought like " I am going to die along with the movie runtime " but it was really good. So therefore I thought that Planet of the Apes Redux, or whatever one calls it, would be fun to see. And when I read Tim Burton had directed the whole thing I was even more excited. Edward Scissorhands- director doing a redux of one of the true movie classics, is that great or not.So I saw the movie and I was delighted to see how the masks had got even more realistic. And we also had Mark Wahlberg performing quite good, but alas he did not prove to be better than old Heston of the original. Helena Bonham Carter as sweet ape Ari was perfect for the role but this human-beings-seller in green? A typical sidekick, and I have never liked sidekicks. He has these spot-on comments to the movie's happenings but this true " evil ape empire "-feeling at once gets toned down by this fellow.Tim Roth plays evil ape general Thade, the ultimate bad guy, breathing a little bit like Darth Vader in Star Wars. Michael Clarke Duncan have been showing off for the Apes- posters, so naturally he plays a great role as armyleader Attar. I have now seen the movie three times, one time on cinema, two times on VHS and I can't still figure out how the ending was like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes while good, could have been much better. The actors, I feel gave great performances and were very convincing as apes, however, the story line was poorly developed. In the original POTA films, there were hundreds of apes that looked exactly alike, so although you knew their names it was hard to distinguish each ape. In 2001 POTA, Rick Baker did a wonderful job of creating a wide variety of apes with very different physical features, however, most were never called by their names. Even the human's name were not mentioned so although you could tell them apart, who were they? I feel that this film is worthy of a sequel, if for no other reason than the performance of Tim Roth as General Thade who needed a female in the worst way. I believe that if a sequel is made, Tim Burton will redeem himself or at least I hope so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put this film directly into perspective, I watched the original version of Planet of the Apes (1968). Although I enjoyed the newer version, there are some small disappointments to mention: Minor changes to plot seem to make this movie less mysterious and dramatic.The main character, again an astronaut, doesn't come out of deep hibernation this time. Heroic enough, in an attempt to rescue a monkey during an experiment, he himself loses contact with the space station too.When he - the astronaut named Leo Davidson - is stranded alone on a planet the dialog shifts to the inhabitants. It's a pity he is able to communicate with both apes and humans. In the older version the humans talked apey.Nonetheless, the art direction of this movie is very impressive. The costumes look superb. I question however why there are various ape species chosen. It takes away some of the realism, although it is supposed to be fiction from the start.Due to the dark sounds used, this movie is still somewhat of a thrill. There may be lesser drama, but it contains a load of beautifully captured action. Tim Burton, the director, did a good job, as well as the art direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Tim Burton fan. I respect his work because he dares to leave his imagination free, in an arty yet commercial way. I always enjoyed his movies, but after continuously watching them for many years now (especially since they were released on DVD), I can finally spot their weakness.You see, some annoying feelings come to surface when you watch 'Batman' or 'Sleepy Hollow' for a tenth time. They are boring movies! Or to be fair, the are movies with long, boring scenes. Evidently Tim Burton seems to fear and respect every frame he shoots while editing and this behaviour creates very long dialog scenes, that work against the pacing of the movie.Long dialog scenes that don't provide exposition should be cut in a non-drama movie. Let's face it, Tim Burton has never worked with a 'Taxi Driver' script, so most of the long dialog scenes should be divided among action scenes.Also, the suspense doesn't change much in his movies. 'Sleepy Hollow' runs in the same way from start to finish, so does 'Batman'. I must say that his best work, is his comedies and maybe he should try to transfer the mood of those films to his other work too.'Planet of the Apes' is bad and I'm not talking about the ENDING, which is the best part of the movie. Only a moron would try to analyse what really happened there. Have you noticed that stupid people, always need to lower every situation to their own standards, in order to understand it? Of course this creates even more confusion (to them) and they won't get this ending no matter what, so let's proceed. By the way, true cinema is about expressing emotions and not opinions. If you need to state an opinion, the printed word is the perfect medium for it.The biggest mistake of the movie is this Burton element. 'Planet' needed aggressive editing, in order to become fun and not boring, which is what it is now. Specifically the dinner scene and the escape scene in the village. Burton treated this script like it was 'Godfather', so we watch the apes discuss over dinner about every day and social matters for ten minutes, like we care. They're talking apes! On with the story please! Obviously they wanted to balance the action with some drama scenes, but the writing is very bad. A lot of other scenes are boring too and should be deleted, since they destroy everything. Burton seems to have lost his humor in this movie too, since these long scenes could work if they were funny, but they are merely irritating.Unfortunately the script is quite weak, so even if that editing took place, it wouldn't make a masterpiece out of the story. Mark Wahlberg looks like a little kid in the whole movie, possibly because of Burton. He wanted him to become this anti Charlot Heston, an action hero who's in the movie only for the fun ride. It just doesn't work.On the positive side, Burton shows off his craftsmanship for one more time, providing us with some fairy tale images and an introduction in a space station, which is the most spectacular cinematic work since 'Superman'.'Planet of the Apes' shouldn't be made at all. How can you recreate perfection? What's next, a remake of 'Lawrence of Arabia'? Anyway, for once more Burton made an action movie that doesn't stand the test of repetitive viewings and this is because of his fear for aggressive editing.4/10</fullReview>

This movie is filled with that kind of action.The mixed metaphors of animal rights and civil rights, where humans fill each role as the script demands, are full of cliches, ultimately making this B-O-R-I-N-G. And while I like much of Tim Burton's sense of humor, the over-the-top jokieness here was the saddest, right down to a female ape complaining of a 'bad hair day'--Yuk yuk yuk.Icing on the cake was the 'twist' ending, which would have been cool HAD IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY BEFORE IT.

The special effects here are brilliant,but in all you have to give Mark Wahlberg his props and so that he can prove that can he,well can be in a movie with action and great special effects. You may laugh at that last sentence,but I don't see an Oscar on Charlton Heston's wall for the original(since he has already have several from his Oscar-winning Ben Hur). Tim Roth,Kris Kristofferson, Estella Warren,and a shocking performance by Micheal Clarke-Duncan as the General and cameos by Heston,Linda Harrison(who played Nova in the original),Kim Hunter and George Clooney are added bonuses in this one.

There is no tension, no suspense, the relationships are empty and not worked out and even the main theme (where do the apes come from and how did they get in charge?) is hardly worked out at all. In short, I wonder why this movie has been made at all. There was an older -better- one already. Why had this one been added? Of course, special effects are better now, but that is no reason for a new version. The makers did not use the challenge to give the movie the tension and suspense it really needs. They did add some -misplaced- humor, which really almost makes the film a kind of cartoon.Where is the time when SF films were full of suspense? "Alien" is an example, although that one has a bit too much of suspense. But was Tim Burton not able to make something better of it? In that case he should restrict himself to animated movies, like "The Nightmare Before Christmas", which was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought it was going to be....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very surprised by this film. I thought I would dislike it intensely, because that is how I feel about just about everything else that Tim Burton does (Beetlegeuse, Frankenweinie, Legend of Sleepy Hollow). However, it really wasn't that bad. That said, here is what I found lacking:The plot. Pretty ho-hum. Man gets lost, man tries to get found.The hero. Mark Wahlberg just doesn't cut it for me. He is fine as a supporting character, say, as a crewmember. But he doesn't carry this film. I never really cared about him as a person, and he never really did anything that could be called virtuous or admirable (except for the predictable scene where he saves the teenager as the apes attack). His character is shallow and wooden.The make-up &amp; costumes. Sometimes great, as in the gorilla generals and Gen. Thade. The female ape make-up was silly, and the pants suit that Helena Bonham Carter wore through the entire movie made her look like Carol Channing. Estella Warren looked like she had just robbed her costume from Raquel Welch on the set of One Million Years B.C. (although at least Raquel's role had some substance to it). The stunts. More of that silly flying around stuff that seemed to get popular after Hidden Crouching Tiger or whatever it was called came out. Since when do gorillas fly through the air?The ending. My 13-year-old daughter predicted it. And it doesn't even make sense.The sets. Stolen from the Ewok Adventure, apparently.What did I like? The pacing. It moved the movie right along and made it seem shorter than it really was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice planet, wonderful apes, threadbare film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full marks for the art direction, and I'd like to give even more for costumes and make-up. I find it hard to believe that this film, dreadful though it was overall, wasn't nominated for an Oscar in any of these categories, especially given some of the lacklustre work that WAS nominated, like "Amélie"? and "The Fellowship of the Ring". And it's not as if any of the other art direction nominees are particularly dazzling, either. But "Planet of the Apes" IS dazzling. The world has its own intriguing version of everything, from tents to buckles to embossed armour designs, and the ape suits are so invisibly convincing we forget that there are human actors underneath even when we have a live chimpanzee as a point of comparison.Tim Burton began life as an animator and the best film he's had anything to do with ("The Nightmare Before Christmas") owes almost everything to his fantastic designs. But, as is becoming increasingly clear, he rose to hislevel of incompetence when he became a director. "Planet of the Apes" is superb visually, but in no other way. And even to say that it's superb visually is misleading. The climactic battle scene is wrong in almost every way it's possible for a climactic battle scene to be wrong: it's all confusing close-ups of characters whumping one another, with no overall design, or end, in sight - until the deus ex machina that we'd all seen coming an hour ago descends to bring the tedious violence to a merciful end.Burton clearly WANTS to be able to spin a gripping yarn. Why else does he tell this particular story? But he can't draw us close to any of the characters, he can't tell the difference between mushy cliché and invigorating simplicity (the "inspiring" dialogue manages to be banal without making any sense), and he can't take three paces without tripping over his own irony. Irony? More like flippancy. Comments like "You can't solve the human problem by throwing money at it - we tried that, and all we got was a welfare state that nearly crippled us" are the work of screenwriters who live in terror of being caught out being sincere about something, who want to cover their tracks by suggesting that, not only don't they mean what they're saying, they don't mean anything.Anyone who doubts that Burton's film is flippant through and through will have their doubts dispelled by ending. The original film is famous for the twist at the end - so famous, in fact, that that particular twist cannot be used again. A pity, for it was a good one. It made sense - more importantly, it made sense OF the earlier parts of the film - and it had a good deal of poetic force. Burton decided to ditch poetic force and all that jazz in order to preserve the least essential aspect of the twist in the original - its shock value. His ending is shocking, all right. It makes no sense. It's easy to shock if you're prepared to break off the narrative in mid-sentence and start talking nonsense.Mark Wahlberg is as unappealing as he ever has been, and it can't all be the script's fault. He goes through the whole film without once dropping the belligerent expression of an ex-rapper who wants to maintain his "cred". And Estella Warren looks like one of those almost supernaturally unappealing models who grace the pages of the latest generation of men's magazines (Maxim, FHM, etc.), with computer-generated skin and computer-animated anatomy, dressed up as a cavegirl - not for the film, but for a photoshoot.P.S.: What the hell did Burton mean when he said that this wasn't a remake, but a "re-imagining"? What's the distinction? I thought remakes WERE re-imaginings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lush settings and advanced makeup artistry are the highlights of Tim Burton's quasi-remake of the 1968 Franklin Shaffner film (itself based on Pierre Boulez' novel) but there isn't as much of interest going on here as there was in the first film. It's an action film, pure and simple. Whatever political comment Shaffner's film had is bleached out of the screenplay (by William Broyles, Jr. who penned `Cast Away', Lawrence Konner and Mark D. Rosenthal); about the only stance the film takes is on the humane treatment of animals and the topic isn't nearly provocative enough in this context. There's a large cast, including Mark Wahlberg (not yet enough of a presence to carry an action lead), Helena Bonham Carter (as stuffy as usual, even in full ape costume), Estella Warren, Paul Giamatti and, as the villain, Tim Roth. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves but their performances are definitely in a minor key. Burton himself seems to have a curious disinterest in the project and none of the passion that infuses `Sleepy Hollow', `Beetlejuice' and even the misbegotten `Mars Attacks!' is evident here. Still, it's a passable, entertaining diversion with a flair for big screen excitement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ya' know movie critics are bad enough; but "wanna be" movie critics are the worst! This is a great fun movie about monkeys, excuse me "apes". You can't deny the special effects are great. I enjoyed it. I don't know what these other reviewers were expecting. I don't think any of the actors expected to get awards for acting like monkeys, nor took on the role for the acting "stretch". I assume they wanted to play the roles because it was fun or that they liked the original. And you know what "it is not the original"... it is a different movie. I get so sick of people comparing remakes. You can't make them identical and why on earth would you want to? Get a life and find some good things in the things you do and don't be so critical. Judge this movie on what it is not on what you think it should be. I think this movie is worth seeing and I think the ending is a great addition. So what if it leaves the franchise open to a sequel? That's why our film community is called an industry. I appreciate Mr. Burton giving me the opportunity to think a little bit more about the movie rather than handing the ending over to me.Go ahead and give this movie a try...</fullReview>

Not just the asinine script, but the direction is dull, the decent cast is wasted under the unimpressive make up, and the "surprise" ending a complete anti-climax.

		<fullReview>Looks great! Less filling! Costumes, makeup, sets, direction, acting, all were adequate or better for a sci-fi action flick. I liked how the apes were more apelike than in the original. But the writing...Almost all the tension of the original was missing. About twenty minutes in the story arc was readily apparent, I figured out the time loop, and started to predict just about every major plot point before it happened.Then, there was the ending. At least what had come before had mostly made sense (allowing for some real puzzles, like why was a research ship obviously not built to land carrying horses?). In the original POTA, the ending not only managed to answer all the questions the rest the film posed while remaining completely consistent to the rest of the story, it was surprising because it wasn't an answer you expected. With this one the ending is unnecessary, as the story loop is already complete; totally inconsistent with the plot; and surprising only because it is so completely illogical. For me, the ending knocked a 'six' (mindless fun) down to a 'four' (just mindless). With no reasonable expectation of a successful return to his own time (not to mention, no way of getting back to Earth with only a service pod) he should've just stayed there. Human/Ape society, and this movie, would've been the better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missed opportunity but fairly enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! PLOT POINTS REVEALED! Hmm, Tim Burton tries his hand at a remake - sorry, "re-imagining" - of the 1968 "classic". Inevitably, comparisons to the original abound, however, not having seen the original thankfully precludes me from such comparisons (though, yes, we all know it was the Earth. damn them).Burton's film is helped firstly by his imagination. The ape abodes and milieu are beautifully and naturally presented. The considerable advances in makeup technology allow more depth of character to be achieved when it comes to the citizens of the ape community, and the sheer variety of simian forms and facial expressions is itself impressive. The only quibble I would highlight is the "muffling" of the actor's voices and the obvious difficulty which they had speaking through the stuff, however this was not too distracting. Wahlberg meanwhile is a sound action hero, but provides little sympathy or interest for the viewer. Bonham Carter is well drawn as the radical humanist ape, but the "semi-romance" between her and Wahlberg seems half-hearted and therefore uninteresting. A rivalry between her and the ridiculously-costumed human love interest is just a waste of time, and the girl really serves no other purpose but eye candy and therefore becomes annoyingly superfluous to proceedings. Roth, however, is superb as General Thade, chewing scenery like nobody's business and delightfully hamming his way through revenge dialogue and lots of shouting and leaping about. His body movements too are by far the most excellently observed.Clearly Burton does not wish us to take the film too seriously, given the comic touches which he has added, which include a slightly farcical (and very predictable) lampoon of the Lincoln memorial. The ending, however, does indeed seem tacked-on - useful for interchangeability (he apparently filmed 4 different ones) but not so good for continuity. Considering Burton had a choice of endings, it would appear that he chose the least original, however, it is refreshingly surprising to find that the ending is not as upbeat as may have been expected from the more sentimental proceedings of the rest of the film. All round this is still a good watch, but you can't help thinking that there was far more potential in the material. Burton avoids re-hashing the political stance of the original, however the result is visually stunning and well imagined but with little beneath the surface. Roth steals the show and provides most of the interest throughout the film, and it's a shame that Wahlberg and Bonham Carter never get much to work with.</fullReview>

Most will abandon hope after the first 60 seconds - why have a monkey control the space pod at all?

		<fullReview>The previews of this movie were very promising: directed by Tim Burton, with such stars as Helena Carter and Tim Roth, and a huge budget for special effects, it had the potential to be one of the year's hits. However, a smarter move on the part of the directors would have been to scrap the film, and screen the preview in theaters. This film in the region of the worst film I have ever seen. Mark Wahlberg, as usual, adds nothing to the film with his despicable acting and moronic facial expressions, except the impression that he is severely constipated; Tim Roth (who has contributed to such great films as Reservoir Dogs and Little Odessa) was physically painful to watch; and I still don't understand why they bothered to include Helena Carter in the cast at all. It takes a flight of the imagination to imagine Tim Burton saying "cut!" on the set, and being pleased with what he had created. Bottom line: DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS FILM. The actors are pathetic, the new ending is as pointless as it is absurd, and Tim Burton should beat himself in the face with a frying pan for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original and thought it was great. This "re-imaging" was so vastly inferior to that, that it's a wonder the script ever got greenlit to begin with. I had heard that the film was bad, but I liked the original so much I rented it when it came out on video anyway. What a mistake.I didn't simply dislike this version because I'm a fan of the original, it is truely a horrible horrible film. The script is pathetic and the ending seems like it was made by someone under the influence of heavy narcotics who didn't care about whether it made sense or fit into the movie or not.This film is almost ridiculously campy with the bad dialogue and lines thrown into it simply to elicit a slight grin beased on a connection from the first film. The apes act ridiculous and you're never left with the feeling that this could actually happen given the absurd things they do. I'm surprised Burton didn't throw in a monkey car that runs on bananas or something. There's even a little dwarf that runs around collecting money like a chimpanzee would do at the circus. Even if they took all the "ape camp" out, it's still a pathetic movie. Mainly because of the script and the horrible directing by Burton. The stunts look pretty bad and fake. Many things don't make sense, like why apes would ride horses if they can move faster than horses anyway. Even Wahlberg gives a pathetic performance.The only entertainment value in this entire movie is the "funny" things that an ape society does that compare with what humans do. The only redeeming thing about renting this trash was that it was the best sounding DVD I've ever heard, and REALLY gave my 5.1 surround system a work. Almost worth the rent to check it out until some better DVDs come along that have sound work as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK - They definitely tried to make this one different from the first film -- hence the term re-imaging. Of course, like the first film, it was only BASED on Pierre Boulle's novel. Like the 1968 film -- the only thing this film has to connect it to Pierre Boulle's work is the title (and a single plot twist). This film does deal with the same moral issues as the original (bigotry) and has some interesting angles of political ambition thrown in to the mix. However, the film ultimately failed to capture my interest as the original did. The characterizations were just flat and 2-dimensional. The ending was the only thing that was shocking. THADE had been beaten, yet his defeat ultimately won him the world he had sought to make.This twist ending was straight out of the book, but I wasted my time for all intents and purposes. If they wanted to resurrect the franchise, they should have done a continuation from where the originals left off. I rate this film H for HORROR and horrible.</fullReview>

About the only thing really similar to the original is "Apes ruling humans." The similarities essentially stop there. I thought the makeup was superb, and Tim Roth's Gen.

		<fullReview>It takes a plethora of qualities to make an outstanding piece of cinema. Many things can go awry, from direction to production, casting to lighting. Any one thing can put the whole thing off kilter. Try watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to a background score of 'The Sound Of Music' and you may begin to see what I'm driving at. It just doesn't ring true. It would come across as, if not ridiculous, then certainly somewhat odd. This is how I felt about this film. Mark Wahlberg plays a United States Airforce space pilot who also trains, luckily for the plot, monkeys. It would be easy to harp on about paying peanuts, getting monkeys and other such witticisms. Instead of blindly denigrating this film, as many have done, it would seem more politic to look at the reasons why. Hammy acting, cliched one-liners, `Never send a monkey to do a man's job', for instance. Lack of plot; Star thrown into space turmoil, gets stranded on an unforgiving planet dominated by Apes. Apes catch star. Star escapes from potential slavery. Star gets home again safely. Everybody's happy. Apart from the audience. Widely slammed by critics and punters alike, and fairly so. A poor excuse for a film which tried, and miserably failed, to live up to the original. Bad, bad, bad. Even the token appearance from Charlton Heston could not save this from ignominy.</fullReview>

I will say this: the performances were good, there was nothing especially WRONG with the directing, and the effects and makeup were everything that you would expect, but in many respects, this drivel reminds me of another ill-conceived sci-fi project. You could probably guess what that is by the title of my comment.Battlefield Earth has been panned non-stop by critics all over the world, but is this really much better? Come on...This film's ending is the most incoherent copout I've seen in years. The script is completely unoriginal, the action sequences are muddled and unexciting, and the attempts at comedy are cringe-worthy. Both are big budget mistakes. The only difference is that this one was successful (and ok...maybe not quite so laughable). The fact that this film has at this point grossed around $US350 million internationally is a huge indictment on the intelligence of your average human being. If you haven't seen it yet, don't. If you want some decent sci-fi entertainment, see Jurassic Park 3. It may not be the epitome of originality, but at least it delivers what it says it will.Tim Burton was, until this film, a symbol of originality, style, and great black humour, but this could just as easily have been directed by Michael Bay (except he'd probably find some way to sneak in a dogfight between the apes and humans in F-15s so there'd be more explosions).To Mark Wahlberg, pick better projects.To John Travolta, you're finally almost off the hook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The technology, the make up, the scenery, just marvelous. A good cast, although the male lead was about as dull as dry toast sitting in a toaster for a day and a half (I hope the apes do whatever they want to him in the sequel). It isn't even the obtuse ending that bothered me. It's that there was something so lacking. With the gifts of computer animations and the advancements in the craft of movie-making, why couldn't one care less what happens to these characters. I don't like Charlton Heston, but when he told off those apes in the first movie, I cheered him. As with the original, why are the humans so docile and disorganized. They have evolved to the upright state, fully clothed, communicative--but they aren't more than silly critters to the apes. How would you feel if your dog started making sweaters, got married, and lived in a cave? Would you be interested in whether he had become a sentient creature, capable of more advance thinking.Another question is why those apes were able to bounce in the air so much. I've never seen a monkey bounce; I've seen them swing, not bounce. The bad guy (excuse me, bad simian) can come flying like an oversexed kangaroo at any point. I have to admit, I liked the battlefield scenes. They reminded me of a kickoff at an NFL football game. Apparently they planned to take over the planet by running into each other.I really did like the physical appearance of the apes--there was great expression. I got a kick out of the humans being sold as pets in stores. As usual, of course, the gorillas are the dumb ones (It's because they are big--right--big people are supposed to be dumb). Oh, wait! They may have been the script writers and got exactly what they had coming to them!Once again, a disappointing summer--two blockbusters in the science fiction field, this thing and Jurassic Park III. Maybe I need to take up golf!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>oh come on!, when are they going to stop doing things like this?, when are they going to realize it doesn't matter how much money they spend on fireworks and publicity... if they don't spend some few cents on writing a script that is not insulting to the viewers' intelligence, the movie is nothing but garbage? well, I've had enough of these nonsense, stupid scripts, with all the plot holes, corny sentimental moments and recycled jokes. Sure I enjoyed the customes, the visual effects and the sexy blue eyed blonde, but I would have enjoyed it more if the movie showed at least a fraction of the impact the original series did. Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter.. they were good enough, frankly I believe they are wasting their talent on garbage like this. I wish them better vision to choose better scripts in the future. Only one more thing: I'm really dissapointed at Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie that deserves a sequel (CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all I must say that I am one of those who really liked this movie, one of the most anticipated ever. Perhaps my expectations were lowered after the initial negative reaction by the press, but I was pleasantly surprised at the intelligence, professionalism, and self-awareness of this blockbuster. It was a re-imagining of the planet ruled by apes concept in the best sense of the word; it is taken in a direction completely different and fresh than the original movie. I was chhering through every minute of this film, because like all Tim Burton movies, everything came to together and worked marvelously: the characters were engaging and the story was interesting. The ending was, in my opinion, the icing on the cake. I knew there was going to be a shock ending when I went in, and actually sort of predicted halfway through when Charlton Heston's character started explaining the plot threads. It may not make complete sense, but works within the film's context and wraps it up in an appropriately cheesy way. But I think they should start thinking about a sequel. Leo Davidson's further adventures on OUR planet of the apes. They should show Thade as ruler of the world or president, that would be hilarious. It would again take the ruling apes concept in an entirely new direction. They should bring the entire cast from the remake back and have some other A-list director make it and Burton producing it. Also try and give a reasonably believable explanation of the final events in the story. I think they would make a very entertaining and interesting movie. You listening 20th Century Fox?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not Burton´s best, but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I was very dissapointed when I saw this film. The "re-imagine" concept just does not work in the movies (just ask Gus Van Sant). But I thought Burton might make it work. Well, I was wrong. I adore Burtons work and in my personal opinion he is Hollywood´s greatest director, but that does not mean that I love every piece of celluloid that he comes in contact with. POTA has some potentials but somehow they just fizz out. You can never stop asking yourself "Why?" Why make a remake of a near perfect film? If POTA 2001 would have been the first ape film, this might have been hailed as a great film. The fact simply is that we have seen this before. And what what is Burton doing with a comic relief?! Limbo is doing the same for this movie as Jar Jar did for Episode one! He is to much, to "haha funny" and should have been killed when the humans escaped. But no, we have to endure him throughout the whole film! The movie does have some good points though. First of all it has Tim Roth. He is without a doubt the best actor in this film and his ape impression is at times very frightening. The sets, costumes and everything in that department was impeccable, in a Burtonian way. There have been some who say that the make up in this film is no better than in the original. That is pure nonsense. I am inclined to think that these people are only blinded by some hate of Burton and his POTA and for fouling the memory of the original that they can´t give credit where credit is due! The makeup in this movie is sheer brilliance. The movement of the actors lips are now visible and so are other discreet features. This is better make up and saying otherwise just underlines that some people can´t judge films without letting feelings cloud there judgement. Last words. See the film at least two times. The initial shock wears off an you like it better the next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is good but not memorable. helena Bonham Carter has twinkling eyes. The tacit love scenes among mark Wahlberg and her are touching. It's amazing how humans can feel threatened all the time . Estella Warren's worship of Mark Wahlberg is challenged by Carter's enthusiasm and worship of the humans. By having this love triangle in this kind of movie plot, Tim Roth did an excellent job potraying humans versus apes, their likes and dislikes. The last scene , to many a confusing ending with different interpretation, is the best scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, my god it has finally happened: Tim Burton has directed an absolute stinker. From the opening minutes, where Wahlberg gets on a rescue-mission for his chimp (!) to its final "surprise"-ending (which is everything, but no surprise) this movie goes nowhere. No action, no script, no suspense and no sense at all - not even good visuals, which Burton is known for. What made the director and the producers believe that this is a movie? It seems as if the whole crew had no idea what they were doing. The acting - especially by "star" Mark Wahlberg, who once again proves that maybe he is the most overrated actor ever to emerge from Hollywood - but also by theater veterans Roth and Bonham-Carter - is completely dull. Well, at least it fits the movie. Be sure to miss this one, you could spend your money in a more reasonable way- like throwing it away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun summer fare with awesome action and great ape makeup.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 7/10I had very mixed feelings about this film. I liked the start; it went straight into the action and had an amazing crash scene. That was all very well. However, as soon as we got to know the nature of the apes, I started to really despise this movie. I thought it was pathetic, gay and boring. Personally, I found it hard to take the `ape city' thing seriously. That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and then BAM! the action hit me like a bomb and I loved it. That lasted for pretty much the rest of the movie. All of it was a blast after the crappy parts in the ape city and I was really entertained watching the adventure and escapist story. The apes themselves can be sort of unintentionally funny at times, but the make-up for them was amazing! Wow, I just gave up trying to guess who the actors were after a while because the ape make-up was so astounding and convincing, you couldn't even tell who's eyes were under that hunk of hair! The actors do well, Mark Wahlberg fits the leading role well and gives it his all. I don't think his character was very considerate and I think he tried to be a little too much like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, but apart from that, he's done well. Helena Bonham Carter was really fantastic and has the pleasure of playing the most developed character in Planet of the Apes, giving her character and performance depth, more-so than Wahlberg's sometimes selfish hero. Tim Roth was evil and believable and the most ape-like actor in the film. Tim Burton's direction shines through the movie, especially the final reel. He puts focus to his camera-work and knows he's up to the job. Some of the characters are annoying at times but you all care about what happens to them. Like The Mummy Returns, this movie is all about action, having fun, escaping and far-fetched fantasy so don't go in to the theatre expecting a summer drama with fully developed characters and a memorable plot. Oh, and I loved the surprise ending!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, especially the ending, was very poor. It started out very promising, and I certainly enjoyed the crew seeing it's own future transmission. After that part, though, the movie went completely downhill. Estella Warren, as far as I can tell, was in the movie solely to get young teenage boys to come out to the movie for the eye candy. The ending was especially bad. How does Thade exist in 2329 AND 2029. It just doesn't make any sense, any way you slice it. I'm also wondering if Tim Burton joined PETA just before the making of this movie, because the ethical treatment of animals message was really, really heavy-handed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ahhh, finally a Hollywood action blockbuster with an intriguing story! Here is the best film of 2001 so far bar none! Critics are just critics, and will never be able to enjoy a movie without picking it apart. This was a marvelous film in so many ways. The script is extremely well written and keeps you guessing. In the end you'll be dazzled and confused, but no less amazed! What made this film so enjoyable was the grand sense of humor and pacing. It was never boring and some of the apes were hilarious. The ending, which has been much talked about, is wonderfully twisted and different than usual. Wouldn't it have been boring if Wahlberg just came back to Earth with a happy ending? Knowing Tim Burton you know something weird had to happen. Wahlberg gave a great performance as the earnest astronaut. From the opening scenes I knew this film would be great. The credits sequence was extremely imaginative and beautifully done. Everything in the film was superbly done. Ape City was truly eye-popping. I couldn't tell if it was done by computer or models. I loved Charlton Heston's little cameo. He really explained the mechanics of the story in just one scene. And it's a fascinating story at that. I highly recommend this film. It's probably best if you haven't seen the original, since I haven't and I really enjoyed this one. So go see it and have an old-fashioned good time at the movies. Best summer action film of the year. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Entertaining minus Marky Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie serves its purpose, assuming you go in with the attitude that it's the Apes against the humans. Tim Burton's imagination makes the new Planet of the Apes a wonder to watch and look at. As with every Tim Burton film, there are certain things that aren't necessary...I could have taken or left the ending. But there is plenty to like about this film, more likeable than not. The only major flaw with the film was casting Mark Wahlberg...and thank the almighty, that he doesn't have enough screen presence for us to even pay attention to what he's saying. I found myself sort of skipping over Wahlberg's part and paying more attention to the real stars of the movie...those damned dirty apes. Rick Baker will win an Oscar for his makeup...(you've done your job if the actors are unrecognizable). General Thade is a villain we can all love to hate and Tim Roth should be proud of the job he did in bringing this character to life. I was convinced of his genuine evil. Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Clarke Duncan were almost equally as convincing and I hope to see all 3 of them back in the next movie.Tim Burton has gained my respect. He surprised me with Sleepy Hollow and has me back on his good list with Planet of the Apes. His storytelling abilities have improved and he's toned down the "unbelievable silliness" factor (IE Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, Any of the Pee Wee movies). Instead of going nuts with how bizarre the characters can be, he redirects his talents into making you FEAR the Apes...as in Sleepy Hollow, you FEAR the Headless Horseman. So much that you're fascinated with how evil these villains are.There's no need to talk about the genius of Danny Elfman's musical talents. He's been doing it for years and if anyone knows how to make even an average movie come to life, it is Elfman.Kudos to Burton....a well done film, minus Marky Mark. He'll get it right next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until the surprise ending [if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about] I was enjoying this movie. I found it to be almost as good as the 1968 original. Before I saw the movie, I read the book. I loved the book. It's my favorite book. Then I saw the 1968 original. I enjoyed the original so when this one opened, I rushed to see it. As I said before, I was enjoying it. Just as I was that this was the best movie ever, the ending comes. Now I heard that ending was messed up, but I didn't know it would be impossible to figure out. Ever since I saw this movie, I have been trying to figure out the ending. I still can't figure it out. It was the worst ending to a movie I've ever seen. Couldn't Tim Burton have done a different ending? I mean this ending didn't even make sense. Hopefully, the video or DVD of this will have something that explains the ending a little bit better [like the secrets and clues after THE SIXTH SENSE video]. It would have been a great movie it weren't for that ending. Now it's just a good movie. Mark Wahlberg does a good job as Leo Davidson and the special effects are amazing. The movie was a bit long though and I wish Estella Warren had some more dialogue because she didn't seem to have a whole lot to say in the movie. Warning: This version is a lot more dark and violent than the 1968 original. Parents with young children might want to show them the 1968 version instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can I start off by saying despite what people say about critics, they do prove their worth like warning us about trash like Pearl Harbor so in the case of Tim Burton's POTA I would merely say they are wrong but then everyone sees the film in their own way. I'm a fan of the original series and was looking forward to this version. Of course it has its bad points like some atrocious dialogue like "..a human from the stars" from Helena Bonham Carter but its a more ambitious film with more content and ideas than say Jurassic Park 3 which was just another tired franchise film. The ending was a fun homage to the original and was not supposed to top that original film but is a part of Tim Burton's reimaging. Mr Burton said in a recent interview that he would rather jump out of a window than make a sequel even though Fox want to turn it into a franchise so maybe there should not be a sequel but just let this film stand as a worth successer to the 1968 version. I can't wait for the DVD with the extras to savor from this excellent version. 10 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as the reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original movie and a Tim Burton fan I was very much looking forward to this movie. Then I read the early reviews coming out of the States and almost didn't go to see it because of the criticism, but I decided to go to make up my own mind.I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised, it was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting. There are a few things that let the plot down and stretch credibility, but then you have to expect that with science fiction movies. Why would they be using monkeys to pilot probes, when even now they have automated ones? Why does the Chimp's pod turn up at that exact minute when it has been missing for thousands of years?? You just have to suspend your dis-belief and go along with the story. If you can do that then you will probably enjoy it. Let's face it, the original doesn't stand up to any degree of scientific analysis either, so why analyse this one?There has been a lot of talk about the endding, to me it made perfect sense, I don't see what all the whining is about. It is obvious that he has gone foward into the future of the same planet, he never went back to Earth. Thade has obviously made a comeback and has lead the apes in a reconquest of the planet, and they have now developed technology (perhaps with the help of the data banks on the ship, now that they know they are there). Simple as that. Why are people getting confused and thinking he went back to earth?? That really would make no sense at all!The only strange thing about the ending, is why oh why didn't he stay with Estella Warren! She wanted him, and he left!! Now that really does stretch credibility!Another interesting thing is that there appear to be several species of apes (Gorillas, Chimps and Orang-Utangs as far as I can tell), and yet they all get along fine and live under the banner 'Ape'. Surely to a Chimp a Gorilla would be as alien as a human! After all humans are a species of ape as well! It seems that this movie is displaying the old human arrogance that there are humans in one catagory, and the whole animal kingdom in the other and that we are the superior. I think it far more likely that each species would hate all the others, just as we see in nature. But that would make the movie far to complicated!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Either the NRA has taken over this page, or I saw a different film as most of the other IMDb users. If this film proves anything, it's that Tim Burton is one of the greatest creative minds in cinematic history. When I saw the trailer I feared this one wouldn't be as dark as his previous efforts, but there are still plenty Burtonesque images for the fans to be happy.I saw the original Charlton Heston film and although I appreciated the camp qualities and the shock ending, it was basically nothing more then a long episode of the muppet show. This version has so much more style and the apes are truly impressive, you forget they're just humans, unlike in the original. Rick Baker deserves an oscar for his work. I also think Mark Whalberg makes a much more realistic hero then Heston. While Charlton was happy enough to fight 'them darn monkeys', the only thing Whalberg cares about is to get the hell out of there, with or without the other humans. About the 'twist'ending (don't worry I'm not gonna spoil it), well I didn't see it coming, as did nobody else in the audience.So don't let all the negative reviews scare you, this movie is really worth seeing!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton does it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...that is, take an old "classic" and make it more faithful to the source material. From the same man, we've had a Batman who acts more like a real millionaire whose parents were murdered in front of him as a boy would, and a Sleepy Hollow that reads more like a Shakespeare play, highlighting as Washington Irving's original story does how badly this overrated poet's dialogues fail to reflect real human speech. In this new version of Planet Of The Apes, we get to see an air force pilot who behaves like an air force pilot, an ape civilisation that behaves like an ape civilisation, and a metaphor for the civil rights struggle that reads more like the X-Men feature film than the restrained, "don't want to upset the powers that be" style of the television series.I've read on this site that the film is simply rehashed in order to suit those with short attention spans. Not true. All through the film, one thinks of how a simple collection of apes from a research station could have evolved into almost-bipedial, talking ones with more distinctive personalities. The next few sentences may spoil any surprises, so those of you who have not seen the film yet can scroll past them at your leisure. One aspect of the film I found a bit disappointing is the fact that the original talking ape who is referred to as CMOS by his descendants is never fully explained. His origins and the reason he is called that are never really talked about, and I originally thought he would be the monkey that Wahlberg's character shot off into space in order to rescue. I must admit, however, that ending the battle between the humans and the apes by having said monkey land right in the middle of them was a fine touch. The metaphor for religion by showing that CMOS, this figure the apes worship for being the original free ape, got to start his own civilisation by murdering the humans who were originally caring for him, was an ingenious stroke. My only real complaint relates to the ending. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, unlike some internet sites, but were I in this pilot's position, I honestly would have stayed. It's not every day that one gets a chance to help build a new civilisation with two very different races are just learning to work with each other. Compared to the planet Earth as it is today, and it shows no signs of ever getting better, it is a real paradise.Given all the displays in the film of appalling behaviour towards humans and each other by the apes, and how they resolve themselves, I think Tim Burton's reinterpretation manages to drive home a point that I seriously doubt the original films and television series would have been allowed to. The fact that not all racism is white-on-black seems a taboo subject in 2001, but one that this film handles metaphorically in an intelligent way. Give it a try without the prejudice of original Apes series fans to blinker you, and it may just surprise you. Encourage yourself to think of a better ending, though. Encourage yourself to think of all the different ways the apes could have evolved, in fact. This is not Planet Of The Apes Lite... it is Planet Of The Apes non-Disney style, something we need applied to more old "family-oriented" piles of cobblers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How dare they? I was hoping to see something new, modern and interesting. What I did see, was Marky -I look so good-, a bit blabla and a very expansive looking decoration and mask. Nothing more. I had some hopes, that the Three angle story, the hero, the ape and the girl will get more weight at the end. The character girl was so ironic and the ape the one to fall in love with. No, nobody must have had the ambition to use the tones of money something like this cost, to create an interesting story. The voting in imdb.com is 6.1. What is up with you? Don´t you know, how a good film looks like? Sad, but true, let´s hope, they don´t sequel this one,tooRichard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time and money. Give this one a miss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***This review contains spoilers.*** You have been warned.I gave this film a 2 out of 10 which means it wasn't *entirely* bad: some of the make-up was reasonable and the music didn't make me ill. That's it for the film's redeeming features.As for the awful bits, where do I start? Let's see:(1) An ultra-politically correct message hangs round this film like a 52,000 ton battleship. We're supposed to bring away the message 'Let's all live together in a nice, warm, and fuzzy multicultural society in which each individual has his own special little contribution to make, etc, etc'. If I wanted to hear such a message, I would read the PC rubbish the UK government puts out. If the apes and humans have to all 'sing from the same hymn sheet', who will determine what the music and words of that hymn are? Who dictates what is in and what is out in this 'multicultural blending'? Living in so-called harmony is *NOT* some 'intuitive, natural' thing -- someone is going to lead, lots of someones are going to follow and that is just the way things are -- and any film that ignores this is just pushing another insipid 'feel-good' fairy story.(2) I object to the insults to men. Both the woman scientist who is in charge of the genetically-modified apes on the ship and Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), the woman-ape 'human rights' activist, make comments about men either being insensitive or making women miserable. It's a sure bet that no such comments would have been allowed if they were to have been made about women. When is Hollywood going to give up its love affair with feminism? When is it going to see that films that contain such insulting material drive men and women -- and I am a woman -- away?(3) The plot, such as it was is a mish-mash. This film could have gone the straight-forward science fiction route, or gone down the path of satire, but instead, it is neither one nor the other. All that happens is that the pilot, Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), goes from one pointless bit of so-called action to another. The plot is also riddled with illogic. Certainly I don't expect films to be completely logical or even mostly so, but I do expect them to have at least a passing acquaintance with logic. How in the blue blazes did horses get on the planet? If the apes are so non-technological, how did they get the armour they wear and how do they manage to build houses and other things? How did the apes even manage to dominate the planet if they are terrified of water?(4) The ending is idiotic. Yes, I know there are x number of possible explanations for Davidson going back in time to Earth to find an 'Ape' Lincoln statue and a world populated by apes, but so what? Certainly I don't want a film to tell me everything -- I want to read between the lines -- but I want some lines, just a few, between which to read. It is clear this 'surprise' ending was just tacked on for the shock effect. It didn't even shock me, though, it just bored me.(5) The acting was boring, boring, boring. Does anyone ever bother to portray a character these days, instead of a few traits labelled 'hero' and 'villain'? The human characters, including Davidson, haven't even the depth and presence of onion skin paper. The apes are just plain silly, and that includes General Thade (Tim Roth). So what if the make-up makes the men look like apes of some sort? It takes acting to make a man into an ape, and acting was clearly beyond anyone in this film.(6) The atmosphere was as bland as low-quality white bread (the type sold so that the masses can always afford something that at least looks bread-like). Part of this is down to the sets, which were surprisingly uninteresting and even minimalist for such a big budget film. Funny thing is that in the low-budget European films of the sixties and early seventies, the sets, although clearly crude, managed to convey a wonderful sense of time and place. It is clear that today's sets are just bad money thrown after a lack of imagination.(7) The 'action' sequences were boring. What I wouldn't give to see a film with the flair for violence that the Spaghetti Westerns had. If there's a fight, I want to see some blood, some guts, some death and pain. The fight sequence at the end looked as if the humans and apes were just slugging it out in a Saturday night pub fight, and a nice, mannerly fight at that. Grown chimpanzees are said to be strong enough to rip a human's arm out of its socket. That would have made a good scene. And why in the world did Davidson wait until after the apes started recovering from the effects of the explosion to tell the humans to go out kill them? The whole point of stunning your enemy is so that you can slit his throat while he is helpless. Doesn't anyone know anything about fighting dirty these days?This list isn't comprehensive: I almost certainly have left out other reprehensible bits. I can't be bothered, however, to make a complete list. Let's face it, this film is a waste of time and money.</fullReview>

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, they should have casted Kevin Costner so you would have been warned. The story is totally uninspired, you don't care about the humans or the apes. Another thing than happens to often in modern Hollywood movies is that they spent all their money and energy on technical stuff and forget about storyline and character development.

		<fullReview>'Planet of the Apes' is yet another example of Tim Burton´s excellent director skills. When Burton gives us a movie we can be sure not to get another Hollywood show of their big special effects. Instead we get a movie where the superb effects are just minor details that support the story´s substance.Burton´s "remake" of 'Planet of the Apes' is as surprising as the first because the story is different. Yet the themes are the same: racism and equality being the most important. Another theme in the movie is the complexity of time travel that Burton deals with in the same way as e.g. ex-Python Terry Gilliam did in '12 Monkeys'.The apes are outstanding e.g. because of their walk and their interactions in general. Another thing I truly love about this movie is that the music score has been kept in the same stile as the score in the original Planet of the Apes.All in all an exceptional movie that is a must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a bad film! I like to think of myself as a Tim Burton fan. However, I feel that when he gets a big budget, his work suffers. Ed Wood was his lowest budgeted film and was by far his greatest work. "Mars Attacks" and this "Ape" movie both had big budgets and were really horrible. Someone needs to tell Hollywood, that when you revisit a classic story, bring something new to the story. Special effects alone is not enough. I believe that Hollywood thought that by just having more elaborate costumes and apes, they would have a better movie, wrong! The story was just paper thin and the script was one of the worst ever. The first hour of this film was just a bunch of campy jokes. I have never seen more uninspired performances. However, to be fair, the actors had nothing to work with. The story is just patched together. Few characters are developed or have any importance. Man, this was a bad film. However, people will consider it a smash hit, because of the box office totals. However, most of the money taken in by this film was in the first week, so the negative word of mouth had not gotten out yet. This film has dropped like a rock since week one. Let's hope that Burton can return to actually telling a story and a weird story at that. That was one thing this film was missing, there was no "Burton Weirdness" anywhere. Bland and boring. * out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great use of humor in here. I don't know why people think the script is bad. I thought the ending was better than the original because Leo, unlike Taylor is in immediate danger. If it doesn't make sense to some of you, why don't you take time to interpret? Remember, the ship Thade gets stuck in may still be of help to him. I don't want to give away my interpretation of the ending, you people better start thinking for yourselves. All I could say is you can't forget that time travel is very possible in this movie. Both this POTA and BTTF have their main characters find something changed when they get back their times. I like the adrenaline-pumping plot. The dabbling of humor in it also helps. It dips just enough into the animal-human relations(and relations within the same species) to prevent distorting the plot. OK, it's not possible for Thade and Ari to speak with British accents if their ancestors learned English from Americans but who cares about small mistakes like that?</fullReview>

I would recommend this film to anyway who always likes to know what is going to happen in the next 10-30 minutes every 10-30 minutes. Make up and effects are as you would expect, superb. Also Estella Warren plays the part of a "wild" slave girl brilliantly and the guy who plays Thade...well. Nothing short of brilliance in a all round not too good film. You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film (bearing in mind the point of this is to fall off and get concussion so you DONT have to see the whole film) and as one last piece of advice. Leave 5 minutes before the end of the film. It's too obvious anyway and it's down right confusing unless you happen to follow the whole film. Overall, not too good, but had the potential to be a hit. Shame really considering all the originals were masterpieces...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this version did not try to be as thought provoking as the original, I enjoyed it as an action-adventure version of basically the same story. The makeup by Rick Baker is amazing and the CGI effects are used well. You can hardly tell they're there at all. Tim Roth practically steals the show as General Thade. My quibbles: Mark Wahlberg wasn't the best choice for the lead. Burton should've cast someone a little older, with a little more presence. George Clooney perhaps. The humans being able to speak in this version (as oppossed to the mutes in the original) added nothing to the story as they really had nothing interesting to say. All in all, a fun time at the movies. Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I spent a long time reading review's of new new Planet Of The Apes here at IMDB. I got the general impression that this movie was a waste of time. Yes, Estella Warren spent the entire movie uselessly pouting with those inappropriately glossed lips. Yes, Mark Wahlberg was not nearly as dynamic and emotional as would be expected for someone crash landing on to a strange planet to find himself suddenly faced with ape-rule.However, I still enjoyed the movie very much. Tim Roth as Thade was a powerhouse, Bonham Carter was good and Michael Clarke Duncan as General Attar was perfectly cast. He actually made a very funny quote which I read about in a newspaper. He said "when my agent called me about a part in this movie, I knew I wasn't gonna be no human!"Anyway back to my comment... this is an entertaining movie, yes it is. Purists, please stop this quest for perfection, it doesn't exist, not anymore anyway. Entertainment is what matters. Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston is brilliant, and emotionally stirring, but it is history. Appreciate it, but move on. Please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i feel like i am the only person who "got it" SPOILER ALERT!the problem with alot of the reviewers is they dont get this movie. this is a time travel movie... all of the ships come out in a different time. notice that the main ship is on the planet 4 generations before mark wahlbergs landing, at the begining of time on earth, populating the earth with humans and genetically enhanced apes, who eventually become dominate over humans, changing the history of earth for all time. ( making a statement about genetically enhanced anything). Mark shows up, then at the end the monkey shows up. now they were DEFINATELY ON EARTH!!! changing the history of earth again by showing the apes that they need to live with man in harmony to gain their ability for technology. it gets into theology about man messing with gods plan and paying a price. then when Mark goes back to earth to the same year it was when he left the Oberon, it is to the earth with it's altered history. it is all there ari said it before he left " someday they will tell this story and some will say it is just a fable." that is the setup for the end sequence. you have to read between the lines and read the inscription behind thade/lincoln at the end. Thade became known through telling of the story, as the great emancipator of humans. it was all there you just had to put it together. the apes could not use technology, so he had to had to have landed in a world that has humans and apes living together hence the hybrid people shown in closeup. burton is a master storyteller, and because he made people think they say the movie is bad. the acting is teriffic.... mark is just trying to get back to the ship ignoring all else. the reluctant hero, this no buisness of his... was this not obvious? this is the best SF movie i have seen in along time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of Planet of the Apes was obviously not supposed to be like the mature Heston version. The original version had more dialogue in which acting ability was so important. But the old version also moved along at a rapid pace. This version played more like an action version but was also very good. Tim Burton for the first time seems to draw the audience in to the movie unlike his previous films which seemed more rock video. Burton is sure to make many more films and has greatly improved from Sleepy Hollow. I saw this film twice and with the second viewing certain details become more understandable. It is interesting to see how the apes seemed to have imitated human culture. Burton has the apes doing all the things humans do even saying grace. But the ape's have no deeper understanding of anything. If you see the film you will understand. I believe Burton has the apes more as a creation from humans and not an evolved species. The first film has the apes emerge out of a human created disaster of nuclear war. This film treats the creation of apes in a unique way.I have heard more long debates about this film than any other film of the Summer. As far as all the criticism of the ending, it seemed much more clear the second time. SPOILER: I think it was more of a beginning than an ending. And if you look on the plaque you will see the name Thade. Perhaps in the next one we will see a battle by humans to retake a new technologically advanced ape world. SPOILER: Whatever, it may be that the ending may be another example of apes having imitated the human world by finding books. Bring on Apes 2 especially with pretty pouty Bonham in it. Lets put Angelina Jolie in it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the film was good. I did not really have any preconceived notions other than the "Burton" touch. His films are usually dark but beautiful spectacles in my opinion.Sometimes I wonder why people take movie plots so seriously.In the original, a lot of political statements were made (not unusual for Sci Fi films of that area). It was safe in that genre to make political statements that would be blasted in other genres.The original Planet of the Apes series adequately addressed the issues of the time. What would be the purpose of reiterating it in 2001?I actually liked the plot. It was an interesting take or twist of the original. There was some tongue and cheek dialogue as well. The ending was the kind the either you liked or thought was really corny. I liked the ending though, even if it did catch me off guard.I really liked the movie and would buy the video when it becomes available. I am really happy though, I saw it on the big screen.The choice of actors was excellent, I think Tim Roth stole the show, he was so convincing and seemed to enjoy every minute. I was impressed with the good job that all the actors did. It did not look easy.I wonder what Tim Burton will do next. He is truly an artist.</fullReview>

The space station just happens to crash land a couple of days ride from Markys crash site. 3. When he leaves the planet, three moons are visible suggesting to me he wasn't on earth. 4. All the apes speak English with american accents - fair enough the space station was manned by Americans - but how many generations had passed up to when our hero makes his appearance. Human english has changed alot in the last thousand years. 5. Ok, so the space storm spits out objects at random intervals in time. The space chimp sure chose his moment anyway. A hairy 'Deux Ex Machina' (sorry if I spelt that wrong!) 6. Oooch! People seem to fly about the place, flung by angry apes then just get up again, particularily Mr Whalberg. A gorilla can rip a mans arm off easily.Ok, I'll stop there. I just had the feeling Burton thought, this is Sci-fi, they will buy anything, so I can do whatever I want to push the plot along. I like Mark Whalberg - but he didn't come out very well in this film. The young boy falling under his horse was soooo predictible - we all groaned. Charlton repeating the last lines from the origional was a nice touch though. The other human characters may as well not been there, for all the difference they made. Unlike the book, or even the origional film, this was pretty brainless. Still, It had its moments and clever touches, I thought, and although we only had glimpses of the ape society (which is what the book focuses on), and the film focused on 'hero-on-the-run' action, I would still recommend it, if only for Tim Roth - the antithesis of a PG Tips Chimp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flaws aplenty, but entertaining nonetheless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!! First, I just wanted to say that I haven't yet had the opportunity to see the 1968 version and I'm not one of those people who prefer remakes over originals just because "the effects are better".Anyway.. what can I say about this movie? I'll start on the positive side of things. It was very entertaining and seemed to actually have a bit of intelligence behind it, a rare (but welcome) combination in modern Hollywood. The makeup and special effects were absolutely stunning. The apes looked and moved like apes, yet effectively had the human characteristic of being able to distinguish the characters through face recognition. It made a great combination. This great imagery was backed up by impressive looking sets. Watching the two connect together, it was hard to believe these were human actors in ape costumes acting on a studio set, you get the full impression of a real world. The cast were good enough, Mark was convincing as a lost and puzzled human, the rest of the humans were appropriately primitive-like, Carter portrayed the human-sympathising Ari well and.. well Tim Roth as Thade.. he stole the show every time he appeared, his portrayl of the character echoed frustration and anger and his voice was more than appropriate. The film also had a well suited soundtrack, provided by music magic man, Danny Elfman. The direction throughout this movie was also very strong and of the usual Burton quality.Anyway, onto the bad stuff. There were countless plot problems and issues that weren't explained either fully enough or not at all. The apes rode horses.. however, where these horses came from was unexplained. Mark kisses that blonde woman at the end (whose character is so insignificant, her name isn't even worth remembering) even though he only said about three words to her throughout the whole film, I have no idea.. was there supposed to be some sort of love triangle thing going on with Mark, Ari and the blonde? The part near the end with the chimp arriving in his pod was so coincidental that it just seemed completely unbelievable. The apes were scared of water, for some bizarre reason they couldn't swim, even though they are physically superior to humans. The apes are unable to cross water because they can't swim, so why can't they build a boat? I'm sure there were other plot issues too, but those are the only ones that I can remember. Now onto my comment on the ending, which, if you've seen the film is probably the part you've been waiting for. I warn you, if you haven't seen the movie, then do yourself a favour, don't read the paragraph below, it will completely spoil the almost remote chance that the ending will shock you in a positive manner.Three words: what, the, hell? I've questioned myself over and over about how this ending could make any possible sense whatsoever. As Mark's pod landed and he walked up to the Lincoln statue I thought to myself "Hehe.. it would be funny if we find out that Mark's world is now inhabited by apes.. but then again.. the writers aren't that stupid.. are they?". I actually felt quite gutted the moment where we saw the statue's face, because the rest of the story (despite the plot problems mentioned) actually made sense. I've since heard lot's of interesting theories, but they've all had some sort of reason for not being correct. The most popular theory was that Thade repairs Leo's space pod and goes back through time to Earth and edits the world. First of all, Leo's pod is underwater and apparently the apes can't swim, so it is unaccessible to Thade. Also, even if Thade could get the pod, the apes don't have the technology to repair it. The pod was only big enough to fit Thade in, how could just one ape make such a difference? Finally, if apes did inhabit Earth instead of humans.. what would be the chance of the apes building a city exactly the same as Washington DC with a Thade memorial looking exactly the same as the Lincoln memorial? Pretty damn slim to say the least.Anyway, final verdict: entertaining, but too many plot problems and an appalling ending. If the movie ended the second that Mark's pod takes off at the end, my overall opinion would have been better, let's just hope a sequel will come our way and remedy all our frustrations about that ending. Rating: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apes Rule Once Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What took so long to re-make this 68 sci-fi classic? I had been expecting it since the early 90's! From reading the reviews, however, I get the feeling that it was probably only me who made that prediction. Why did I predict or even insisted that there would be a re-make of Planet Of The Apes? Well, for one thing, I believed that the advanced cinema techniques could add so much flavour to the original screenplay, which was superbly revolutionary (please read my review for the original Planet Of The Apes 68' to see why I consider the original screenplay to be "revolutionary"). I have always thought that the original Planet Of The Apes was full of imaginative thoughts but it lacked juicy action scenes that could have made it even more fun to watch (however even this drawback didn't stop it from becoming a classic sci-fi, probably the best of its genre). The other reason why I expected a re-make was because I wanted to see my most favourite sci-fi saga being re-imagined, as director Tim Burton put it. My Vote: 7/10Things I liked about the movie: In contrast to other people, I liked the screenplay. In fact, I thought that it was brilliant. It was probably the best screenplay that could have been written for this movie without the "it-was-earth-all-along" concept that shocks the audience in the 68' version. I was as much amused by the twists in the end, as I was amused when I watched the original 68' version. Even the last 4-5 minutes were such a great enjoyment. I honestly think the screenplay works. But as much as it works, screenplay was not the best thing about the movie. I personally think that there are mainly two things about this movie that left me in complete amazement, 1) Tim Roth's performance and 2) The original score of the movie, both of which well deserve Oscar Nomination. Tim Roth was the only REAL APE in the movie; the rest were just humans under ape costumes. Tim Roth was the only one who really gave his character an identity. He was not just an ape; he was an ape with a personality. The rest of the cast couldn't even manage to act or even look like apes, except for their costumes, of course. The original score was totally mind-blowing. It is a musical expression of what's going on in the movie. Marvellous achievement!Things I didn't like about the movie: In contrast what other people think, I thought that the apes were too human. They were humans under ape costumes. Most of them didn't even try to act or move like an ape (except for Tim Roth). Obviously, they thought that wearing an ape costume was enough. I could puke at the dinner scene when the elderly ape character was speaking: he was just TOO HUMAN. And again, in contrast what other people think, I wasn't satisfied with the make up. Well, for one thing, the cast put too much trust in their make-ups; they didn't make the slightest effort to give themselves an ape-like personality (a couple of scenes showing them hanging upside down from the ceilings or trees don't redeem that - if they are ape enough to do that then how come they are so much human when talking?). Secondly, the make up in the original version was as good as it could get; it was revolutionary in its time. That's why, there was nothing revolutionary about the make ups in this one. Briefly, it was not better than the make ups in the original 68' version. Lastly, I saw a couple of flaws in the make up. For one thing, the one ape character -the one who sells humans as gifts- hadn't had his eyelids painted; every time he closed his eyes, his eyelids would look white (am I the only one who saw that?). Some of the actors' upper teeth had ape-like appearance, whereas their lower level teeth were obviously human-like. What about the hair of Ari (Helena Bonham Carter)? It looked like she had hair done in a beauty salon; it was too human. And her make up was terribly cheap, as if she was a little girl who didn't know how to put a make up. Maybe, Tim Burton wanted to give story a different respective with these ideas on purpose. But honestly, I don't think they work. My last criticism is the inappropriate sense of humour, which has become the disease of Hollywood in recent years. Directors must be very careful about the timing and the nature of the humour otherwise they spoil the whole movie. There are some silly jokes that work perfectly fine in the genre of comedy (Rush Hour, American Pie, Jim Carrey / Eddie Murphy kind of comedies and the like). But when you use jokes out of these movies in a movie that has a totally different personality, it spoils it. Within that respect, I have found the scene where the elderly ape character is taking his fake teeth out and putting into a jar absolutely inappropriate. Other then these flaws, the movie was a perfect re-make of an old sci-fi classic. Possible Academy Awards Nominations: 1) Best Performance By A Leading Actor In A Motion Picture: Tim Roth. 2) The Original Score: Danny Alfman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Else Left Besides Makeup and Effect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem in the Planet of the Apes is that there are no deep feelings within the characters. Leo (Mark Wahlberg) does not care for any of human on the planet of the apes but himself. His goal was just get himself out of the planet as soon as possible. The director knows too well that he is not a hero, that's why he decided to add a scene of heroic rescue of a young boy in the movie. But it doesn't help to make him a better character but too obvious of an effort. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) was a confusing idealistic character that she believes ape and human should be equally live together. But the movie fails to show her feeling when she watches human killing her own kind. Instead of an internal struggle inside her, she just blindly help human beat up her own people. And the third main character, Daena (Estella Warren) she was just a pretty figure follows Leo everywhere until the end. It's not her fault that she couldn't act, it's the movie doesn't give her any chance to act. It was a failure when Leo farewells to Ari and Daena in the end, there's nothing there to drive the audiences to any feeling. It's as if we watch some stranger say goodbye?They could have brought up much more than this. They could use the scene when Ari heard about how human treat Apes on Earth (lock in the zoo) as an ironic moral in the movie. But they didn't go further? Everyone agree that the makeup in this movie is awesome. There's no doubt about that. But beside the makeup, Tim Burton directed nothing shine in this remake of sci-fi classic.Everyone agree that the makeup in this movie is awesome, but beside the makeups, there's nothing shine in this remake of sci-fi classic.HinxLinx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm gutted, one of my all time favourite movies ?Planet of the Apes' is to be remade by one of my favourite directors ?Tim Burton' at last a film to really look forward to. Oh dear! What's with these filmmakers, why do they seem to pay no attention to the story and script? Planet of the Apes (2001) is a stunning piece of film work with great make-up, effects (a few actors aside) an excellent cast.The first half of the movie is entertaining and builds well though it doesn't take a genius to work out where the story going. The second half comes across as though they ran out of time and were not sure which way to take the movie. Because this it becomes farcical! It looks like they panicked, the problem is the original movie is a classic and easily stands the test of time, the end, still a very powerful image. They concentrate of trying to replicate (in a different way) this but it's desperate. If you're going to see this film try to forget about the original and just enjoy it as a different film. This is difficult because they insist on repeating the classic lines from the first movie. I suppose they were trying to be funny, it was funny but for the wrong reasons. Planet of the Apes is an entertaining movie that does not carry much impact Michael Clark Duncan is big, Mark Wahlberg is good, and Tim Roth is great, though given the costume, setting and make-up not a difficult task! People will not be watching this film in thirty years. Yet another disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all: I'm a HUGE fan of the original 1968 POTA. And this is not a remake of that movie. It's simply a reinvention of the same story, filtered through the eyes of one of the most creative Hollywood directors. Everything in this show work in a perfect way: the screenplay is inventive and brilliant. All the performers gave their best, in particularly Tim Roth portraing the main villain, General Thade, and Helena Bonham Carter under the make-up of the kind chimp Ari. Costumes, art direction, special effects are amazing! Great part of the success of this film is due to the wonderful make-up effects by the genial wizardy of Rick Baker and the complex score composed by the talent of the sublime Maestro Danny Elfman. Main titles (music and images together) are simply astonishing! Absolutely a must see by all the fans of fantastic cinema. Rating: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations from Tim Burton's new film, hoping his unique genius would improve upon the dated preachiness of the 1968 original, but, alas, I was greatly disappointed. Of course, this is a high-class action movie and the apes' looks and movement are quite stunning, but the plot is so corny and juvenile. As for the ending, I don't see any difficulty in understanding it (although I'm not going to spoil it to anyone), it is just a pointless twist on the 1968 ending. And Back to the Future I-II handled time-traveling paradoxes so much better. Acting is quite horrible, with Helena Bonham-Carter as her usual pathetic self, underneath all the make up. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not haven't seen the original "Planet of the Apes," I've never been part of the fan club. I wasn't heavily anticipating this remake, like about ninety-percent of the viewing public. In fact, I predicted it would suck. For some reason, I'm not a sucker for all these big-budget Hollywood summer blockbusters. I thought I'd feel the same way about this movie as I did with that borefest "The Mummy Returns." Even action movies can put me to sleep, if flashy special f/x is the only fuel to keep them going. But as it turns out fifty-percent of the time, the movies I least anticipate are the ones I end up liking quite a bit. First of all, it's directed by Tim Burton. I've always been fond of his work (minus "Mars Attacks"). Just like most of his movies, he creates a creepy atmosphere that deeply engages you--sometimes on a conscious level, sometimes on a subconscious level. And also like most of his movies, he adds a nice touch of humor. Some of the humor's pretty silly and obvious and some it's pretty subtle. Whatever route he took, it often worked. The ape costumes are amazingly realistic and the set designs are very impressive. Also we have the great Danny Elfman who composed a great score to help intensify the creepy atmosphere.The premise is quite nifty. A planet run by apes, where the apes rule and the humans are enslaved and put to work and even treated as pets. That I found very interesting. The premise is handled nicely, and it was amusing--sometimes hilarious--to see apes take on a human persona. Playing card games, running shops, etc.In the comic relief department, we have Paul Giamatti who takes on the bumbling henchman role. Just like his enormously impressive debut as Pig Vomit in Howard Stern's "Private Parts" he is absolutely hilarious. Now, my mother saw this movie before me, so she pointed out that Charlton Heston had a cameo appearance. Watching the film and seeing his name absent in the closing credits, I wasn't sure who he played. I had a hunch he played Thade's father, and I was right. The hint that sorta gave it away was when he quotes his famous "Damn you all to hell" speech on his deathbed. I wonder if others caught on that it was Heston in that cameo, because I don't hear much buzz about it. The story's not topnotch. This is overall shallow, predictable entertainment, but it works. I enjoyed it a lot more than expected, though it dragged at points (especially in the third act) and went on a little long. Tim Roth is great as the villain. If I didn't check the credits, I wouldn't have known it was him. He didn't even use his British accent (something he's amazingly good at covering up). And behind all that makeup, he's almost completely unrecognizable. Though I haven't seen the original, I'm pretty sure Heston played a much better hero than Mark Wahlberg. I don't think Wahlberg's a bad actor. It's just, he's one of those actors who doesn't seem to go the whole nine yards for his craft. He speaks in a moderately monotone voice, and never seems to have much substance behind his performances (even in his acclaimed role as Dirk Diggler in "Boogie Nights"). He's good in this movie, but they could've cast a better lead. Someone with a more commanding presence. Please keep in mind I didn't see the 1968 version, so I might be a little sweet on this remake. After seeing this version, I'm more anxious to check out the old version. I heard a lot of buzz about this movie's ending. Though I didn't think it was a bad way to end things, it was...weird. A little enigmatic. Something you might have to ponder for a while. Though it's nothing as subtle as M. Night Shamalyan's ending for "The Sixth Sense." Tim Burton really did an impressive job, this is another score for him. It's good, fun entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously and leaves sufficient room for comic relief. So I will recommend this movie, but if you're a die-hard fan of the original--please don't get on my case!My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" is dark, macabre, and visually stunning. William Broyles's screenplay is interesting, but the dialogue has it's moments. A dear friend pointed out for me the low point in writing occurs when Leo (Mark Wahlberg) in an attempt to inspire the humans to battle the attacking apes he says "Come on guys! We can take them..." Whoa! Much of "Planet of the Apes" is like that. It has the trademark Burton brooding, dark settings-- great attention to detail. Though the story is in-cohesive and uneven. And there is some killer over-acting, particularly by Tim Roth as General Thade. Mark Wahlberg is okay as stranded astronaut, Leo, who wants to go home. Human activist, Helena Bonham Carter as ape Ari, is convincing in a strange "romantic" role. Liked Cary-Hiroyki Tagawa as Ari's protector, Krull-- the one really heroic character. All the other characters are forgettable. Even with these weaknesses in writing and acting, "Planet of the Apes" is definitely entertaining. It's pretty much an action picture with a slight social context-- very slight. You have great visuals, chases, explosions, and cool looking apes.

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I saw this summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a joke! One of the worst movies I have ever seen! The only thing that kept me from walking out of this nightmare was Estella Warren. Not only do I think Tim Burton has completely lost his originality and independent risk taking but Mark Walburg??? This guy is the most over rated actor to date. Are you kidding me, all he does is breath heavy and talk breathy in every movie he's ever in. My rating for this flick would be GARBAGE if there was one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad taste in your mouth..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often that I find a movie that I literally wanted to walk out of during the film. This movie just happens to be one of those movies. Mark Walhberg was not the cause of this movie to stink, nor was it the acting in general. I liked the acting and the special effects. However, the story and script should never had made it past the producers. In fact, I am surprised the ink in the pen wanted to write it out. This whole story does nothing but tarnish the original movies good name. I literally, as soon as I left the cinema went and rented the original Planet of the Apes to wash the bad taste this one left in my mouth.Let's compare the new movie to the old;Actors: Charlton Heston &amp; Mark WalhbergWhile Hestons brand of acting may not appeal to all, it IS brilliant acting. Mark Walhberg is an up and coming star, this is true, but for him to rise to the level that Heston sits upon, Mark is going to have to start looking for some seriously good scripts and take some more acting lessons, maybe even from Heston himself. ADVANTAGE: OriginalSupporting Ape Cast Old &amp; Supporting Ape Cast NewApes are Apes but there are aspects from both the new and old films that I liked. The Original movie had Dr.Zira and Dr.Cornelius and who could forget Dr.Zaius, who were all pretty great characters which added a lot of character interaction and development for Hestons character(Taylor). While the new movie has Ari? An Ape with a serious case of the hots for Walhbergs character(Leo). ADVANTAGE: OriginalSupporting Human Cast Old &amp; Supporting Human Cast NewBased on the fact that the original only had Linda Harrison as Nova, I have to give the advantage for this class to the new movie. ADVANTAGE: New MovieSpecial Effects:While the old has some fantastic sites where they shot the film, we do have to give the new movie the advantage in the special effects department. The only thing I really did not like where the Gorillas that were leaping distances of 30 or so feet. Advantage: New MovieStory:Well this is the big kahuna. The old movie had an amazing script. The new movie was geared too much towards quick action where the old movie was a lot of character development with enough action to keep it interesting. After watching the new movie there were definite aspects that I really would have liked to see in the old movie. Such as the fact that the Apes were using primitive weaponry. Makes sense. Also they lived in the trees, again.. makes sense. I was very dissappointed when the humans in the new movie opened their mouths and could speak perfect english. WOW, it's actually very difficult to see, at least in my point of view, how the apes could regard humans, that can speak just as eloquent english as they.. AS SAVAGES. Or question whether or not they have souls?? Hello?!?! I thought the whole reason they were "savages" was because they could not be taught, were stupid and were almost neanderthalic in behavior. What I saw in the new movie was an excuse to have at least a few more characters for Walhberg to talk to since they did not have the character interacton with the Apes. I liked the idea or Thade.. but he was just a tad bit too insane for my liking, then again, maybe there just wasn't enough character developement for me to like him. Overall.. ADVANTAGE: OriginalIn short, this movie is a waste of time, don't see it, don't rent it, don't buy it. I give it 4 thumbs down</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a fan of the original Planet of the Apes and all of its sequels, which told a fairly convincing story. This new version blows all of my expectations away. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was terrible and if we ignore the little facts (like how easily Ari let herself be lead by humans or how Daena has lipstick and a boobjob on this planet), the overall plot made no sense. This movie was made to have a sequel, because there was no explanation of why earth was exactly as it is now, just with apes. All in all, DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike the original which is good.... but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>but it's a very weak story with unremarkable special effects and full of gaping holes. Which is bad. Very very bad.I went in expecting a good movie that would live up to the name of the franchise, despite the presence of Burton in the director's chair.I cannot believe a story resembling an early draft and not much more than a comedy sketch in someone else's production would have received final approval and the go-ahead by an entire studio.When it's available on video (DVD), watch this along with the original 1968 Apes. If you care for nothing more than MTV special effects, maybe you'll come away with a distaste for the original. But if you value any type of consistency and plausible story, in an implausible world, then the newest Apes movie will leave you wanting a lot more. Not even Helena Bonham Carter nor Tim Roth, both whom put forth excellent performances, could save this picture. Paul Giamatti was brilliant - his performance might have been a little too comedic over-all, but again, that was a problem with the writing. His performance was stellar. Mark Wahlberg has chosen far better roles in the past.Ah, Burton signs his name on another ruined production. He certainly has earned his over-rated respect directing this type of swiss-cheesed fluff. The picture does nothing to advance the state of cinematography or story telling. It adds an easily forgettable movie to the Apes line-up. If nothing else, at least a sequel, with someone else handling direction, doesn't stand much chance of being any worse.POTA-2001 earns a solid (1) rating. Wahlberg offers a one liner which would sum this picture. I'm only paraphrasing... "you shouldn't send apes to do a man's job" - and that there points to one of the biggest holes in the entire story. No spoilers though. Watch it for your own opinion, but do yourselves the favor of going in expecting very little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very bad. First of all, Mark Wahlberg phoned this one in, and I can't blame him. His character never showed any real concern with the plot, his only concern was to get back to his ship. That is fine, but when the storyline (macro level -ape vs man, micro level the humans on this planets apparent desire to rebel against the apes) hinges on the hope that he will- he is the humans savior. He doesn't care, and any effort to care seems half hearted at best. The writing is terrible, wasteful and at times just stolen and ba****dized. If we aren't supposed to compare this movie to the original, then why did they steal superb lines from the original and force them into this one? Early in the movie, on the spacestation, one of the scientists tells Wahlbergs character that the female apes are the aggressive ones. I thought at that point there would be a female general on the planet of the apes. Was there? No. Did that line ever come into play? No. So why have it in the movie? It didn't further the plot, it wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it provided nothing at all. Is this nit picking? Perhaps, but it just goes to show how unattached the people making this movie(and films in general) are to the point of cinema. Shakespeare never wasted a word, and here these people are, using millions of dollars to produce a story and they can't even get a quality script written. All this movie is a chase scene, but the end of the battle scene is ridiculous, the only way the writers could save their hero, and the apparent peace that arises between man and ape is forced because no real discussion of the topic occurs. The ending makes no sense, only cents- it is the launching pad for a sequel to try to explain what the hell happened. I'll only touch on the awful directing (hey Burton- why does everything important have to happen when it is dark) and the complete lack of attention to detail (Estella Warren's character was supposed to be the love interest- but the female ape and wahlberg had more chemistry, ape costumes looked just like ape costumes.) Did anyone else notice that at the bottom of the lake in which Marky Marks spaceship crashed was brighter than the dark jungle in which he crashed? Do the fish in that pond have lightbulbs? This movie was the pits- and if fits right in with the rest of the garbage I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible. Special Effects don't make a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I left the theatre wondering what sort of opinion the makers of this film must have of the audience. Do they think we're stupid? Do they think we will accept anything they put on the screen just because it has special effects? What was the point of making this film?Despite being very courageous to even attempt re-making such a popular and well known movie, the perpetrators of this waste of time and effort seem to have forgotten some of the cardinal rules of movie making. It's great to have special effects and lots of make-up artists working for you but a decent screenplay and some talented actors might have helped, too. The actors in this debacle were one dimensional, at best, with the most believable character being that of Pericles. There was little if any development of the characters and there was no hint of the messages found in the original.The worst part of all of this is that the altered ending of the movie opens up the opportunity for a sequel. If it gets made, that's one movie I won't be spending time or money seeing.In summary, this is a thoroughly forgettable movie that deserves no more than the score I gave it: 1/10</fullReview>

That, a lousy story, Elfman's most uninspired soundtrack ever (his music usually rules), recycled lines and lousy and uninspired acting by the actors sums up to a memorable ordeal - of how NOT to make a movie!Add this to the list of horrible summer movies of 2001! Avoid seeing this film, it's not worth the ticket! Treat yourself to the original Planet of the Apes or any previous Tim Burton project instead, by renting or buying them on DVD... Whatever you do, don't give them a reason to do a sequel on this crap - and they will, if enough people see it! I give this movie 2/10. Why not 1/10?

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes Tim Burton-style is a disappointment. It's a good film, but I have learned to expect more from Burton than just 'good'. As with all Burton-films though, Planet of the Apes is visually stunning. Costumes, make-up (brilliant!), the production design, the cinematography... Simply amazing. However, the script is seriously lacking pace in the first half hour and the ending is an abomination! One of the worst movie endings in years. Doesn't stand a chance in comparison with the ending in the first Planet of the Apes. After the slow beginning, the movie builds up nicely to a final battle scene, which is great, but that ending... My, my... What a mistake.In a fine cast (though Mark Wahlberg is a bit boring) Tim Roth is certainly the stand-out. He delivers a great performance as Thade.In short, an entertaining sci-fi adventure which is let down by a silly ending and a slow start. Visuals are stunning and well worth the admission price.Could have been such a great film... (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film. I went in pumped up but left feeling disappointed because I probably expected too much. They did a good job distancing themselves from the original film. This film has a surprise ending that's not as good as the one in the original (which is my favourite ending in ANY film) but is still very nightmarish. Unfortunately this movie's mid section drags mercilessly and I wanted to leave the theatre. It starts off very well and ends well in the last 40 minutes or so but about 45 minutes in the middle of the film is just plain bland. Mark Wahlberg wasn't well casted. I didn't buy him as an astronaut and adventurer at all. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and especially Tim Roth all have their characters nailed down perfectly. Roth's General Thade may be one of the top five villains in movie history. The savage nature of his portrayal made him a great sadist and the make-up spoke a lot for him as well. Rick Baker could earn another Oscar for his make-up work but Tim Burton was not the man to direct such heavy material. Burton is good for decorative pop culture stuff found in comic books ('Batman') or heavy indoor and artsy production design stuff like 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' or 'Beetlejuice' but somehow he just couldn't get me excited enough to embrace this remake of a legendary motion picture.</fullReview>

The script they're forced to use is chockablock with utterances such as "I'm sick of this human" which kicks off the key battle scene. And, simply "Gotta go," as Leo (Mark Whalberg) bids adieu to his gorgeous model Daena (Estella Warren). Maybe the only reason to see it is to try to puzzle through the twisty ending.

Not just the time shift but the whole evolution of monkeys into something more. If in the thousadn years or so that the monkeys had become dominate then why had the humans not also changed? Wouldnt the humans be a lot smaller and dumber? And all the perfect teath in the movie?If you have to see it wait for the video to go into the $.99 special of the week section.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Instinct, this should be studied for years to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning! May contain spoilers.What I have always found incredibly funny and yet at the same time downright scary about us as human beings is our ability to be so stupid and so cruel at the same time. We are the best at cruelty. As far as I know, we are the only species that hunts for sport and kills for pleasure. Everything else in the animal kingdom does so for it's very survival. When lions hunt gazelle, it is to feed their young or to feed themselves. Even the fearsome and loathed Great White Shark hunts and kills for it's very survival. But human beings are nothing but charlatan when it comes to our apparent benevolence. Not all of us of course, but a good majority of us. Even myself, who I consider to be somewhat of an animal lover, will go out and eat the latest slaughtered cow from the supermarket and I can justify that because in mind, that cow has been killed more humanely than a pig ( which I will not eat, have you ever seen the way a pig is killed at a Portuguese barbecue, well it is even worse when it is killed for mass consumption ). Human beings are not magnanimous in the least. We take what we desire, not what is necessary. That makes us gluttonous and that is unacceptable. But no one does anything about it because we are used to living the way that we do and for some reason, we have laws and human rights for criminals ( including rapists, murderers, child molesters and arsonists). But we have very little regard for our next meal and how it dies. Doesn't anyone else out there think it is inhumane to boil a live animal before you eat it? Well?I begin this review of Planet of the Apes with this sanctimonious "holier than thou" sermon because I think this film and the writers do think about these things. Planet of the Apes is a great action film and has some outstanding special effects but the core of the film is one that is perhaps overlooked. This is a film about man's comeuppance and what would happen if another species could do to us what do to them. Battlefield Earth, as awful as it was, touched briefly on this subject matter. Instinct, the under-rated film starring Anthony Hopkins was also critical of man and our abuse of not only this planet but the inhabitants of it. See also the Matrix and even Free Willy. Sometimes movies come out and have outlandish theories and sometimes they thrive at the box office. This is going to be one of those films. But people do not often advocate change after they see these films. They makes hundreds of millions of dollars but that is all they do. They entertain. But maybe films like this are about more than entertainment. Maybe there is a message that Burton and company want us to hear. Maybe what we are watching is not just about entertainment.Spoilers ahead!!!What was fascinating about this film is that the theory that it subscribes to is that this ape world would not have gotten as bad as it did if it wasn't for human beings. When captain Leo Davidson ( Mark Wahlberg ) lands on this distant planet, he travels through time hundreds of years. He is immediately thrust into a chase involving humans and super intelligent and herculian apes. He is captured and brought to their camp and here he learns that the world has been ruled by the apes for years now. He can't understand this because not an hour earlier he was on a his ship that used animals to try and figure out complex problems and to basically use them as guinea pigs. When there is a dangerous mission to embark on, they would send out the monkeys first to see what the danger was. If the monkey did not survive the ordeal, then their human soldiers would not go. So this is a great shock to Davidson. When he asks the humans how the monkeys got like this, they don't understand what he means. To them, it has always been like this.The apes, lead by Thade and his right hand ape, Colonel Attar, rule with an iron fist and want to rid the planet of the humans. They enslave them and put them to work. But there are human rights activists that think the ethical treatment of humans should be advocated by all so for now the humans are allowed to live. But most of them live on the outskirts of the world, cowered in little huts or caves and living like rats. There is great detail that goes into reversing the fortunes of man as we are used as pets. We are chained up at night and kept in cages and it is even a far fetched theory for the apes to believe that we have souls. Humans are also branded like horses and are forced to wear the mark. This is a little like Naziism but more like humanism.Aside from all of the politics of the film, it has to be said that it is a treat to watch strictly from an entertainment form. Burton never lets us down with the action sequences and the team of art directors, costume designers and make-up artists should be nominated for Oscars this year. Rick Baker leads the team of make-up artists and his work here is absolutely incredible. Actors, and that is plural, meaning hundreds of actors, spent six hours in the make-up chair ever day. But it pays off as the apes look fantastic. Michael Clarke Duncan was the most impressive to me. He transformed wonderously into Attar and even though it is not the kind of performance that you would say is Oscar material, it certainly is fun to watch. Others that should get mentioned for their work is costume designer Colleen Atwood. She too should be remembered at Oscar time. The set decorators, Rosemary Brandenburg and Peter Young, created a wonderfully dark and sinister home for the apes from the ground up. It is truly remarkable to see the village and realize that it was once nothing but a vision on some scrap piece of paper.Planet of the Apes is an excellent film in all areas. It is entertaining, action packed, littered with humour and it is a great summer film. It is actually the perfect pastiche of a summer film. It has all the ingredients. But to me it is much more. This is a smart film and it has a little more on it's mind that just talking monkeys. It would be interesting to see a film like this produce more than just hundreds of millions of dollars for 20th Century Fox. It would be nice to see someone out there take a film like this and truly re-examine how we are to the species that we depend upon and for our very survival and abuse in the process. It would be interesting, but impossible. After all, we are human.8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This updated version reverts to the clash of warring parties and focuses more on ape authenticity, then the more intimate original version which focused more on the individual diversity and complex interaction between man and ape. The silent humans in the original version gave the movie a much more dramatic feel. The original ending was one of the best stunners in the league of "The Sixth Sense," and "The Crying Game." The original held much more of sci-fi instead of the usual us versus them wargames. The original was more thrilling, mysterious, and scary, ominously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this would be easier if you all knew about time paradoxes like in Star Trek. Don't stop reading because I mention Star Trek. Here goes: (One thing you have to know first, when Mark goes through this storm in space, he thinks he is taken to another planet, when he is really taken to another time on his). If you remember, when he was crash-landing on the "other planet" (Earth), his digital calendar was moving the years ahead very quickly. He was going into the future. The space-station he came from was pulled in too but not at the same time as him. The space-station got pulled into a time 1,000's of years before him. That space-station was carrying many genetically enhanced chimps. When that station landed (crashed), the apes got out, killed the humans and populated the planet. Since, Mark was sent to a time ahead of that, the apes had already evolved (genetically enhanced). So, they evolved. Remember, this is Earth. Remember that at the end when Mark locks the General in that room he doesn't kill him. So, after Mark leaves to go back to what he thinks is his planet, but is really another time, the General escapes and still has his armies so he exterminates the humans. Mark goes through the time portal and really instead of going to what he thinks is Earth, he goes ahead in time even farther, to where the apes have evolved into a society like ours. The statue (Abraham Lincoln) is of the General because he saved the planet for the apes (by exterminating the humans).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth my time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" reminds me of one of those times when I had no idea what to expect of myself.Was I going to like the movie?Was I going to hate the movie?I waited anxiously for the release of the film,knowing that it was not going to be the best film ever made.Basicly,when I go to see these types of films,I don't worry about the quality of the acting and the directing or it's script.Some people on this website like to watch films with a story and quality performances.That's sensible.I am different.I look at "Planet of the Apes" this way.One,it's a science fiction film.The genre of science fiction takes you anywere your mind takes you.Finally,two.The only purpose these films have is to entertain the audience.I was very much entertained by the way this film turned out."Planet of the Apes" was to me seven dollars that was well spent.Leaving the theatre,even though I knew there were better ones,I appreciated the film for the fact that it led me on a trip through the entertainment world.Mark Wahlberg is pretty good as Leo Davison and so is Tim Roth is General Thade.What else impressed me about this film is Rick Baker's impressive makeup which I believe is a dead lock for an academy award."Planet of the Apes" is a fun filled journey that thought was never a waste of my time.Every minute was worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does plenty well everything a movie is supposed to do, and does it GRAND!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderful movie! Although not without some flaws, but well worthseeing and enjoying. After seeing it this morning, I was surprisedto discover that this evening I felt like seeing it again. So, I'll catch itagain within a week or two.WARNING--SPOILERS The entire gorilla cast was magnificent! Truly and reallyastounding work by the makeup guys-- but more, by the actorsthemselves. Not once did I think-- Hey, there's Roddy McDowell ina gorilla suit! The animal characters were so believable. Thehumans were less than grand, though. Kris Kristoffersen wasamazing-- a welcome and remarkable acting re-appearance, andtotally apt for his role.The blond babe: Whats-her-name, was serviceable, but nothingspecial. Markie Mark -- I mean Mark Wahlberg-- is a fine actor,generally. But here his character is annoying and dumb. I kind ofwanted to see him killed pretty much right away.Helena Bonham-Carter-- all I can say is you've got to see her tobelieve her! Even though any role as a gorilla lady would be,professionally, a bit of a burlesque, she made it into somethingworthwhile. Appropriate to the spirit of the movie-- but I say that hercharacter in this flick outdoes and therefore embarrasses JuliaRoberts, in ANYTHING Roberts has EVER done. Bonham-Cartergets an exquisite performance out of the circumstances, whichspeaks highly of her genius and mastery of acting.The ending, though-- What the F*** was that??? Talk aboutsomething happening simply because the script, or pre-fab cliche,demands it! Knowing critic Roger Ebert's movie law that "No propis featured in a movie without a purpose/payoff later on"-- seeingso much attention paid to the real chimp in the beginning was aclear tip-off that somehow he'd show up later, etc. I also couldguess the secret source of the ape planet within 8 seconds of itsfirst mention. I'm sure most other audience members did as well.But when Wahlberg goes back in time to earth and finds that AbeLincoln is a gorilla dude? That is illogical, even in a 1960's vibesci-fi movie. What's the logic? It makes no sense, and thus hadabsolutely no effect on me.On the other hand-- so what? This great flick does plenty enoughof what a movie is supposed to do, and it does it really well. Maybeit ain't Shakespeare-- but from what I've read, in his time,Shakespeare himself wasn't Shakespeare either.Go see "Planet of the Apes." Be glad; be happy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chimply, A great time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think first of all, one can easily separate the two POTA movies, as both, while sharing some elements, have VERY different stories. Mark Wahlberg stars as an soldier who is based on a space station which is experimenting with using chimp controlled spaceships. When one chimp is lost in a spacepod during an exploration of a magnetic space field, Wahlberg takes off (unauthorized) to find it. When the pod enters the field, Wahlberg loses control as well, soon he crash lands in a jungle. And he is VERY quickly introduced to the dominant species on the planet ;) The story which follows is very tightly directed by Burton, and is very well acted by Wahlberg. Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are (as usual) excellent and don't let the make up (which is designed by the always outstanding Rick Baker) get in the way of the performances. Finally, as usual, a GREAT score by Danny Elfman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing redeeming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers think that there are some good qualities to this movie. Let me clarify: there are none, at least, none that could make this movie worth seeing. Terrible writing, a completely befuddling misunderstanding of time and space, a confusing ending, highly variable special effects quality, and people in monkey... please forgive me: APE costumes. One of the things (aside from the hammy Heston) that would put people off the original is the obvious ape masks. I would have thought that if one were to remake a film, it would at least improve upon it's major flaw. I know little of ape behaviour, however, I did appreciate their efforts in adding ape gestures (i.e. rubbing knuckles on another's chest). It took me twelve years to finally see this movie. It was not worth the wait, but it is sure to be on the itinerary of my next bad movie night party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really freakin like this movie - Great Job from my favorite director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had bought the DVD, thinking it was just an average movie. But because Tim Burton was my favorite film director and I thought it was only okay But watching it again, I'm one of the the few --probably on the planet--who really likes this First of all you really need to accept this film is not a remake, and I like the story more.Many criticize the direction, and I've found as an older person, I really liked it much more than when I was younger. In fact I was twelve when I saw it in the cinema -- the violence disturbed me, but I love the ending. I still love the ending Not enough films (or at least big films) have a finale like this, in fact that was one of the criticisms on Minority Report (which I need to watch again) But my favorite director of all time has made a film people consider his biggest fault, they don't like Alice in Wonderland either I love both, I love all his films.I'm proud I have the DVD, and don't need other people to like it as much to make me feel like I'm allowed to feel that way Oh and the cast and acting are wonderful, so is the make-up.

		<shortDescription>Literally defines the term LAME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is my absolute favorite director of all time and he rarely strikes out but when he does, it can be quite embarrassing. Case in question: the 2001 remake of one of the most famous sci-fi films of all time.I do have one confession. I've never actually seen the original 1968 film but I am familiar with the story. Here, astronaut Leo Davidson (played forgettably by Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on a distant planet ruled by intelligent apes. From there, he treks with a small band of outsiders towards these mysterious, ancient ruins which may hold the key for his return home.Where do I begin? Well, the cast is thoroughly wasted and this film has quite a cast (David Warner! Michael Clarke Duncan! Paul Giamattei!), the special effects are pretty generic, and the production design is slimy and claustrophobic. On top of all that, the final battle is very lackluster.Adding to all this, the ending is a joke. While the original film had an ending that was surprising and strangely appropriate, this one feels forced and confusing. Additional sore spots include a bland score by the usually reliable Danny Elfman and a pace that BEGS for a steroid shot.You may be wondering are there ANY redeeming values? Well, Charlton Heston's cameo is pretty good but since it is just a cameo, he's not in long enough to truly save it.What else can I say? This film stinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the movie Hated the actress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well what can I say, I love planet of the apes, all except one actress who I could not get used to through the entire movie. And that would be Estella Warren, i cannot pinpoint it but I just thought her character really threw off the whole admiration thing to the main character played by Mark Wahlberg. It looked silly as she did the same thing he did, like jumping in the water when the question was asked, How long can a human hold his breath under water? It seemed to hokey to me. And even though her lines were not that long, even when she spoke it gave no passion, no heated conflict to be aware of. Her role just did not fit the story. Everything else was fabulous, Tim Roth as thade, Paul Giamatti that played the slave trader, which to me was a wonderful addition, for the humorous side to a mad world. And yet Micheal Duncan Clark also gave a great role as Thades general and subordinate. But one other that seemed to throw it off another notch was the irritating kid, who thought he could do everything in the face of danger, yet bungles it up just as badly as he rode the horse. This in itself did not make the stories strength, the strength came from the apes, and that to me is the story. Estella to me just wasn't the right one picked for her character, she was too flimsy... and too blank to be believed. And as for the runt, I couldn't see it he just did not look the type to play a would be hero. Yet besides these flaws i still thought the movie was a great adaptation to the novel, especially the features of the apes and mannerisms. Which to me seemed more real than the old seventies version. Fantastic time to watch this again. If only i could stomach the other two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cool, under-rated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film, and think that all the bad comments it has received are undeserved. Although I haven't seen the original, this film looks wonderful and dark, and this is surely thanks to Burton's skill as a director. It manages to make the slightly detached characters really work well together, and the acting was great throughout. Very interesting race/ animal rights issues are raised by this film and, although I'm guessing that the original also raised these issues, I suspect it provoked much thought with teenagers who wouldn't dream of watching the original. Of course, you've got to compare it with Burtons other films, and, as far as spooky, Gothic atmospheres go, this doesn't really live up to them. But as an action film it surpasses so many. My favourite character was the Tim Roth evil general. He is the kind of bad guy whose evil has been set so deep within himself that he can no longer control it, and when he kills those gorilla-type creatures it's absolutely amazing. He also emanates pure evil through his wonderfully made facial features. The ending is an issue that raises much debate, but I loved it, the master plan, killing one wave of the enemy with an explosion, was beautifully futile, and the coincidental monkey landing was pleasantly ridiculous. And his return to earth was just really cool. All in all, a great film, watch it. By the way, did anyone else find themselves fancying Helena Bonham Carter in this film. Although, because of the amount of hair and her weird posture, it sounds quite wrong to think that, it just feels so right!</fullReview>

Mark Whalberg needs to go back to either singing or playing a pretend porn star. the humor was bad. the slave trader with a heart of gold? the blonde chick. nobody that oppressed is gonna look that good. and to end this off, Helen Bonham carter, she is better looking as an ape than in real life. the make-up improved her looks, too bad it did not help her acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton has always been overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be a bit late to weigh in on this film, but I feel compelled to if for no other reason than that Tim Burton has just arrogantly messed with another classic, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, and has once again screwed things up. Burton has no concept of plot or acting, his style is entirely visual, and he is dishonest as all get out when he wants to make a point. I'm sorry that Tim had problems with his parents, especially his father, but that does not justify his screwing with classic stories so that he can whine once again about how parents just don't understand you and might even abandon you.Having got that off my chest, I would like to summarize POTA as follows. The movie makes no sense and the reason it makes no sense is that the director has no vision, no sense of a story that he wants to tell. Even the highly touted ape makeup is a mistake, because the director has no idea whether the apes are supposed to be subhuman or better than human. As a consequence they behave in a manner that simply leaves the viewer confused.I am a biologist who has studied behavior in apes, so I might be more picky than most, but I defy any viewer to answer the following question. Why are all the female apes chimpanzees? I have watched the ape village scenes several times and to my view there is not a single female gorilla or orang utan in the entire place. Also these female chimps don't look like chimps, but like some sort of odd chimp/human hybrid, which might explain the attraction between Marky Mark and Helena BC, but otherwise feels just thrown in (This is what I mean by Burton throwing logic out the window to make his themes fit his preconceptions). For example why does the female chimp (Carter) have eyebrows, a trait missing from every primate but humans? Also why do chimps, which seem to make up the vast majority of the apes, walk upright except when they charge? This makes them very ineffective as warriors. They can't hold weapons, so why do they wear armor? The acting in this film is confusing and few characters seem realized, and once again I think Burton is to blame. In Burton films the only actors who are memorable are those willing to create their own characters and overact shamelessly, e.g. Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice, Nicholson's Joker, DeVito's Penguin, Walken's headless horseman. In this film this tradition is carried on by Tim Roth's Thade, a character so psychotic it seems amazing that anyone takes him seriously. The cast includes some good actors, but all are handicapped by bad direction. For example, Paul Giamatti an excellent character actor, tries hard to create a believable character in his whining sycophantic slave trading orang utan, but he is made up as a female rather than a male orang utan, which collapses the character completely.Other actors fare no better. Wahlberg, at best a charming male ingénue, cannot act like a leader, so I was startled by the idea that all the humans would follow his lead when he seems to have no idea as to what he's doing throughout the entire film. The other humans seem to be merely tagging along looking confused. Michael Clarke Duncan, subtle and wonderful in the Green Mile, here plays sort of a King Kong who can talk. As a subtext, why are the Gorillas played by Afrcian American actors, and the chimps by white actors? This leads me to what I think is Burton's greatest weakness, his ability to direct actresses. The only actress who has ever turned in a memorable performance in a Burton film is Michelle Pfeiffer's sly, slinky Catwoman in Batman II. Otherwise excellent actresses have been left to flounder by Burton, e.g. Christina Ricci is Sleepy Hollow, Kim Basinger in Batman. Given this history, I find confusing all of the hostility and crass comments about Estella Warren's performance as Daena, the only human in the film with any personality. Estella Warren is a powerful presence, who in every film in which she appears works from the premise that she is, at the least, the equal of all the male characters and that she is smarter even than most of those. She tries to pull that off in POTA, but she is left to flounder, trying to work off the giant vacuum emitted by Marky Mark. Warren acts using her face to communicate subtle emotions and changes of mood, but that tactic backfires in this film, where subtlety is lost. She gets no perceivable reactions from Wahlberg, who seems lost in his own world, and she has almost no scenes with anyone else. As a result Warren has little to do but look distressed and confused. I think most of the negative comments directed at Warren's acting come from silly insecure young men who feel that a pretty woman should not also be strong and competent, and simply want to ogle her.To summarize, this film is probably the worst big budget film ever made, but don't blame the actors. As they say in Russia, fish begin to stink from the head. In this case the head is the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing look on a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes could perfectly be a part of the selected group of good remakes. This group of films could include movies such a The Fly, The Thing, and some others. The criteria to be a part of this selection would be that every new remake should try to take distance from the seminal classics. Those old and dear movies are classics, there's no sense in make the same movie using the same script and so. If there's any need of release a remake it is necessary a new take on the same tale.Tim Burton has done just that with his version of Planet of the Apes, and also has made the whole myth of this saga his own. Leo Davidson is a hard action astronaut but still he's very innocent just like many of the heroes of Burton. And these Apes who are a distorted image of us as society (greedy, intolerant). The special apes that don't follow these ideologies are the good sensitive beings. I think this is probably one of the most important messages in every good movie of Tim Burton, the special outsider view of the artist in a world who's not sensitive.Owning an amazing design of make-up, scenarios, and lots of practical FX, P.O.A is honest to the old fashion style of Sci-Fi .This is the remake that the seminal classic of 1968 deserves. A great cast of actor and actresses is here and they deliver over the top performances even wearing pound of Makeup! This new version pays homage to the first Planet from the first minute to the last. It deserves an absolute 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real ending explanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's rendition of planet of the apes is just an interesting interpretation, not a remake. overall i thought it was well done. i do enjoy the originals quite a bit. after watching almost every original form of POTA, watching the Tim Burton version was fun, but just as long as you see it as his interpretation. the first time i saw the movie, i thought the ending was messed up, but after i saw it again years later, and understanding the time line of events i figured it out. many people have different opinions on what it means, but no one is close. the whole time Leo is on another planet. we know this from the 2 moons. then at the end he jumps into the alpha pod and heads for the electrical storm again, in hopes of going home. after Pericles arrives and just before Leo leaves the apes and humans have a respect for each other and now live in harmony, good job. then he leaves. however, general thade is still left there and being the ape-supremacist he is, is surely nothing less than disgusted. now, in an effort for revenge or even to alter his present, Thade becomes preoccupied with the delta pod. he is still one of a select group that knows about it. he somehow manages to resurrect it and get it to work. more than likely it still has power because A) its run with nuclear energy that "lasts forever" or B) just because Leo didn't use that much to get to the ape planet to begin with. Thade then takes off in the delta pod (possibly with another ape but i'm not sure, it is unlikely though) and manges to get into the electrical storm and make his way to earth. and because of the electrical storm he arrives long before Leo does. i think it may even be in the early 1900's. while he is there he, no doubt, wreaks havoc among the humans and through a series of unknown events, procreates and eventually overtakes the human race. and mysteriously history stays basically the same (except of course for the appearance of thade). thus when Leo gets to earth around the same time he left apes have long since ruled earth. we know its thade because if you look at the inscription on the back of the Lincoln memorial its says that it was built "in memory of general thade" (and it looks just like him). also, given that we now are back in time to the first present, Leo more than likely will not be able to go into space and have the beginning of the movie happen again and the first ape planet stays uninhabited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible remake of a movie that was only halfway good anyhow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely the worst film yet by Burton, who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs. A miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film. This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out "he's lost his gun!" or whatever it is to let everybody know. Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing. Very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton's crony Elfman. Heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch-phrases from the first movie. Very poor results.If anyone else out there also saw "Sleepy Hollow", they will probably have noticed, as I have, the declining quality of Burton's films. I've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned. But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films. In "Sleepy Hollow", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film (those are never scary, as horror fans know). The movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. "Planet of the Apes" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than like sci-fi. He's also fallen into the rut of so many other "big" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience. Word to Burton, if you're out there -- pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together (as in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going.</fullReview>

Boy, were they wrong. I don't guess the sequel will be made because it will be too expensive to make such an awful film.There is one good thing about this movie. The make-up. The actors really do look like talking apes. And all the apes look different with their own unique face. The teeth even look real.Now back to the plot. Why was Estella Warren even in this? She did nothing. At least the female ape did something. (SPOILERS): And that chimp landing the space pod at the end, which basically saves the humans, is so convient. I mean, come on, why did it take so long for the chimp to land when Leo crashed his ship days earlier. And leo is not well written. I think he should have been more shocked and stuff when he first saw apes talking.(END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT: You might want to watch it for half an hour just to see the realistic looking apes. But, don't waste 2 hours to see this flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dismal remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Planet of the Apes' is a joyless, soulless and utterly pointless remake of the 1968 sci-fi classic. The original film had two strong elements going for it: its expansive visual style and its playful spirit. Both qualities have been effectively eliminated in Tim Burton's update, along with the sense of wonder that came, thirty-three years ago, when the material was still innovative and fresh. What viewer can forget the time he first saw that stunning final shot of the earlier version, with a weary Charlton Heston coming upon the remains of the Statue of Liberty - then bellowing in outrage at the tragic reality hitherto unrevealed to both him and us? Burton, not wanting to be a slavish devotee to the original (and not wanting the audience to know everything about the story in advance of entering the theatre), attempts a similar `surprise' ending here, but the execution of it is so ludicrous, confused and clumsy that all one can do is scratch one's head and giggle in bemused befuddlement.Much of the effectiveness of the original `Planet of the Apes' lay in its deliberately paced buildup. The early stretches of the film, in which Heston and his fellow astronauts wandered the desert in search of life, helped immensely in generating an atmosphere of suspense and mystery. In the new version, however, the lone hero, Thade (Mark Wahlberg), crash lands on the planet and, almost instantaneously, finds himself caught in this strange world in which evolution seems to have taken a reverse course, where apes speak and have dominion over docile humans - though they're not quite as docile as they were in the first version since in this edition the humans speak, rendering absurd the idea that the apes would consider humans to be a subspecies. Also, in the original version, much of the time was spent focusing on Heston's attempts to convince the apes that he was every bit as smart as they were. Thus, much of the pleasure of the film came from the fact that there seemed to be a duel of wits going on between apes and humans ? a contest that often took the form of high-spirited, clever and even witty dialogue exchanges. For all the ludicrousness of its premise, the original `Planet of the Apes' was not a DUMB movie. I wish one could say the same for the remake. The plotting in this version essentially boils down to little more than an extended and distended chase story, with apes racing madly after humans from one dimly lit locale to the next. And here we come upon another problem with the movie ? one it shares with many modern action flicks, actually, especially those made by Burton. It is simply shot too dark. One of the qualities that distinguished the original film from most of the sci-fi adventure films that came before it was the near-epic feeling created by its beautiful wide screen images of the desert setting. These shots lent a visual impressiveness to the potentially childish material and helped to bring an aura of seriousness to the proceedings. In Burton's version, however, the visual style is often dark, cramped and confining, not at all conducive to the sense of majesty and awe that Franklin Schaffner's version afforded.Wahlberg is a bland substitute for Heston who, dressed only in a loincloth and hissing virtually every line through clenched teeth, seemed to sense the camp potential hidden beneath the story's surface ? a fact not acknowledged by the stolid Wahlberg (or by Burton for that matter). How we miss the charming personalities of Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter as the sympathetic ape characters. Poor Helena Bonham Carter, in the Hunter role, doesn't get to recite even one vaguely amusing line. It seems amazing that a movie made thirty-three years ago would take itself so much less seriously than a film made today. One would expect that a filmmaker like Burton, known for his ability to find humor in the most macabre of situations, would be the last director to take such a humorless, deadpan approach to material like this. The original `Planet of the Apes' managed to combine the elements of originality, suspense, humor, irony, surprise and visual acuity to create a work of lasting value and interest. My prediction is that copies of it will still be on video store shelves long after this remake has hit the bargain-price recycling bins. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton is obviously losing his touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsA while ago,Tim Burton directed such twisted fantasy classics as the Batman films,Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands.But recently,he churned out the rather turgid Sleepy Hollow and followed it up with this uninvolving and unnecessary remake of the original 1968 Charlton Heston movie.There are some noticeable in-jokes in the film,for instance,wheras the original is remembered for it's classic ''Get your hands off me,you dirty ape'' line,this time the ape bit is replaced with ''human'' and Michael Clarke Duncan is brilliantly cast as a big hulking soldier ape.No one else sadly is however.Mark Whalberg is totally unconvincing as a leading man action hero,and Helena Bonham Carter makes a complete fool of herself as an ape.Throw into this a totally far fetched story and you have a film that you should probably stay away from.**</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smarter than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Planet of the Apes has been around for over 30 years so It's not that big of a suprise that the fans of it didn't like this version. They left their comic book stores and went to the theater expecting a shot by shot remake of the original. Well -- suprise! -- This wasn't a remake. Tim Burton's Apes was a different story all together with a similar --more sensible-- plot. This one, in my opinion, was better. It contained connections to not only the first few movies in the series but to the novel as well [examples being with the GREAT suprise ending or the 'fun for the whole family' monkey named Pericles - who sadly died in the book]. Also, The Special Make Up Effects to this 2001 version --when analyzed-- blew the original out of the water. Rick Baker's work to this is his best since 'an American Werewolf in London'. When you combine all of that with Danny Elfman's pounding score and Tim Burton's smooth direction you get something that hasn't been conceived since Warner Brothers' BATMAN was released. Oh, and In regards to a few news group critics' spiteful reviews, Tim Burton's visual style is very much evident in this million dollar 'Blockbuster' movie. If you'll think back to the cold white/black contrasting space station segments or the jungle / desert shot lay-ups then you'll realize that a sort of Hitchcock reminiscent style of frame composition is present. That's pure Tim Burton. The colors and set designs are prime examples. In my opinion, Don't you compare this one to the original, it's a great movie on it's own. It explains more than the original did --or the book-- and makes more sense, like how the apes speak English. Tim Burton hasn't done something of this calibre since his 1989 comic book film renderings. So in summation, for all of you whiny little 1960's Apes Fanatics, just think about the references this one made to the original, Think about how much better the old one could have been and think mostly about why the movie made so much money - if it was so bad? Tim Burton's a genius artist and this film was his pallet.</fullReview>

Tim Roth completely over-did the whole husky-voiced bad guy thing, Helena Bonham-Carter was no more than annoying, and Estella Warren couldn't act to save her life.

		<fullReview>I was going to use the old cliche, `You'll go Ape over this movie,' but after watching General Thade during the climax of the movie, I felt that the summary above served the movie justice.This was some movie, and while it has similarities with the previous releases, it is a more modern tale of simian evolution. Just don't call them monkeys...they've killed humans for less.This movie was very entertaining and captivating with very few lulls. Mark Wahlberg (once known as the rapper `Marky Mark' from the turbulent nineties) performed quite well, although he did not seem to have the proper demeanor for a soldier of the US Air Force. He seemed to be a bit too `common.'I was also equally impressed by Tim Roth as General Thade. Thade is a chimp, but not like the cute and loveable ones you see on television. He was a homicidal maniac with a deep hatred for humans, so deep that he would go so far as to betray his own kind. He made Adolf Hitler look like the Easter bunny by comparison.The special effects were marvellous. It was amazing how they were able to design the make-up such that the simian masks mimicked their human facial expressions. Some of these actors must have spent some time at the nearest zoo or something, because some of them portrayed the instinctive reactions of apes, such as throwing their hands up in the air and screeching loudly. Fantastic. I also loved the way the apes would leap through the air and land on their opponents.As with the majority of the movies I like, I do not watch them for their artistic content. If you want artistic content, watch `The Piano' or something like that. If you want a movie for the adrenaline rush and you have an open mind, then do not hesitate to watch this one.The saddest part about this movie is that I had once seen on tv that Tim Burton is not planning to direct a sequel. That would be a shame, but you never know - once Tim sees all the revenues generated by this movie, he may reconsider. Or perhaps another director will take up the mantel. We can only hope.***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***I was not kidding about the spoiler alert. One of the paragraphs mentioned below will briefly discuss the ending of the movie, and if you have not seen the movie yet, I would not recommend that you read any further.First of all, I did not like it that the movie started out in the year 2029. So am I supposed to believe that we as a race will be capable of space flight and capable of designing self-sufficient space stations away from the Earth's orbit in just 28 years? Unless there's influence from an alien specie, I cannot believe that we will progress that well in such a short period of time. However, despite this `flaw,' it did not affect my overall view of the movie.Another question I had pertained to genetic diversity. With so few humans and apes aboard the space station, how is it that they were able to populate that planet? With all of the inevitable in-breeding (and I do NOT mean inter-species mating), how is it that either specie is not riddled with disease or deformities? And for those of you who did not catch it, they were on a distant planet. It even had several moons, so they were not on Earth the entire time.Finally, I was not impressed by Capt. Davidson's flight home. In a matter of what appeared to be a few seconds, he escaped the planet's atmosphere, flew into the storm, arrived back into his own solar system (near Saturn by the looks of it), and then immediately arrived at Earth. What makes this all the more amazing, this was done in a spacecraft not much larger than my car (apparently it is capable of deep space flight), and it's fuel and oxygen reserves were likely expended beforehand, yet Davidson made it some in one piece in about 30 seconds.The ending itself was fantastic. Davidson landed on an Earth that had evolved the same as ours with the exception of one difference - the apes became the dominant species, not us. Apparently, not only can the storm bend the laws of time and space, but apparently it can throw someone into an alternate reality. I would just love to see a sequel to determine where this movie left off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get me the spaceman! CONTAINS SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers* Unlike, seemingly all of the people who went to see this movie, I have read the novel on which the POTA series was based. The twist at the end being that by the time the main character had returned to earth the apes had taken over society. This is what would appear to have happened at the end of this version of the story, not some of the bizarre interpretations other people have posted. The main problem people seem to have with this film is that it has a sense of humour about itself. at a time when so many films are ruined by taking themselves to seriously, this film probably should have taken itself seriously but a sense of smirking fun prevails throughout. Burton's unique visual style is perhaps not as dominant as in some of his films but it's still clearly there. The film is riddled with plot holes and nonsense which are clearly going to drive the petty logic obsessed viewing public crazy, in short if something about this film annoyed you, (most of these complaints are just to stupid to list) chances are you missed the point. Oh, and the film is not set up for a sequel (not to say that there won't be one) but think about it for god's sake (the ending was a parody of the book, a joke no one understood), how would that work exactly?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the other user comments and found that you were complaining that it was nothing like the original. Well, you're right, but that was Tim Burton's point. It isn't a remake or a sequel, just simply Burton's take on it.I thought that this movie was very entertaining. Mark Whalberg was pretty good, Micheal Clark Duncan was great, but the real credit goes to Tim Roth as the evil Thade. My mom thought that he was pretty scary and almost left the theatre.But there was one thing that was wierd, which many people have pointed out: The Ending. It was pretty twisted, but I'll buy the DVD to see the other endings.Well, I'm gonna go see the movie again because I love Tim Burton and the movie is really cool, (half of the credit goes to Rick Baker's make-up, which will no doubt be nomminated for an oscar)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man I went into this movie really thinking it was going to be a dog because of the poor trailers for this movie. I mean does every movie have to show the dumb trailers that either show you every laughable line or worse yet, show you a synopsis of the whole movie??? I think a simple teaser would suffice for any and all movies before they are released. Unless we are all turning into little children as adults and need the whole movie pratically explained to us before going to go see it.Anyway, this was a very good version of POTA. I was very pleased and a little surprised at the outcome of the movies ending. They practically gave it away, probably for the slower people who like long trailers.This is very much worth seeing and I hope they get the sequel done by next year. They better not leave this one hanging too long. They never made people wait too long in the past series.Thanks, Gary</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't help but think that people who call this movie 'horrible' are mean spirited. In fact, one reviewer gives a completely false description of how ape civilization started which makes me think he hasn't even seen the movie, but is only spreading bad hype. Folks, maybe you haven't seen some of the other movies that came out this year, but compared to the likes of "Mummy Returns", "JPIII", "Swordfish" etc., Tim Burton's POTA is a modern-day "Citizen Kane".I understand people don't like to see their favorite movie remade, but that's no reason to diss this movie. Besides, it's not a remake, it's a re-imaging.The original movie was a social commentary. The new POTA is a sci-fi action summer movie, and I don't see anything wrong with that especially if it's done the way Tim Burton did it. Racial inequality and fear of nuclear annihilation don't plague the world as much as they did in 1968. The story line is basically same.The acting is top-notch as opposed to the original's melodramatic and sometimes over-the-top acting. Mark Wahlberg gives a subtle and understated performance. Paul Giamatti provides great comic relief. And can you say Academy Award Nominee for Tim Roth and Helena Bonham-Carter. There are a lot of complaints about bad dialog. I must have overheard it, because I don't remember any cheesy or nonsense lines.The ending was fascinating. In two years, no other movie, besides Memento, made me think about it as much. The makeup and cinematography are absolutely amazing, as is the kick-ass score. I see how someone could get frustrated with the ending, because it makes you make use of those damn brain cells. Tim Burton used the original novel's ending, so when you trash the ending, you also trash a sci-fi classic.So don't listen to all the bad hype. Go see the movie and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's "rethinking" of the 1968 original. In this one Mark Wahlberg takes over the Charlton Heston role. He's trapped on a planet (not Earth of the future as in the original) where apes rule over humans. He tries to find a way home.The visuals are impressive--visually Burton knows how to direct. Unfortunately, he's never been very good with scripts and actors. That is painfully clear here. The script moves slowly and the dialogue is comic book level. The acting is pretty bad too with the sole exception of Helena Bonham Carter as a kind scientist ape. Tim Roth as an evil ape scowls all the time and throws tantrums--it's not funny or cute or scary--just dull. And Wahlberg is truly terrible in the lead. His character is so passive and accepting--a total wimp. At least Heston's character in the original had some edge--Wahlberg has nothing.The makeup on the apes is good, a definitive improvement over the original. Also there's a good score by Danny Elfman and a terrific battle sequence at the end, but it's too little too late. So, I give it a 6 for the visuals, Carter and the score. Also the new ending is really really bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of the Apes, the Remake: Now with 75% more snarling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS (also for original PoA, 1968)You would have to look far and wide to find a bigger fan of the original Planet of the Apes. I nearly went berserk a few months ago when a woman I know said that Planet of the Apes was a so-bad-it's-good type of movie. It took all of my mental power to remain calm (she wasn't even speaking to me). Yes, I worship the original Planet of the Apes and disdain its cheap, money-hungry sequels. It was those that lowered the original's reputation. Now comes the remake, directed by Tim Burton, a director whose work, IMO, is often visually brilliant but more often narratively incompetent. After I saw Sleepy Hollow, I wrote on imdb how I thought Burton should make sure his next script is okay before filming commences. Obviously Tim doesn't care what I think. His Planet of the Apes is a decent, run-of-the-mill summer actioner, but it has these weird attempts at social commentary and, even worse, at comedy.The jokes referencing the original are very cheaply made and only inspired embarrassed laughter. Charlton Heston's cameo is so gauche it's unbelievable. I pity him. The only self-referential gag that worked was a visual one that few people in the theater seemed to notice: the spaceship that Leo (Mark Wahlberg, who is so bland I almost forgot he was in the film while watching him) and his crew find in the forbidden zone is a visual pun on the Statue of Liberty ending of the original, even quoting camera angles. I laughed at that bit of cleverness.The make-up ought to be criticized a lot, for it is so much worse than the make-up of the original that it is startling. People nowadays might scoff at the original's make-up, not realizing that it was Academy Award-winning at the time. It is not bad at all, and the emotions could be seen on the faces of the actors. My favorite expression is one that a gorilla soldier has on his face when he is hosing down Taylor, Taylor exclaiming: "It's a madhouse, a madhouse!" The ape shouts back "SHUT UP YOU FILTHY HUMAN!" The expression on his face and his tone of voice are powerful. In this one, the make-up artists foolishly tried to ape real apes. What results is once and a while amazing (the orang-otans, especially Senator Sandar, whose corpulent orang-otan politician is the greatest and most underused creation this film has to offer; the other orang-otan, Limbo, is the best character in the film (Paul Giamatti, a good character actor all-around)) but more often terrible (Ari (Helena Bonham Carter, a poor actress in most respects), apparently a chimp, looks so much worse than her counterparts in the original, Zira and Cornelius; Thade seems more like an invented ape or a werewolf than a chimp). The apes' movement in this film is also ridiculous. They move basically as humans in the original, simply because they were supposed to have evolved. Evolution has given us humans straight backs. These apes run on all fours and jump a hundred feet in the air. What is this, Crouching Chimp Hidden Gorilla? Maybe a chimp can do that, maybe even an orang-otan, but not a gorilla. Thade (Tim Roth) at one point throws a fit where he leaps around like crazy. It's so ridiculous, several people in the theater were laughing. Also ridiculous was the decision to make these evolved apes sound just like their natural counterparts. There is so much squealing in this film that it ends up hurting your ears. Heck, I wish they would have just gone for broke and had them whip feces at the humans during their battles.In the original, characters were well developed and defined. The apes' society and civilization was well displayed, including the complex ape class-structure. The original film had patience in setting things up, it didn't overburden us with unnecessary action sequences. All in all, the new Planet of the Apes is only worth seeing if you are bored and in desperate need for an action film. It does not work on any intelligent level. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even Tim Burton's unique and great style can save this movie.There are several bad things about "Planet of the Apes". (One of them is the fact that this movie should never have been made at all but let's put that aside.) It might sound strange but the thing that troubled and disappointed me the most was that the humans in the movie could all speak normal English and all acted like almost normal humans and some even seemed to have make up and hairdressers! Another troubling thing was Mark Wahlberg. Now, I'm not one of those people who have something against Mark Wahlberg, not at all but he was simply totally miscast. He is too much of an hero, which is not the right type of guy for this movie. And let's not even get started about Estella Warren or Tim Roth's overacting and some of the unneeded and weak characters in a disappointing story with an ending so weird that not even the smartest person will understand it.Now, I must say that the movie has some nice sets, costumes and make up that are typically trademark Tim Burton, the special effects are also quite good. It's also good that there still is plenty of humor to enjoy but it's not enough to make the movie interesting.There are some nice scene's but there also are some extremely disappointing scene's. The hunt is pretty cool (although still not as cool as the '68 hunt version) but the end battle is extremely weak and disappointing and ends too abrupt. Especially the Colonel Attar vs. Krull battle is laughable and a disgrace for the two characters that were about the most interesting two in the movie.I do not hate this movie I simply did not enjoy it. Only watchable for the Tim Burton fans and for the nice Charlton Heston cameo.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it wasn't for him, I would have liked this movie a lot more. Part of it isn't his fault as the stupid story has his motivation for going into space to find his monkey that disappears. So he risks his life and that of the ship's crew to find his monkey. I can't really back a guy that stupid. Then the parts that are his fault is that he is just a bad actor and has a look about him I just don't care for. Of course, he ends up landing on a planet run buy super monkeys. The people playing the monkeys do a very good job with their parts. I don't have anything bad to say about them, except that their good job makes Wahlberg look even worse. Tim Roth is great as is Carter. All the apes do well. Kris Kristofferson is not in the movie enough and is killed relatively early. I wish he were in it more; they needed one good human character in this one. Also, Charlton Heston makes a brief appearance in this one, this time as a monkey. The ending to this one makes no sense though as the original it did.</fullReview>

But the terrible ending aside, this film still has some very good aspects.I like that only the basic premise is the same as the original film, the specifics of the story are quite different and it sets itself apart well. The makeup of the apes is terrific, as is the production design. Tim Roth is too over the top as General Thade, but other than him the cast is pretty good.The dialogue can be pretty bad, with the "Damn dirty human" line being the worst example. Even with some large flaws, this is still worth seeing for some great visuals and a different and interesting take on the story of the Planet of the Apes.</fullReview>

PLANET OF THE APES is based on a 196os French novel, "La planete des singes," by Pierre Boulle. I think one of the reasons there is so much animosity against this one is that it is undeniably dated. This movie kept me captivated from the beginning all the way to the end. This might all sound corny, like a bad B-movie, but that is not the case. This is actually a serious movie with a serious message. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again.

But adventure movie, even at best are shallow. Indiana Jones is not very deep, but as example of movie art is sophisticated, and extremely well made. That's the difference: Planet of the Apes is a failure not because of weak background (AKA: The meaning of..., the philosophy etc.), but of the weak first plan.We can see, how black-hole open between script and execution, we've got characters without character, like Estella and Kris, we've got hero without one single good moment in entire movie. I mean, really Mark..."Why are you helping me?" - asked Mark. "Because you are special" answered Ari (Helena B-C). No Helena, he is not...What else can I say? This predictable movie is boring, stupid and unconvincingly. After 40 minutes I wish that some better race punish stupidity of humans and apes, but it never happened.At least I must say, that Planet of the Apes is a lot better that recently garbage of Burton-rotten-chocolate-factory.

Also You'll understand this movie a bit better.Visually this movie is wonderful, and the new ape suits are incredible. Unlike the original movie, the apes have a more realistic appearance, they act more, and sounds a bit more like apes. But the apes are still the dominat and intelligent species on the planet. This movie is more based on the original novel by the French author Pierre Boulle. And I'm sure he would be pleased with the story arc in this movie, even though all the french factors have been Americanized.Mark Walberg show us a strong performance, and the movies "villain" general Thade, portrayed by Tim Roth, is just terrifying. To be candid the two adversarial roles really saved this movie.It may not be as mind-boggling as the original movies, but it's still well worth watching. It's great for remake standards and shouldn't be compared to much to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all honesty, I can say that Tim Burtons version of this film made the original in all honesty look like (as that saying goes) look like ape sh**! But that is just my opinion. The graphics, the story, the whole thing seemed to grab more of my attention than the others did... Now there is no doubt that Charleton Heston did an extrodanary job acting in the others, but Mar Wahlberg isn't bad at all in this one! Mark Wahlberg is honestly a good actor, and just because he is not viewed in the same way that Heston is, doesn't mean that he can't give a good performance! Anyways, the whole film was extrodanary in the aspect of anyone who enjoys good plots and imaginative views! PS, I loved the intro for some reason... So Tim Burton, keep up the good work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's worst movie of his career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the apes(2001) is a bad movie but I think that the great Tim Burton(the director of this remake)is not the guilty because this movie has not got Burton's vision;it has 20th Century Fox's vision.It seems that Burton followed the instructions that the 20th Century Fox left him.Planet of the apes is a boring and a totally unnecessary remake.The film has not got nothing of the intelligence the original film had.The movie is absurd and it pretends to be intelligent,but it's far away from the intelligence.The film has some good scenes but all the other scenes are very idiot and absurd.The executives behind this movie thought the ending was going to be surprising trying to finish the movie in a classical way.But the ''surprising'' ending is very stupid.The good scenes I talked about before are those which have Burton's vision with a good combination between adventure and humor.Sadly,that scenes appear only on some moments.Planet of the apes is Burton's worst movie of his entire career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to respectfully disagree with jackzen from Wales. To be fair though, I will preface this by saying that I never saw the original TV shows, and if there was a book, I never read it.But, that said, I would say that this movie stands as a fine piece of work in it's own right. It was, I believe, very well acted and filmed, and I believe that the plot was basically good. I did however dislike the ending, but don't feel that it was a fault of poor plot, just personal taste.I won't say more, because I don't want to spoil this for anyone that has not seen it. I believe that it is a movie you will enjoy watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not such a bad film as some people have reported, I actually liked it, and I'm also deeply worried about the talk of the many cuts made.Allegedly Tim Burton made it as close to the book as possible, and even included some scenes such as a human-ape love scene. However, this is also one of the main reasons why fans of the original Heston film were upset, `where is the Statue of Liberty scene?' Well, it's not in the book!However, all this aside, and it is a really enjoyable movie. I'm a growing fan of Mark Wahlberg, and he just proves why yet again with his talent shining through. There's a superbly crafted ending here too, and one that I so enjoyed. This was another sticking point for some critics.My advice would be, drop the ideas from the original, and go and see this movie with fresh eyes.</fullReview>

And I like car chases and when stuff blows up. And I like science fiction.But even with these factors in my favor, I was very disappointed by Planet of the Apes.The film is poorly acted -- especially the natives, and the world does not seem realistic, so instead of being spooky we don't really get drawn in. Most importantly, I don't like a sub-intellectual film that insults my intelligence. Some of the plot twists just didn't make any sense. The original version had something to say; that all gets lost here.What a disappointment, and the ending was brutally concocted and unsatisfying.Who should see this film:-- Sci-fi film buffs who didn't mind the stupidity inthe remake of "Lost in Space", or "Independence Day"(which admittedly is a lot of people)-- I can't think of anyone elseI regret I can only give "Planet of the Apes" an uninspired 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so looking forward to watching Planet Of The Apes and in the end i wasn't disapointed athough i dont think this version had the same impact on me as the original. The special affects are superb as is the story and like the original it has a great ending. I'm not saying what happened was a suprise because mostly everything that happened during the film was very predictable but dont let that distract you from what is an entertaining movie. When you have a movie that involves such heavy make up you lose a lot,when it comes to acting,which is a shame because you certainly would not have know that underneath all that make up there was superb actors such as Tim Roth and Charlton Heston. In fact they could have saved thierselves a lot of money and had lessor actors in the apes role.All in all a couple of hours of good entertainment. 8 out 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. When I first heard that Planet of the Apes was being remade, I was so incredibly disgusted. I loved the original series of movies, and I felt there was absolutely no way they could even come close to making a decent film. And I was pleasantly shocked. Right from the beginning of the film, you could tell it was directed very well. And the movie kept a very good pace, I was never bored. I loved the costumes, the music, and the attention to detail. I also thought the film was very well acted by all. In a weird sense, I was reminded of Star Wars, maybe it was the scenes of the ape city. The ending, I'm not sure it sat well with me, but I understood why it was done that way. I really enjoyed this film, which is a very rare occurrence these days. I'm a movie snob and tend to only like the older films. But this new film was very good and I highly recommend it. The story stands out on it's own and doesn't need the original films at all. Even Charlton Heston's cameo was great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually prefer originals to the remakes, however this one is an exception. I was trully surprised by Burton's handling of this story with a respect for the original in intent. The cameo appearances and treasured lines we all look to hear were brought back and with a twist in context. When reviewing the deleted material on the DVD, I was puzzled why two very detailed scenes were redone which tied up a couple of loose ends the finished story failed to answer. The time differences were not great, so I am not sure why they were removed. With the exception of the choice of Mark Wahlberg (who I still feel cannot act his way out of a paper sack) Tim Burton did a superb job. This one is worth the purchase if you have a great home theatre system.</fullReview>

The ape makeup on the actors does look convincing. And having them actually move like apes was a nice touch. But, to tell the truth, the new twist ending didn't really make sense.

The end is a cliché and the snappish satire from the brilliant original is totally missing! Instead of it you`re getting a breathtaking, but finally also very empty popcorn movie, enriched with some pseudo-moral..! Actors like Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan or Paul Giamatti are doing solid jobs, but the excellent Roddy McDowall, who played Cornelius/Cesar, can´t be replaced be anyone!!

		<fullReview>Tim Roth seemed a bit apologetic at the Edinburgh Film Festival premiere of this movie `It's just a bit of fun . . . treat it as a bit of fun' he kept saying. Well Tim, get a family of four together with nowt to do on a Saturday afternoon and it might be a bit of fun. Gather several hundred film addicts together for the surprise movie of the festival and expecting the same reception is a bit much (especially when they could see it at half the price the next day when it went on general release). The costumes are very good: technology and makeup has come a long way since the first cult movie classic of the same name. Unfortunately script seems to have gone backwards. The movie starts promisingly enough with a space station time-slip introduction. But having gone to enormous lengths to create the situation and life-like apes, the whole thing is ruined by resting on awful dialogue and corny 20th century jokes that are guaranteed to avert any suspension of disbelief. These super-intelligent apes toy with humans that they capture and one can't help feeling the filmmaker is toying with the audience too. One is reminded of Director Tim Burton's reputed comment that he only wanted to make movies in order to make money. If he has shown great originality and creativity in recent films to suggest he didn't mean that, this film, on the other hand, simply looks like little more than one narrow filmmaker's dream come true again . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very good re-imagining of the 1969 classic. I went to the theater with high expectations (because, let's face it, it's Tim Burton), and this movie struck a cord with me, because it is my favorite Sci-Fi film in the last decade and a half, the movie was 'Aliens'.Mark Wahlberg did a very good job as the lost Capt. Leo Davidson, but my hat goes off to General Thade himself, Tim Roth. He was *excellent* as the sadistic, human loathing primate villain. Michael Clark Duncan also was perfect support as Thade's brutish right hand man, Colonel Attar.Every one who was an ape did an excellent job at moving like actual primates. The score kept you with the flow of the movie, the choreography was marvelous, and the acting was good. The action sequences were very intense, and the chase between the humans and Thade's Army was very suspenseful. There was an outstanding surprise to the end of this movie, it was very unexpected. I recommend this movie to any one who wants an exciting, special effects adventure, but this movie also has a very surprise end, good acting, and a great plot. Do not compare this to the original, because the only thing connects them is a title. Also, Charlton Heston made a pleasing cameo as Thade's father, and blurts out the most famous quote in sci-fi movie history! If you have a choice between this, and Jurassic Park 3, pick this, because this has excitement AND brains. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of the Oops!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not entirely familiar with all of the other Planet of the Apes films, but I don't think there could be anything in any of them that would change my mind about the 2001 version. We start off with an electrical storm in space that results in some serious time travel, just like we saw in Lost In Space, which results in our hero winding up thousands of years in the future and on an unknown planet. Seconds after surviving the crash landing of his pod on this mysterious planet, Leo Davidson (Mark Walhberg) finds himself surrounded by fleeing HUMANS. The first thing I thought was that there are humans and apes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy roughly 5000 years in the future, but later we learn (also as seen in Lost In Space) that Leo's ship also passed through that time warp and landed in the same place, leaving the humans to go into submission to the out-of-control apes that were on the ship for experimentation, and the apes themselves were left to evolve and take control, ultimately turning into the hard-nosed apes that ruled the planet when Leo crash landed. That was a mouthful. Pretty creative though, once we are eventually informed as to what the hell is going on. So Leo is stuck on this planet where the roles are basically reversed and exaggerated between humans and apes, and now it is entirely up to Leo to save this planet's version of the human race from the oppression of the apes. Tim Roth delivers a horribly annoying performance as General Thade, the militant leader of the apes who is so filled with hatred for the humans (for reasons never made entirely clear) that he operates just like a machine. He's always grunting and growling and always has his head tilted downward like he's expecting physical confrontation at all times, and his constant guttural tone of voice makes him almost amusing after a while. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that the apes are so well made up, but they also have tremendous intelligence, as is made evident by their strikingly human eyes, and yet they switch back and forth from normal speech to the same screeching and screaming that you hear from the monkeys at the zoo. There is a scene where General Thade is told that the humans crossed the river using the apes' own horses, and he jumps all around the place, screeching and jumping and breaking things, and then he's back on the ground talking like a warrior. It's so hard to take this stuff seriously.Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Ari, the weirdly attractive ape who is disgruntled with the way that the humans are treated by the apes, and who turns against her own kind to help the humans escape. There is a childish scene at the end of the film where Leo kisses Ari that is sure to get a laugh from any audience, while the stunningly but almost weirdly beautiful Estella Warren provides the human love interest. It's a good thing that they had a human woman in this movie to take romantic interest in Leo, because without her we only have Ari, who is 100% ape but who acts exactly like a human woman while interacting with Leo. For the first half of the film, I was a little nervous about the possibility of a little bestiality happening somewhere in there. So we know that Ari is helping the humans because she is disillusioned with her violent species, but they are also accompanied by another ape - Attar, I think (hey, half the fun was trying to figure out who was underneath all that make-up, right?) - and we never know why he agrees to go along, knowing that he will face severe punishment upon returning, which is one of the movies more simplistic but peeving oversights. It is, however, the ending of the film that ruins it beyond all hope for being saved.At the beginning of the film, when Leo took off in the pod toward the electrical storm, he was going after the pod of his chimp, with whom all communication had been lost. He gets swept away in the same electrical storm as the chimp got caught in, and winds up on the planet described above. At the end of the film, the chimp comes through right in the middle of the climactic battle between the humans and the apes, and the apes bow down to him as their god. This was actually a pretty clever scene, because he was, in fact, one of the first apes of their civilization, and then Leo trades places with him, leaving him with Ari (and with an obviously broken leg, which we're left to assume turned out okay) and taking the ship back to his own time. And General Thade, I guess, was just left sulking under that console on the ship forever, doomed to live the rest of his life as a loose end in a sub-par sci fi movie. It was bad enough that everything on the ship still worked after thousands of years, now they have to leave stuff everywhere unexplained.So we get back to Earth, Leo survives the entrance through the atmosphere and then miraculously survives another violent crash landing without a scratch, and he finds the Lincoln Monument is an ape (when I saw Lincoln from behind, I jokingly said to myself that it would be an ape. I was disappointed and amused to find that I was right). This could, of course, mean only one thing. Seeing how there was barely an explanation for the English speaking humans and apes on the planet on which most of the film took place, and there was literally none at all given for the apes replacing the humans on Earth, we can only assume that they ran out of money or they are just setting up for a sequel. My money is on the latter. Stay tuned for part 9 (or so).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O Tim Burton, where art thou?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like Tim Burton- Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, Ed Wood, Batman, Beetle Juice and Sleepy Hollow are all great movies. The thing is this remake(or re-imagining if you like) is not, in fact this could very well be Burton's worst movie, even worse than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and that could have been much better. Tim Burton, what has happened to you? Before I get to the many negatives of this film, I will say the apes are very well done. Their mannerisms and the way they move are perfectly convincing. Plus Danny Elfman's score was pretty good, it's no Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish but it's good enough. And the scenery and special effects are fantastic.However, that is all the praise I can give it. I am briefly going to say it is vastly inferior to the 1968 classic, which was much more exciting and much better written as well. The script is awful, not quite Pearl Harbor kind-of-awful, but some of it is lame and unintentionally cheesy. The story takes a while to get going and meanders all over the place, not helped by pedestrian pacing and drawn out scenes and very rarely gets interesting. Plus is it me, or does the film get unnecessarily loud at times? Tim Burton's direction was also a disappointment, usually his films are full of heart, that's what made Edward Scissorhands especially such a gem, but here he seems lost, bogged down might I say. On top of that, the character development is non-existent, as is the chemistry between the actors and the characters are extremely clichéd, especially Kris Kristofferson's character. And the acting didn't fare that much better, Mark Wahlberg is a bland lead, while Estella Warren acts like a zombie throughout. Then we have Tim Roth trying hard and giving the only credible performance as Thade, and Helena Bonham Carter wasted as sympathetic Ari, while Paul Giamatti is useless. Not even the talented David Warner can save this film. And don't get me started on the ending, what a bummer, so predictable and obvious.Overall, a case of all style no substance. Definitely not Burton's finest hour. 3/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "director's commentary" on the DVD explains ... uh, not much!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS - Watching the DVD of "Planet of the Apes (2001)" with the director's comentary "on", the most revealing thing is when Burton mentions "comments on the internet" -- folks like you and me, puzzled with the ending, actually got director Burton's attention! Before the internet, and DVDs with commentary, this sort of feedback was impossible. Think about that for a minute, to realize the possible future impact!!(And I pause to add, if any of you who think you are true film fans, but are not yet watching movies on DVD, are still in the dark ages. Get a grip, your head out of the sand, and upgrade, there's no comparison.)"Planet (1968)" is a fine, fine movie. The pacing is just right, the acting is first-rate, and when we get to the end, and see lady Liberty sitting there on the shore, everything in the story comes together. "Planet (2001)" is not that kind of movie. Director Burton didn't want it to be. He wanted it purposefully to be ambiguous.SPOILERS, again - When Leo gets back to Earth, in what looks like our current time (judging by the vehicles, the D.C. buildings, the clothes, the cameras, etc) he encounters something he did not expect. Although Burton could explain how it got that way, he chooses not to, for the sake of a possible sequel by the studio. He, or we, could think up a number of scenarios, but we must assume that the events depicted in this film are responsible for changing the past some time way back, so that evolution proceeded on a diferent path. You see, the "apes" he returns to are quite different from the apes he encountered at first, and escaped from. These apes did not shuffle around, but walked like we do. They drove cars, rode motorcycles, used cameras, flew helicopters.The whole point of Burton's film was to show the "circular" nature of time travel and changes it might trigger. If Leo had not chased the chimp, then his crew and mothership had not chased him, and crashed, allowing this ape race to flourish, then history would not have changed. That is the only germane dramatic element here, that Leo instantly felt the whole burden of this adverse change in the history of mankind, his decision to chase the chimp dramatically altered the history of mankind.This is only a story, a fictional film, so let's not get too wrapped up in it. However, it does illustrate a truism that we seldom focus on. Each of us, in everyday life, make decisions, do things, that trigger other things, and so on. If we could go back a day, or a week, or a year, and make a totally different yet still "correct" set of decisions, our whole present and future would be different. And that's what happened in "Planet (2001)" -- Leo's decision had an unimaginable influence on mankind. I wonder if the writer and director thought that deeply about the message??This is not a very good film, but not nearly as bad as a few reviewers say it is. I found it fairly entertaining for the most part, and generously rate it "7" of 10. Much has been made of the "13 hours of extras" in the 2 DVD set. Well, unless you are a die-hard "Planet of the Apes" fan, most of the "extras" are just not that interesting, once you've seen the movie. Aside from Burton's choice to not explain the story, I found it interesting how he has difficulty completing a sentence with a complete thought. Maddening to listen to. I'm sure he is a fine director, but the guy just doesn't have the ability to complete a thought!</fullReview>

The film itself was a dud, and got a ruthless beating from critics and the general public, despite making a profit in theaters.The problem is that they tried to "re-imagine" the original much in the same way that "Batman Begins" was a restart of the Batman franchise - but "Begins" did it well, and "Planet of the Apes" was not as skillful.Tim Burton has some die-hard cult fans on this site who are quick to blame studio interference, but I think the real problem is that Burton was given too much free roam. Armed with a $100,000,000 budget and a very mainstream, action-oriented picture - something he had only ever ventured upon with "Batman" more than a decade prior - he just couldn't get a grip on any aspect of the feature. It's a very loose, jumbled, unfocused picture - full of absurdity, stupidity and downright hammy acting.Mark Wahlberg plays the hero, an astronaut who is transported through a black hole to another galaxy where apes rule the world and humans are their slaves. Leading a revolt against the apes, he fights for the rights of humanity - becoming a Jesus Christ figure for all the other humans...a "savior." The ending throws in an illogical and pointless twist that is just there for the sake of shocking people. It undermines the rest of the film and makes you kind of go, "So what was the point of everything that happened before this?" Burton's worst film, and one of the more disappointing films I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing like the original, but just as impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first time I watched the classic series for the first time, not too long ago. My initial impression: Shock. I had never before witnessed such a captivated tale. The series kept getting better with each movie. Not long after I found out that Tim Burton was to remake "The Planet of the Apes" and I asked myself, "Why bother?" The original series have hardly aged a bit and are still vastly entertaining to watch. Even though the original is over 30 years old, it doesn't feel like it at all. I felt there was no need for a remake. I saw the new film on opening day, and I have to say I was disappointed. The movie wasn't as shocking as the original. It wasn't as captivating. It wasn't anything like the original. The only thing that seemed to save it was the truly shocking twist ending. It really made me think for a while, but, eventually, I gave up. It didn't make sense to me at all. Then, I decided to throw all my initial thoughts of the film away and decided to go see it again for a second opinion, and, this time, I was blown away. Rarely do I see a film and loathe it only to go see it again and absolutley love it. I didn't compare it to the original as I did the first time, and I think that's the reason I completely hated it the first time around. Tim Burton really did an amazing job creating a whole new world of apes where humans are slaves. The cinematography, the set designs, and just about every technical aspect of the film is a marvel, especially the make up and costume designs. Danny Elfman's score is one of his best, and at times, very frightening. The acting is also top notch, from Wahlberg's subtle but heroic portrayal of Leo, to Roth who is absolutely stunning as General Thade. This has got to be the most impressive movie of the summer, if not the year, easily on par with "Hannibal". Just don't go see it and compare it with the original. My grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's worst film to date. His style is missing. ** (out of four).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES / (2001) ** (out of four)By Blake French: "Planet of the Apes" is a $100 million remake that makes its points so many times that we eventually stop caring and begin to lose interest. The film is well made and has a lot of interesting material, but it's been done before, and we don't need five or six examples of grizzly apes abusing humans just to prove the fact that apes treat humans harshly. "Planet of the Apes" quickly becomes redundant and outstays its welcome. The production turns into a tool to impress us with the amazing set pieces and dazzling make up effects. This movie is a waste of the talents of director Tim Burton. The year is 2029. An astronaut named Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) lives on a large United States Air Force space station that contains a large selection of apes used for space exploration. One of his beloved apes gets launched into space?but something goes wrong. He decides to go against the captain's orders and take a ride on a small space pod to rescue the animal and explore the unknown territory himself. Again, something goes wrong. What kind of scientist would launch himself into some unknown abyss in space when an experiment just proved the area dangerous? Leo must be suicidal, stupid, or both. Anyway, he finds himself stuck in some kind of time warp that blasts him into the future on a mysterious planet where talking apes control the world and humans live in cages.He meets several resident humans there, like Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), and his grown daughter Daena (Estella Warren). They are captured by military forces and delivered to a human slave trading ape named Limbo (Paul Giamatti). Leo has a difficult time understanding this world, but luckily, there is an ape who shows compassion towards humans. Her name is Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), and we are not surprised when she offers Leo and his fellow humans a chance to escape from the planet of the apes. Although none of these characters are particularly memorable, one stands out in my mind as an absolute nuisance: General Thade (Tim Roth), the planet's head military leader. He isn't scary, shocking, or disturbing, just really, really unpleasant. Tim Roth, a good actor, goes way over the top with this simple-minded character-to the point where I hated him. Not because he's the villain, but because his screen presence is irksome. It's just an unpleasant performance for an unpleasantly stupid character. Something about the time frame doesn't seem right. Let's examine this: Leo jumps into the future, where apes rule the planet. Once on the planet, he discovers his old space crew came to rescue him and crashed. This is where the apes become out of control, and take over the planet. Good insight there. But the crew crash landed on the planet thousands of years earlier, according to a character in the movie. Leo has only been on the planet for days. Hmmmm. Something here just doesn't add up. I guess I am thinking too hard for a movie that isn't supposed to make you think that much. If you can clear this up for me, please drop me a line. It'll be much appreciated and save many hours of sleep that would otherwise be spent wondering about this. There is something else that bothers me about "Planet of the Apes." The make up effects are stunning-so good that I could not tell who the actor was under the ape makeup and costume. So here's my question: why spend millions of dollars on big name actors like Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Helena Bonham Carter when you're going to smoother them in make up beyond recognition? The actor could have been my neighbor for all that I knew. The filmmakers might have liked the voices and energy of the actors, I guess.I give the movie credit for making us care about the humans. By the end, during an involving and intense war sequence between human and ape-kind, I was definitely rooting for the humans. I also liked the way it reveals the plot. But "Planet of the Apes" could have been so much more. Tim Burton's style isn't obvious here, either. He does inject a convincing and masterfully crafted atmosphere, but it doesn't entrance us like "Batman," "Edward Scissorhands," or "Sleepy Hollow." It think that's because the movie concentrates so hard on the plot and special effects, it never relaxes and explores such themes as isolation, loneliness, or racism. "Plant of the Apes" is a wasted opportunity.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human-like apes rule the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After digesting the hype and then taking in Tim Burton's remake of "The Planet of the Apes", I felt cheated or let us say disappointed. It was by no means any better than the original. An astronaut(Mark Wahlberg) lands on a planet where apes rule over humans, ok. He then tries to lead a revolution, ok. The twisted ending is the only captivating part of the movie. The set designs were awesome, cinematography out of sight and the special effects very good. This is a very interesting movie, but lacks the impact of the original. Danny Elfman proves again to be a wizard when it comes to scoring a movie.Supporting cast features Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Clark, Kris Kristofferson, Michael Clarke Duncan and Estella Warren. There is no reason to not think this movie can last over thirty years like the original and still be worth viewing. Hang on to the youngsters and your popcorn. A fun flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton Goes Ape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good news is that this re-make doesn't completely ruin the original; still, if you haven't seen the 1968 "Planet of the Apes", view the older film first. That film's "landmark" moment is one of the all-time great moments in science fiction films. The "memorial" in this new version is a science fiction failure, a cheap stunt, which makes no contextual sense. What else? well, this film has all-talking, clean-shaved humans. The sophisticated 1968 model apes are abandoned in favor of goofiness. The "attraction" between human Mark Wahlberg (as Leo Davidson) and chimp woman Helena Bonham Carter (as Ari) dies on the vine. And, worst of all, Roddy McDowall is no longer available...**** Planet of the Apes (2001) Tim Burton ~ Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great retelling of a classic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Pierre Boulle wrote the original book "The Monkey Planet", he was mostly known for the classic story "Bridge Over The River Kwai".When it was made into a movie in 1968, Charlton Heston ingrained this movie permanently in our minds. He was also a driving force in the creation of the original, having read the original book and helping to bring it to the attention of the money men in Hollywood and carrying it from original concept to final completion.In fact, the original movie is such a classic, it spawned 4 sequals and 2 TV series (1 live action and one animated). It's influence was so wide, that when "Welcome Back Kotter" premiered on TV, the character Arnold Horshack carried a POTA lunchbox wherever he went.This new version in many ways is both closer to the original book, and also deviates much more.The effects and makeup in this version are spectacular. Much as the original revolutionized makeup for decades to come, this one will also show it's influence for a long time. Rather then use computer graphics to create the apes, the use of makeup and appliances is spectacular.Tim Burton did a fantastic job on this movie. And of course, what is a Tim Burton movie without Danny Elfman doing the musical score. Combined, they have made a movie that is sure to be a classic for years to come.One of the biggest differences is that the classes of ape are not as seperated as they were in the original.In the original, Chimps all wore green and were scientists. Gorillas wore black and were military, and Orangutangs wore orange and were clergy/politicians. In this they are more diverse, and there even seems to be hints of cross-species breeding. This makes for a much more diverse history, and more potential for both conflict and support.Also, the humans in this version are able to talk, but they strive to hide that fact from the apes. And as the humans are more human then in the original, the apes are more ape like. They frequently jump around and climb on things, write with their feet, touch and groom each other, and in general are more like evolved apes should be.The cast is excellent, with both Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa playing excellent roles. Michael Clarke Duncan is one of the best new actors in the business today, and this role is as far as possible from The Green Mile.Tim Burton added several subtle and not so subtle pokes and images from both the original and contemporary society into the movie. From Charlton uttering his classic "Damn them all to hell" again, to an Orangutang saying the Rodney King line "Can't we all just get along", to having another orangutang rub himself with flower petals while upside down, very reminiscant to "American Beauty".Of course, the most memorable part of the original movie is the ending. The image of Charlton Heston looking at the wreckage of the Statue Of Liberty is forever burned into our minds. In much the same way, this ending will also be burned into our minds. And in many ways, the ending this time is much closer to the original ending as written by Pierre Boulle.I am curious to how they will do a sequal to this movie. In today's market, everything from American Pie to Wayne's World have sequals. And this is really the first time that a movie spawned a series of sequals (the 007 movies do not count, since they do not sequal in any order, and were based on a series of books). So it will be interesting to see if this movie spawns a similar series of sequals.If you loved the original movie, you have to see this one.In addition to Charlton Heston, look for a cameo by Linda Harrison, the actress that played Nova in the original movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another example of why Burton and Roth are so good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet Of The Apes" clearly has the "Tim Burton" seal on it, but unfortunately shows both imaginative and argumental development voids, which I blame not to bad directing, but to an irregular script, revised and changed thousands of times, due in part to the late entrance of Mr. Burton in the project. However, here I'm going to focus on the most positive points, rather than the negative ones.The Seal I talked before is present as in any of Burton's films. I mainly refer to the conception of the eccentric, delirious, out-of-this-world characters and to the Gothic-romantic, fantastic art direction this films radiates (I don't have to mention previous examples, but Batman, Nightmare and Edward are and will remain in our minds). Danny Elfman gives again the best of himself with a dynamic, at times majestic score where percussion leads.The apes are incredible, they work, they really rock in the show. Not only for Rick Baker's make-up masterpiece (which deserves not the nomination but the Academy Award NOW!), which gives them live and expression unlike 1968's sort of dummies, but because they are credible... and light years far more credible (and even more human) than the film's humans, except for Mr. Whalberg. The script said they had to talk this time.Can anybody tell me if they liked them? If they found their importance to their dialogues? And why Stella Warren hasn't been issued with the "manikin" label, as Jake Lloyd was in "Episode 1"? The native roles show no interest and slow the rhythm of the movie.Now, returning to the apes, I have to talk about the real showman:Tim Roth as Thade. Exceptional. Histrionic. Aggressive. Cool. Evil portrayed as an ape. As the Ape General, he gets so very deep into the role that you end up thinking Roth, after all his extense and peculiar filmography, has finally turned crazy and really believes he's a monkey free in the stage. He is of the very few actors, along with Gary Oldman, Edward Norton and De Niro, which I consider as chameleons:ready to face any kind of role, however obscure, violent or psychologically strong they are.About the rest, I'm definitely getting in love with Helena Bonham Carter (another example of the ape's astonishing expressivity),and Mark Whalberg is fine as always. I liked his role, in comparison with Heston's in 1968, because he is a pure survivor who wants to go home with his friends and family (he just doesn't fit in that planet), while Charlton arrived there by accident and became a revolutionary hero. .To finish with, about the ending: perfect. I love it. And I love it because 1) It is different, it's of the few which make the viewer's imagination work, so anyone can figure out an explanation to the ending the way they want, 2) Its philosophy, the paradox it represents, which I'm not going to tell, and 3)It is extremely "Burtonesque"."Planet Of The Apes" reflects again the style of an excellent director, but shows his vulnerability in works he doesn't personally project (remember the initial idea came from James Cameron), in which a studio, and not himself, determines most of the finished work. However, an entertaining film, recommended to any sci-fi lover. And an advice: read the original book by Pierre Boulle for another view of the story... Vote --- 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How in the name of everything holy could Tim Burton do this to us?! The director best known for "Beetlejuice", Batman", "Edward Scissorhands", and "Sleepy Hollow", gives us something that looks like it should star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Everyone knows what happens, but the dialogue is just silly - mainly mocking the original. Mark Wahlberg, as hero Leo Davidson, does as good as he can, but he can't escape the fact that this movie (correction: this remake) should have never been made. The only remotely interesting scene is the end. All in all, Wahlberg suffers, as do Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, and everyone else. Dreadful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit I only saw this the once and thought it wasn't a great film, in fact, for a while I hated it, but seeing it again, I can see why critics give it three stars out of five, and that it actually is a pretty good film from director Tim Burton (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow). If you have seen the original 1968 film, plus the sequels ("Beneath the...", "Escape from the...", "Conquest of the..." and "Battle for the...") then you would know this is a new vision, and mix of all of them (well, besides Escape from, that takes place of Earth). Basically it is 2029, and in a space station, where monkeys are trained to carry out missions, one monkey is sent out, and disappears in the large space cloud, and without permission his friend Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) speeds after him in a space pod, and doing so gets sucked into the wormhole, and crashes in the jungle of an unknown planet, similar to Earth (well, it is). Soon enough though he is captured along with many other humans by human acting and talking apes, and like Charlton Heston before, almost the first words spoken, by ape warrior Attar (The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan) are "Get you stinking hands (paws) off me, you damned dirty human (ape)". Anyway, the planet is afraid of humans, and will only use them as slaves, and sympathetic chimpanzee activist Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter, Burton's fiancée) is pretty much the only ape who thinks humans should be treated equally. Eventually Leo manages to escape with some other humans, including Daena (Estella Warren) with the help of Ari, and they head to where Leo sees a signal on his still working locater. When they get there, the ships appears to have crashed, and there for thousands of years, well, you did the see the travel clock going up rapidly. Meanwhile, the army lead by the great vicious villain Thade (a very aggressive performance by Reservoir Dogs' Tim Roth) is preparing an army to fight the battle for the planet. In the end, thankfully Thade is trapped for lying about humans and apes originally getting on, Leo gets a new pod when his monkey friend lands, and he heads back to Earth, but when he lands in front of the Lincoln memorial, it has the face of Thade (!), just like the ending of the original with the Statue of Liberty buried on the beach. Also starring Paul Giamatti as Limbo, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull, David Warner as Sandar, Blade's Kris Kristofferson as Karubi, The Mummy's Erick Avari as Tival, Luke Eberl as Birn, Chris Ellis as Lt. General Karl Vasich, Lisa Marie (Burton's ex) as Nova, Deep Roy as Gorilla Kid/Thade's Niece, and a cameo by the star of the first original, Charlton Heston as Zaius, Thade's Father. The changes besides most of the story are that the humans are not dumb, there's no Dr. Zaius (Heston's character isn't him, he's a general), there's no Roddy McDowall or Kim Hunter, and of course the make-up is obviously more updated, a good remake. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up/Hair. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninvolving Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I despair when Hollywood does remakes , they never get it right. The script to this remake of the classic PLANET OF THE APES contains far too much self referential humour where characters quote Hitler , Orwell and Charlton Heston , and go on for far too long about human rights. Yes we get the message , just a pity the screenwriters didn`t spend so long on developing the script more.Visually the sets are good as is Tim Roth`s make up , but this is the only success Tim Burton has with the film. Didn`t he realise that in the original apes were split into differing castes down to their species ? Here we see an ape army composed of all types of apes.Why ? I have no idea . And worst of all gone is the mystery and other worldliness of the original. Remember the scenes where the Earth astronauts trek through the forbidden zone and the first appearance of the apes or that final scene ? In the remake we have no similar impact.There`s a rumour that there might be a sequel in the pipeline. I hope not</fullReview>
