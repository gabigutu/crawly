		<shortDescription>Not the '60's &amp; '70's cheesy film you may fear!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one I know under 40 had seen this film, though we all joked about it as being a stereotypical "bad" film based on rumors. the title, and clips seen here and there. Finally one weekend when I was working until 2:00 a.m. I went home and there was a sequel on late night TV, during the 30 year Planet of the Apes marathon. It made me curious about the original and I tracked it down. I have to say it blew me away!The film is philosophical, creative, absorbing and scary. Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it. So far I haven't even been able to convince my friends to see it because there seems to be such a strong prejudice against it and some sort of entrenched belief it must be bad; in fact it is one of the finest films I've seen and I can see why it is a classic.If you enjoy films that make you think you simply can't dislike Planet of the Apes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Science Fiction Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 1968, two movies came out that changed modern day science-fiction films forever, 2001 A Space Odyssey was the most famous out of the two, but Planet of the Apes stands on its own ground and became a classic that it is universally acclaimed to be. Planet of the Apes is still way better than all of the sequels and remakes that has even been made.I remember the first time, I watched Planet of the Apes. I was a major Sci-Fi geek who loved Star Wars and Blade Runner. I was sitting down on the couch with my nerdy glasses, watching T.V. When all of a sudden the movie started, my friends told me the movie was very cheesy and lame. So I had extremely low expectations, but I told, whatever, I'll give it a try. After the film finished, I was completely flabbergasted and amazed to have seen this work of art. The visuals were great and the movie was extremely entertaining. But that's not the main reason I loved the film so much. It raises a lot of questions about our modern day society without letting social commentaries get in the way of the drama and action.The movie is easily one of the top ten best Sci-Fi films ever created, it stands high up with Star Wars, 2001 A Space Odyssey and The Day the Earth Stood Still. If you're a Sci-Fi, this movie is highly recommended because it deals with philosophical and sociological questions and its a must have.10/10 for this Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark SF film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1968s PLANET OF THE APES has been my favorite film since I first saw it in April of that year when I was eight years old. The movie had a huge impact back then and I cannot emphasize more the power to grip the imagination it had -- and has -- and the shock the final image of the movie was back then. I literally left the theatre stunned and speechless. No other movie of my youth had such impact, or created such suspension of disbelief. Over the past thirty-four years PLANET OF THE APES has attained classic status and it's a tribute to the film's excellence that there are so many comments left here on the Internet Movie Database that this film is better than the viewer thought it would be, or that it wasn't campy or cheesy as they'd always thought, or that it was more intelligent and thought-provoking than most films they've ever seen, and that despite the studio stupidly putting the final shot -- one of the most famous last shots in the history of American cinema -- on the cover of the video, they were still stunned and haunted by it.PLANET OF THE APES is based on a 1963 French novel, "La planete des singes," by Pierre Boulle, most famous as the author of "La pont de la riviere Kwai" (1952), which became the 1957 film THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The story tells of a French journalist, Ulysse Merou, who, in the year 2500 travels with two companions in a near-light speed spacecraft to the red-giant star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. There they find a sister planet to earth, Soror, and after landing on a remote plateau discover a race of human beings that are no more than animals, naked and unable to speak. The three earthmen are stripped of there clothes by the humans, who hate anything that isn't natural. Their spacecraft is destroyed by the savage people and they are run off into the jungle. The next morning the tribe of wild humans are attacked by hunters, who are gorillas dressed like men, hunting like men, and acting and speaking like men. One of the earthmen is killed, another disappears, and Merou is captured, taken to a research lab, and subjected to scientific experiments.A sympathetic female animal psychologist, Dr. Zira, a chimpanzee, is intrigued by Merou keenness and soon learns that this man is highly intelligent and able to learn speech. With her help Merou learns all about the simian civilization on Soror, in which the apes live in modern cities, drive cars, fly planes, and watch TV, and where conservative orangutans, especially one named Zaius, so fear this intelligent human being that they seek to have him destroyed. With the help of Zira's fiance, an archeologist named Cornelius, Merou unwittingly discovers a secret about the origins of intelligent life on Soror that's so dangerous he's forced to flee the planet of the apes and return to earth.Boulle's novel is a satire in the tradition of Voltaire that mocks humankind's anthropocentric theory of the universe from which human beings derive their sense of importance, and is laced with the kind of harrowing ironies that Boulle was famous for.The movie based on this book is an 'Americanized' adaptation of it. Rod Serling did the first drafts of the screenplay, simplifying the plot by fitting it into the mold of his "Twilight Zone" TV series and introducing an anti-nuclear war theme not present in the Boulle novel. Because of budget constraints the modern ape civilization had to be reduced to a less technological one, something more reminiscent of ancient Greece. In fact, after Michael Wilson, who had also adapted Boulle's "Bridge Over the River Kwai" to the screen, was brought in to do the final script drafts what emerged was a political allegory more akin to an Aesop fable than a Voltairian satire.An improvement on the book was to turn the Merou character, now named Taylor, into a misanthrope and to reduce the scope of the story into a kind of 'misanthrope's comeuppance.' Charlton Heston was a perfect choice to play the unlikable American astronaut, having essayed such similar 'bastard' roles in 1954s THE NAKED JUNGLE, 1963s DIAMOND HEAD and 1963s 55 DAYS AT PEKING, and the movie would be a lot less funny and pointed without him.Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, as Cornelius and Zira, and Maurice Evans, as Dr. Zaius, enjoy some of the best performances on the screen, bringing the then-innovative makeup design of John Chambers to life under the intelligent and stylish direction of Franklin J. Schaffner. Also excellent in this Arthur P. Jacobs production for 20th Century-Fox is the veteran cinematographer Leon Shamroy's Panavision lensing, which makes great use of remote areas of southern Utah around Lake Powell to suggest an alien world, and Jerry Goldsmith's avant-garde musical score, which has become a landmark, cannot be emphasized more for contributing to the weird atmosphere and eerie mood of the movie. Rarely has a movie score so fit like hand-in-glove than this one.PLANET OF THE APES was a box office smash in 1968, but if ever there was a movie that was more a victim of its own success it's this one. Four sequels, two TV series, numerous novelizations and comic book adventures, and a lamentable remake in 2001 have been spawned by its popularity, most of which has been so inferior in quality to have tarnished the reputation of this classy and intelligent SF film landmark. Luckily the qualities of the film remind viewers again and again of what noted New Yorker movie critic Pauline Kael titled her review of this movie, "Apes must be remembered, Charlie!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone; one of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I recently, for fun, ranked my favorite films in a top 100 list, Planet of the Apes ended up at 33. It was the second sci-fi on the list, after 2001, which ranked #1. I have always been disappointed and irked at the ill-will that some people have towards Planet of the Apes. I almost assaulted someone who described Apes as "one of those so-bad-it's-funny type of movies" a few months ago. I take this film very seriously, and I wish others would do the same.I think one of the reasons there is so much animosity against this one is that it is undeniably dated. Not too much, but it would be difficult to sit a young teenager, raised on 1990s movies, down in front of it and have him/her enjoy it. Even a young adult, between the ages of 18 and 25, would find it difficult. Planet of the Apes definitely exists in a specific time, the late 1960s. This was the best decade for film, churning out tons of both American and foreign masterpieces. Times were rough, and the Vietnam War was growing in intensity by the time Planet of the Apes was made. Because of this, we see many references to the current dilemma. The film willy-nilly debates issues like hunting, violence, animal rights, evolution vs creationism, class structure, and nuclear war. Taylor tells a young, rebellious, teenage chimpanzee not to trust anyone over 30 (a common youth adage in the late 60s). Yes, it has so many topics that it seems to be about to burst at times. And, yes, the satire does go overboard once in a while. Still, it is all argued passionately. You can tell that everyone involved, even Heston, believes in what they are saying. In its own way, Planet of the Apes is as intellectual and philosophical a film as 2001. I know that, when teens and younger people go see the Tim Burton remake (which is not great, btw), there are going to be many who overpraise it and say that it is much better than the original. You would have to be mentally handicapped to honestly believe so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Planet of the Apes' is better than the 2001 remake on almost every level. May be Tim Burton's version looks better, no wonder with Burton as the director, but the direction itself, the cinematography, the story and the performances in Franklin J. Schaffner's original are much better and more interesting.Heston is Taylor, who crashes with his spaceship on what seems to be a deserted planet. He and two other survivors start searching for life. They run into other human beings, and at that time they are all attacked by apes. The apes speak English, the human beings are mute. In this society a human being is what apes are in our society. Animals, nothing more. The humans are taken for research, Taylor as well, and since he is shot in the neck he is not able to talk at first. One of his fellow survivors is dead, what happened to the other is unsure. A female ape who is a scientist discovers that Taylor understands her, and even thinks he can talk. Of course this is not what the high people in this society want to hear.The movie has some very interesting elements. Worlds are upside down, as Taylor says, and in a way the movie puts a mirror in front of us. The human beings are humiliated in exactly the way we treat animals. What would we do if another mammal suddenly knew how to speak our language? We would probably react the same as the apes do in this movie and therefore it is even more interesting.In liked the movie very much, and some very nice moments in particular. Early in the movie Taylor gets a woman in his cage. He calls her Nova (Linda Harrison). We know what the apes want, and it is funny because it is exactly how we do this kind of stuff to our animals. The apes are even surprised when Taylor wants to keep his woman, and therefore seems monogamous.With some nice touches, a great and famous ending, some quotes that will sound very familiar, Charlton Heston as a pretty good leading man, a score from Jerry Goldsmith that is perfect for a movie like this, nice direction and a fine cinematography by Leon Shamroy this movie is a very good classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only one word can describe this movie, "WOW"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely incredible. Easily in my top 10 all time, and that's saying something. This movie kept me captivated from the beginning all the way to the end. It combined a super setting and effects (at least for '68) and the casting was perfect. This movie included, in my opinion, one of the most memorable line in film history, "get your damn paws of me, you stinkin' apes!". Not to ruin it for anyone, the ending is also one of the best in film history. This easily won my award for most entertaining and original story ever, because it captivated the imagination, especially considering the fact that it could actually happen (it's a stretch, but...) This is a rather short response, but I could just go on and on saying how great it was, but it would only be redundant. Overall, this movie was absolutely incredible9.5\10 stars (I'm a tough reviewer)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get your hands off this movie, you damn dirty remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's especially interesting that "Planet of the Apes" was released a few months before "2001: A Space Odyssey", as they both look at the same question: what will become of humanity (and how did we originate)? Obviously, the really famous line is Charlton Heston's snap at his captors, and the really famous scene is the end - which I won't tell here for fear of spoiling the whole movie. And what an impressive movie it is! Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Tim Burton's remake. "POTA" should never have been remade. So, for a cinematic treat, stick to this one and avoid the remake.One more thing is that some people have pointed out that the portrayals of the simians were kinda racist. The blond, cultured orangutans are the nobles; the dark-haired, mildly nervous chimpanzees are the scientists; and the dark-skinned, incompetent gorillas are the police. Oh well. It's still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of Monkeys and Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years sci-fi have been filled with flashing lights, high-budget CGI effects and ridiculous stunts like in THE MATRIX and I, ROBOT. If you don't like one sci-fi film you're unlikely to like any as they're all the same. However, my dad took down PLANET OF THE APES from our video shelf. Unlike most sci-fi films it was made in a time that had to deal without CGI and relied completely on the break through movie make-up as well as providing what people have voted time and time again "The Greatest Film Ending". PLANET OF THE APES has a memorable cast, simple plot and it keeps your attention even as the credits are rolling at the end. Based on Pierre Boulle's lesser novel (La Plan?te des singes AKA Monkey Planet) tells of an astronaut landing on a distant planet and discovering that man's role as the superior life form has been reversed with the apes. The film has many needed changes to it to make it more watch-able and tap into the true fears at the time the film was made. In 1968, everyone lived in fear of an atomic bomb attack and PLANET OF THE APES truly taps into that fear, for reasons I will not reveal but it is understandable why the story was so popular at the time and why it shocked everyone.PLANET OF THE APES tells the story of George Taylor (Charlton Heston), when he and his doomed astronaut friends find themselves stranded on a distant planet. It seems to be inhospitable with no life. However, after travelling throughout the place, which is famously referred to as "The Forbidden Zone", discover plenty of life including ape like humans and human like apes. Taylor is shot in the neck rendering him unable to speak. Treated as a wounded animal he is taken to a human-ape study lab where he meets Zira (Kim Hunter), a sympathetic and friendly chimpanzee. She almost straight away notices that Taylor's intelligence goes far beyond that of any other human, and she encourages him to speak. However, orangutan leader Dr Zaius sneers on Zira's and her fiancé Cornelius' (Roddy McDowall) belief in any human intelligence, and won't listen to reason. Despite Cornelius' skeptical feelings towards Taylor, he agrees to help prove his intelligence which is proved once he finally says his famous line: "Take your stinking paws of me you damn dirty ape!" Heston is anything other then a likable character. Unlike Ulysse Merou in the novel Taylor is slightly moody, but a likable character who values his friendship with Zira and Cornelius. He represents what humans truly are that is self-centered, violent and dangerous. Though on stage he is reportedly (according to Laurence Olivier) truly a talented actor, on screen and in PLANET OF THE APES, Heston basically turned up and played himself. Nonetheless the character of Taylor works as you either love him or you hate him. The rebel Taylor is no different from the other pushy characters Heston has played over the years. With his tough, physical god-like body you suppose that in a film where the apes are pushing us humans about because we're basically behaving like apes he is just what the doctor ordered.Of course we all know that it's the two lovable chimps Zira and Cornelius that we remember the most in the PLANET OF THE APES films for their charm and humor they bring to the story. Hunter's portrayal of Zira was a masterpiece on its own, giving one of the most powerful performances. It's fair to say that Zira is the strongest and most developed character in the film. Indeed she is the only ape that Taylor actually likes! With her wit and admirable sense of humor it's not surprising that most people asked who their favorite character is reply "Zira". Hunter manages to make Zira what she was meant to be, more human then ape. In fact, she's more human than most of the beautiful female actresses of the 60's films. Despite the fact she looks as ugly as hell in her ape make-up the charm still shines through.Of course, if you don't love the intelligent and cool Zira, you always have intelligent and nerdy Cornelius. McDowell, next to Heston, is the most celebrated male actor in the films as he comes over as the nerd of the rebel gang that you just want to hug. In the film, Taylor seems to have a love-hate rivalry with Cornelius as they constantly challenge each other like full-blooded males do no matter how civilized. A good example of this is when Zira allows Taylor to kiss her on the lips as a goodbye and Cornelius makes his jealousy clear. However Taylor sticks up for him against Zaius, which shows not as much friendship as understanding. McDowell is an irreplaceable member of the cast who is near impossible to live up to.PLANET OF THE APES is a mark in cinema history, famous for these talented artists, gripping story and an amazing ending that shocks you, scares you, breaks you and brings you to tears with the realization that you'll never truly experience a film like this again. Anyone who is anyone owes it to himself or herself to watch this film and experience the feeling. Even people who dislike sci-fi are likely to enjoy this. A film that truly did break STAR WARS and challenged it like no other film ever could. PLANET OF THE APES will live on in all of us. It will go on forever, find its way to younger audiences and will win them over just it won over us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb exercise in fantasy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a magnificent performance, Heston plays what he considers an "existential" character... He is a cynic who hates mankind enough to make him leave the Earth in search of "something better than man." Heston tries to make sense of this "upside-down" world, and in the process, Pierre Boulle raises such issues as balance of power, racism, the role of government, and evolution... The apes are seen with cameras and guns, but strangely, the sight of a paper airplane shocks them...Schaffner's ability to focus on the human element in the face of awesome spectacle is one of his greatest assets... He uses dizzying camera effects, very enthusiastic zooming and hand-held cameras at ground level during chases..."Planet of the Apes" is a magnificent visual experience, from the emerald lake at the beginning to the threatening sea-shore at the end... The desolate landscapes of the Utah and Arizona National Parks, represented into primeval ruins, make an appropriately setting for the first appearance of the talking apes, rounding up humans like animals... The apes themselves remain an astonishing achievement of make-up and performance... John Chambers receives an Academy Award for his art...The motion picture features one of Heston's strongest, most emotional performances... Heston escapes, fights and yells... He is violently treated, caged, dragged, and hosed with powerful jets of water... He runs barefoot through hills, mountains, plains and an ape city... He is raided by gorillas on foot and on horseback, humiliated by thoughtful chimpanzees and mad ape scientists, pelted by inhabitants of the Planet of the Apes...The terrific supporting cast is wholly convincing: Maurice Evans in the role of Zaius, the scientist who does not want his race to suffer the fate of the humans; the two friendly chimpanzees named Zira and Cornelius (Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall) are superb..."Planet of the Apes" also gives us something else:-Heston and his crewmen have landed on an unknown planet... They hear sounds of galloping horses and guns being fired... But what they see is incredible... Apes on horseback!- "Bright Eyes" does surprise the apes who believe humans aren't capable... With those enraged words ("Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!"), he shakes the entire foundation of ape society and causes the Semians to retreat in shock...- The crucial scene where Taylor has been given a hearing: As he tries to explain to his captors that he's come from another planet in a spaceship, the scene cuts to the monkey tribunal - sitting in the classic "hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil, see-no-evil - pose...- When a shaved Taylor kisses Zira in front of Cornelius who is suffering without complaining... An indecisive Zira expresses: "Allright. But you're so damned ugly!"- The ultimate scene: Having finally escaped from his captors with his mate Nova (Linda Harrison), Heston rides along the beach on horseback to the Forbidden Zone, once a paradise... Suddenly he spots something unusual in the distance... He remembers what Zaius told him, "You may not like what you find!" What he can see was not a rock but salt-stained metal... As he draws closer, the camera slowly draws back and up to reveal what must come as a terrible shock... Backed by a magnificent and unusual Jerry Goldsmith musical score, "Planet of the Apes" is a stylish and thoughtful science fiction film, which starts and finishes splendidly... It is a superb exercise in fantasy, a fine suspense adventure, an exciting and provocative entertainment...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going 'Apes' Over Heston's 'Planet'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner ("Patton"), is one of the most stylized films of the late 1960's. "Planet of the Apes" - which was based on the novel by Pierre Boulle - is social commentary at it's best. The film's post apocalyptic look is breathtaking, and Roddy McDowall (Dr. Cornelius), Kim Hunter (Dr. Zira) and Maurice Evans (Dr. Zaius) are the standouts in this finely written tale by Michael Wilson and "Twilight Zone's" Rod Sterling. The ending - which is still considered one of the best twist endings of all time - still doesn't disappoint. The film spawned four sequels, novelizations, cartoons, a TV series, as well as a nicely done remake by Tim Burton. This is a must see for all film purists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apes must be remembered, Charlie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is Pauline Kael's review from the February 17th, 1968 New Yorker:"Apes Must Be Remembered, Charlie" "'Planet of the Apes' is a very entertaining movie, and you'd better go see it quickly, before your friends take the edge off it by telling you all about it. They will, because it has the ingenious kind of plotting people love to talk about. If it were a great picture, it wouldn't need this kind of protection; it's just good enough to be worth the rush."Adapted from a novel by Pierre Boulle, 'Planet of the Apes' most closely resembles George Pal's 1960 version of H.G. Wells' 1895 novel 'The Time Machine.' It's also a little like 'Forbidden Planet,' the 1956 science-fiction adaptation of 'The Tempest,' though it's perhaps more cleverly sustained than either of those movies. At times, it has the primitive force of old 'King Kong.' It isn't a difficult or subtle movie; you can just sit back and enjoy it. That should place the genre closely enough, without spoiling the theme or the plot. The writing, by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling, though occasionally bright, is often fancy-ironic in the old school of poetic disillusion. Even more often, it is crude. But the construction is really extraordinary. What seem to be weaknesses or holes in the idea turn out to be perfectly consistent, and sequences that work only at a simple level of parody while you're watching them turn out to be really funny when the total structure is revealed. You're too busy for much disbelief anyway; the timing of each action or revelation is right on the button. The audience is rushed along with the hero, who keeps going as fact as possible to avoid being castrated or lobotomized. The picture is an enormous, many-layered black joke on the hero and the audience, and part of the joke is the use of Charlton Heston as the hero. I don't think the movie could have been so forceful or so funny with anyone else. Physically, Heston, with his perfect, lean-hipped, powerful body, is a god-like hero; built for strength, he's an archetype of what makes Americans win. He doesn't play a nice guy; he's harsh and hostile, self-centered and hot-tempered. Yet we don't hate him, because he's so magnetically strong; he represents American power -- the physical attraction and admiration one feels toward the beauty of strength as well as the moral revulsion one feels toward the ugliness of violence. And he has the profile of an eagle. Franklin J. Schaffner, who directed 'Planet of the Apes,' uses the Heston of the preposterous but enjoyable 'The Naked Jungle' -- the man who is so absurdly a movie-star myth. He is the perfect American Adam to work off some American guilt feelings or self-hatred on, and this is part of what makes this new violent fantasy so successful as comedy."'Planet of the Apes' is one of the best science-fiction fantasies ever to come out of Hollywood. That doesn't mean it's art. It is not conceived in terms of vision or mystery or beauty. Science-fiction fantasy is a peculiar genre; it doesn't seem to result in much literary art, either. This movie is efficient and craftsmanlike; it's conceived and carried out for maximum popular appeal, though with a cautionary message, and with some attempts to score little points against various forms of establishment thinking. These swifties are not Swift, and the movie's posture of superiority is somewhat embarrassing. Brechtian pedagogy doesn't work in Brecht, and it doesn't work here, either. At best, this is a slick commercial picture, with it's elements carefully engineered -- pretty girl (who unfortunately doesn't seem to have had acting training), comic reliefs, thrills, chases -- but when expensive Hollywood engineering works, as it rarely does anymore, the results can be impressive. Schaffner has thought out the action in terms of the wide screen, and he uses space and distance dramatically. Leon Shamroy's excellent color photography helps to make the vast exteriors (shot in Utah and Arizona) an integral part of the meaning. The editing, though, is somewhat distracting; several times there is a cut and then a view of what we have already seen from a different angle or from much higher up. The effect is both static (we don't seem to be getting anywhere) and overemphatic (we are conscious of being told to look at the same thing another way)."The makeup (there is said to be a million dollars' worth) and the costuming of the actors playing the apes are rather witty, and the apes have a wonderful nervous, hoping walk. The best little hopper is Kim Hunter, as an ape lady doctor; she somehow manages to give a better performance in this makeup than she has ever given on the screen before." </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike the recent Tim Burton remake this can be called a great film . Franklin J Schaffner does a good job of bringing an otherworldliness ( And just how ironic is that ?) to the film , and the ending is rightly regarded as a classic moment of cinema . This is how SF should be made , with little FX and with much intelligence .No doubt a reviewer can be critical and point out that a lot of the subtext of the original novel has been culled and there`s a serious lapse in logic in that both apes and humans speak the exact same language without either stopping to point this out , but I like this film and it`s too good to pick holes at</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heston Factor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you really look at this movie from a certain perspective this really is not that good. Yet Charlton Heston some how makes this into one of best sci-fi films ever.Charlton Heston provided something that most actors don't have. He has that look into the camera that can just describe so many things about his character and portrayal. He has that action hero look yet he is by all accounts a great actor. That is why when he just looks into the camera you get a powerful sense of what is happening on the screen. Heston actually is able to portray a man put into slavery by apes. Somehow though it works.Combined with Schaffner's directing abilities Heston and him were able to really take this movie to another level. Other than the costumes of the apes, even though they were pretty impressive for that time, everything looked very realistic allowing you to really get into the movie. That quality alone of this movie separates this between the ordinary sci-fi movies. It even has a plot. It is something we are all familiar with. A person fighting for their freedom and survival. Like everything else in this film the plot was also taken to another level. The ending was not cheap either it was a bit of a surprise and was really something I won't forget. It was one of those moments in movies you won't forget. This is a true classic.If you have seen any other Heston movies you just know that he is the king of sci-fi and transforms almost every single one of them, especially this one, into an unforgettable classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think that this movie had the best shock moment at the end of the film than any other film in history. i saw this movie when i was about 9 years old and was fascinated with the thought of apes evolving on another planet and had heard nothing about the ending. when the camera pulls out at the end and shows the statue of liberty i about sh_t my pants. i was totally shocked and awed and i will always remember that moment. i think this movie holds up even today and was way better than tim burtons awful remake. i mean come on mark wahlberg versus charlton heston. heston wins this one easily. moses vs dirk diggler ha! for the times the makeup job on the apes was excellent and its too bad they had to make 4 more of these movies and ruin the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and adapted to screenplay by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling from the 1963 Pierre Boulle novel La planete des singes. It stars Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and Leon Shamroy is the cinematographer.3978 A.D. and a spaceship and its crew crash down on a distant planet. Three astronauts survive the crash, they appear to be on a planet not unlike their own, Earth. But soon they come to learn that this planet is ruled by intelligent apes, the human being is the lesser species, mute and of basic intelligence?.. It was a tough sell to studios back in the 1960s, not only was the premise that formed Pierre Boulle's novel a tricky one, but the technical aspects, cost and quality of, also had the men in suits backing away from producer Arthur P. Jacobs and beefcake actor Charlton Heston. Eventually Dick Zanuck over at Fox nervously agreed to make it as long as significant tests ensured that farce would not follow. Stumping up $50,000 for John Chambers to develop the ape make up and masks, and a successful test run acted out by Edward G. Robinson as Dr Zaius opposite Heston, Planet of the Apes was given the green light. The script went through a number of changes as Serling and Wilson tossed around ideas to improve on Boulle's page turner-Heston himself felt that the novel as written was unfilmable-and when director Schaffner came on board, he himself went for a more primitive ape world as opposed to the one under consideration that featured futuristic high rises and super advanced technology. What came out at the end of it all is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time.What would follow the success of the film is well known, a number of inferior sequels, a TV series, a remake and even a prequel in 2011. Then of course there was the toys, models, comics, cartoons and T shirts; it at times felt in the 70s that there really was a Planet of the Apes, only this one was driven by commerce. The aftermath of the original film has not done it any favours, the lines have become blurred, with so much muck and tack about, it often gets forgotten just how clinically great Schaffner's movie is. If ever there was a film that deserves to be a standalone, this is the one. Follow Heston's brawny Taylor from the pitiful planting of the stars and stripes at the beginning, to that monumental ending, and then leave it at that, do not pass go, do not venture further into any sort of monkey business. No sequel necessary, for Planet of the Apes to truly hit you with maximum impact, it all needs to end right there on that shoreline. As the great Rod Serling intended, in fact.Thematically the picture is acknowledged as being caustically strong, a sociological allegory, with pinches of racial animus just for flavouring. It might be under the guise of a sci-fi movie, but the makers aren't trying to hide it. Whilst the narrative twitches with comment, whoosh was that an aside to the Scopes trial? Film is also full of visceral thrills, pop-culture references and unnerving (alienation like) photographic beauty. The former comes with the hunt sequence, where we first meet gorilla's on horses, with guns and attitude, the latter with Shamroy's Panavision/De Luxe colour lensing of the California and Arizona locations. All enhanced by Goldsmith's aural pinging percussive led score. And while we continue to remember some of those famous bits of dialogue, we also pick up on each revisit to the film those little slices of humour slotted into the story; human see, human do, indeed. Film of course hinges on Heston's central human performance, of which he delivers athletic guts and subtle nuances in equal measure. Taylor's character arc demands repeat viewings to fully appreciate what Heston brings to the role. Take in the cynical Taylor who wanders through the Forbidden Zone in the first quarter, then marry it up to the Taylor fighting for his life in the middle, and finally to the Taylor at the denouement, it's a three pronged acting turn of some undervalued distinction. Not all muscular "presence" actors are/were able to be credible, Heston was. Around him in the monkey suits are true professionals, Hunter, McDowall, Evans (coming in for Robinson who feared for is health in the suit) and Whitmore, while Harrison in the non speaking human role of Nova does her job of looking gorgeous! All that's left to say is that Schaffner, who would win the Academy Award for Best Director two years later for Patton, pulls it all together neatly. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic and energetic science-fiction movie with a terrific Charlton Heston</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This known story is the first and best of the primates series; it starts when Taylor(recently deceased Charlton Heston) and three astronauts crash on a far planet and encounter a culture where the simians rule over. At the start they trek taken across the desert. Later discover humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts. Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum. A couple of gorillas named Cornelius(Roddy McDowall) and Zira(Kim Hunter) think otherwise and even agree Taylor escape, accompanied by a gorgeous native named Nova(Linda Harrison). He's trapped and judged by Dr. Zaius(Maurice Evans) and the president of assembly(James Withmore).This is a classic sci-fi movie with metaphysical significance and reflexion about origin of human being, though also packs action, adventures, intrigue and entertainment. In spite of time, the original energy remains and results to be an agreeable fantasy. Exciting writing credits by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson from Pierre Boulle novel, though the amazing final scripted by Serling. One of the important attributes of this work, is the excellent, spectacular production design by Walter Scott. Glimmer and luminous cinematography by Leon Shamroy. Magnificent make-up by John Chambers, a first-rate expert, such as proved in 'Blade runner, Ssss, Island of Dr Moreau' among others. The picture is fabulously directed by Franklyn J Schaffner, utilizing a great visual sense. The film won two nominations for Academy Award, the best costume and sensational musical score by a top-notch Jerry Golsmith,- Schaffner's usual: Patton, Papillon-, and deservedly won Oscar for make-up by Chambers. Schaffner was an impressive director with hits : 'Boys from Brazil, Papillon, Patton, War lord', but also flops, : 'Lionheart, Island of streams, Nicholas and Alexandra and Sphinx'. Schaffner was one of the most innovate creative minds from the 70s and 80s.Followed by four inferior sequels and a TV series, as 'Beneath of the planet of apes'(70, Ted Post), 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes'(73, J.Lee Thompson).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Simians Take Over...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been avoiding watching 'Planet of the Apes' for a long time as I thought it would be one of those silly futuristic sci-fi movies with men fighting monkeys. However, the movie turned out to be so much more. The limited use of special effects give it an authentic look. Schaffner makes fine use of his equipments and crew. The reddish mountainous desert-landscape is mysterious and fascinating. The cinematography is good too. The makeup is terrific and beats what any CGI could have done. The plot is simple and yet engaging. One wonders what Taylor's fate will be. Just one you think it will take a predicted turn, you are thrown away with a surprising but layered twist. Some parts of the film are quite disturbing to watch (the museum sequence and the ending). The legendary Charlton Heston does a great job. Even though he brings the same persona that was evident in his other works, it is what Taylor required. However, the show-stealers are Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter. Hunter's funny, witty, compassionate and clever Zira and McDowell's nerdy, dedicated and devoted Cornelius bring a wonderfully humane quality to their characters. 'Planet Of The Apes' deserves to be watched because it is a well-made and marvelously acted film but it also raises some relevant questions regarding humanity and nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlton Heston is the only survivor of a space expedition that has crashed on a planet some millions of light years from earth, and thus some 2,000 years in the future. He stumbles into a rude civilization in which apes rule, while the tribes of speechless humans are treated as wild animals and periodically rounded up for experimentation or extermination. Heston is wounded in the throat during his capture and is rendered mute like the others. Since he demonstrates signs of intelligence, he is singled out for behavioral examination and kept in a cage with a female of the species. The apes argue over whether he actually has brains or is simply aping his betters. When he regains his speech, it upsets everyone's view of life as it should be, as it's written down in the "scrolls" by the "law giver." His chief enemy is an orang-utan played by Maurice Evans. With the help of two enlightened scientific chimpanzees, Kim Hunter and Roddy MacDowell, he manages to escape with his Significant Other, only to discover that he has landed back on earth, whence he came, but that a war has destroyed humankind and left an ecological vacuum that has been filled by the great apes.Actually, the movie runs along three parallel tracks. One is the unraveling of the mystery of how the apes came to be superior to humans, and the moral behind the puzzle. A second involves the internal dissent among the apes, pitting those who scoff at the idea of man and culture, and those who believe Heston and want to see him saved and set free. The third is a running commentary on Western culture circa 1967, the era of flower power and hippies and rebellious youth and disgruntled, resentful elders clinging to old concepts. I discount the relationship between Heston and the young lady, since she doesn't speak and was in real life the mistress of the producer, Richard Zanuck.It all may seem a little preachy now, and in some respects incomprehensible to those who don't remember the tumultuous 1960s. The morphed wisecracks are still amusing though. "Don't trust anyone over thirty." Will the youngsters get that? Will they get Maurice Evans' speech before the Council of Three, which alludes twice to the Declaration of Independence and once each to Alexander Pope and George Orwell? Probably not. The apes seem to be getting righter all the time.There are other instructive evocations of current social dynamics. On Planet Ape, the lighter you are, the better off you are. The buff orang-utans are the aristocratic leaders. The grayish chimpanzees are their middle-class intellectuals and technicians, rather like today's nerds. The black gorillas are the grunts. They do all the wet work. They're the guards and the police force and the flunkies and the shoe-shine boys. An interesting remark by Heston in a commentary on the film: the three simian strata subjected themselves to voluntary segregation. The separate species hung out together, ate lunch together, and though they showed no evident hostility towards the others, they clearly preferred their own kind. Is this movie telling us more than we need or want to know? Shouldn't a sociologist find this as disturbing as Heston finds the wreck of the Statue of Liberty? Except for Charlton Heston, there's no acting worth commenting on. The others are buried in carefully designed make up. They can only project the most rudimentary expressions -- a slight frown, a weak smile -- and their voices could have easily been dubbed. Every actor, down to the extras, underwent this lengthy and elaborate disguise. Later versions of the tale, as the concept became degraded and decadent, saved time and money by giving the lesser performers simple rubber masks.They probably could have lowered the budget on this initial entry by using cheaper techniques. Few people would have noticed, and, really, the story is determinedly middle-brow, like Rod Serling's simple sermons on the excellent "The Twilight Zone" series. Not particularly subtle or challenging, the story is what might be called "thought provoking." It made scads of money, which accounts for the many sequels and the recent remake. If there's a nickel left to be made out of the franchise we can expect another one any minute.Yet it's an enjoyable movie -- amusing and, well, though provoking. Nice location shooting and imaginative art direction. See it with the kids. Explain to them that "we hold these truths to be self evident" is from a charter document, that Pope said "the proper study of mankind is man," and that Orwell wrote "some are more equal than others." They'll thank you for it and, with any luck, will climb down from the chandelier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Intelligent Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is a highly underrated science fiction film that focuses on ideas and social commentary rather than action, special effects and twists in narrative. That is not to say that it does not contain any of the latter, indeed it does have plenty, but they are all suitably used in order to convey the message being put across, not just to show off.This movie is definitely not to be taken on face value because although seriously campy and surreal in it's premise, under all this is a brilliant palette of ideas and questions about human ideals, our future as a species and the very nature of our existence. Combined with a highly interesting overarching science fiction plot of some space explorers landing on a presumably foreign planet ruled by apes, Planet of the Apes serves as entertainment not just for the mind, but for the heart also. As a whole, the story itself is brilliantly paced, allowing for detailed character and plot development that never drags or rushes along too quickly to be analysed.I noticed a lot of critics have slammed the acting and dialogue in the film, but I couldn't disagree more. I adored every character in this film and thought the cast did a terrific job bringing them to life. Sure the dialogue is a little contrived here and there but in the context of the story, it makes absolute sense. Also contrary to seemingly popular opinion, I'm also a huge fan of the effects and costumes used in the film and regarded them as very well done for it's time and never once did they detract from the film.As I've said before in my reviews, I often find it hardest to write about films that I find near flawless, and this is no exception. By the end of Planet of the Apes, I was overwhelmed with thoughts and views that would be impossible to get down on paper after a first watch. Instead I simply recommend you watch for yourself and see why I regard this as a fine example of intelligent science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some films stand the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does contain spoilers!I remember recently having an argument at work with my boss who vehemently argued that 1968's Planet of the Apes is head and shoulders above Tim Burton's version. I had just come back from seeing Burton's and was quite impressed. And even though I had never seen this one, I argued the other way. I am not sure why I did this, perhaps it was just to play Devil's Advocate, maybe it was just cause I'm an ass at times or maybe I really thought that this version couldn't be better than the new one. After all, Burton's post apocalyptic futuristic ape world was inhabited by apes that were intelligent enough to form societies and create laws but they were too stupid to realize that the world they live in is big enough for both humans and animals. It went to great lengths ( or so I thought) to show man's, and conversely apes ignorance when it comes to the welfare of anything that is considered lower in intellect. In short, I felt that Burton's Planet of the Apes touched on many issues that are important to me. I couldn't really see how a film made 30 some years ago could top that. Boy was I wrong!I rated 2001's POTA an 8.5 based mostly on it's theories and because of the action in the film (and because I have a soft spot for Michael Clarke Duncan). If that is true, and I do feel that way, then 1968's POTA is easily worth a ten and that is what I am giving it. Very few films make you feel something. Let me re-phrase that. A good film will entertain you, an even better one can enlighten you. But only a very few precious films can keep you entertained and fill your head with a plethora of thought provoking ideas and "what-ifs" at the very same time. Planet of the Apes is one of those films. JFK, and all of it's pseudo-theories about the assassination of the president left me feeling exhausted and afraid of the world we live in. Films like The Matrix (you're a disease, Mr. Anderson") and T-2 ("it's in your nature to destroy yourselves") and Instinct ("these are the takers") gave me similar premonitions. You can add Planet of the Apes to that select breed of films that gave me a similar feeling. This is a film that takes its time to tackle such weighty issues as evolution, human rights, animal rights, racism, religious ambiguity, military strong arms and many other issues. The screenplay was skillfully adapted by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame from a book by Pierre Boulle. And although I have not read the book, I have read that the film is different in quite a few ways. For instance, the book and subsequently Burton's version, has the apes very technologically advanced. But because of technological inferiority in 1968 the film took the apes and had them living in a primitively built city/village. They had buildings made of rock but not concrete. The had guns but not automatic weapons. And although Burton's version hasn't introduced them to guns, the apes are much stronger, much higher up on the evolutionary scale. But in this POTA, there seems to be a missing link. Certain apes have theories that apes really evolved from man and yet the humans in this world cannot speak. They seem to understand some things, but they cannot comprehend what is being said to them all of the time, kind of like the way our animals are today. This opens up a plethora possibilities. Are these humans mutants, are they a cross between man and ape? Have they been scientifically altered by some medical Nazi-like experiment and over time, generations have adapted to these experiments? There are many weighty issues open for discussion. Other reviewers bring up the possibility of a nuclear war and one of Taylor's observations was that there may have been a nuclear shower or meteor storm that devastated humans, just like the dinosaurs before them. And doesn't that make Heston's speech at the beginning of Armageddon ( it happened once it'll happen again.. it's just a matter of time) all the more chilling?Contains major spoilers in the next few paragraphs. Please, do not read if you plan on seeing the film soon for the first time!!!! You have been warned! 2001's version of POTA was quite impressive because of technology first and the story second. While it did think about things such as animal rights and such, it did not hold it as important as this version does. This is a film that you could watch over and over again and still have it give you that sinking feeling in your stomach every time. The ending alone is enough to open up discussion for months to come. And I have a theory. So bear with me. If what he sees at the end of the film on the beach is really the whole thing sitting there, and not just the head ( meaning that the rest of it is buried some 200 feet in the sand, then this presents a whole slew of possibilites. Dr Zaius has discovered the cave where he believes there is sufficient enough evidence that there were intelligent human occupants before apes. The basis of his evidence is that on different levels of the earth, buried in the sand and clay there are artifacts to support his claim. One one level he found reading glasses and deeper still, he finds false teeth and in another level, even deeper he found a babies doll that talks. Proof that evolution granted man the ability to talk. But when Taylor is left to "find his destiny" what he finds is the thing that may be buried so deep in the earth from thousands of years of stagnancy. What if what he is seeing is really all in tact, just buried some 200 feet under the earth? If they could dig that far down, what would they find? Would they find dishes or the remains of houses? Would they find subway tunnels, sewage pipes, bones of sewer rats, bones of CHUD like people? The possibilities are endless. This could turn the ape world upside down and it would create a division in those that are ardent followers of the ape religion and those that believe in evolution. Doesn't this kind of sound similar to situations here in our time?End of spoilersPOTA is the one of the best Science Fiction films I have ever seen and this would easily crack my top 100 films ever made. And that is after 2 viewings. I want to go back and watch this film a few more times so I can really understand it. It is a rare film that entertains and poses some very interesting and provocative questions. And as I said earlier, there are very few films that can do something like that. Films like American Pie or Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Godfather are great because they entertain and make you laugh or cheer. POTA is in a class with other films like T-2 and Aliens. These are films that also entertain but they force you to examine who we are and where we have come from and where we could possibly go. Is it possible that man will one day become so unbearable that some divine intervention will occur so that we are not the inferior species? A film like this makes you think and wonder? What if......?10 out 0f 10-- This is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one that I am going to get my kids to watch someday. Burton's is fun and thought-provoking. This one is simply mind blowing and intellectually stimulating. This is a must see for any generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, for a Variety of reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the February 7, 1968 review from Variety:"'Planet of the Apes' is an amazing film. A political-sociological allegory, cast in the mold of futuristic science-fiction, the Arthur P. Jacobs production for 20th-Fox is an intriguing blend of chilling satire, a sometimes ludicrous juxtaposition of human and ape mores, optimism and pessimism. Franklin J. Schaffner directed star Charlton Heston and a strong supporting cast. Production values, especially outstanding makeup, plus Jerry Goldsmith's score, maximize impact. Strong entertainment assets for general audiences, plus concurrent -- and perhaps controversial -- appeal to more sophisticated viewers, add up to excellent b.o. prospects."Pierre Boulle's novel, in which some stranded U.S. space explorers find themselves considered animals in a world dominated by apes, has been adapted by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling. Script at times digresses into low comedy -- many common phrases in which 'simian' and 'ape' are substituted for 'human' and 'man' -- and, whether intended or not, audiences will be inclined to laugh rather than to grin at the irony. Perhaps this was a gambit for mass appeal. "In any case, the totality of the film works very well, leading to a surprise ending, although, in hindsight, it could have been deduced all along. Yet, the suspense, and suspension of disbelief, engendered is one of the film's biggest assets. "Heston, leader of an aborted space shot which propels his crew 20 centuries ahead of earth, is a cynical man who eventually has thrust upon him the burden of reasserting man's superiority over all other animals. At fadeout, he is the new Adam. Linda Harrison,who has appeared in some recent 20th pix bits, is herein formally 'introduced' in a totally silent part of the new Eve. "Key featured players -- all in ape makeup which obscures their regular facades, yet permits subtleties of expression -- include Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, two scientists accused of heresy; Maurice Evans, their adversary in the Inquisition which forms a major plot sequence; James Whitmore and James Daly, two other ape Establishment functionaries. John Chambers is given special creative makeup design credit, and it certainly is deserved. Ben Nye and Dan Striepeke executed superbly the makeup design."Rather precise parallels exist in the allegorical writing to real world events over, say, the past 20 years. Suppression of dissent by fair means and foul; peremptory rejection of scientific data by maintainers of status quo; double-standard evaluation of people and events. It's all here."Screenplay probably could not have been filmed 10 years ago, and the disturbing thought lingers that it might not be possible in another 10 years, when engineered public and political opinion again swings into another distorted extreme. Despite the immediate world turmoil, climate appears to be in a dead center which in life, as well as in mechanics, cannot long endure. "Schaffner's direction generally is sure throughout. Leon Shamroy's versatile Panavision DeLuxe Color lensing accents both the macroscopic and microscopic dramatic elements, with adroit and neatly restrained forays into subjective technique, per director's obvious intent. Goldsmith's score, orchestrated by Arthur Morton, lends an excellent mood. Overall establishment of setting is, in the best sense of the word, a successful con. "In smaller roles, Robert Gunner and Jeff Burton, as Heston's space crew survivors, serve to fix star's initial character; their eventual demise in plot is logical. Lou Wagner, as a young ape intellectual, and Buck Kartilian, as a gorilla zoo-keeper, help reinforce the ape civilization setting which, in some spots involving principals, is strained (but never broken) in credulity. "There is some medium and long-shot male buttocks nudity, but handled with care and free of obvious exploitation sensationalism. Hugh S. Fowler executed editing to 112 minutes. It is debatable whether about 10 minutes could be trimmed, particularly in first two reels; film would play better, internally, yet the deliberate establishment of the strange world -- which successfully gulls an audience -- could suffer. In any case, once story begins to move, it keeps going. "Other technical credits are first rate. Film exteriors were shot in Utah and Arizonia National Park country, where desolation and grandeur of an indifferent Mother Nature matches perfectly with the desired story setting of the results of an insolent Human Nature."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking some liberties with Pierre Boulle's book,the movie remains faithful to its spirit,to its Voltaire-like irony.It's interesting if you saw the movie to read the book and compare the two endings:desperate at the end of the movie,it's actually tinged with humor in Boulle's words (Men inspired by wisdom?Quite impossible!the astronaut says before we realize it's a monkey)On the other hand,the fact that, unlike in the book,the apes do not enjoy a modern life with cars is not a problem.I would go as far as to write that it's better that way.Considering the conclusion,the shattering final clue, desolate landscapes and primitive technology are logical,de rigueur.In French junior high schools,pupils frequently study this book and now,thanks to the video,they study the movie in parallel.I saw the movie when it was released and I knew from the start it would become a classic.The final scene ,one of the strongest of all sci-fi movies,filmed with an impeccable science of the picture using high and low angle shots ,is mind-boggling.It's a movie that cried to be left alone,I'm not sure that Tim Burton (whom I admire though) was right to redo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On April 3rd,1968 (2 months and 10 days before my birth)"Planet of The Apes" was released for movie-goers. 40 years and two days later we now say farewell to Charlton Heston.I just heard the news of his passing at 9:25pm last night on my local news. Most of us know Heston for his 3 biggest roles,Moses in "The Ten Commandments","Ben-Hur" and his unforgettable role of astronaut George Taylor in this film.I'm not going to go over the plot of the film here,we all know it and love the movie for it. As boys in the 1970's,my brothers and I could not get enough of this adventure,including the later Saturday morning cartoon and the movie sequels.Overall,though it's this original that we'll always like the most. Heston (as well as the other actors playing ape/humans) "makes" this film in his simple but powerful performance.From fighting to not be treated like an animal (the way we humans sometimes treat animals and each-other),his fighting the simian authority (a parallel to what was going on in America in 1968) to his painful discovery at the end of the film that man had destroyed themselves long ago.The other great irony of Heston passing away last night is that it also came just two weeks after Easter,for which his other film "The Ten Commandments" was and still is a holiday staple on those weekends that Easter fell upon. Although I never agreed with his support for guns,I can agree that he was one fine actor,the likes of which we'll never see again.May he rest in peace.(END)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A crew of astronauts crash-lands on a planet in the distant future, where the dominant species are intelligent, talking apes. The leader of the astronauts is treated like a caged slave (like the other humans on the planet) but he tries to escape, in the hope to return home.'Planet Of The Apes' is one of those movies that I knew everything about, without actually ever having seen it. I knew the characters, the narrative, THAT iconic ending ? I knew the whole lot. So, admittedly, I was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to my imagination. Thankfully, it was as good as I had hoped. With an excellent premise, good writing, and strong special effects for the time, the movie really is a sci-fi classic.The best thing about the film is the premise ? turning the evolution theory upside down is an extremely intelligent idea, and it's handled brilliantly by the writers. It's a script full of wit and irony, with the right level of satire to make the film work. I won't spoil the ending, but it's a brilliant one, rightfully regarded as one of the best endings in cinema history.The use of make-up and costumes is also commendable, especially considering it was the late-sixties. Sure, the apes don't look amazing; but, somehow, it works. As the film goes on, you forget that these are people wearing somewhat mediocre ape costumes ? you're so heavily invested in the characters by this point that how they look becomes an afterthought. That being said, Kim Hunter is brilliant as Zira, doing a great job of emoting with her eyes.The let-down, for me, was Charlton Heston. Heston has always had the moniker of being a hammy actor, and he's really, really hammed it up for this film. It's excruciating at times to see him overacting so much, and a miracle that it didn't end up hurting the movie. At the end, he does just enough to keep the film engaging and watchful, and we should all be thankful that the supporting cast are so excellent around him.This really is a brilliant film, and one I thoroughly enjoyed watching. Whatever you may think of the movie, and whatever your opinion of Charlton Heston's acting, nothing can be taken away from it's final couple of minutes. The film is worth watching just for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes", was a french novel released in 1963 that asked big, interesting questions. Would humanity eventually be bested by a similar species? Or would humanity ultimately destroy itself? Seeing obvious potential, 20th Century Pictures acquired the rights to make a film, and the result has spawned one of Science-Fiction's most iconic pictures of all time. Since then, it has gone on to release countless sequels, remakes and prequels. George Taylor (Charlton Heston), and his fellow astronauts get lost in space and eventually land on a deserted planet. After travelling far they are eventually separated and end up in the hands of intelligent apes, who on this planet have surpassed humans as the dominate species. Taylor, who is temporarily muted becomes the subject of cruelty to both the apes and the caged humans who lack intelligence and the ability to speak. Will Taylor regain his voice? and just what awaits him on such a rural planet?Charlton Heston is fantastic as out-of-his time character George Taylor, whose constant questioning of the ape's society leads to much annoyance on their part. Linda Harrison is just as iconic as "Nova", who does so well even though she doesn't have one line of dialogue. And of course the show stealer was Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), who remains arrogant even though his entire beliefs are constantly being destroyed by Taylor's rational actions. The special effects at the time were considered brilliant, and famously went through a lot of people before final decisions. Considering how laughable they really look by todays standards, I still enjoy watching them. The shots in the desert are bleak and harsh, and when the screenplay is co-written by Rod Serling (Creator of my favourite TV series "The Twilight Zone"), It's so easy to see why this film is a classic. Final Verdict: A brilliant piece of Science-Fiction, that will stand the test of time for many no ape-dominated years to come. 10/10.</fullReview>

Soon, they are separated, and Taylor discovers the truth about where he is, a truth that is more devastating than he first imagines...Intelligent, exciting, and thought-provoking film with superb, ground-breaking makeup F/X, and fine performances from the supporting cast that stars Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, and Maurice Evans.Unforgettable ending may or may not come as a surprise, depending if you were a fan of "The Twilight Zone", but it packs a wallop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A justifiably iconic sci-fi adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1968 seems to have been something of a watershed year for cinematic science fiction. It was the year that both 2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes were released. Both films were game changers in that they were big budget sci-fi made by the major studios. Up until that time, the genre had been very much mostly the province of the B movie. After the massive success of those two a series of often extremely interesting science fiction films were released by the studios. In effect these movies created a situation where the genre could flourish, with bigger budgets and more seriousness. Of course those films were quite different; while both dealt with some serious themes, 2001 is by far the more intellectual and is pure hard sci-fi ? Planet of the Apes, on the other hand, lay somewhere between 2001 and traditional action-adventure fare.It does deal have definite social commentary and like many sci-fi films, it's about the time it was made as much as it is a look into the future. It considers the dangers of nuclear war and comments on the racial tensions of 60's America ? both through allegory in its post-apocalyptic world. I guess this is one of the things that makes it work so well, the upside down society of the Planet of the Apes allows for an underlying message while at the same time offering up a thrilling sci-fi adventure scenario. To be perfectly honest, it works great as the latter. For me, the best parts are the early scenes leading up to the capture of the astronauts. The mystery of the strange world and the unforgettable arrival of the horse-riding apes in the fields are terrific. While John Chambers has been rightly praised for the ape make-up, a lot of credit should also go to Leon Shamroy for his stunning cinematography which is particularly brilliant in these early scenes, with great shots from unusual high angles that makes the planet seem so very ominous. Kudos too, to Jerry Goldsmith for his soundtrack whose strange tones compliment the visuals. When we reach the ape town, it's the fantastic set-design that takes centre stage with those houses that seem to come out of the rocks organically. Charlton Heston leads the picture of course and he does provide star charisma but it's the character actors in the heavy make-up that make the best impression, namely Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans. And of course, well?there's that ending?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A one of a kind sci-fi masterpiece, creative and ingenious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was Rod Serling of "Twilight Zone" fame, who initially penned the screen version of Pierre Boulle's not particularly successful novel "La plan?te des singes" and was responsible for preparing it to eventually become a cult movie. While rewritten several times later on it was the genius of Serling who was attracted by the potential of the material, laying out timeline and rules already in a first draft. These guidelines would also be followed in the four sequels of the Ape films of the seventies to eventually form a whole cohesive unit. The initial movie of course is the great one, the one with the most powerful impact, the shocker, the one that irritates, disturbs and asks all the questions. The rest of the movies in the series for sure is inferior and more pedestrian than revolutionary, yet they are all part of one great sci-fi idea and therefore should be treated as such.As for the first "Planet of the Apes": The picture has all good science fiction needs and more - it deals with the consequences of evolution, mankind reaching its final frontier, the ultimate philosophical questions about existence and becoming. The scenery is great and believable, Charlton Heston and recurring ape performers Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter are standouts, Jerry Goldsmith hits the right chords with his avant-garde compositional techniques producing an innovative off-beat score and the make-up achievement was phenomenal for its time. At the bottom of it all lie the thoughts of creative minds, and we should be thankful that "Planet of the Apes" made it on screen pretty much unharmed in its ingenuity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Film Released During a Dreadful Time Period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year 1968 was a rough time period for Americans and even by me saying it, is a complete understatement. It was a time in which American youth after graduating from high school were automatically drafted off to Vietnam to fight in Vietnam in a war that had no real purpose; plus these kids had no real military experience. Two very iconic leaders who were the potential guiding light of hope Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy were shot and killed by a random act of hatred. There was turmoil at the Nation Convention in Chicago. Women burning their bras in their quest for equal rights and plenty more. Science and Technology was becoming more enhanced usurping general knowledge. But in the summer of 1968, a blockbuster film hit the big screen, set the tone of the trials and tribulations of the civil pandemonium that has plagued the United States in that time frame. Of course I'm talking about the science fiction classic "The Planet of the Apes". The setting of the story was set in the year 1973 where our journey starts with four astronauts lead by Col. George Taylor (Charlton Heston). The Colonel was at his wit's end with the dying of humanity and how far we've turned out (and not necessarily a good thing at that) so to get away from us miscreants, he decides to embark on a journey with NASA. We flash forward to a spaceship collides to a rocky hill and a dark planet with very little forestation. When one of the astronauts gets killed on the way, Col. Taylor and the other cadets make a narrow escape as the ship sinks into oblivion. At first glance, the space cadets make the assumption that they have landed on the planet Bellatrix of the Orion constellation. Further exploration, the cadets notice that the humans on this planet are voiceless and have a primitive thing going for them. During their exploring another two cadets were killed by a group of simians and Col. Taylor was being held prisoner by these superior primates. But once he starts talking, he becomes more acquainted with two simian doctors and a young simian child, he is able to show that he is equal in intelligence with the other apes. Even though he can talk and strike a conversation with the other primates, it also leads up to bit of paranoia towards them. So Dr. Cornelius and Dr. Zira and her nephew Lucius, help Col. Taylor and a mutual female named Nova (cliched name I suppose) sets them free and hides out in a vast desert known as the Forbidden Zone, where remains of the human race were discovered and a surprise revelation manifests itself that will both shock Taylor and the audience as well. "Planet of the Apes" magically sets the tone as being one of the original space operas as star Chalton Heston puts it. Asdide from that analysis, it is to this day one of the great films that revolutionized the summer blockbuster definition. It's not only one dimensional in purpose to entertain, but it also makes you want to think as well, so don't put your mind to sleep in this movie folks. It looks into the problems that human society has faced back then and still reflects possibly even more to this day. Charlton Heston was custom-made for the role of Col. Taylor, a man possessed with a disgruntled and cynical disdain for the human race, but was chosen as an unlikely Savior to them. Legendary British performers Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans shine in their supporting performances as the likable Cornelius and the shrill human-hating Dr. Zaius. The female performances by Kim Hunter and Linda Harrison were excellent as Zira and Nova. The soundtrack compliments the scenery and the emotions spectacularly by Jerry Goldsmith. And hats off for Rod Serling and Michael Wilson for writing a terrific script. And until the ultimate twist in the end we can understand the misanthrope that has plagued the mind of Col. Taylor.I would ask you all to see this movie over the Tim Burton rehashing anytime soon. It's never too late. I guarantee, it will leave you amazed and astounded as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mystery and thrill of the original still remains, and is undoubtedly one of the more fascinating films to grace the screens in the late 1960s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet Of The Apes is a science-fiction adventure that doesn't need light saber battles, flying spacecrafts, or aliens to keep viewers entertained. In fact, there's nothing significantly sci-fi other than that it's set thousands of years into the future on an isolated planet.Created by the writer who gave us The Bridge On The River Kwai, Planet Of The Apes is an exploration of the existence of intellectual beings other than Man. Why it's an eye-opener is because there's no other film (which I've seen) that directly shows the inferiority of Man over another species that we know. We have seen films that emphasize Nature's superiority over man in disaster flicks, but this is clearly something uniquely different.Director Franklin J. Schaffner loves making films that pit Man against the harsh physical environment (e.g. the hostile jungle in Papillon, the hot battlefields in Patton). Now in Planet Of The Apes, we see barren, isolated landscapes similar (but not equaled) to Lawrence Of Arabia.Cinematography-wise, it's as beautiful as it's stark. Moreover, famous composer Jerry Goldsmith's striking yet strange score helps to accentuate the primeval mood of the place. Charlton Heston's performance is a balanced mixture of boldness and vulnerability, though not as great as what he had achieved in Ben-Hur.The most notable aspect of Planet Of The Apes is the costume design, and the makeup effects by John Chambers (who won an honorary Oscar for his pioneering work here). It's incredibly realistic, to the extent that the talking apes become humanistic, and have personalities attached to them, rather than just being shallow talking apes.The chilling climax somewhat compensates for the average screenplay, and the plain script. There have been several sequels, and a remake by Tim Burton over the decades; but unfortunately they don't even work half as well as the original, becoming diluted and commercialized respectively. The mystery and thrill of the original still remains, and is undoubtedly one of the more fascinating films to grace the screens in the late 1960s.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic piece of Sci-Fi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film a several times before but this is the first time I've attempted a review. Made at the time when NASA was getting closer to putting a man on the moon, writers were beginning to explore the possibilities this achievement might open up. French novelist Pierre Boulle took it to its extreme with his novel of the same title on which this film is based. For those that are maybe too young, or have been living under a rock for the last forty or so years, here's a brief summary.Colonel George Taylor and his surviving crew, Landon and Dodge, crash land on a planet they think is far from Earth in the Orion constellation. It looks very barren but the air is breathable and there is water. They set off to find if there is any life. Eventually they find plants and then primitive mute human like creatures. These humans are foraging for food when they are attacked by apes! No ordinary apes though, these can speak, ride horses and use weapons. Dodge is killed and Taylor is injured in the throat before he is captured. He is taken to the Ministry of Science where he is put under the care of Dr. Zira who treats his injuries. She is intrigued by his attempts to talk. Her friend, Cornelius, is more cautious and her boss, the Minister of Science, Dr. Zaius, wants him put down. Still unable to talk, Taylor eventually escapes but is re-captured after an exciting chase through the town. It is here he is heard to say the memorable line, "Get your filthy ape hands off of me!". What can this mean for the apes? A human that can talk! There are plenty of witnesses who believe man to be inferior to them and is to be treated like any dumb animal. All this and much more is revealed but, of course, I'm not going to tell you here.Somebody really thought about the world the Apes inhabit, there is a clear structure to their society. Orang-utans are the administrators, chimps are the scientists and gorillas are the military. It's not clear who does all the menial jobs, but there is a structure there. The cinematography is quite superb; it would have looked great on the big screen (I've only ever seen it on TV). Of course the make up effects are also groundbreaking and quite brilliant for the time it was made. The music is quite unusual, but still in keeping with the visuals.I thought Charlton Heston did a great job as Colonel George Taylor, he played it with the arrogance and swagger the part needed. Kim Hunter was also really good as Dr. Zira, she was really great despite the limitations of the costume and the make-up. Of course, Roddy McDowall is best known for his part as Cornelius, and various parts in the other 'Planet of the Apes' films and finally as Galen in the much loved '70's TV series of the same name. Also worthy of note are Maurice Evans as Dr. Zaius, James Whitmore as the President of the Assembly and Linda Harrison as Nova (although she didn't have to say much).This is the best of the 'Planet of the Apes' films, even the 2001 reboot starring Mark Wahlberg. It gained a huge following and started a very lucrative franchise for the studio. It is really well made although I thought it took quite a long time before we actually saw an ape. It also struck me that for a species of vegetarians they wear an awful lot of leather? just an observation. So, over all, a really well made and iconic film with some great ideas that really took hold of the public imagination. I really enjoy it every time I see it? Highly recommended.My Score: 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes starts as space mission that left Erath in 1972 to travel in space at the speed of light for six months crash lands on a planet that doesn't look too dissimilar to Earth. Only three crew members survive, Taylor (Chartlon Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner) &amp; Dodge (Jeff Burton) who find themselves in desert like conditions &amp; struggling to survive the hostile planet. Just as all hope seems lost they encounter a tribe of humans who are then attacked by a group of man like talking Apes who have become the dominant race on the planet with man being the beast who are rounded up, put in zoos &amp; experimented on. In the attack Landon &amp; Dodge are lost while Taylor is shot in the the throat, unable to speak he is rounded up &amp; put in a cage where kind Chimp female scientist named Zira (Kim Hunter) befriends Taylor &amp; when he regains the ability to speak there are certain Ape hierarchy who want him dead so to preserve their own society &amp; beliefs...Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner after J. Lee Thompson who was originally set to direct pulled out to make Mackenna's Gold (1969) this, I suppose, is considered as a true sci-fi classic &amp; as I write this even makes it to number 228 in the IMDb's Top 250 &amp; since this is a forty year old film that's pretty impressive going. The script from Twilight Zone host, creator &amp; head writer Rod Serling &amp; Michael Wilson was based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle although by all accounts refines it a little bit &amp; adds that twist ending which surely everyone now knows, Planet of the Apes is a good solid sci-fi action adventure that uses the role reversal of a dominant Ape society living next to uncivilised wild human tribes to make some nice points about humanity, where we are going &amp; has some strong social satire as well. From unfair trials to the religion versus science debate to prejudice to wanting to destroy what we don't understand to the ultimate devastation of war. Sure it's all good stuff, it's well written &amp; it's very well put together &amp; the fact most of the main character's are talking Apes it's deadly serious &amp; it all works surprisingly well on various levels as a film that entertains &amp; social satire that has meaning. Some of the sci-fi elements don't add up though, I don't believe the concept of time travel as described here &amp; after a thousand odd years would that doll still be in perfect working order? Also I just don't believe Taylor wouldn't have guessed he was on Earth, I mean there are people there, Apes there, the technology is the same &amp; the trees, sky water &amp; terrain is exactly the same too so it wouldn't exactly take a genius to realise or even make an educated guess. Then there's that iconic twist ending, sure it's a great image but the fact everyone knows about it means it might not have the impact it once did &amp; the fact most should realise that this is Earth means it shouldn't really come as much of a surprise. That's a minor quibble though in an otherwise very good sci-fi film that probably just about deserves it's classic status.The one outstanding area of Planet of the Apes is the Oscar winning make-up effects which are really very impressive even forty years later, the effects are very convincing &amp; while not as good as the remake (no matter what anyone tells you) they hold up extremely well. There are some well staged action scenes too, in particular the sequence about thirty minutes in when the Apes attack &amp; kill numerous humans while on horseback complete with memorable images of the Apes standing over the dead bodies of several humans posing for photographs. The opening as the three astronaut's walk through the harsh desert is also well shot &amp; you can almost feel the heat &amp; isolation. An extremely popular film at the time Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) &amp; Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) as well as the short lived TV series Planet of the Apes (1974) &amp; the animated TV series Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975) before it was remade as a hundred million blockbuster by Tim Burton back in 2001.With a supposed budget of about $5,800,000 this wasn't mega budget but all money went on screen it seems, this is a great looking &amp; designed film. The acting is good especially from those wearing Apes make-up.Planet of the Apes is considered a sci-fi classic &amp; despite one or two minor flaws I would largely have to agree, it's maybe one of those iconic films that everyone should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the centuries of time, we hear that the fantastic on one planet is common nature on another. When this incredible novel was first penned by Pierre Boulle, few if any ever thought it would be food for thought at a war conference in Germany by the NATO allies. The story is nothing short of superbly incredible as that is what happens to the United States astronauts who return to Earth 2000 years after they left. Upon landing, their leader George Taylor (Charlton Heston) a cynical and introspective man from the 20th century explains why he left Earth. " I've always felt there has to be something better than man. " Upon discovering he has emerged in a society run by Apes, he believes he is in a living nightmare. The ape society is primitive and structured much like early man. Two 'doctors' (Roddy McDowall) as Cornelius and (Kim Hunter) as Zira heal him but discover their 'animal' specimen whom they call Bright Eyes, explains he is an astronaut and comes from the planet Earth. However if Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), James Whitmore and James Daly have their way, he will be lobotomized. Linda Harrison plays Nova, Jeff Burton is Dodge and Robert Gunner is Landon. The movie is powerfully written by the late Rod Serling (Twilight Zone) and has the ending few could ever have guessed. This is the original film from which so many spin offs began. It is decidedly a Classic in its own right. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I begin? An outstanding cast featuring American and British heavyweights, the best prosthetic make up ever achieved, a gripping, engaging plot, an unbelievably clever script, beautiful sets and set-pieces, and perhaps the greatest twist ending of all time? Those are just a few things that come to mind when I think of this film. This film is first and foremost, a thinking person's movie. Ironically, it was a huge hit with kids because of the fantasy/action aspect of the film. Make no mistake though, this an adult film dealing with serious, philosophical and political issues which are still relevant today. This movie challenges the viewer's perception of reality and man's place in the universe in a way that no other film ever has. Charlton Heston gives by far the most under-appreciated performance of his career, giving us a vital, living, breathing, bleeding character who is impossible not to sympathize with. As Heston wanders further into this brave new world I found myself wishing I was him, despite the horrors he encounters. The viewer feels every ounce of pain that Taylor, played by Heston, feels. It is a cathartic cinematic experience that is not to be missed. Franklin Shaffner, the director, deserves to be counted among the all-time greats for this movie alone, but throw in "Patton", which he also directed, and it is clear he was a singular talent. I could honestly go on forever about how thoroughly engrossing this movie is, but I won't here. Just know that this movie represents the best that Hollywood has to offer-intelligent script, superb acting, thrilling action, masterful editing, an unforgettable score and great plot twists. Planet of the Apes is in my top 3 all time films and still holds up incredibly well almost forty years later.</fullReview>

Planet of the apes did start boring but it got good in the middle and the ending was amazing.It was followed by four sequels and a remake.The sequels are called:"Beneath the planet of the apes","Escape from the planet of the apes","Conquest of the planet of the apes" and "Battle for the planet of the apes".I recommend this to sci-fi fans nd those who are interested in watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not Confuse this with any other Planet of the Apes sequels this is a GREAT FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** This has spoilers **** This is a great film, and has been a victim of it's own success. The 1968 film is first a great story. Second it is a great allegory about our society. Third it is a great drama. Fourth is a great example of story telling. You are first introduced to main character on board an futuristic spaceship that can travel near light speed. Then you are led to think they crashed landed on a desert planet on the way home. At this point you find out the main character hates human society. He became an astronaut to find something better than man. Then you find that the primitive humans seem to populate the planet, and the astronauts think they will be running the place in six months. Then you find out apes run the planet and treat humans as we treat apes. As the astronaut learns about the ape society, he begins to yearn for the human society he hates. We also see parallels that comment on our own. You can see Rod Serling's hand in the script. The twist at the end - that the planet is Earth in the distant future makes the astronaut hate human society, that he has just begun to want, even more.If you follow the story of this film, all the sequels are impossible. The people who launched the space mission would never had sent the rescue mission of the second movie, because they would have know the spaceship would return in the future when they all were long dead. In this film they hint that the human society destroys itself, and then their trained ape servants took over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Planet of the Apes' is a film I've watched at least a dozen times, and I never tire of it. I'm not even exactly sure why, but after a few months have passed and I pop it into the player again, it's like revisiting an old friend. I saw it when it first came out and my feelings toward it haven't changed much since then, when I was 12 years old. One thing I've always been curious about and need to research someday is how much of Rod Serling's original adaptation made it into the final script. The two biographies of him that I've read didn't say much about 'Planet of the Apes.' It seems to me, as someone who loves 'Twilight Zone' and much of Serling's writing, that quite a lot of his script survived. The cynicism, the talkiness, the liberalism, the satirical jabs at organized religion and its inherent hypocrisy, even the nuclear bomb-themed twist ending... all classic Sterling. Certainly Charlton Heston's opening monologue, when he asks, "does man, that marvel of the universe, still make war against his brother?" could only have been written by Serling. But the whole film pretty much follows the same tone, which again leads me to believe that most of what Serling wrote was left intact; either that, or Michael Wilson (the other credited screenwriter) is a Serling clone! The film itself looks like a medium-budget affair, at best. Most of the sets resemble those of a late-sixties TV movie, or an episode of 'Star Trek.' The special effects are hardly special; just adequate enough to do the job. The real attention-getter when the film came out was the ape make-up, which was considered astoundingly realistic at the time. It's still impressive in its way, allowing for quite a lot of facial expressiveness by the main characters, but like so many technical aspects from that time and before, it will come up lacking and seeming phony to today's younger audiences who have grown up with CGI and other much more dazzling and realistic effects. Heston carries the film; without him, 'Planet of the Apes' would probably seem a lot more foolish than it does. He is bitter, heroic, noble, and cynical; his George Taylor is even at times a Christ-like figure, as when he is stoned by the ape mob and endlessly tied up and taunted by the guards. At its core, 'Planet of the Apes' is a rather heavy-handed spoof of organized religion. Time and again, we hear the elders of the ape community talk about "heresy" from younger apes who don't understand that "the proper study of apes is apes." Man is a soulless animal to them, lacking "the divine spark that exists in the simian soul." The point is hammered home again and again that organized religion is narrow-minded, unwilling to accept new ideas even if they're true, and almost always, inevitably, corrupt. The now-famous ending was such a shocker at the time that it somewhat obscured the fact that it was really very downbeat. 'Planet of the Apes' has been called 'near-classic science fiction'; it's a bit too goofy in places to be taken completely seriously, and yet has many powerful moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet Of The Apes would have to be in the top ten movies ever made if not my favourite.I've seen it many times,but when I first saw it as a kid in the 70s it just blew me away,with how realistic it seemed.Remember at the time I never knew any of the actors,so there was no typecast actors, adding to the feeling of realism.Throughout the movie it felt all realistic,where I just got lost in the movie as though I was in it.Not knowing the actors in good movies makes it that much more believable.That's why these days they just can't make classic movies like this.These days they always use the same actors.How can that be believable!The magic of a good movie is when your captivated by the superb acting and get caught up inside the movie.Back then I never knew who Charlton Heston was,so it worked its magic on me,but also I was just a kid with a big imagination.So I'm not sure how I'd feel if I were to see it for the first time now.Still for what it did to me I would have to give it a ten.I still have those memories of THE PLANET OF THE APES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning in its day, impressive still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great examples of social commentary masquerading as (highly entertaining) sci-fi, this striking film spawned four sequels, a prime-time TV show, a Saturday morning cartoon and a remake. Americanized and simplified from a Pierre Boulle novel, it stars Heston as a cocky, misanthropic astronaut who crash lands with his crew on an unfamiliar planet after experiencing a long period of suspended animation. After spending several days alone, amid stark, arid terrain, they eventually stumble onto a lush, green area and are surprised to find other humans in place. They're even more surprised to find out that the humans are treated like so much game by the ruling authorities, an articulate civilization comprised of gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees! Heston is injured and captured by the apes and taken to a barbaric laboratory where he catches the eye of kindly chimp doctor Hunter. She tentatively nurses him back to health while fending off opposition from her superior Evans who would like nothing more than to geld and mute Heston. With the assistance of her boyfriend McDowall, she begins to communicate with Heston and learns of his origin. She develops an affinity for him, causing great personal risk to herself and McDowall. Heston repeatedly defies his captors and tries to escape, but is thwarted at nearly every turn by the society that treats him like an animal or worse. Throughout his ordeal, similarities to many real-life instances of social injustice including racism, repression of free speech, suppression of truth and others are discernible, tempered by bits of, sometimes corny, humor. Despite the small doses of humor, an atmosphere of oppression and helplessness dominates the film and it is incredibly bleak and even depressing at times. However, thanks to sincere performances, exceptional music, stellar cinematography, thrilling chase sequences and an overall commitment to the concept, it all comes across beautifully. Heston begins with a necessarily obnoxious level of superiority, but is soon taken down a peg or two and serves as the audience's liaison between the world it knows and this bizarre upside-down one in which callousness and uniformity rule the day. His unforgettable delivery of certain lines have entered the pop culture hall of fame including, "Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!" Hunter is ingratiating and interesting in her role. She, like all the other actors portraying simians, had to undergo 3 or more hours of makeup and took great pains to learn how to properly emote through all the prosthetics. Second-billed McDowall is a terrific counterpart to her and turns in one of his most enduring performances, though he doesn't appear until nearly 45 minutes into the movie. Evans is excellent as the deceptive and distrusting head of the apes. His cohorts are played by several solid actors including Daly and Whitmore. Harrison, who often gets a lot of heat for winning her role as Heston's love interest through her marriage to the studio head, is nonetheless suitably emotive and exceedingly attractive in the part. Wagner, who plays Hunter's eager nephew later played the obnoxious teenage stargazer in "Airport" who debates trajectory with Dean Martin. Gunner, who plays one of Heston's crew-mates, was seemingly never heard from again after this landmark film! It's an unforgettable motion picture, especially for those who were around upon its premiere, and, despite a few flaws in logic and in its dated references, it remains a captivating piece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you are at blockbuster and ask yourself the question "The Mark Wahleberg version or the Charlton Heston version?" the answer is totally obvious. This one. The new ones twist 'ending' (to be frank I don't think it had an ending) had as much twist as three week old lemonade. This one had an ending that'd shock you and (in some cases) would make you fall out of your seat. It has an ending worthy of Rod Serling, speaking of him, he also penned the screenplay for this thrill ride. That's it about the ending, my lips are sealed about everything else about it.The performances are awesome (espically Charlton Heston as astronaut Taylor) you would believe there them, not an actor hoping for a big paycheck. So if I could put 'Planet of the Apes' in one word, it'd be 'Awesome'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alternative history; the human kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes teaches us to take a closer look at ourselves. From the opening speech by Heston as astronaut Taylor all throughout the movie, we, as a human species, are simply given a mirror to watch ourselves. The apes simply tell a tale of ignorance and abuse. It's a mixture of ape science and religion, just like the real world, the human world we live in. In that respect this movie has not dated at all.Most mirror aspects are the 'in your face'-type. A more subtle one is right before the famous ending when the apes have dug up artifacts of a previous civilization that was more advanced than theirs. This finding is ridiculed by the apes eldest, the wise one. If anyone has ever looked into the aspects of alternative history 'the human kind', one will find out that the reaction of the apes eldest is typical of the human scientists in our every day lives. Anything contradicting their theories is ridiculed based on beliefs, never on scientific proof. Just because it is more convenient. The same comment is given by the elderly wise ape. He knew and has always known about the old civilizations, he just tried to hide it. Although Planet of the apes is rather slow in the mid section, Heston is great and this movie is thought provoking when you take all aspects into account, not just the obvious ones. Recommended, even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without question, this is the best movie ever made. The acting, the screenplay, the direction, the music score, the setting, the costumes, and of course the best movie ending in film history. As many times as I have seen it, within the first ten minutes of the film, I forget that Heston is on planet Earth all along. Now that's great movie making. This film is still so current with its theme of what man is unfortunately capable of doing to itself and the planet if it does not wise up. But back to the film, the way it just sets you up to truly believe that you are on a different planet and are surrounded by all those alien cultures when in fact it is Earth was simply genius. The acting in this film was great by all cast members, especially Kim Hunter.Take the time to watch this film. It is the best ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Twilight Zone Episode! In Color!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's travel back to the year 1968!By now, most everyone has color TV...for the past three to six years. And color TV was no where near the quality of today's TV's. And you better have an antenna on your roof (even the click dial rabbit ears on top of the TV set didn't cut it). Before then...black and white! So going to the movies, especially the films made in technicolor, was an event. This is still almost a decade before cable TV becomes the norm. Science Fiction??? Not exactly rare...but not mainstream either.Now comes 'Planet of the Apes'! A fantasy sci-fi film that gets a rating labeled "M" ('M' for mature audience...Really!!!). This is before the standard 'G', 'PG'...ect.If this review sounds subjective rather than objective, then you're primed for 'Planet of the Apes'. This is a film that came at a crossroad when 60's movies were influenced by new wave cinema while Hollywood tried to desperately cling to old fashion (but still effective) method of tried and true storytelling. This also premiered before the superior '2001: A Space Odyssey' (an even more effective subjective presentation) that would historically influenced elevating sci-fi to its proper place.(Subtle Spoilers) From the opening scene of interstellar stars hurtling past the windows of a light speed traveling spaceship, to its closing moments, the film carries the viewer on an adventure that jerks our emotions from satire to deadly dilemna. Just don't look too hard and enjoy the ride. And that's all 'Planet of the Apes' intends to deliver: a sci-fi epic-like odyssey; a few jabs at human behavior; a tweak to laugh at our own faults; the consequence of blind tradition; and a flip-side of a culture we detest while subconscience-wise admit we are guilty of. But then again...it's a damn good example of what a movie is meant for: suspend your belief for a couple of hours and enjoy some pure escapism from life's (sometimes) harsh realities.Fortunately, the studio took alot of care to restore the film to its near color brilliance that aging chemicals in the negative nearly disintegrated. You may have to pump the color of your TV spectrum controls a few notches to fully appreciate how audiences experienced the wonder of 3 strip technicolor that is no longer utilized, (Godfather PART II in 1974 was one of the last to use the 3 strip method). This is very effective, especially scenes that were filmed outdoors, unlike the 2001 remake (yes...remake!) that tried to cheat the viewer. The 1968 version was before CGI, so outside in the blazing sunshine meant that it was filmed outside in the hot blazing sunshine.Arthur P. Jacobs was the rolling stone that combined so many talents at the right time, and the right time ripe for constantly improving the end result. This is one of Hollywood's few times when so many that were involved, kept improving the project, before a green light was granted to start filming.Charlton Heston is perfectly cast as iconic hero. So is Kim Hunter! And Roddy McDowall (especially Roddy who gave much more in the ensuing sequels than the writing merited; except, of course, 'Beneath...'). And Maurice Evans! And especially; Franklin Schaffner's unique vision that spawned an entire franchise. Bottom line; the Original is best!From Pierre Boulle's novel, to Rod Serling's interpretation (many drafts), to Michael Wilson's polish, 'Apes' exceeded everyone's expectation in 1968! Jerry Goldsmith's score embeleshed a futuristic suspense combined with Ape culture insanity as 'Taylor' is the eyes and ears of a world "turned upside down". The film dares to allow the surviving astronauts to slowly trek across an alien landscape before discovering the planet's true horrors. And then the fun begins! Bizzare landscapes; paradise short term; The Hunt; Ape City; the escape; a kangaroo court; defending the human race; a revelation!! 'Planet of the Apes' has character, color, costumes, humor, scenic vistas that are real, imagination, thought provoking attributes; and a nice twist!Attention: WIDE SCREEN only!!! Before movies in the 70's figured that many people would see a film on TV anyway and framed it with that in mind, 'Planet...' in pan and scan loses almost 50% of the image. This is one movie that is symbolically 'off center'; and most of the dialogue and action take place off to the side where a story tells as much on an actor's reaction to an actor's action. THE only way to see this is Wide-Screen!!8 out of 10! If you saw the 2001 Tim Burton's film...then the original 1968 version gets promoted to a 9 out of 10!To everyone famliar with Rod Serling's 'Twilight Zone'??? Enjoy It!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get your stinkin paws off me you damn dirty apes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was afforded the displeasure of seeing the 2001 version of Planet of the Apes before seeing the original. There were quite a few variances, and I must say that the original was far better. While watching Planet of the Apes I began to realize that the movie was much more than a movie about Apes taking over the planet, it was a movie trying to tackle two very big social issues: 1.) racism &amp; 2.) science v. religion.From the first scene when the humans were being rounded up by the apes, it was wrought with the very manner in which African slaves were treated just a few hundred years ago. They were being netted and shot, then they were caged and constantly being berated and told that they were not even evolved. There were a few lines that came direct from the oppressor handbook, and the hosing scenes were direct from the civil rights protests.Intertwined in the story was that of science versus religion. On the one hand there was the young ape Cornelius who had done some excavation and found artifacts suggesting that an intelligent man existed even before apes and there was a possibility that apes evolved. Opposing him was Dr. Zaius and his counsel who were fervently upholding the sacred texts they had stating that man was always an animal devoid of any real intellect.It was really interesting how this movie played out, and how it was done. The court scene portrayed best the two elements the movie reflected (racism and science v. religion). In the court scene Taylor (Charlton Heston), was not allowed to represent himself or even speak although he exhibited the intelligence to do so, in fact his fate was already decided. And at the same time the arguments of science having findings that contradicted the popular religious thought were not even listened to either, and it was decided that the two young scientists (Cornelius and Zira) had committed heresy. This movie was very deep and thought provoking. It was no mere science fiction, it was more of a drama in the guise of a science fiction to be more palatable and not such a ringing wake up call.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the late '90s, I worked with a young guy who felt that rock and roll began and ended with Grunge groups like Nirvana, Alice in Chains, etc. I tried to explain to him that without Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and the Beatles, groups like his favorites wouldn't exist. He scoffed at the notion, and called those groups dated and hokey. He played me a tape of an upcoming band, and we got some tickets to their show. I remarked that they sounded a lot like Zeppelin, and he scoffed at that, too.Midway through the show they started to play a riff that I recognized, and then broke into a rousing cover of a little known Zeppelin tune. After the show I told the kid that they had covered a band he supposedly loathed, only to find out that he really never listened to Led Zeppelin, but took it on faith that they were a "dinosaur" band to be scorned.When I read the reviews of younger viewers of this film, I see terms like "dated" and referrals to the groundbreaking makeup effects as "hokey". You people need to get a grasp of history, the artists of today certainly have, and any current special effects artist stands on the shoulders of those who came before.Planet of the Apes has become a cultural icon, parodied by the likes of Homer Simpson, and the simple fact that it has enjoyed such staying power reveals that it was a very original, groundbreaking film. Like other sci fi of its era, Soylent Green, Silent Running, etc., it has a downbeat ending, and in the case of Planet of the Apes, very shocking for its time.So much of modern film is derivative of Planet of the Apes that it has earned a place as one of the precursors in theme and effect to many more "sophisticated" and technologically advanced movies; those viewers who downplay and ignore such great films only end up shortchanging themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't watched "Planet of the Apes" for a very long while. With the impending release of the 2001 version of the film, I decided to take another look at this old classic.I think anyone who hasn't seen "Planet of the Apes", will enjoy this film. The premise of future earth being dominated by "intelligent" apes makes for an interesting story. Coupled to this, are some excellent locations, decent performances and a neat ending.If, however you were looking for a scientifically rational, well scripted epic, better look elsewhere. "Planet of the Apes" script is filled with more holes than a swiss cheese.I was wondering why anyone would send a character like "Taylor" on a space mission. Was he supposed to be an astronaut? a scientist? or just a big boorish bully-boy. As the three scientists explore their new planet home, what do they do when they finally come across the first sign of life (a bush). They dig it up of course! I was also amazed at how nonchalant they all were when they came across the ape totems. I would expect an intelligent person, upon confirming the existence of other intelligent life, would display some appropriate measure of surprise and wonder (even fear).But it was all taken in stride by the characters in this film. Disappointing and unrealistic.There are many more anomalies, which spoilt the experience for me. More often than not, I found myself laughing while watching, and I don't think this was the intended response the director was looking for."Planet of the Apes" is a light-weight enjoyable, entertaining film. Just don't think about it too deeply.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Planet of the Apes does look more than a little dated - special effects-wise - when compared to the likes of Avatar and so on. However, few films will have the impact of this sixties cult classic. If you've already seen in, you'll know the part I'm talking about. If you haven't (and you have an appreciation for classic sci-fi in general) then you should definitely watch it. It's more than just some flimsy pulp sci-fi starring men in rubber masks.First of all, the masks are actually pretty convincing and the apes take on personalities of their own. But, it's Charlton Heston's film really. He plays the last of three astronauts who crash lands on a planet where humans are feral mutes and apes are the dominant species.He plays the cynical leader of the mission who was trying to get away from humanity. Well, he certainly got his wish. Now, he finds himself a prisoner of the apes who want to cut him open and find out why he keeps nattering on! There's action (hardly on a par with anything of today's standards), but it's still good, plus great characters and sci-fi of a quality that will stay with you forever. I'm not saying anything that will spoil it (assuming you haven't seen it already). Just don't look at one of the cover designs - I really can't believe that they allowed that to be the first image you see of the film!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An exceptionally well-made science fiction masterpiece directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. Three astronauts land on a planet many light years from Earth and find themselves in an upside down evolutionary nightmare with chimps, gorillas and orangutans ruling. Charlton Heston, playing nearly the entire film at such a level that he seems ready to explode at any moment, is the lead spaceman with Kim Hunter &amp; Roddy McDowell are the sympathetic scientist chimps who help him escape the clutches of a power mad government stooge (played by the great Maurice Evans as an orangutan). The film is entertaining from beginning to end and as horrifying as its premise is, it's not without humor, poking fun at the generation gap (it's 1968!) as well as government bureaucrats (note the way in which the assembly refuses to even listen to Hunter &amp; McDowell as they plead to save Heston). Despite the heavy make-up, the performances by Hunter &amp; McDowell really shine through. They're great, as is Evans in one of his rare film roles. James Daly, James Whitmore and Lou Wagner (hilarious as Hunter's rebellious nephew) all don John Chambers' impressive ape make-up. The creepy, now classic music score is by Jerry Goldsmith and the script was worked on by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling. It's based, very loosely, on Pierre Boulle's novel. This original spawned four sequels of varying quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows about Planet of the Apes. this is just one of those classic sic-fi movies that everyone knows about. this is also known for being an incredibly cheesy movie about taking apes. I know this is exactly what I expected when I first downloaded this movie because I was bored. But I have to say this movie went beyond my expectations. As a matter of fact this is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. The movie is about a man and his crew of astronauts who go onto a mission into space. their ship crash-lands on an unknown planet. On this planet is a flip flopped society where humans behave as animals and Apes are the civilized intelligent race, wearing cloths, living in houses, and of coarse, talk, and even hunt the humans who are naked, mute living in the wild. however the astronauts from our planet are of coarse civilized. but are captured by a Ape hunting group. things start to get interesting when one of the astronaut show signs of actually being capable of thought, which of coarse in this simian society is supposedly impossible. The plot may sound somewhat cheesy, but trust me, it isn't. this movie is huge on social commentary, and questions about the very society we live in. This movie really never feels silly at any point.My one issue with this movie is the first 30 minutes of it, which some really slow and painfully boring moments. even with moment where nothing appears to be happening. But when the Apes make their first appearance, the movie couldn't be more exciting.I would recommend this movie to any fan of sic-fi, or even anyone who has ever enjoyed a movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Don't look for it, Taylor, you might not like what you find"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PLOT: George Taylor and two other astronauts experience some type of time warp in space and crashland on a distant planet over 2000 years in the future. They soon discover that highly evolved apes rule the planet while humans are disdained "animals." WHAT WORKS: First of all, Charlton Heston is outstanding as the disillusioned humanity-hating Taylor. Taylor is brilliantly put in the ironic position of representing humankind to the apes. Although I love Heston in other films like "Ben-Hur" and "The Ten Commandments," I believe Taylor is his best role and performance. Heston was, incidentally, 43 years old at the time of filming. He's utterly captivating in the role and charismatic in an anti-hero sense.The first 35 minutes of the film involve the crashland, the search over the wastelands, the discovery of primitives and, finally, the potent cornfield revelation. This segment is one of my favorite parts of the film. The desert wastelands are awe-inspiring and one can't help but enjoy Taylor's amusingly pessimistic antics. This part of the film is highly mysterious in nature. Where ARE they? Why are there so few signs of life? Did Taylor hate humanity so much that he was literally willing to escape his home world? Who made the strange X-shaped scarecrows? Why can't the primitive "cavemen" speak? Who planted the crops of corn?When the story shifts to the ape city the film takes on an entirely different vibe. There's suddenly no more mystery and the shift is so jarring that the film momentarily loses its captivating sense of awe. No matter, the viewer is soon engulfed in the social dynamics of the ape society.The rough-hewn, alien-looking rock city sets are marvelous and the ape make-up is exceptional considering the time period. In fact, it holds up pretty well even to this day.It is soon discovered that the apes have three distinct "races": The chimps are scientific, humanitarian and pacifistic; the gorillas are militaristic; and the orangutans are the respected elders &amp; religious leaders. The attention to detail of the ape society, and the social dynamics thereof, is nothing less than brilliant. The apes have their own distinctive walk and the actors do a splendid job depicting facial expressions through all that make-up, giving life to their characters.The story's characters are distinctly fleshed-out and superbly performed by all involved: Nova, the animal-like primal beauty (Linda Harrison). Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), who are willing to risk everything for the sake of the truth and their ideals. Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evens), the defender of the apes' religious faith and protector of their society. Heck, even the secondary characters are great, like the chimp teenager Lucius and the gorilla jailguard Julius.Although Dr. Zaius is portrayed as an antagonist, it's impossible to hate him. One ascertains that he only acts in the best interest of the apes. He's very learned and, although he doesn't know or believe everything about Taylor and humankind in general, he does know that humans were once the dominant species of the planet, ages ago, but they foolishly destroyed themselves and their great society. He knows very well that the apes have this same destructive potential so he does everything in his power to protect the community he knows and loves. Note how Cornelius and Zira regard Zaius with the reverence and respect at all times, even when they are fugitives and Taylor has Zaius captive. This shows their humility and respectfulness. Also notice that, at the very end, right before Taylor and Nova depart down the shoreline on the horse, Zaius suddenly has it in his power to stop and even kill Taylor, but he DOESN'T. He lets them go. Why? I believe this reveals his good character and shows that he's not a villain at all. He knew Taylor could have easily killed him numerous times when he had the upper hand, so he mercifully returns the favor -- to an "animal" no less! Also, consider this: Although Zaius is shown in a negative light by hindering scientific efforts to discover historical truth, the Lawgiver's scriptures that he quotes from are RIGHT -- humans ARE destructive &amp; made a desert of parts of the planet and, for the sake of ape society, should not be allowed to "breed in great numbers." Zaius obviously feels that the apes, in general, can't handle the truth. The climax is incredible (SPOILER ALERT!): Taylor and Nova travel a LONG distance down the shoreline while the viewer hears eerie music on the soundtrack. Something's just not right; it's too quiet and uneventful. There's no way it's gonna end like this. And then, suddenly, the truth about the "planet of the apes" is revealed. Utterly dumbfounded, Taylor jumps off his horse and furiously pounds his fists into the surf while screaming curses at humanity.Also, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is PERFECT -- fittingly eerie and primal.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Sometimes the apes' mouths don't move enough when they speak and it clearly looks artificial. Also, there are a few corny elements of dialogue and the social commentary is occasionally tacky.The only real plothole is that the apes speak English (!), which means this couldn't be another planet, unless it's perhaps another dimension with certain parallels. FINAL ANALYSIS: This is a great science-fiction film, even though it's well over forty years old. Every time I see it I re-discovered certain things and "see" others for the first time! I should also point out that "Planet of the Apes" is very adult-oriented (even though kids will, of course, appreciate many aspects of it). Although there is quite a bit of action, it is by no means an action flick. It's primarily a dialogue-driven sci-fi adventure. Lastly, this film and its sequel "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" (which is technically the only sequel) should be viewed as ONE long film/story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Year: 1968. That was great year in film industry. What a beautiful films: Planet of the Apes, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Once Upon a Time in the West, Night of the Living Dead, Rosemary's Baby, Romeo and Juliet...Planet of the Apes is simply the best of them all. Science fiction masterpiece. It is almost perfect. I watched this film so many times. I was scared a lot when I was a kid, and now I am impressed every time, again and again. In my opinion this is one of the best films ever made.I still miss Charlton Heston, I still miss my all time favorite "ape" Roddy McDowall, also Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans. And truly great film director: Franklin J. Schaffner.Till now there are 5 films after original Planet of the Apes (1968): Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972), Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973), and newest: Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). That means 6 "Planet of the Apes" films now, and looks possible - there will be some more in near future.If you have a chance to watch remake of this film: "Planet of the Apes (2001)" don't even think about it. Run. Just run and don't look back. That so called film is insult to this masterpiece. That should never been made.Some "Planet of the Apes" films are good, some are not so good. But this? This is the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my cup of tea, but . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The name of the film and its premise has never really struck a whole lot of interest in me. Granted it's considered a classic and a great film, and I do own the film's legendary soundtrack solely for Goldsmith's name. I've had some interest in seeing it but not on the same scale as Patton (also by Schaffner), Citizen Kane, or Nosferatu. Planet of the Apes just seemed too silly, too out there.However, through that hesitation, I have to say Planet of the Apes did keep me entertained throughout the entire length of its running time; like with films by Welles, and Hitchcock, watching this classic by Schaffner was like looking at an old photo-album that shows early roots and developments of popular (now gimmicky) sci-fi concepts, and I always love that feeling.Now we've come a long ways and the concept of the human race being eradicated or enslaved has been molded in numerous directions and made more complex, but seldom handled as gracefully as the original Planet of the Apes with its slower pacing, simpler explanation, and a thought-provoking (not an adrenaline induced) resolution. I love films that can create intensity without filling the screen with explosions and over-the-top gunfights, and as Schaffner would prove here and especially with his next film, Patton, he was a master of doing just that.And the means of creating the onscreen tension was pure genius in its simplicity - create a character for us to sympathize with, Taylor, and throw him into a world where all the rules are set against him. We know the oppressing Apes are only seeing through an unfair bias and missing out on the facts clearly obvious to us, and we know a simple acknowledgment is all it would take to resolve that tension. Which sparks and introspective thought - are we, individually, like that on any issues where one miniscule detail prevents progress? Well done Schaffner.Amazingly, the craft of the film rises far above than the premise's implication (a planet of monkeys? Yay). It didn't quite live up to its `classic' reputation for me, but it did surprise me with how much I wound up liking it. Still not my cup of tea, it's not a film I'd watch frequently nor one I would actively recommend to every casual moviegoer . . . but it is a very solid well made movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They just don´t get it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I´ve got to say that "Planet of the Apes" is a brilliant, intelligent and well-made SF-Movie. But as we have a lot of comments already I want to concentrate on two topics, ignoring however the plot of the unforgivable bad sequels.First I just can´t understand that so many viewers who wrote here there comments just don´t get the plot right. The apes DID NOT evolve from man of course and it´s not mentioned in the movie at any time! Did you get that finally? They evolved from the now-a-day apes, from our chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. The nuclear war first wiped out our civilization and probably nearly all of mankind, the few survivors degenerated and some how the apes got intelligent. Not completely impossible although the time period is much too short for natural evolution. Possibly genetically manipulated primates survived and mutated due to radioactive radiation, I don´t know. But I DO know that the apes in the movie did not evolve from mankind.Second I believe there are several compromises necessary to make a movie workout, although it violates natural laws or even logic. The space battles from "Star Wars" would be pretty irritating without sound in space. In "Phantastic voyage" the scenes in the body had to be lighted or the voyage wouldn´t be very phantastic looking at all. And "Planet of the Apes" wouldn´t stand a chance to the average US-audience when nearly the complete dialogue would be spoken in a fictitious ape-language of the fourtieth century. Of course there could have been "apish" dialogues but then the movie would have been out of the cinemas within a week in a country whose people tend to ignore even movies made in really existing foreign languages. (Yes this IS meant to critizise the US-audience!)Finally I want to say that "Planet of the apes" is definitely a classic SF-Movie and shouldn´t be violated by a remake. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how I made it nearly three decades without seeing "Planet of the Apes," and I have to say it was a lot better than I thought it would be. I was expecting something kind of campy and cheap, but it was actually pretty clever and well done. It's another example of how Hollywood has de-evolved over the years. What movie made today would allow 30 minutes of three men wandering in the desert just for the sole purpose of emphasizing their isolation? I haven't seen the 2001 re-make, but I bet more time was devoted to overblown action sequences than intelligent debate about ethics, theology, and science.I really did like it, but it struck me as being little more than a beefed up episode of "The Twillight Zone." And was it just me or did *every single scene* end with Charlton Heston either having a collar thrown around his neck or being dragged away in a net? That's nitpicking. If you haven't seen it yet, get your damn dirty paws on a copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of American astronauts get lost in space and crash onto a strange planet. The wander around in the empty, desolate landscape but find only frightened humans, seconds later they are captured and mostly killed by apes on horseback wearing jackboots. Taylor survives and is captured ? he is shocked to hear them talk, but they too are shocked as humans cannot speak on this planet. Taylor plans to escape and with the help of the more scientific of the monkeys he is able to, despite the warmongering gorillas desire to stamp out the humans.Despite several sequels of increasingly diminishing returns, a TV show, a cartoon and a comparatively poor remake recently, the original Planet of the Apes stills stands out as a really good film and much better than all those who, pardon me, aped it in later sequels. The plot is well known to all now and the film makes good use of putting the apes in the roles of humans and reducing Taylor to the status of a monkey, and later a threat. The film is a little slow at times but moves quickly for the most part. The ending is a real blast ? even when you know it, it's still a classic scene.Heston is good (long before he became a gun nut) and is restrained considering he doesn't really speak very much in the first hour. The ape makeup is as good as the Oscars said ? even if A Space Odyssey's were better ? and the actors are better as a result. Given more facial expression McDowall, Hunter and Evans all bring their roles to life well.Overall this is not a classic film but it is pretty good and is well known to even those who haven't seen it! Some really classic lines, scenes and a memorable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Mirror: See Our End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The key to understanding this product of the 60's Counter Culture is when Taylor laughs scornfully at the astronaut planting the flag. The astronaut says,"Why are you here? You hated society and you had nothing but contempt for man?" Yes, earlier we heard Taylor, on the flight recorder, asking if man still 'made war on his brother.' This anti-hero is the center of Serling's adaptation of the book. The movie builds to two peaks thematically. The first one is full of suspense with Taylor surrounded by mute humans with a throat injury that causes him to blend imperceptibly with the rest of the group. We know it is coming, when it does it elicits a gasp of terror we here re-prised in Dawn only it is inverted, there it comes from the humans not the Apes. "Take your GD hands off me, you damn dirty Apes!" Taylor, existentially, reclaims Humans hegemony over the Apes at this peak. Many viewers consider this the apex, I do not. The second peak is much more important thematically for grasping this pure allegory. Taylor and Nova find the Statue Of Liberty half buried on a sandy, wave swept beach, Taylor cannot contain his rage,"They really did it, damn you all to hell!" What is important to notice is his language, 'they' did it, damn 'you' to hell. Notice how he shares emotional consanguinity with our collective fate while still distancing himself existentially from the rest of us. This is critical for this is the allegorical center aimed by Seriling at the : Tune In, Turn On And Drop Out millions that are walking away in contempt from the Zeitgeist this was made within. Taylor is the personification of the Counter Culture. That laughter at the flag, hatred of 'The Man' could not be clearer. See, Serling's stern warning? Go ahead, walk away, you share our species fate; maybe you should have taken a greater interest? This allegory is an attack upon the sub-culture of disaffection that was so powerful in the greatest year of tumult in the US, 1968. Serling gives us plenty of hints that we are on earth: The Forbidden Zone, early human weapons, Christianity converted into the Ape Lawgiver religion, subtle geographic hints with the surroundings after we emerge from the desolate Forbidden Zone. That area's barren landscape the director pairs with unearthly creepy dissonant music that, coupled with the Ape scarecrows, really tricks us into thinking they are on another world. Yes, the Ape masks are dated and it muffles their voices and enunciation but really, the rest of the movie is one of the most clever allegories ever written. Serling's work really is of one piece, like his Twilight Zone, the movie's message is aimed right at Taylor.Notice the contrast between the laughing, scornful, insouciant Taylor at the beginning and the enraged, furious Taylor yelling recriminations at the ending. The hints above will make you, during your first showing, angry at yourself for not guessing where they are. Made during the height of the Cold War when millions of young people were walking away from their culture when you return this to its Zeitgeist, it will make sense to you. Taylor still holds his ontological estrangement, verbally, even when he sees our end. His emotion may betray his feeling of relation to us but he still re-establishes his existential alienation from us. Serling has him this way to teach us, through his anger, yet his alienation, that he shares our guilt. Also, still being estranged, why isn't he happy? Remember how elated he was to escape all of us at the beginning? The cause of the rage is his guilt at worrying that maybe if he, and the generation he represents, took a greater interest our annihilation may have been avoided. I see lots of criticism of this nearly fifty year old movie but please see the allegory not the dated effects. They were stunning for their time; this is a great science fiction movie for its powerful warning to the disaffected then and now: We are all in this together. It may be old but the theme of humanity being one that shares the same fate still is powerful today. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the PLANET OF THE APES film series. I did not wanted to review all of the movies, so here's what I am going to do. I will review the original films, then the 2001 remake, the 2011 reboot and the 2014 sequel to the reboot.Now, let's begin with the original series with the 1968 original film, PLANET OF THE APES.The film tells the story of an astronaut crew who crash-land on a strange planet in the distant future. Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins.This film was groundbreaking for it's prosthetic makeup techniques by artist John Chambers, and was well received by critics and audiences and launched a film franchise, including four sequels as well as a short-lived TV show, animated series, comic books and other merchandising.The original series was followed by Tim Burton's remake Planet of the Apes, released in 2001 and the reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, in 2011 and the 2014 sequel to the reboot Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.Charton Heston played the role of George Taylor and he was incredible for the part. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall played the sympathetic chimpanzees Zira and Cornelus and Linda Harrison played the love interest of Charlton Heston's character, Nova. Maurice Evans played the villain, Dr. Zaius and they all played their parts wonderfully.The finale, in which Taylor comes upon a ruined Statue of Libery and realizes that he has been on Earth all along, became the series' defining scene and one of the most iconic images in 1960's film.The make-up was amazing and fantastic and John Chambers did a really great job. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score was amazing and his score was nominated for an Oscar. Morton Haack's costume design was really amazing as well.Overall, PLANET OF THE APES - the 1968 version - is really amazing and it gets a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a masterpiece. Most of the time when I give a film 10 on IMDb it is to do it justice and try to make up for people who drag the rating down.This thought-provoking epic puts real life in a surreal one. Political issues, animal treatment and many more captivating themes are used. Whereas the special effects are terrible, it is a film which does not need any action at all to be excellent,, so if your idea of a great film is 300, I would strongly recommend that you do not watch this film. Overall, Charlton Heston delivers excellent, moving scenes and quotes and the film's ending is probably the best ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes (1968): Dir: Franklyn J. Schaffner / Cast: Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore: Here is a total switch on the rules with regards to dominance. Four astronauts are in hyper sleep and land in water on a bare rocky planet. A female astronaut died and the other two are killed at the hands of a band of apes on horseback who capture humans for sport and research. After a throat injury Charlton Heston is caged with a woman. He cannot speak but after an escape attempt he yells out, "Get your paws off me, you damn dirty ape!" Heston makes failed attempts to convey his story of humans but the apes won't have it until he takes matters into his own hands. Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter play an engaged chimp couple doing research on humans. They are sympathetic to Heston's cause when they realize that he is superior intelligence. Maurice Evans plays an orangutan who heads the courts and denies Heston on every single claim until Heston decides to force his proof. James Whitmore plays the president of the assembly. We have chimpanzees in the labs. We have orangutans heading the courts. We have gorillas hunting humans. Gibbons seem to be left out in the ape department here. The ending is a big downer, and watching Heston kiss a female ape is retching but its role reversal is intriguing. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this as a teenager almost 20 years ago and genuinely didn't know the ending, so that famous twist was a beautiful revelation to me. Incredible to think that this film has had video &amp; DVD releases which effectively reveal the twist on the front cover! Still, what this recent second-watch has taught me is that even knowing the twist can't sully what an incredible film this is. There's at least three epic memorable moments of cinema: - the booming dark tones of trumpets &amp; bassoons as we get the first sight of apes.- "get your filthy paws of me you damn dirty ape!" - and of course, the ending reveal.The rest of the film is also brilliant: nicely-paced, good deep dialogue, well acted, great make-up, believable characters, cinematically-shot, perfectly-weighted use of dramatic music and the introduction to a huge mythology.The classic-era sequels are also interesting, tho' the general quality tails off quite a bit. I've only seen bits of Tim Burton's effort but it looks bland. The new origin series peaked my interest, with Rise getting a 7/10 from me, good enough to make me want to watch Dawn.But no match for the original, and best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest pleasant surprise from a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My brother highly recommended this movie to me one night. I was expecting to enjoy it...I was not expecting to completely fall in love with it. Insanely excellent writing, completely likable characters, strange, yet original twilight zone style story, good cinematography, and awesome sets make this one of the best classic films of all time.Three astronauts land on a distant planet after being in hyper sleep for 2000 years during a space expedition. On the planet, human beings are wild animals, and apes are civilized and rule all. Ape scientists Cornelius and Zira, who are trying to prove the early existence of humans before ape, may have found the answer when one of the astronauts provides intelligence.The setup is brilliant. It quickly sets up the plot with clever twists and shocking turns, and introduces the characters in a clever fashion. For 1968, it looks really sharp. The story does look like something that came right out of the Twilight Zone. It's definitely kind of corny, but it takes itself seriously enough to be a convincing plot. The setup is interesting, the makeup and costumes are very good. Nobody can be identified in their roles.All the cast and characters are fantastic, the supporting roles in particular. My favorite character is Zira played by Kim Hunter. She's the motherly, sympathetic, intelligent character that defends the astronaut to the very end. By the end of the film, I was attracted to her. Cornelius, played by Roddy MacDowell, just as bad ass, supportive, and intelligent. Dr. Zaius played by Maurice Evans is just a jerk, going out of his way to disprove any former existence of man by sabotaging the astronaut and the theory developed by Cornelius. Charlton Heston is also really awesome. Even though he's the standard pretty face for the leading man, he gets dirty and gritty on certain moments and shouts some of the most famous movie quotes ever.Even though it's relatively a not very eventful film, (not till the end anyway) it's so well shot and well written that you're just invested in everything that's happening. The idea is strange, but they make it work so well with the writing. It just spells classic. You feel confident for the main character and the supporting cast. Even though it ends with a cliffhanger, you leave on a positive, mostly uplifting note.It's simply an amazingly likable film. The dialog is easy to follow, the characters are easy to fall in love with, and it's incredibly imaginative and creative. I'd recommend this to anybody who loves a good classic, because this is a great classic. This film knocked me off my ass, I was not expecting to love it this much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his fellow astronauts, Landon (Robert Gunner) and Dodge (Jeff Burton) take off with a female astronaut Stewart (Diane Stanley) to test theories about time in deep space. They fall asleep and wake up to discover they've crash landed in an ocean on some planet in the year 3978. Stewart dies at some point while they were sleeping, and Taylor, Landon and Dodge barely make it out of the spaceship before it sinks. They make it ashore, and traverse a huge desert where nothing can grow. They've got three days to find food, or they die, they find a flower, then some weird looking scarecrows and finally trees and a flowing stream of water. The astronauts make it to a corn field where they see some mute prehistoric humans. Taylor thinks he'll be running this planet in no time. But then things grow eerily quiet, there's gunfire and creatures on horseback. The humans all instinctively run, the creatures hunting the humans are gorillas, and they mean to kill every last human they see.Taylor and Landon survive the hunt, but Dodge does not. Taylor is shot in the throat during the hunt, and loses the ability to speak. taken to Ape City where he's given a blood transfusion, and survives. Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) is a chimpanzee animal psychologist who is fascinated by Taylor's attempts to speak. Her boyfriend Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) is a chimp archaeologist, who's done some interesting digs to find out about the origins of the simian society. Taylor communicates to Zira and Cornelius through handwritten notes, a human who can communicate is a direct threat to the order of the society that Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) Chief Science Officer and Defender of the Faith has built. Zaius orders that Taylor be neutered, immediately. Taylor learns of the plan and escapes the cage where he is kept, after a long chase, just when all seems lost for Taylor, his voice comes back and he cannot be killed now because he can speak.Taylor is given a show trial, and remanded to Zaius' custody where he promises to spare Taylor if he outs his talking human colony. Taylor says there are no others and faces certain death. Does Taylor die at the hands of Dr. Zaius? Does Taylor ever find out more about this strange planet where apes rule over mute men?I first watched this movie on TV in the 1970's, when I was around five years old, to my five year old mind, gorillas riding around on horseback hunting humans was the coolest thing ever. As I got older, I understood the many complex issues discussed in this movie, nuclear war, evolution, the tension between faith and science (very timely these days) time travel, animal experimentation, even the cruel treatment of animals in captivity. The trial of George Taylor was similar to the Scopes trial, with apes arguing over evolution instead of humans, there was even a social pecking order in the ape world, with orangutans having most of the powerful government functions, chimps doing the scientific work, as it were, and gorillas doing the military work. All these facets in the story and the fact that the screenplay was co-written by Rod Serling, the genius behind The Twilight Zone made this movie endlessly entertaining and fascinating. The other co-writer Michael Wilson, co- wrote such classics as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai, The iconic line "Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape", comes at such a pivotal point in the movie, and is so perfectly delivered by Heston, that the viewer cannot help but cheer that line. The script is not perfect however, most notably regarding women, the female astronaut is killed before ever leaving the ship, Nova is mute, and once Taylor talks to her, he says some incredibly sexist things to her. The strongest feminist voice belongs to Zira, who in a lot of ways is not only Cornelius equal, but superior to him, prodding him to act when he is too timid.The acting especially by Heston is superb, he doesn't play his usual epic hero, like Moses in the Ten Commandments or Ben Hur, in this movie he is an anti-hero, much in keeping with the times, the turbulent 1960's. Heston's character George Taylor didn't like people much, he didn't even like his fellow crewmembers, he thought he had all the answers, in other words, he is a character in search of a comeuppance, and boy does he ever get one. But as the last intelligent member of humankind, the viewer can't help but root for Taylor despite all his shortcomings. Roddy McDowell was still feeling his way in this movie, he has some good lines but he plays the chimp Caesar with much more command in the later movies. Kim Hunter gives an exceptionally strong performance, I just realized that when watching it now, she is the one who moves the story along, and she has some of the best lines, including a comedic one to Heston. She played Stella in Streetcar opposite Brando, so obviously she can act. Maurice Evans was also superb as Dr. Zaius, the tension was palpable in the scene between him and Heston in their scene alone in Zaius office. The direction was eye-catching by Franklin Schaffner, who directed Patton and the Boys From Brazil, another favorite of mine. Schaffner adds many unique touches to this film, The plane crash in the beginning of the film, grabs the viewer immediately, the chase scene that ends up with Heston speaking is gripping, how he waits till the last possible second to show the apes in the hunt scene to get the full shock value is amazing, and of course the last scene is one the most iconic in movie history.For more reviews to go ape over, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A spaceship from 1972 Earth crashes on a planet in the year 3978. The surviving astronauts, led by Taylor (Charlton Heston), soon discover the planet is ruled by intelligent talking apes while the humans on the planet are treated as animals.This classic sci-fi is one of the all-time greats. The intelligent, satirical script was co-written by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame. It doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to picture this film fitting right in as a feature-length episode of that series. The cast is terrific, despite most of the actors being hidden behind masks. Terrific masks, by the way. Heston is also great in one of his signature roles. Wonderful location shooting. Famous ending probably doesn't have the same impact for new viewers today, as it's been copied and ripped-off many times. Followed by several sequels and a short-lived TV series in the '70s, as well as an unnecessary remake by Tim Burton in 2001 and a surprisingly good series reboot in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal favorite movie of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" is truly my personal favorite movie of the series, and it is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. I thought the filmmakers put their greatest effort into the project from adapting the novel, and making it a classic movie. Charlton Heston was absolutely outstanding for taking on the role as the main lead, and does make you root for him and feel sorry because of the issues he is having with the apes. The rest of the cast Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, and such were great in their own roles. The makeup design by John Chambers were groundbreaking at the time, but they still look marvelously well done today. I thought the music by Jerry Goldsmith was really very well effective, and I thought he created something more interesting than any other science fiction music that were done in the 50s and 60s science fiction movies. The director Franklin J. Schaffner, who would go on to direct another great movie "Patton" has done a brilliant job on the movie. The movie does go by at a very good pace, and does not seem to drag; it really did kept me going, and I thought the premise was very well done as well as the story. The locations for the movie were incredibly well shot, and I do love the look of Ape City. Lastly, I do love how we as the audience wanted to know about how the Apes live and what their society is like. I also would love to give props to the very last minute of the movie, which I thought was very chilling. I love it before, and it still hold up quite well. I give this movie a perfect powerhouse 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Underrated Films Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet Of The Apes gets a bad rap. People dis on it just because the masks and special effects look a little fake. Well, stuff them! Planet Of The Apes is awesome, and i'm going to tell you why.Let me start off with the acting. The acting in this film is great! The way they were able to develop the ape's characters personalities through those rubber masks is amazing! Charlton Heston is fantastic as the main character, and Nova was a surprisingly good actor!Most people only see pictures of the ape masks and think: FAKE! THAT MOVIE SUCKS!!!!! Well, c'mon, it doesn't look that bad! Maybe if it was made today people would have the rights to laugh at it, but, the film was made 45 years ago! CGI didn't exist yet! SO DON"T JUDGE THIS FILM ON ITS EFFECTS!!!Now we've gone over the acting and effects, we can talk about the actual film. Planet Of The Apes is great. what more is there to say? It has an important message and is very deep, it talks about heavy subject matters such as evolution and war, and its funny, but stays serious. I'm not going to spoil anything, but that ending! My god! Overall, Planet Of The Apes is a great satire and is overall fantastic. This movie is very highly recommended in my point of view.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science-fiction at its very best *personal TOP 10*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagination, vision, style, credibility (at least theoretically!) and being about much more than science-fiction itself: the hallmarks of quality for the genre, and this movie has them in abundance. The opening sequences of the 3 astronauts stranded in a desert landscape on a planet they know not where are captivating, setting the tone of utter alien mystery and hinting at dreadful conflicts to come. The surreal musical score by Jerry Goldsmith (who also penned arguably the most powerful and dark horror theme of all time, 'The Omen') is vital to this. The hand of Rod Serling, of Twilight Zone fame, surely makes itself felt in the script too. Some aspects may be a little dated, such as the monkey make- up and the melodramatic delivery of Charlton Heston - "It's a mad house, a maaad house!" - but still it towers above the misdirected remake of Tim Burton which for all its production values and technology comes across as ill-conceived Gothic nonsense. Not so the original epic here, which is sci-fi, drama and philosophy rolled into one, with masterly plotting and direction. Also, this is a fine example of how a movie can surpass the novel on which it was based - 'Monkey Planet', by Pierre Boulle, which is actually rather poor - and demonstrate the artistic status of the movie idiom.The story of Planet of the Apes is essentially one of the mystery of the marooned, followed by the peril of discovery and survival on the planet they have crashed-landed upon. After the perfectly unfolded opening, the inexorable and fearful revelations of their predicament form the adventures and character interactions in the meat of the movie. Engrossing though these are, the true genius of the package is in its commentary on the nature of mankind and the roles of religious myth and science, much of this carried in the lines of Taylor (Heston) and the apes Zira, Cornelius (the memorable Roddy MacDowell) and Zaius. "Man is a pestilence," quotes Zaius from his religious scriptures. "He makes war against his brother, and lays waste to all around him." He goes on to claim nothing he has seen would contradict this wisdom, to which the normally resilient Taylor has no answer. The greatest 'humanity', ironically, is to be seen in the characters of Zira and Cornelius. Planet of the Apes is a brilliant re-imagining of evolution, through which are worked the themes of bigotry, cruelty and war. We are even treated to a grotesque parody of the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, and a vision of the '3 wise monkeys', whilst the violence of the military wing of the Apes' society is obvious enough. But is all this any worse than the world from which Taylor and his fellow astronaut's came? The ending, of course, is legend in itself.God damn anyone to hell who does not appreciate the greatness of this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Connor Macgregor Reviews...Planet Of The Apes (1968 Version)I remember seeing the 2001 remake and don't remember much of it...but i decided to check out the 1968 original to see how good this film really is.And boy i wasn't disappointed.Now this film is DARK...VERY DARK...WELL QUITE DARK.The story is very good and is very enjoyable.The characters are splendid in this even Nova who never speaks in the film (don't tell me if she does in the next one...and yes i know what happens in 2). Charlton Heston is great as Taylor as he is thrown into this unknown world in which he knows nothing about.He is separated from his two other friends and he is left to fight on his own.I won't spoil the ending for it is simply so surprising...i knew the ending but watching the film for the first time gave me more of a shock than i thought i would know.It leaves open some sort of a story for the sequel...which i will review tomorrow or watch tomorrow and post it later.Overall i enjoyed the first film.Dark story,great characters,incredible action sequences and a surprising climax.Rating - 81% - A- - **** Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a mission in space Charlton Heston and his crew get a fast forward courtesy of a 'time bend' and they wind up hundreds of years in the future. And on a planet where evolution has reversed a step. It's the apes that are the species created in the image of the Creator and humans are at best entertaining and at worse a lower form of animal that threatens the existence of Simian Civilization.As Heston so aptly puts it he thinks he's arrived in a mad house. Two simian scientists, Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell have true scientific curiosity and want to know more about this human with articulate speech. But they answer to Maurice Evans who acts more like the high priest of simian religion and will do anything to protect the orthodoxy of his faith.Sounds familiar, doesn't it? As is true in human religions on earth, those in charge have power over the true believers and will do anything to protect their privileged position. The apes haven't done anything different, it's what is driving Charlton Heston quite out of his mind.My favorite in this film is Maurice Evans and seeing him in that orangutan costume and makeup and hearing that classically trained voice come from same is a treat that keeps on treating every time you see this film and the sequel films that he did appear in. Today's audience cannot appreciate the familiar voices of people like Evans, McDowell, Hunter, James Whitmore and James Daly who are in ape costume, but even so the makeup remains a marvel.In fact it got Planet Of The Apes its only Oscar and well deserved. In the past you simply would put some actor in a gorilla costume in some B and lower grade feature, but it was never convincing. The actors here look like simians and must have rehearsed for weeks to get simian movements down as well as they do.In the end Heston goes off to meet his destiny and the destiny that met mankind while he was asleep and time bended. Planet Of The Apes is as fresh as it was when it arrived on the big screen in 1968 and with a lot of the same lessons to be learned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Taylor leads a group of four astronauts sent to explore the farthest reaches of outer space. Hibernation, time dilation and light speed travel combine to send them 2,000 years into the future. They crash-land on a distant planet. What they will discover will shock them. Shock us too.One astronaut, the female of the group, didn't survive the journey. The other three have to abandon ship in a hurry because they've landed in water and that ship is sinking. With only the sparest provisions they make their way ashore. What they find is a barren, seemingly uninhabited, desert-like world. But they eventually do find some humans. But not humans like we know them. These humans are primitive creatures. Mute, dressed in rags, seemingly devoid of any intelligence. And then the apes arrive. Gorillas attack the humans, killing some and capturing others. Taylor is shot in the throat and dragged away to the ape habitat. Here he finds that in this world it is the apes who have evolved. They walk, they talk. They have their own society. Gorilla hunters, chimpanzee scientists, orangutan leaders. In this world Taylor is the animal.His throat wound rendering him unable to speak Taylor is unable to convince the apes he is intelligent, evolved, unlike all the other primitive humans they hunt for sport. But a chimpanzee psychologist, Zira, sees a spark of intelligence in him. She and her fiancé, Cornelius, take great interest in Taylor, who is unlike any human they have ever seen. Unfortunately Dr. Zaius, the orangutan who oversees Cornelius and Zira's work, has no use for an intelligent human. He wants Taylor disposed of before he causes any trouble. It becomes pretty clear that Zaius knows more about Taylor, and humans, than he's letting on. What is he hiding? The answers will rock Taylor. And the audience.Now this might all sound somewhat silly, like a bad B-movie. That is not the case at all. This is a serious movie, with a serious message. And it's very well done. Charlton Heston, playing Taylor, is the big star and while he may be a little melodramatic and over-the-top at times it is a fine performance. But for the movie to really work it was the performers portraying the apes who really had to do a great job. They had to convince you that these creatures were intelligent and they had to infuse each individual ape with its own unique personality and motivations. The key roles of Zira, Cornelius and Zaius are performed by Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans respectively and they brilliantly bring these apes to life. No easy task showing personality through ape masks but these actors pulled it off, helped no doubt by the fact the ape costumes look so convincing. Truly excellent makeup and prosthetic work was done here. To believe in the movie you had to believe in the apes. You do and that allows the movie's very smart story to truly shine. It's a bit of a slow build but from the moment Taylor utters his famous "stinking paws" line of dialogue the movie picks up steam as it hurtles toward its brilliant, stunning conclusion. A very well thought-out, and very well executed, sci-fi success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of the Apes (1968) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest science fiction masterpieces of all time, superbly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, with an intelligent and thought-provoking script co-written by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling (creator of "The Twilight Zone"). It's the story of a bitter, cynical astronaut named Taylor (Charlton Heston) who despises 20th Century Earth and its people so much that he abandons his planet in a spacecraft with three other crew members (one is a woman who does not survive the flight). The ship enters a time warp and crash lands on a strange planet over two thousand years away from home, which Taylor learns is controlled by intelligent, civilized chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans, while human beings are nothing more than mute and savage beasts. Taylor and his comrades are hunted and captured by the gorillas, and then become separated. Having been shot in his throat during the hunt, Taylor is unable to speak to defend himself as the supreme conservative orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) deems him as a threat to this simian society. Only through the liberal efforts of two pacifist chimps Cornelius and Zira (Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter) can Taylor hope to find his freedom in a world turned upside down, while he is now forced to defend Man as a species.There is so much to recommend about this movie, beginning with Charlton Heston's excellent performance. Kudos must be given to John Chambers' incredible ape makeups, as well as Jerry Goldsmith's other-worldly alien score. All the ape actors are superb in their parts, with Maurice Evans (Zaius), Kim Hunter (Zira), Roddy McDowall (Cornelius), and James Whitmore (as the council leader). The brilliant script works as a sometimes terrifying, occasionally endearing, politically motivated commentary on race relations, yet with the occasional lightness for comedy. PLANET OF THE APES was so successful upon its release that it spawned four sequels, two TV series, at least two reboots, and a legion of Apeaholic young fans like myself, who would go on to collect all sorts of toys, games, bubblegum cards, action figures, magazines, and a plethora of other merchandising -- and all of this well before STAR WARS ever came along. The first sequel released was BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES (1970). **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What will he find out there, doctor?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the greatest sci-fi film? Undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi films of all time, that's for sure. Never since this one, despite its original four sequels, Tim Burton re-make and 2011 re-boot, has the series been this hard hitting. Don't get me wrong; I enjoy all of the Ape films, finding something worthwhile in each one of them (while not denying the absurdity factor that would dampen the series in the 70s), but nothing compares to this one. Let me start by honoring the actors who helped cement the characters in our minds for all time. Charlton Heston as Taylor, wow, how iconic. The character represents the inner nihilism we all feel inside when we stare at the decadence of our society; the urge to feel that there is something better out there, just maybe. Of course this leads to the great irony of the story, all leading up to that unforgettable ending. Roddy McDowall, who played Cornelius (and would go on to play his son Cesar), is just excellent. I'm so glad he returned in the sequels. Who can forget Kim Hunter as Zira? Feisty, strong, intelligent, despite the elaborate prosthetics the character is definitely meant to symbolize the ideal woman in a sense. And Maurice Evans is so great as Dr. Zaius, one of the best villain sin cinema. This is due to the fact that he's indeed a villain, but when you think about it, a necessary villain. And what the hell, Linda Harrison will forever be remembered as Nova.John Chambers make-up effects are quite extraordinary, holding up to this day. The quality of the makeup would deteriorate until finally by 73's "Battle for the Planet of the Apes" most were merely mask. In its prime however, this process was so tedious the golden era actor Edward G. Robinson dropped out of the project early on stating that he was "too old" for the lengthy procedure.And the themes intertwined in the film make this quite enjoyable to watch again and again. Every single one of them is relevant to this day, making it timeless. Just a few would be the fragile relationship between religion and science, the treatment of creatures we do not perceive as sentient, and its best; the self destructive nature of mankind. And despite all its seriousness there's still quite a bit of fun to be had with it, leading to so many iconic lines. There are too many too count in this film, and I'm sure you've heard them before without even knowing it. Last but certainly not least, Jerry Goldsmith's score for the film remains one of the best he's ever done. There are many strange cues, of course accompanying the strange and often daunting images displayed. I'm sure everyone remembers the first time you see those ominous scarecrows. The beauty of the film I always admire is how it builds up quite nicely to the reveal without rushing it. Today's films are so focused on getting to the action they sacrifice atmosphere and characterization. This film to me has set a bar that very few have come close to, delivering both intellect, and suspense as well as awesome visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made in 1968, still amazing to this day, that's what makes a movie a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am newly introduced to the planet of the apes series and I must say that in my opinion this film stands high up as other sci-fi masterpieces like the Original Star Wars Trilogy,the older Star Trek movies, Terminator, Terminator 2, The Thing (1982), The Matrix, Back To The Future and probably The Alien Series (haven't watched those yet) and is one of my favourites as well. To bad that the original gets a lot of praise but the sequels are way underrated and they should deserve little more attention than what they get even if they turned out to be B-movies in the process. Luckily the series has established a cult following and soon when I have watched all of the 'ape-movies' I will surely be one of themBut let's have a look on this one. The script has inspiration from a novel and the dialouge is great and does contain some memorable lines. The Setting is futuristic and post-apocalyptic just like sci-fi fans love. The Actors are all great especially Charlton Heston and Maurice Evans, The character of Taylor is very well portrayed and Dr. Zaíus is awesome as the villain. The Story is brilliant and the ending is simply mind-blowing, sadly I eventually did spoil it for myself but it is powerful. In fact I can't find anything bad about this movie, everything is executed good, so i'm just gonna say that I love it.So if you love sci-fi and haven't seen this one... well what are you waiting for? Pick it up anywhere, watch and enjoy!It is a solid 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PLOT: The year is 1972. Four American astronauts travel to a strange planet where highly intelligent Apes rule the world. The Apes are physically the sizes of various different types of humans, they speak English, and they use horses as means of transportation. As far as their technology goes, they are at least one hundred years behind the times of human beings on Earth in 1972. There are also three different types of Apes on this planet:The Gorillas - They act as the Military, Police, and Manual Laborers.The Chimpanzees - They are the intellectuals. Many of them are scientists.The Orangutans - They are the politicians.Then there are the human beings of the planet - The majority of them are White-skinned, they do not know how to talk, they are unintelligent and primitive savages, and they live in caves and jungles. Many humans are often hunted and killed by the Gorillas, while others are captured by the Gorillas, and are then placed in cages at laboratories and zoos so they can be observed and studied by the Apes.MY THOUGHTS:What I find appealing about this film is that it's a highly entertaining satire of human behavior. This film basically takes many of the evil things we white male human beings have done to animals, and other human beings, and puts us in the opposite position so we can see things from the point of view of all those who my race has repressed. For example, there is a scene when the Gorillas are riding on horses and they chase down a herd of humans with the intention of killing or enslaving them. It's a pretty disturbing scene, and the Ape make-up is amazing. I was highly impressed. I also could not help but think of slavery, and when white men traveled to Africa to enslave the Natives. I am sure from the point of view of Africans being enslaved, it was a very frightening and surreal experience seeing strange White-skinned men invading their homes, putting chains on them, putting them on a giant ship, and taking them to a strange new land. In the scene from "Planet of the Apes" when the Gorillas kidnap the humans, we the audience get to understand 1/10th of the fear the Africans must have felt. The film is full of other political parables that mirror American History. Thus, "Planet of the Apes" is in a sense an American History film, only everything is turned upside down and the roles are all reversed. With the way the Apes hunt and treat the humans like animals, it also reminded me of how some of us in real life treat animals in a degrading way, and will go into their world and hunt them or capture them.WHO I THINK WILL ENJOY THIS FILM: I think the people who are all about "fighting the power" will enjoy it. Plenty of people will also enjoy the political and social commentary of the film. The film also has plenty of Western and Sci-fi themes. I also think some kids and families will enjoy it as well just because of the novelty of talking Apes, and because the film has no profanity or intense action, they will be able to watch it without being offended. Some people who are not familiar with history may miss the political parables, but that won't mean they won't be able to enjoy the film.WHO I THINK WILL NOT ENJOY THIS FILM: Some movie elitists will have trouble taking a film about talking Apes seriously, and may never even give it the time of day. This was a concern of the makers back in the 1960's, and the same concern still sadly applies in the here and now. Some younger people who for some reason have issues with older films and can't stand the idea of watching a film that has no cursing, no intense violence, no modern music, no CGI, and no car chases may also not be interested. FINAL THOUGHTS: What lead me into watching this movie is that I had watched and enjoyed a trailer online for another film - "Rise of the Planet of the Apes". I knew it was rebooting the "Planet of the Apes" series, and I was looking forward to watching the movie, but I also decided that it was time to watch the original "Planet of the Apes" series because I had only heard of them, but had never watched them. So I watched all the "Planet of the Apes" films last summer, knowing nothing about them beforehand. I never saw the previews for them, I never read anything about them, and I never saw the spoofs. (Or if I did, I had forgotten them, or never understood them in the first place.) I thought the original "Planet of the Apes" was amazing. One of the greatest motion pictures ever made and it has become one of my favorite films ever. I enjoyed all the sequels that followed it as well, and I am now a major "Planet of the Apes" fan. I went into the theater watching "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" and was able to catch several of the nods to the older films. I now own all five "Planet of the Apes" movies on blu-ray, the live-action TV series, and the animation show on DVD, and Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes", and "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" on blu-ray, and several "Planet of the Apes" related books, and even a "Planet of the Apes" t-shirt.I hope you will "Go Ape" as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic within- and outside of its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" remains a great and special movie within its genre, that also still remains a perfectly watchable and effective one now days. After almost 50(!) years it hasn't lost any its power and might still very well make a big impact on you, when you go and see it for the fist time.The movie is still original to watch now days, so imaging how things must have been like for viewers back in 1968. It was something unseen, the way the movie approached its genre. Science-fiction at the time hadn't been a very profitable genre but more importantly, it was a genre that wasn't taken very seriously by critics and lots of film-makers. Yet this movie managed to get made, with lots of talents and acclaimed persons involved, in front and behind the cameras.This movie is all the more an accomplishment when you look at it from the perspective and context of its time period. Even though the movie is science-fiction and is definitely filled with lots of fiction, it still is one that puts its emphasis on its science. The movie takes a very reasonable approach to its story, events and characters. Everything gets looked at from different perspectives and asks itself a lot of questions, dealing with topics such as religion and what is it that makes a civilization an advanced and civilized one.But even when you don't read too deep into the movie and its themes, you'll still get plenty of enjoyment out of this movie. Even though it's most definitely not an action filled one, it's still fast paced and makes sure that there is always something happening or progressing within its story. I remember watching this movie ever since I was a young kid, when I probably couldn't even read subtitles yet but I never was bored with it, also not even now that I have seen the movie countless times already and know it by heart.It's a movie that is a quite serious one within its genre when you purely look at its story but luckily they managed to make the movie at the same time a very entertain and enjoyable one to watch. It's because the movie is filled with plenty of great and unforgettable moments and overall is an extremely well made one in every regard.One of the things obviously is its make-up. All of the apes are so fantastical but above all also realistic looking. They have a great look to them and it would had been very easy to mess up. Imaging how much this movie would had been laughed at and not taken seriously if it wasn't for the convincing and Oscar winning make-up effects, by John Chambers.Another thing that always stood out to me was the Jerry Goldsmith musical score. It's unlike anything else really and quite daring for its time as well. It suits the atmosphere and madness of the movie so well and over the years has grown out to be one of his most iconic and appreciated scores.What the movie always did so well to me was creating a sort of atmosphere of madness and absurdity. The main character finds himself in a pretty absurd situation from pretty much the start on already and things soon start to get worse and worse and more unusual for him. Just like the main character, you really want to scream out, when he gets treated incredibly unrighteously and hold prison by the apes. All of these elements get strengthened due to the entire way the movie got shot and told by Franklin J. Schaffner, along with its sets, experimental style of film-making, make-up, music and acting performance by Charlton Heston.Yes, of course I can see how incredibly over-the-top Charlton Heston is going with his performance at times but I actually think this adds to the movie its madness and unusual style and story. I wouldn't want to have it any other way really. Also amazing to see lots of other great actors from the earlier days of cinema behind the ape make-up. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall were pretty big acting names once and this so easily could had been a movie that would had done more harm than good for their careers but needless to say that it all turned out alright. Not that they had big shining careers after this movie but it at least added some wonderful and memorable roles to their resume and legacy as actors.And talking about memorable; it's definitely true that this movie has one of the absolute best surprise endings and shots out of movie history. I'm not going to spoil it for you, some DVD covers are doing that already. But man, I would love to see some of the surprises off people's faces who see it for the first time. It's however hard to imaging though that there are actually still people out there who haven't seen this movie yet.A classic, not just only within its genre and an absolute must-see for everybody.9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see classic sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There can be few people who haven't seen or at least heard about the final iconic scene from this film but I will endeavour not to spoil it despite it appearing on the DVD cover! In the far future a spacecraft arrives on a distant world from Earth; for the crew only eighteen months have passed but for everybody back home thousands of years have passed. The landing does not go according to plan and the find themselves sinking in a lake. Three of the four astronauts have survived but it doesn't look as if they will live long as it appears to be a desert world. They walk from the crash site and eventually find vegetation and soon after that they find what appears to be a race of primitive mute men. These men aren't the most advanced creatures on the planet though; the apes take that position. The apes capture or kill many of the men along with one of the astronauts. The astronaut Taylor was wounded so can't speak initially but the chimpanzee scientists that are studying him soon realise that he isn't like other men. We soon learn that ape culture has its religious beliefs about its origins and the idea that a man might talk is a heresy; as it the idea that a human civilisation might pre-date the apes; scientists Zera and Cornelius believe it to be true however and escape with Taylor to 'The Forbidden Zone' where he makes a shocking discovery.As this film is over forty years old it is little surprise that the special effects have dated; the ape costumes were Oscar in their day but now look rather primitive; this does not distract from the quality of the story however. The way the apes stubbornly cling to the idea that there was no civilisation before theirs and they did not evolve from earlier primates is a clear reference to how some people still refuse to believe in evolution. The acting was pretty solid; Charlton Heston does a fine job as Taylor and Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall do well under their heavy make up as chimpanzees Zera and Cornelius. If you still haven't seen this classic science fiction I recommend that you do so; it is one of those films that everybody should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The irony of that statement of course is that the Ape Civilization Charlton Heston's astronaut encounters is a grotesque parody of human culture, in which humans occupy a level not much above a sewer rat. The irony becomes a double one when we realise that Taylor is someone who dislikes his fellow man, and is forced to become a defender of the species. It's a neat trick and Heston's subtle and dignified acting emphasises the point perfectly.Planet Of The Apes is a movie that makes an interesting contrast to so many of today's empty CGI-bloated "Sci-fi" epics. Firstly it's actually an intelligent movie about where humanity is heading if we don't curb our self-destructive tendencies, secondly it's beautifully shot and expertly directed, the first 30 minutes or so convincingly steering the viewer away from the famous twist-ending.Thirdly the actors deserve enormous praise for bringing off a near-impossible challenge - making us forget they're humans in ape make-up. Kim Hunter is terrific as Zira, as is McDowell as her finance. Maurice Evans' Dr. Zaius is a splendid adversary for Heston.The basic plot concerns a small group of astronauts from our time (that is the late 60s) stranded on an alien planet thousands of years in the future, although thanks to Relativity they have aged only 18 months since blasting off from Earth. They discover here that Apes are the most evolved species, and that humans are mute animals, unthinking and unreasoning. Taylor (Heston) faces a battle for his own survival while trying to make sense of his predicament. His fellow astronauts wind up stuffed in an ape museum and lobotomised.Forget Tim Burton's awful "reimagining" (the Oxford Dictionary should define that word as making a great film into a crap one) and savour this fantastic movie. It may not be as arty as 2001 but it's just as brilliant for my money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apes and Man... Together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his crew go into stasis while their space ship transports them 300 light years from Earth... and they land on a planet that is not very hospitable to mankind.This film is clearly a classic, with several sequels and a remake. Unfortunately, it loses something by the fact it has entered popular culture. Anyone who sees it probably knows the full story before the first frame, which ruins any surprise there may be.The message of the film seems clear, that mankind treats animals poorly. But is that the message? It certainly does not make a pure analogy. Our apes do not speak and such. If the message was one of science and evolution against religion, well, that is another story...The movie gets praise for its costumes, and I agree they are not bad, but they have such terrible mouth movements... I do like Heston talking about the "hot and eager help" they would provide their female companion. (Strangely, the film treats female ape Dr. Zira with respect, but the female humans are seen as little more than breeding tools.) Sadly, Roddy McDowell is hidden under a mask... he recommended to his companions in makeup that they should frequently add tics, blinks and assorted facial gestures to add a sense of realism and keep the makeup from appearing "mask-like". McDowall reportedly became a merry prankster with the makeup, driving home with his make-up on, and shocking some of the other drivers on the freeway. I still would rather have seen his face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and still provocative sci-fi masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think about this day and age if the internet, youtube, etc., I realize how lucky I am to have grown up getting to see movies fresh with no distractions and the element of SURPRISE! I recall first watching this film PLANET OF THE APES (1968) as a kid on TV late one Friday or Saturday night and enjoying it a lot. Yeah, there are a LOT of movies I liked as a kid that I realize aren't so great now, but it's so refreshing to have seen a true classic as a kid, knowing absolutely nothing about it at the time (other than it looked like an interesting sci-fi flick and starred the actor who played Moses!) and later in life seeing it repeatedly and realizing how it still holds up, even more so in this age of awful film experiences! PLANET OF THE APES stars Charlton Heston in one of his most iconic roles as Taylor, an astronaut sent on a space mission in a ship travelling at the speed of light. Along with 3 other astronauts (2 other males, 1 female), their ship crash lands 3000 years in the future on a desolate planet that is run by an advanced civilization of apes. Key figures in the ape colony are scientists Dr. Zaius (a brilliant performance by Maurice Evans) and Zira (wonderfully "humanistic" role by Kim Hunter) and her husband Cornelius (the always entertaining Roddy McDowall). Captured by the apes, Taylor is imprisoned and meets the stunning human beauty Nova (an enchanting Linda Harrison), who along with all other humans on the planet are mute and servile to the apes.The beauty of this film is that it is there is never a dull moment! It moves at a brisk pace, has a focused story, exceptional and confident acting, thought-provoking dialogue that never sounds stale or self-important. I know that Mr. Heston has been accused in his career of "overacting" at times, but IMHO, this is the type of role that fit him like a kid glove! He was born to play action-oriented, leading man roles like this one and he carries the movie wonderfully as all his reactions to his surroundings are spot on. Plus, his weighty stature adds to the powerful ending! Directed by Franklin Schaffner, PLANET OF THE APES is an all time classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Significant and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a keen reader of science fiction in my teens in the 60s, and one book I particularly enjoyed was a novel called Monkey Planet (mistranslated from Planet des Singes) by a French novelist called Pierre Boulle (in my ignorance I didn't realise that he had also written Bridge On The River Kwai). I was mightily pleased when this novel - which ends up with two pretty good twists - was adapted for the cinema.The film makers took a lot of liberties with the novel (including dropping the two closing twists in the novel and adding one of their own) but they succeeded in making it that rarity - a film with something to say which was also eye-catching, action-packed, and thoroughly entertaining.The message about racial intolerance only mildly bludgeons the audience, and this doesn't really matter, so caught up are we in adventure and satire. Heston's gravitas sweeps away any sense of triviality which might otherwise work against the movie, and McDowell, Hunter and Evans all perform well behind the practical difficulties of the ape makeup. Only Linda Harrison, in the thankless role of Nova, is less than brilliant, but at least she is decorative.Hindsight shows that the ape makeup is, perhaps, not entirely deserving of the Oscar it won (the ape makeup in Kubrick's 2001 in the same year was far superior) but, apart from that, this movie succeeds on every level and keeps you glued to the screen from Taylor's opening log entry as the spaceship approaches the planet, to the final, brilliantly executed twist. The shock of this on first seeing it cannot be overestimated and even now, after multiple viewings, it is still riveting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four astronauts are sent on a mission through hyperspace and are due to rendezvous back with Earth hundreds of years after they left. But something goes wrong and they crash-land on a mysterious planet with no idea where or when they are. Things get worse still when they are captured by strange bipedal talking ape-like creatures who seem to be the dominant race. Can Taylor, the lead astronaut, escape from this madness ?This science-fiction classic is one of the most thought-provoking films of the sixties, as well as being an exciting and gripping adventure story. It manages that rare trick of being great escapist entertainment but also postulating about so many interesting ideas - racism, evolution, theology, apocalypse, to name but a few. It's adapted from a clever book by French author Pierre Boulle, but was originally scripted by Rod Serling, in my view perhaps the greatest screenwriter of his generation, and I think it's from him that the intelligence, humanity, imagination and bitter irony which make it such a rich movie come from. The beach scene ending is of course hugely famous, and its impact is as profound as ever, but the speech Dr Zaius precedes it with sums up all of mankind's worst attributes neatly and is in its own way just as memorable. Special mention must also go to John Chambers' outstanding makeup work in bringing the simian characters to life - the ape masks and design set a new benchmark for movie effects and they are so good that within two scenes we forget what we are watching and start responding to Dr Zira as a character, not a creature. If at all possible, try to see this in widescreen, as the Panavision photography by Leon Shamray is outstanding throughout; the Lake Powell Utah desert vistas are stunning, and the shot compositions - such as the amusing see-no-evil-hear-no-evil-speak-no-evil tableau at the hearing - are terrific. There is also a scary blaring score by Jerry Goldsmith, which adds immeasurably to the tension. A huge hit, both critically and commercially, this film was followed by four sequels, a TV show, a cartoon and a perhaps ill-advised remake by Tim Burton in 2001 with a resolution so inscrutable I don't think anyone understands it. I've always thought Charlton Heston should have got a special award for keeping sci-fi movies alive in the doldrums - he followed this with two other great flicks - The Omega Man and Soylent Green. This one is the best of the three though, and a top-notch thinking-man's action picture from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ageless classic. Yet, Boulle's novel wasn't about nuclear war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of the lucky ones to have seen POA at the time of its release and I still recall the stunned silence in the crowd when the lights came back. Everyone standing open mouthed, incapable of leaving their seats. The most shocking ending in movie History, closing up a tale of space travel gone terribly wrong. Wow. Superb scenery, weirdly amazing soundtrack, out of this world acting?despite all the latex involved. But the stroke of genius was Heston's casting as the man who hates mankind and leaves for another planet only to find it there reduced to vermin and treated as such by a species that to him is clearly inferior, but which got the upper hand. It's worth recalling that Heston's screen persona represented then what many people abroad had come to hate about the U.S., something that Vietnam was greatly accentuating: he embodied the stereotypical arrogant, pushy Yankee. And when everyone was getting used to see in the news images of little Viets taking at gunpoint tall, blond, yanks to the POW camp, what was happening to him in the screen was mirroring such scenes. As if he had taken the role just to express a new, uncomfortable feeling sweeping the land: that of a giant of a nation profoundly wounded in its pride. That's the main reason why POA could only have been made at that time, but not the only one.By the late 60s U.S. society was struggling not only with the threat of nuclear war because of the Cold War but also with civil rights, hippies, a generational schism, a race to the moon and so on, all topics touched one way or another in the film. Yet such issues were far away from Boulle's mind when he wrote this story. He wasn't even thinking about nuclear war. He was rather interested then in the decadence of civilizations, specially that of our Western World. Doubtful as it seems, this appears clear if we recall a crucial event in his life that no reviewer has mentioned yet: he was a (Japanese) POW during WWII. It's from this experience that he drew the inspiration for both POA and Bridge Over River Kwai. Without knowing this POA would appear as a purely philosophical exercise delving on abstract ideas unrelated to the author's own experience. But there's also a crucial difference eve between both: BORK deals with his here and now as POW leaving the philosophical question to the personal struggles of each individual between fulfillment of duty and satisfaction of egoistic desires. POA instead embodies the projection of all this to a more general, even cosmic, dimension; an extrapolation of his then situation to what could be a world order where an enemy looked at as inferior has become the master (remember: for months after Pearl Harbor Japan looked like the winner and that impression could have lasted a bit longer for Boulle).I said Cosmic, why. Let's recap the tale. A couple of space voyagers--Jim and Phyllis?find a bottle with a manuscript inside floating in space. In it the writer, a Merou from Earth, tells of his trip to a planet near Betelgeuse, which he finds inhabited by civilized apes and savage humans. Humans are treated like vermin by the apes and so it happens to him. He's finally able to escape, with the help of friendly chimps Zira and Cornelius, and heads back to Earth. As he lands at a Paris airport a lone, decorated, official comes to greet him: he's a gorilla. Moreu is barely able to escape again. The diary ends there, with his plead for help. At this point Jim and Phyllis both agree: the manuscript got to be a joke. Humans don't have soul or intellect. So, Jim and Phyllis are apes too. It seems the whole Cosmos is going ape.In an odd way the book is more relevant today than the movie ever was. At a lab experiment in which the apes put electroshocks to a woman's brain, shortly before Merou escapes, the truth comes out as she starts blurting out ancestral memories: Man dominated the planet long ago, but his demise didn't come about through nuclear war. Instead, humans got dumber and lazy. They stopped reading, thinking, while the apes got smarter and pushier. Finally they took over. So, in POA Boulle wasn't talking about nuclear war, he was talking of Western decadence.I watched again POA last night and I noticed that it hasn't lost a bit of its edge in 42 years. And even if some of its issues are dated, it still it packs a whale of a punch. I say 10 out of 10. And I don't get all the fuss about English speaking apes. Hadn't they spoken it, Chuck would have spent the entire movie in Ape 101. Got it? That's Artistic License.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It gets better and better with the time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" is a great sci-fi film about the perdition of mankind and humans in a society ruled by thinking apes. Human race is obsolete, useless and so weak that now they're dominated by apes who talk like us, fight like us and think like us (or perhaps better if you consider that they're much better than what's left of human).In a distant future Charlton Heston plays the astronaut Taylor and after a failure on his ship he and crew mates end up in a strange place very similar with Earth. While trying to find a way out of this desert and lonely place they discover a few bunch of people who are treated badly by strange figures (the apes) who dominates everything there and they're transformed into slaves. Taylor is able to show some notable abilities that surprises this apes society since humans in this time no longer can speak and he can. Scientists Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter) are the noble creatures that are stunned with this revelation and they're develop with Taylor a relationship based on knowledge trades, with Taylor telling things about his distant planet and the importance of humans. But things are not so easy and Taylor has to fight with the other monkey authorities (they don't believe in Taylor and they want to kill this "slave" of inferior race). Will Taylor find out what's happening? Will Cornelius and Zira trust this man who they thought was inferior to them? Very intriguing!This film was a great hit in the year of its release and it was a very significant and thoughtful work, but it is even more relevant to watch it now. The idea over the evolution of mankind and how many great things were created and achieved but even so people didn't become more humanized or more positive, and this distance was growing bigger between them, everything was so critical and I think the writers of this movie thought that in the future things could become more frightening and desperate for the human race. And if you remember this was released in the same year of "2001: A Space Odyssey" which means that people back then really thought that the future would be marvelous for the evolution of things but not so much interesting in terms of people's evolution. And what's more interesting of both movies is the fact that they've used in their stories the ape figure, the primal force of the evolution of man, the creature that started all for us and in both movies they're intelligent creatures and their actions always resembles our own actions. With that in mind it only proves the theory of Evolution and people have to accept that bipedal mankind started with monkeys. The last quote of the very last scene is one of the most powerful ever delivered by a character in a sci-fi movie. A warning sign for all generations to take care of our planet and take care of ourselves because evolution can walk backwards. The movie is very good, but if wasn't for too many speeches and theories about humans and the trial and escapes of the hero it would be more fun to watch, especially for the younger generations (since this movie doesn't have too much action and people nowadays demands for action all the time). All the performances are good and the fantastic makeup effects on the actors playing the apes really worked well here. A very good movie that really gets better and better with the time. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the first of a long series of films. At first you think you are in some kind of Star Trek series with a little bit less gadgetry, or maybe a new Space Odyssey. Then you think you have been thrown into a remake of George Pal's Time Machine, adapted from H.G. Wells. But you realize very fast it is quite another story. Instead of implementing Darwinism within a Marxist vision of industrial society, here the very Darwinian evolution that man produced man as superior to apes, we have exactly the world upside down and apes are superior to man. It is an inverted story of human fundamentalist Christianity or any fundamentalist religious belief in the hands and heads of an ape rather medieval society. Some humans arrive in a very long distance NASA flight and they are at first confronted to a wild human species and then hunted down by an ape superior species. That's the beginning. Of course the parallel with H.G. Wells stops here and we shift to another story. The aim is to reveal the absurdity of a fundamentalist belief that one species was created by God to dominate the world and another to be the Devil's spies and pawns. It is not racism since the apes and the humans are not members of the same species. It is what we humans practice everyday on earth, the absolute domination of all that nature contains. What is surprising is that these apes hunt humans, capture them, kill them but do not eat them. In H.G. Wells the Morlocks hunted the Elois in order to eat them as meat, proteins. The next surprising thing is that this dependence, inferiority has erased the capacity to speak in the humans whereas their superiority has granted the apes the power to speak and write. That is surprising since humans do have the physical ability but they lost the know-how. The film is surprising in its ending because it is the triumph of force over reason. The last surviving Earth man and his human female wild acolyte escape enslavement by using force, and the chief scientist and chief religious authority escape truth by using force. The end is all the more surprising when the Statue of Liberty jumps up out of nowhere on this extremely distant planet. Fascinating anachronism. I think they call that, in the intellectual critical milieu, a "mise en abime". Of course we know it is the door to the sequel, but even so it is slightly moving to see her in there. Quite out of her normal environment. Maybe some myth is attached to this lady, so strong that on September 11 they attacked the Twin Towers instead of the Statue of Liberty. Surprising indeed what force a mythical being can take in human minds.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

It is very well written and well acted film. It also contains a plot-twist that I consider to be one of the best of all time. The makeup is fantastic. The best thing about the film by far is the irony of it all. Not only do apes treat people like apes, but they also have a religion that is like Christianity where they believe that their ape god put them on the planet first then populated it with all other animals much like Christianity's Adam and Eve. The irony in the film is so ironic that it makes this film a classic.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking Darwin's Theory of Evolution and turning it on its head, this classic slice of 60s sci-fi is visually impressive, thoroughly exciting, and most importantly, extremely thought provoking: not only does it poke fun at organised religion's refusal to accept the whole evolutionary process, but it is also a savage indictment of humanity as a whole, quite correctly identifying us as a violent race destined to destroy ourselves.Charlton Heston stars as US astronaut Taylor, who along with two fellow spacemen, awakens from suspended animation to discover that not only have they overslept a tad (by a couple of thousand years) but have also crash landed on a strange planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are their slaves.Although Heston is undeniably superb in his role as the dumbstruck Taylor struggling to cope with life as an ape's plaything, it is those who play the lead simians that deserve the highest praise of all, acting convincingly beneath John Chambers' impressive iconic monkey make-up. Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter are excellent as Cornelius and Zira, the likable chimpanzee scientists who believe Taylor's story and try to help him escape to freedom, but my favourite character has got to be Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), the orangutan who hides the truth behind his species' rise to power, tries to have our hero castrated, lobotomises his friend, and accuses Cornelius and Zira of heresy, albeit all for the good of his own race. What a delightfully devious yet strangely admirable man err, I mean ape.It's now been over 40 years since Planet of the Apes was originally released, but it has stood the test of time well, remaining the best of the long running ape series (and infinitely better than Tim Burton's abysmal remake/reimagining) and well deserving of its high praise and 'classic' status (the ending alone is worthy of this accolade: it's one of the finest twists in the history of cinema).</fullReview>

This movie has great twist and excellent moments that i consider a classic and the intro music really settled me in and brought out the real feel of the movie.Don't bother with the remake.

		<shortDescription>Much Better than the Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story of a group of 20th century astronauts that are sent far into the future where they crash land on a planet ruled by intelligent apes, and where humans are little more than animals.The film effectively touches on a number of themes that were very topical in the 1960's such as race and equality and it also addresses the arms race.One of the most impressive aspects of the film is the apes for whom cutting edge prosthetic makeup was designed. Even now this makeup looks effective and considering that this film was made almost 40 years ago this was a very impressive step forward in that field. The makeup artist for the film was given an honorary Oscar for his achievements here as the Academy did not have a makeup award at the time.Taylor (Charlton Heston) the lead astronaut of the story is the protagonist and while Heston can be somewhat limited in his range he is for the most part quite effective. More impressive though are Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans as the three lead apes. These three give very effective performances despite the limitations of considerable prosthetic makeup.The film was well directed by Franklin J Schaffner (Papillon, Patton) and based on the novel by Pierre Boule (Bridge on the River Kwai). The somewhat experimental score by Jerry Goldsmith was also quite good and is very evocative.The success of the film would spawn a slew of increasingly inferior sequels (see the other disc's in this set) and eventually a TV series. More recently the film has been remade by Tim Burton. While the remake definitely had the edge on production values the story wasn't as strong and it didn't come close to living up to the ending of the original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who could imagine that this planet could be run by primates instead of man? "Planet of the Apes" sure can answer that question well. You got in orbit, can a few years later you come back to Earth. Or do you? Three astronauts land back on Earth only to find out that man are the lowest forms of life, and the Apes(Chimpanzees, Orangutans, gorillas, etc.) are the majority of the population. George Taylor(Charton Heston, 1923-2008), and his crew have their clothes stolen and are captured by these apes. Taylor is shot in the neck and is unable to prove himself that he's not one of them primal humans. Only a duo of chimps: Zira and Cornelius are more curious about Taylor than any of the other apes around. The part I didn't like is where Taylor got hosed by one of the apes and when he tried to speak the ape said, "SHUT UP, YOU FREAK!" It is slightly funny, but in reality it's not. It was just a scene, nothing to get all hot about. I enjoyed it very much, at least we don't go round calling each other banana breath! HAHAHAHAHA!!

		<fullReview>This was a groundbreaking movie in its day. I have 3 impressions of it. The first is from when I first saw it as a child in the 60's. It terrified me - I had nightmares for weeks. Then I saw it again as a teenager in the mid to late 70's and I thought it was extremely "cheesy".I have since recently seen it again as an adult. It is amazing the different view the movie has for me now. It is quite a well made movie. But the philosophies and ideologies are little disturbing. The question is if it's meant to be taken seriously, or if they are just making lighthearted fun of the human race.One theme presented is reverse evolution - the idea that apes evolved from man, to which Heston famously replies "I am NOT the missing link!". There is also the portrayal of the apes of faith being zealot idiots, afraid to even consider ideas that don't fit their mold or "ancient scrolls".I think the acting is some of the best I have ever seen in a sci-fi. The actors in ape make-up (McDowall and Hunter)did a great job with their facial expressions - which must have been very difficult in their masks.The cinematography did a great job in depicting a bleak and harsh world. The use of odd angles and hand-held cameras added to the effect of this harsh world.I do think it is a scathing look at the worst traits of mankind - racism, prejudice, religious hypocrisy. While still a classic movie, I think it is a product of the social commentary prevalent in the 60's.</fullReview>

The end of the movie is a classic Twilight Zone End. Serling loved to use irony in his stories. The music in the movie is also excellent as it was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. My favorite scenes are at the beginning when the astronauts land in the lake in the barren desert and don't yet realize what planet they are on. This movie was filmed on the Fox back lot in the L.A. area...there was a great documentary on the making of this series that came out in 1998 for the 30th anniversary.

		<shortDescription>One of My Favorite Sci-Fi Films ever ! ! !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the film ! I love C. Heston's role ! I also loved the music from Jerry Goldsmith, which won an Oscar.But here's the thing.... when I was watching 1954's "The Silver Chalice", I kept thinking of how Franz Waxman's music could so easily change into some Planet of the Apes music, especially int he desert scenes. So, I'm not as impressed with Jerry Goldsmith's "originality" in the overall scoring of Planet of the Apes... Oscar, or not. Pure coincidence perhaps, but, it's fair to assume that Jerry saw "The Silver Chalice". However, I still love Jerry....and Planet of the Apes !!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IMHO, the best movie ever made. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really see the point in adding the "spoiler" warning, as this movie is nearly 40 years old and I find it hard to believe that anyone hasn't seen it. But in the interests of harmony, I'll play by the rules :-)I think I first saw this movie when I was just four or five, and have watched it many times since. It's quite simply the most exquisite piece of cinema ever created... and that's just based on the final scene. I can take or leave the rest, although of course the plot development is vital to the final scene, but Mr Heston's disbelief and rage at what had become of the Earth he knew is the most powerful thing I've ever seen.And being a huge Simpsons fan, I also quite like the two references they made to this epic: Troy McClure starring in the hilarious musical version of Planet of the Apes and the "Dr Zaius" song to the tune of "Amadeus" by Falco, and Homer's "damn you all to hell!" in another episode.The only downside for me is that it completely ruined Roddy McDowell for me... I could never watch him in anything else without picturing him in the superb award-winning simian makeup and twitching his nose!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeful Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this entire movie for the first time. It's an all-time classic. I believe it explores in detail the debate between God and evolution, but from a different point of view... what if God created apes to be superior to man or did apes evolve from man? I can see Rod Serling's technique by twisting reality, like he does in "The Twilight Zone". As a scientist and atheist, I do believe in evolution and can respect the moral of this story. However, I do not believe that man can evolve back into apes, but instead into a more intelligent and profound species. This brings me to my next point. As I am a true fan of time travel, I noticed that this film had a hint of "The Time Machine" where the future has two species. The jungle humans are like the Eloi and the apes are like the Morlocks, both having the same characteristics. Over the years in both of these films, man has evolved into two separate species. I do not believe this will happen, but more separate races, as we already have many. Overall, this movie was excellent.RJ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow. this really is an amazing movie, though the ending seems like too much of a morality play ending that happened to be stuck on. other than that i have to say that it was amazingly written and directed. though you can tell the cinematography is from the 60s/70s period, it doesn't detract from the film at all. Charleton Heston is the ultimate action hero, and he very boldly delivers some of the most famous lines in history. if nothing else, see this movie for it's cultural influence. what i loved most about it though, was the moral and ethical questions it posed about dominance in whatever we consider to be modern society. sheer brilliance on many levels. please DO see this film, it will make you think about your place in the universe as a human and what the significance of your life is, and what kind of legacy humans leave behind them. this is a real movie, you don't see those much anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film in my opinion, great effects and great story line even tho the film is from the late 1960's. I like the cast especially Taylor and the special relationship he has with Dr's Zira and Cornelius.There are a few good lines from Charlton Heston. The most catching line is when he's captured by the apes after escaping the prison and he quotes " Take your stinking paws off me ... you damn dirty ape". And when he's about to leave with nova before finding his destiny, he wants to give Zira a goodbye kiss and she says " alright but your soooo damn ugly". I have to agree with other users that it has one of the best endings ever, and i wasn't expecting it to what it was supposed to be.Wasn't keen on the re-make just didn't make any sense and was a load of rubbish!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, less is more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something very special about this movie. I watched it many years ago, and I though that it was a wonderful experience in imagination, a science fiction masterpiece. It was before "Jurassic Park" and "Lord of the Rings". Then, some months ago, I watched it again and had the same feelings. It's like if the movie itself ? it's storyline, production values and characters ? was in a time capsule, save from the present, protected against imitations and spoofs like the new "Planet of the Apes" (2001) or The Simpson's "Stop the Planet of the Apes!". What is the source of its power? The answer, I think, is the absence of special effects and the "realism" of the story. We have a travel to the future, some apocalyptic sets and talking chimps - so, we don't need laser guns or apes jumping like Keanu Reeves in "Matrix". The upside-down world visited by Charlton Heston is absurd enough, and CGI effects (if they were available in 1968) would be too much. It's a science fiction oriented for the adult audiences, what explains the sober tone of the acting and the film-making. The script also delivers a powerful story and an eerie climax, in the school of H. G. Wells and Philip K. Dick novels ? and the simian establishment, with it's medieval mentality and cold rationalism, represents a real threat to the astronaut/hero Colonel Taylor (a sense of danger totally missed on Tim Burton's remake). In the conclusion of the film, there's no ape army fighting human warriors ? but a lonely man discovering the ultimate true about our destiny, the fate of our species. Even in these days, when the nuclear nightmare is under control, it's a blasting, impressive view of the future. In movies like "Planet of the Apes", the visual aspects are always relevant. POTA was certainly ahead of its time: the tools used on the film works SO WELL (the ape makeup is still very impressive, along with the sets and costumes) that is easy to buy its premise. The monkeys are very real in their leather clothes, and one can imagine that, if the evolution had been reverse, they would look like that. It's an amazing exercise in imagination. After all this years, with it's subtle sense of wonder and intriguing premise, "Planet of the Apes" remains an amazing movie. The new science fiction and horror flicks could learn from it's legacy: sometimes, less is more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why did they remake it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1968 classic is still a must see for everyone. It has Charleton heston (forget his politics for a while, he can act) giving one of his best performances ever (he says more than just "let my people go for six hours). It also has a strong cast playing the apes. The ending was in 1968 and still is today relevant and thought provoking. It makes me wonder why they polluted the big screen with an unnecessary remake with an ending, while closer to the ending of the book, misses the point the book was making and was thus pointless. If you've only seen the new one (or the 4 worthless sequels to the original) you've missed the only thing in this series worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie Ending Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I defy any serious movie fan to not admit that the ending of the film is the coolest final scene of any movie ever made. It was another example of the genius mind of Mr. Rod Serling (creator of the greatest television series ever, "The Twilight Zone"). The final shot of Lady Liberty on the beach is a final scene with no equal. I am a big fan of the Apes series (I often have the urge to view all five films in a row, and "Go Ape"!). I think all five films are cool and it's fun to watch them in order of the story (if I have this correct) with the third film being the first (Escape From) and then the fourth (Conquest of) and then the fifth (Battle For) and then finally the first two (Planet and Beneath The). I don't mean to confuse anybody but all true Ape fans know that the story was different than the order of how they were released. I suggest everybody who enjoys classic science fiction buy "The Planet of the Apes Collection" on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a splendid movie. Like other great horror-fantasy films (Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) it explores the relationship between humans and non-human beings. In "Planet of the Apes" there are only three animals: man, ape and horse and they play out their drama in this futuristic desert land. Unlike so many bad fantasy films, this one has a highly authentic aura around it. It is so utterly convincing like a story by H.P.Lovecraft or like one of your own nightmares and dreams. So strange, so fantastic! The words "The Forbidden Zone", I will never forget. The ending, of course, is so wonderfully eerie and shocking, one just gets goosebumps for hours. A child will never forget the experience of seeing this movie and she/he will learn so much about human relations with non-humans by witnessing this movie which explores the ethical theme with style and power. Such an utterly convincing fantasy film with a message of dream-like proportions are yet to be done better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it a Sci Fi film? I am not sure it is. To me this is a very serious drama where many important issues of our origin are discussed. Let's try to remember Inquisition imposed by Catholic church during the Medieval era, and you will see that Apes in their planet did the same with the humans and with their scientists. Cornelius was a kind of Galileo Galilei, anything he supposed or found was rejected by the council. Funny to see how the roles are changed here, i.e. the Apes judging the humans and denying the theory of evolution, refusing that the planet is round, not letting the people to visit the forbidden area. The end showed something tragic. At this point, the astronaut George Taylor felt helpless and sad to know that his civilization does not exist anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy sci-fi classic that looks like genius next to Burton's version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes this weekend and was thoroughly disappointed so I had to go out and rewatch the original to compare the two. While the 1968 Planet of the Apes has its flaws, it is simply a far superior film to Burton's. (This is sad too because I feel there was so much that Burton could have improved upon in this film, which he didn't.) Although the 1968 version looks somewhat dated and silly in retrospect, it also comes across as more powerful and poignant, somehow effectively bridging the line between utter cheesiness and utter eerieness. How does it do this? First, there's the great atonal symphonic soundtrack. This soundtrack is used effectively throughout the film to build tension and suspense in almost every scene. Next, there is the awkward, but somehow effective camera technique of zooming from a distant shot to close-up shot in certain dramatic moments during the Planet of the Apes. Examples of this include the final scene where Taylor finally meets his "destiny", the famous "Get your hands off me you damn dirty ape!" line, and the first space scene where the three spacemen make a horrifying discovery about their female crew member. Like much of the film, I find this zoom lens technique brings out both the eerieness and the cheesiness of the film. Also, the pacing and revealing of information in the 1968 Planet of the Apes is much more subtle and "real feeling." Though the film is short, there is at least some sense of getting to know everyone and the construction of the "ape world" gradually. Burton's version comes across more like a rushed Cliff Notes summary. Next, there is arch-conservative he-man Charleton Heston's portrayal of Taylor. Though annoying, incredibly silly, and sexist in his character, Heston's Taylor somehow seems perfect for this film. He bridges the cheese-serious gap completely with his absurdly cocky sililoquies. Example: While looking at she-woman object Nova: "Yes, there were lots of women and love-making on earth, but not lots of love. I wonder if you love me...." You've also got Kim Hunter's Zira and Roddy McDowall's Cornelius, which, while not genius have more personality and character development than most of Burton's faceless apes. In addition to all of this, the evolution versus religion theme is brought out much more ironically and powerfully in the 1968 Planet of the Apes. Somehow, even watching this film in 2001, I felt questions arising to my mind as I watched this such as, "Wow, there really are a lot of people who accept religious dogma out of fear of change" and "What was prehistory really like?" I did not have these questions arise inside of me while watching Burton's film, though it was supposed to be treading the same thematic territory. And perhaps all of this had something to do with the temper of the times in the United States. 1968 was definitely a year for questioning "traditional values" in American culture. Perhaps it was simply easier to make a more believable Planet of the Apes at that time.</fullReview>

And the apes seem too primitive to have rifles, that is a product of an industrialized civilization. And the woman, she has perfectly shampooed hair, make-up, no hair on her body.. and of course they chose an actress for the role who was Miss Berlin and a model :) Add some racist undertones to it, and it's just too stupid.

Even the landmark film "2001" suffers a bit from it.This film grabs you from the first minute and doesn't let go.There's a creepy tone to the films first half-hour, only bolstered by some fantastic sound editing and music.This is a non-stop adventure. Uber-fast-paced. At the end, we wish the film would just keep going.The make-up work is fantastic, and it's not just the apes. Blood that actually looks like blood(novel idea)etc.The acting is strong across the board, and it's amazing how expressive the ape faces can be.The concept isn't rocket science(pun intended), but it's still intriguing. One of the best moments of the film is when Heston falls to his knees at the end, "you finally did it!".The series would never be as good again, but I can't remember a more anticipated sequel. This original has teeth, and should go down as one of the top 6 or 7 sci-fi films ever made.This film shouldn't be this good. Somehow it's not big in scale in terms of cast etc(you know not epic like "The Ten Commandments"), but it IS certainly grand in it's own way. 92/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always found it easier to write about the junky, cheesy movies I watch than it is to write about why a certain movie works flawlessly with me. I find that I enjoy my favorite movies for personal reasons that are difficult to put into words. For me, Planet of the Apes is one of those flawless movies. Everything works perfectly ? the plot, the acting, the special effects, the locations, and the action. Charlton Heston is an actor who could chew the scenery with the best of Hollywood. But in Planet of the Apes, it works for me because for long stretches of the movie, he's the only human with a line of dialogue. The movie might have become dull with an actor with less of a screen presence. The ape makeup is fantastic. Like a lot of fans of the movie, I went to see Tim Burton's re-imaging. And while the apes may have looked more ape-like, I'll take Roddy McDowell in a latex mask any day. The music is otherworldly brilliant and fits every scene. Oh, I could go on and on for pages, but I'll stop here. As I said, it's difficult for me to explain why I enjoy Planet of the Apes so much, I just know that I wouldn't change a thing.There are certain images and moments in Planet of the Apes that will always stick with me. I look forward to revisiting them each time I get the chance to re-watch the movie. The final scene is iconic and needs no further explanation. Other favorite bits from the movie include: the "hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" courtroom scene, Heston trapped in the net, and Heston's goodbye kiss with Zira. But one of my favorite moments is the first images of the gorillas on horseback. Heston and a few other humans are in the cornfields, crouching low. A horse and rider gallop past and make a quick turn. The rider's face comes into frame and we see not a man, but an ape. It's an amazing moment in cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far ahead of its time as a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1968, I was just married and in my second year of post-graduate studies. "Planet of The Apes", a movie with a silly title and much substance hit the theaters. A remake of the same title some 30 plus years later is inferior in every way. This original does not rely on special effects, just a good story and good execution. Human Earthling space travelers crash land in this mysterious place where apes are the higher intelligence, and what we might call 'humans' are hunted and trapped, and treated like any other wild animal. What a development! One of the better science fiction movies ever made.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Charlton Heston is the captain, George Taylor. Injured and unable to speak at first, he is captured and caged. The ape scientists, including Roddy McDowall as Cornelius, study him curiously, and begin to notice what appears to be intelligence. Eventually George begins to speak, and coincidentally it is the same language, English, that the apes speak. Is this sheer coincidence? The authorities naturally suppress any notion that these mere humans could be anything but dumb animals, but an alliance develops which eventually allows George and some other humans to escape.MOST MAJOR SPOILER -- As they walk along the beach, and try to figure out their next step, we see George flabbergasted by what he sees, and shouts, "What have they done?" Then we see half of the Statue of Liberty near the water, with no city in sight. His only conclusion, and ours, he had somehow traveled far into the future, there had been a world-scale war that destroyed everything, and continued evolution had given the advantage to the apes. Perhaps this was in spirit the sequel to "Dr. Strangelove."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allegory that's profound, if a bit silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING: reveals `shocker' ending)This isn't just some cheesy sci-fi flick. It actually has a thought provoking message, even if it is a bit silly in delivering it; for one, how and why would apes evolve from humans, specifically into more erect versions of orangutans, chimps and gorillas? But more on that later.One thing that impressed me about this film is the make-up. The meticulous application of latex masks and affecting performances by Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans and others really went a long way into making the apes seems life-like. Except for one shot where Cornelius had two sets of lower teeth, the illusion was fairly solid. Another impressive thing, visually, was the make-up.One thing that I must question, though, is the idea of the `shocker' ending. One of the reviews found under the ?external reviews' section of this site asserts that the film `ends with a shocking revelation about the planet's origins that no one could possibly have guessed'. I really have to contest that. I admit, I knew the shocker ending before having even seen the film (yesterday), but I think there were clues that should have tipped off anyone. First, the planet had humans, horses and apes, which are called orangs, chimps and gorillas. English words. The apes speak English. That should be enough of a clue for anyone, especially Taylor, unless convergent evolution (of both organisms and language) is a common occurrence across planet's in Taylor's society.. I guess since this film is more allegorical and philosophical than scientific (it actually brings to mind Gulliver's Travels), we're not expected to pay much attention to that. I'm simply saying that the ending isn't as shocking as it's made out to be.And as allegorical as this film is, I think the theory that apes - specific species of apes, no less - would evolve from humans is laughable and sort of undermines the film; also the idea that humans would forget how to talk or make any kind of vocalization.Still, the film works and those flaws I mentioned give the film a surreal, almost creepy feel, which is effective, in its way. And while I still think the ending wasn't or shouldn't have been that shocking, the shot that revealed it was still masterfully done.</fullReview>

And what makes this movie such an enduring flick, apart from the larger than life alpha-male screen presence of Charlton Heston, is that it's about what science fiction does best: examine real-life issues (race, class) by flinging them into the far reaches of time and outer space. It's everything that was great about THE TWILIGHT ZONE writ large, and will continue to resonate for some time. There's also spectacular makeup effects, the searing cavewoman hotness of Linda Harrison (mmm, Nova), and some gorgeous widescreen canyon vistas.

		<fullReview>I decided to watch the original Planet Of The Apes because I recently watched the recent movie Dawn Of The Planet of The Apes, which was a very good movie, at least in my opinion - And If you're like me and saw the new ones before the old ones then while this is a good movie and not necessarily the cheesy sci-fi you may have come to expect but I still may need to explain some things to set up expectations.Astronauts go out on an expedition where it would take nearly a millennium to reach alone, to stop the one fatal flaw of "They'd die before they'd get there" they go into sleeper pods much like the ones from Alien and crash land into an unknown planet where evolution is reversed. Apes now are just as intelligent as the humans are and the humans act almost like apes. Only one of the astronauts manages to survive without being lobotomized or killed and the fact that he can talk is controversial because some are claiming it's evolution, which does not comply with the Ape religion.Basically the best way to see this is if you were aware of what went on at the time with the theories of evolution, which a few were beginning to believe was controversial with the Christian faiths at the time (and in some places it still is) and the threat at the time of nuclear war even plays a part in this movie. In what way, I won't tell you. So I think if you look at the movie that way, in the same way District 9 paralleled the Apartheid system then the movie would be that much more interesting to see in that way.Onto my opinion the effects for 1968 are amazing. Usually with a movie like this you may think the apes would look dated but it holds up really well. I also like the cinematography, the acting is alright, I guess and as cheesy as the idea may seem - it actually is pulled off in such a way that is entertaining and in such a way that it can be taken seriously.But this movie is not without flaws. The point where this movie completely loses me is the ending. It isn't Monster A-Go Go bad or anything ruining the whole movie, it's how the ending is linked to the fears of nuclear war I told you about earlier. Wouldn't it be a little more likely that in the condition it was in it was natural decay instead of nuclear war. Either way I maybe spoiling the ending and I don't really want to do that but it just bugs me.Another thing is the sheer pointlessness of one of the characters. One of the astronauts along with the other three just dies when they get to the planet while they were in the deep sleep. Why? What was the point of having her where the film starts to then basically say "Here, you got a paycheck for lying down." I also think as a side-note - I really don't like the musical score.So aside from some of my nitpicking this movie is an enjoyable watch. I also think I should watch the sequels in time but as far as sci-fi movies go the best way I'd describe it is imagine what would happen if they took an episode of The Twilight Zone and made it an hour and a half movie. I'd say if you have an open mind then check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometime in the future, four astronauts from Earth are journeying out of our solar system, to hopefully arrive somewhere habitable (thought to be 300-320 light years from home). Travelling in suspended animation and at or near the speed of light, the crew ages only 18 months in 2,000 years. After crash-landing on a strange planet, the men sadly discover their one female crew-member has expired. Slightly space-crazed leader Charlton Heston (as George Taylor) laments this means missed opportunities for copulation. A crew of two women and two men might have been a better plan. The landing site does not show any obvious signs of life; but, water and the elements suggest life is present. After a hike, Mr. Heston and the men discover they've landed on "Planet of the Apes"...This marvelous science-fiction story started a monkey money-making franchise. In hindsight, there are some obvious ways to improve the narrative. They should have created an Ape language and used dubbing, for example. It's more believable to consider Heston as smart enough to pick up foreign languages easily; probably, that would have been stipulated in astronauts for this trip. We're also dumbfounded by Heston's inability to show he's fairly intelligent, during his initial captivity. Still, this story is imaginative and thought-provoking. The common reading is that we are to derive some racial parallels to present-day (or, 1968) civilization. Since both astronauts and simians range from blond to black, the racial comparisons are subjugated to deeper comparisons and considerations...John Chambers deservedly won an "Academy Award" for his simian make-up design. The "missing link" in Chambers' monkey make-up was previewed a week before "Planet of the Apes" premiered, in a "Lost in Space" TV episode. Therein, Dr. Smith and Don West are sent to a prison planet and meet Michael Conrad (as Creech). He looks like a "Planet of the Apes" refugee because the Irwin Allen-produced TV show swiped the facial applications. And, if the voice of teenage chimpanzee Lou Wagner (as Lucius) sounds familiar, he appeared on "Lost in Space" as the Spock-eared alien J-5. Also under the fantastic "Apes" make-up are Roddy McDowall (as Cornelius), Kim Hunter (as Zira) and Maurice Evans (as Zaius). Their concealed characterizations are most memorable..."Planet of the Apes" is given an exciting treatment by producer Arthur P. Jacobs, director Franklin J. Schaffner and the crew at Twentieth Century-Fox. Gimmick-free photography by Leon Shamroy makes it look real and Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack compliments everything beautifully. The story was adapted from an original novel by Pierre Boulle. Of course, they changed some important details. For the visual medium, the alterations made a better story. Awareness of comic and pulp science fiction stories comes into play, along with a twist which imaginatively links the simian civilization to the human condition. Thankfully, the changes made by writers Rod Serling and Michael Wilson allowed filmmakers to give "Planet of the Apes" one of the best movie endings in all of filmdom.********* Planet of the Apes (2/8/68) Franklin J.

		<shortDescription>The One and Only Apes Fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES (1968) This original production, inspired by the 1963 Pierre Boulle novel, La Plan?te Des Singes was cast well, with a screenplay co-written by none other than Rod Serling. However, someone marred it by injecting period politics. It still stands out as the "one and only", primarily because it was the surprise evolutionary reversal that made it great and launched it into the Pantheon of Classics.The ensuing milking of the original in the following years was nothing more than various filmmakers attempting to cash in. The first sequel was somewhat interesting but it takes the story beyond known and theoretical science into metaphysics, thus, shattering the original concept. In my humble opinion, it is not a true sequel in that it varies wildly from the original concept, creating its own plot line and becoming silly, actually, with the introduction of malicious, telepathic super humans. That is like a bad pastiche on good art. The following "sequels" are not worth watching.The 2001 re-make of the original, with a bizarre script and completely incomprehensible ending that essentially tells audiences they have just wasted two hours of their lives and a few dollars, was stillborn, mostly because Tim Burton, who can claim some merit for other movies, such as Mars Attacks, is still no Franklin J. Schaffner.If you have not seen this original obtain a good copy of it and stick with it. You will be disappointed with anything that follows it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Taylor (Charlton Heston), John Landon, Stewart and Dodge are astronauts on a near light speed spacecraft. After around 18 months in hibernation, they crash land on an unfamiliar planet. The year outside is 3978 AD around 2000 years after launch. Stewart is dead. The three survivors escape the sinking craft with almost no supplies. Primitive humanoids with no language steal their supplies and clothing. They are also raiding a corn field. Then they are set upon by a hunting party of apes.The apes don't show up until 35 minutes. When they do show up on horseback, it becomes movie history. The story is compelling to the bitter end. Charlton Heston has his John Wayne swagger. He is the big American iconic superior man. Sci-fi had an interesting run in the 60s and this is definitely part of it. Then there is the ape makeup. That's the biggest danger of this movie. It could have gone terribly wrong. However for its time, the makeup is done very well. The mouth moves a little. The main ape characters can show some emotions. This is a well made sci-fi icon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh you must like this movie, it's a classic masterpiece. Totally one step ahead of his era.They are 2 hours also an amazing mind blowing adventure, also full of philosophy to analyze.We do not see the apes until the first half hour, but in any moment I fell bored. the whole time I was intrigued and expecting something amazing happen. It's totally shocking seeing apes civilized, but it gets worse when we see that them treat humans like animals (they call them like that). As I said, there's so much philosophy to analyze o:The acting is good, I saw the movie 45 years after its release, I can't even say that I don't like it.The location also is very good, all that desert civilization is very well done, the human cages are a good idea. And the heat of a regular day on that planet,is fully visually reflected.It's an undisputed "must-see" not only of the science fiction genre but also movies in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profoundness For Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie the Planet of the Apes, astronauts crash land on a planet where humans been slaved, caged in zoos and experimented on, apes are dominate but ignorant in science and technology. Through out the entire movie the protagonist tries to escape the planet and return to Earth, only to find this is the planet Earth, he has been home the whole time, but the home is no longer what it was...It's a thought provoking perspective to see how it's like humans been treated the same way that humans treat animals in the real life. The ending comes jaw dropping, mind blowing, the most stunning movie ending of all time. You can find ground shifting twists in The Sixth Sense or Shutter Island, but not to match the profoundness of the ending in the Planet of the Apes, as it only to reveal the entire human civilization had been long gone, re-evolution had taken place. It makes you to look into the tales of lost continent of Lemuria and Atlantis, mysteries like Sumerians cylinder seals and Yonaguni giant steps, space ship sightings, other dimension channelings, past life memories documentaries, out of body experiences reports... and to question what is THIS Planet of Earth we have been on.The Planet of the Apes 1968 had spawned 4 sequels, 2 TV series, inspired remakes in 2001, Rise of the Planet of the Apes 2011 and recent release Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It's very touching to see how this Planet of the Apes original had influenced the filmmakers of generations that followed and it's legacy continues for decades and on going... Personally speaking, i saw Planet of the Apes at age of 10, only to realize 10 years later it is the most import movie of my life. Even before i consciously knew, it had opened my door to see more movies for illuminations, and to learn filmmaking to create and transcend of what's in me. And that journey turned out to be my re-awakening journey to put life puzzles together and found God.I give my most sincere and forever thanks from the bottom of my heart to this movie, Planet of the Apes, and all the people who brought it alive onto the big screen. .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with my 4-yr old on his insistence. He was fascinated by the talking monkeys. I was expecting it to be a kiddish fantasy movie. But i must admit the concept was mind-blowing! Of course I found it visually dull and full of plot holes (this is 2014) which I've added to the goofs and FAQs section. But this is QUALITY sci-fi story! I really admired this movie for 3 extremely innovative features: 1&gt; The use of time dilation to achieve a sort-of time travel (although uni-directional and irreversible) 2&gt; Showing us the mirror on how cruelly, humiliatingly and impatiently we treat our animals; how we find other creatures, esp monkeys, ugly and repulsive. And making a mockery of the creationists, that too from another species' perspective. 3&gt; Evolution is old, but de-evolution really gave me the kick!I don't remember the name, but when I was little I read a poem in school in which all creatures (both intelligent and otherwise) firmly believe that God is one of their own, and He created them in His likeness. The cockroaches believe God is a cockroach! And it had made us kids laugh at all the creationists!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly one for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can now see why this movie is regarded as the classic it is, an rightly so if I might add. Starring the charismatic Charlton Heston as the brash Taylor, an astronaut who has landed in a strange planet in which the apes are the dominant species, POTA offers an entertaining sci-fi action experience, as well as providing with an allegory that will be discussed long after the movie is over, which for me is always a good thing.So as previously said, Taylor and his crew find themselfes stranded on a distant planet after their ship crashed. Between finding out that they're 2000 years into the future and that during their hibernation a fellow crew memeber has died, they seek answers that could help them survive this new environment. Soon after, they spot the humans who now are mute and lack any sort of intelligence. In ambush, one of them is killed and Taylor is captured. Due to a wound in his neck, he is unable to speak at first. Still chimps (the smartest apes) like Zira &amp; Cornelius, soon see that he isn't like the other humans, and soon after he professes the famous "get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape" line, Taylor will come at odds with the evil Dr. Zaius, who seems to know more than he shows. And soon enough, you will be surprised (if you don't already know it).Planet Of The Apes is a prime example that a film can be full of thrills, but also very enlightening and actually worth investing time and knowledge. Now one of my favorite movies, I hope to catch this movie in further viewings, as I well leave both entertained and puzzled in the best of ways.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the apes is one of the best science fiction movies ever made in my opinion. It has a interesting story, great performances by several actors, and great memorable scenes.An astronaut named Taylor travels through space and winds up on a planet that has apes as the superior race and not humans. Humans here are primitive and not able to speak so it comes as a surprise when Taylor speaks to the apes and causes many questions to be asked.Charlton Heston is great as the lead in the role of Taylor. One of the greatest actors of all time in my opinion and this might be his best performance in a film in my opinion. He really plays a character you can get behind and root for. That alone is reason enough to see this film.The supporting cast is great as well. Kim Hunter is great as Zira, the open minded psychiatrist who becomes friends with Taylor. Maurice Evans is great as Dr. Zaius the not so understanding Orangotang who is the villain of sorts in this film. Roddy Mcdowell is great as Cornelious, the archaeologist chimpanzee. Mcdowell is one of the main reasons Planet of the Apes as a film is series is so great as he returns to give great performances as several ape characters throughout the rest of the films, except Beneath the Planet of the Apes.The story is great and the action scenes are pretty well done. The music also adds to the tone of the film.Many iconic scenes as well that you will always remember. Lots of good memories in this film for me.The make up in this film is really well done for the time that this film was made. All of the apes look really good in this film and I respect all of the actors who had to sit and wait several hours for the makeup to be applied while they were shooting for this film.Overall a great science fiction film. Recommend it strongly.</fullReview>

It's all fantastic, and the fact that it was made in 1968 makes it all the more amazing. An absolutely perfect movie. 10/10, must-see, amazing brilliant, genius. Buy it, don't rent it, BUY IT!

		<shortDescription>Monumental Achievement For Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apes movies had always seemed like a joke to me, until I watched Rise of the Planet of the Apes a few years back. It was a movie that made me love an Ape more than the humans and it was one of the best showcases of motion capture I had ever seen. So before the new Dawn of the Planet of the Apes comes out, I thought I would check out the original classic. I have to say it doesn't disappoint, and as a matter of fact, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. It is much different from the reboot, but did offer up some questions about where humanity was and where it may be headed. Obviously to think that Apes will somehow take over as the dominant race would be preposterous but the film makes it believable. Besides the fact that the back cover of the movie somewhat spoils the ending, I think the movie is just genius.The reboot is much more relatable because of the time period and the place that it happens in, but there is something about apocalyptic movies that have mystery behind them that I find so fascinating. I think that the movie also does a much better job at building up the reveal of apes than the new Godzilla movie did. I knew what the apes looked like, but the fact that Heston and his crew were on the planet for a good 20 minutes before they find anybody, and the tense and haunting soundtrack does nothing but help the build up to the reveal.I do think that at times the apes can be goofy and the weak dialogue between humans and apes can be laughable but again the soundtrack and mystery behind it has me crawling back in. The apes are not at all menacing and really the only one that I felt connected to was Zira. Time has definitely helped these apes movies and the franchise is moving towards something special. I hope the new film has a great story and at some point using some of the old story arcs for future films?+Compelling story +Haunting score +That ending....-...Too bad the DVD cover spoils it -At times Goofy dialogue 8.6/10</fullReview>

The special effects for it's time were really good, compared to today of course, they can't compete but back then, they were good. The story line was so good and the acting of course was great. The costumes, the music everything was going for it. It got you hooked big time and keep you on the edge of your seat, trying to figure out what had happened to this planet. Also intriguing was the chemistry between "bright eyes" and the doctor chimp lady, that was really cool also. You found yourself pulling for the leading man and wanting to know what was going to happen all at the same time. Then - the ending - oh wow - that just blew me away. He had traveled forward in time and found out at the end we had blown ourselves all to hell and the apes had taken over. The other sequels were OK but not as good as the first one. It was really hard to follow up on and make any sense whatsoever. Those of you who have not seen it, get it, kick back and watch a really good if not great classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rise of the Orang-Utan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The timeless sci-fi classic of a space mission returning to Earth only to end up on a mysterious planet, where the other primates have evolved to become the masters of the subordinate human race, needs no real introduction. The key character remains astronaut George Taylor (memorable role by Charlton Heston), who crash-lands on this alien world only to find himself quickly subjugated and caged as unwilling slave labour of the inferior species, while the remaining two members of his crew quickly meet an untimely end. Struggling to speak due to a throat injury sustained during capture, George watches on in awe and disgust at the society he finds himself in, his sole allies are two chimpanzees - the animal psychologist Zira (Kim Hunter) and archaeologist Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), who quickly notice the man's inherent intelligence. As George Taylor attempts to communicate, more sinister forces come into play, as their superior, the orangutan named Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), obviously knows more than he is willing to reveal...Based on the same-titled novel by Pierre Boulle, "The Planet of the Apes" has aged admirably well, even though the plastic facials of the apes, chimps and orangutans takes some of the sparkle of the final product. Nonetheless the entire ordeal remains captivating throughout, rife with tension and social commentary, that covers the underlying depth of the story. At times these may seem a bit heavy-handed by todays standards, as the evident reference to racial issues in the United States have become much more complex, than during the movie's production period. This undoubtedly makes the courtroom scene, where the fate of George Taylor is to be determined, seem inexplicably crass, lacking an immortal subtlety. Nonetheless, the story still molds together nicely, still making the audacious twists and turns near the movies end as delightful as back in the day (even if the last scenes intensity has dropped significantly, due to its technical deficiencies).It is without a doubt that certain standards of movie-making have improved markedly, since the Franklin J. Schaffner classic, with the most key being the linguistic issues. The use of English as a lingua nova on a pan-galactic scale in a movie, where language constitutes a key plot point of the story, really brings about an awkward sense of incredulity to "Planet of the Apes". Back in the days maybe this issue could have been overlooked, but in hindsight this constitutes a major plot-hole, that proves extremely distracting from the overall reception of the movie. Are we really supposed to believe that George Taylor never once questioned why he is able to speak in or understand the language of his captors? A slightly more comprehensive script would best have utilised Pierre Boulle and have Taylor learn this language he does not understand.</fullReview>

The make up is still better than CGI today despite the movie set resembling TVs Star Trek. Charlton Heston's "Taylor" experiences the science fictional results of evolution on to discover that what followed was de-evolution. Social commentary never felt so personal from our 1968 maverick. How can you not love the see, hear and speak no evil scene, which subliminally answers the movies question at the end on how not to commit such unbenevolent atrocities. Oh well, two hours of the shoe being on the other monkey foot still is both scary and awakening, as is watching the apes bewilderment and wonder... It's a classic for a reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If people deserve second chances, then so do movies, and I gave Planet of The Apes a second chance. I'm talking about the 1968 classic with Charlton Heston, not the 2001 disaster with Markey Mark Wahlberg. This movie was a classic because in the 60s a movie was rare to have a sequel because they usually did not exist. This movie had a sequel because the original was so successful and made a lot of money. I saw it when I was really little and thought the site of apes talking was cool. I saw it again a year or two ago and I thought it was really boring. I decided to see it again and here is what I thought. Charlton Heston plays George Taylor, an astronaut sent out with a team of Americans to find life. They go into a deep sleep and wake up in the year 3978 on an unknown planet where man is uncivilized and apes have a full society. Just the premise of this movie is incredibly unique. Charlton Heston is amazing in all of his roles and this is one of his best, excluding when he played Moses in The Ten Commandments, he plays the loner who just wanted an adventure and an excuse to leave Earth. In the beginning he is a snarky sarcastic punk in a way. He understands the reality of his situation at first realizing that everybody he has ever known is dead. The relationships between he and his two mates push the story forward and brings entertainment as they explore the planet. His charisma is what keeps him alive after they are captured by the apes.The apes to this day still look amazing. They have a slight hunch like an ape and the prosthetics they use were the best of the time period. The year was 1968 and CGI did not exist so actors and extras had to literally be transformed. They looked, and still do look, real. There are two different types, chimps and apes. Chimps are more intelligent than the apes but they live together in peace. The apes are the fighters and higher power in government while chimps are the scientists and common people. One scene chimps are shown protesting something I can't remember but it is a satire of society in the 60s. Little pokes at society and how they connect are shown throughout the movie and I thought it was worth mentioning.Taylor's charisma and intelligence helps him survive as he is the only human capable of speaking, but his throat was injured in the raid and for a while he cannot speak. He tries to communicate with chimps with words and that is a big deal to chimps. Cornelius and Zira are two scientists who study man and they are very interested in Taylor who they call "blue eyes." At first I found the lack of action and the conversations Taylor was having with the Ape incredibly boring, but after seeing it with a new perspective, I found it interesting. The way Heston uses his words and acts out his monologues is fun to watch. He has a lot of emotion that is kind of unexpected after the first act introduces his character.Dr. Zaius is one of the head apes in society and he is a well- respected doctor. Throughout the movie we know he is hiding something because he shows so much hate towards the humans. He has a secret he never admits but the final scene reveals the biggest shock and plot twist a movie had ever seen at that time. Nobody saw that coming. I won't spoil it but it just makes you think. Heston delivers one of the most memorable lines in movie history. "You maniac, you blew it up, damn you, damn you all to hell." Then the camera pans back, we see the big surprise and the waves of the ocean crash over Taylor who is sobbing, and it cuts to credits. It was the perfect ending to the movie. The buildup was subtle by Dr. Zaius but it was worth it. You go back and watch the movie again and realize what is actually happening. Strong dialogue and something an audience has never seen before made this movie a classic.Overall, Planet of The Apes is a classic movie in Hollywood history. Charlton Heston does what he does best in the lead role and this movie shook Hollywood to its roots. It did have some pacing problems in the middle and I became uninterested. The story seems to drag a little bit and the big picture became unclear but the big punch to the gut in the final scenes save the movie from a complete disaster. The viewer almost has to read in-between the lines to fully understand the greatness of the middle of the movie but nevertheless, Planet of The Apes gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. Would I watch this movie again and again? Probably not but it is a good thing to see a few times and enjoy. Appreciate that in 1968 there were very few special effects so the visuals are kid of terrible but try to imagine back in that time. If this movie came out today as it is, its complete garbage, but for 1968 it is a gem, and I respect that and I approve of the filmmaking, acting, score, visuals, and anything else I am forgetting right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Patton" director Franklin J. Schnaffer's "Planet of the Apes" is an extraordinary science fiction film that synthesizes a fish-out-of-water adventure epic with an anti-nuclear war message in a dystopian setting. Charlton Heston stars simply as Taylor while the rest of the prestigious cast wears John Chambers' incredible make-up as chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Moreover, despite having themselves concealed beneath layers of latex, Roddy McDowell, James Daley, James Whitmore, Kim Hunter, and Maurice Evans. "A Place in the Sun" scripter Michael Wilson rewrote Rod Serling's original screenplay with splendid results. When "Planet of the Apes" isn't being memorable science fiction, this Twentieth Century release skewers mankind for our pugnacity and willingness to destroy each other. The stunning long shot at fade-out takes on an added dimension in light of the 9/111 tragedy at the World Trade Towers. Meantime, Schnaffer and company strip Heston naked as he enters a world where simians rule and humans are the dregs of society. Wilson and Serling deliver considerable wit when they aren't demolishing us with message about world chaos. Remember, "Planet of the Apes" came out during the Cold War. Schnaffer orchestrates some incredible sequences, primarily the crash sequence in the lake. He shows everything from our heroes' perspective and gyrates his cameras vertiginous throughout so convey the out-of-control sensation. At no time are elaborate miniatures utilized until we see the spacecraft sinking in the lake. Basically, Heston finds himself held captive in a society that consists of apes. They treat mankind with utter contempt. He loses two of his companions after they fall in with the rest of the humans. Eventually, Heston attracts the interest of a curious couple of scientists and pleads his case before a tribunal before escaping to the Forbidden Land for refuge from the inhospitable apes. "Planet of the Apes" is an unforgettable experience, despite some narrative flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is easy to make a sci-fi movie with the advanced technology we have today, but to make a movie like this one without it is a real achievement. This is a movie that I have seen many times, and I never tire of it. It has so much to think about in the dialog that to not have it in your consciousness shows a severe lack of movie knowledge.This film illustrates the lengths to which the religious right will go to deny scientific truth. They, like the apes, refuse to accept any evidence contrary to their hardened minds and dismiss it as hogwash.They will go to their graves without understanding the magnificence of this world, dreaming of some fantasy land to sooth their ignorance.This was a perfect role for Charlton Heston. His manner shows through in his characterization and makes the film. Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall, and newcomer Linda Harrison all contributed to a classic that is among the best movies of all time.45 years later, the ending never ceases to amaze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sci-Fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a Sci-Fi classic that all should get to see, especially if you are a Sci-Fi fan. Planet of the Apes is one that I think can stand the test of time as an ongoing classic. The great thing about the movie is not the graphics or the costumes which were great but could be better, the great thing about the movie is the story, and the depth of the story goes deep to the very end.The height of this great movie is the interaction; the dialogue between the characters is more captivating than the screenplay itself. The movie is based on a 1963 science fiction novel named La Plan?te des singes meaning Planet of the Apes or Monkey Planet in English, the novel is written Pierre Boulle. The novel's (and movie's) story is built on a strong foundation similar to that of the Biblical creation of man, the tweaks to fit the creation of man to that of apes is spectacular and one that you have to see for yourself.The plot is about three astronauts who crash landed on a planet where apes run the whole planet and humans are uncivilized and speechless. The apes were in charge and spoke while the humans were treated like animals.Taylor (Charlton Heston) and two other astronauts come out of deep hibernation to find themselves on the strange planet. Taylor sustained a throat injury that made him unable to speak, making the apes think that he is just as uncivilized as the rest humans, but when his throat healed he spoke and all hell broke loose on the ape planet.Seen as one of the best movies of our time, Planet of the Apes was a huge commercial success and it had a higher critical acclaim than any of the other four in its series. The franchise was revisited in 2001 by Tim Burton the name of the movie was also the same and the movie was a financial success, but 20th Century fox didn't continue with it but did a reboot of the franchise in 2011 named Rise of the Planet of the Apes which won an Oscar for best visual effect, a second part of the movie will be released in 2014.This movie is excellent and it is great, one that you will not mind seeing, the movie is so captivating that from the get go you will be attracted to see how it will end, and the twist ending is one that has remained in cinematic history as one of the best endings there is, and I agree.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sci Fi Classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with...this movie has an excellent story that should be seen by everyone. Charlton Heston does an amazing job acting out the lost astronaut (Taylor). Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter also do very good jobs with their characters that will set the tone for the rest of the series. I came in to watching this with low expectations, because like so many of my friends my age (18) they believe this to be a terrible movie that goes into an even worse series, but I was HUGELY surprised to find that this movie kept my attention the whole way through! Not only that but it had enough action and dramatization to keep my attention every step of the way. It also qualifies as a great "thinker" movie and ends in a very thoughtful/pessimistic way that works perfectly for the movie...compared to the remake (planet of the apes 2001). I even caught myself thinking about it later in the day. Once its all said and done I found myself wanting the movie to continue! The story, acting, and sheer filming (great job to director: Franklin Schaffner!) of this movie makes it one of a kind and one of the best Sci Fi movies I have EVER seen!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Planet of the Apes" is a science fiction classic that, after more than 40 years, still stands the test of time. The story revolves around a group of astronauts who crash land on an unspecified planet hundreds of years in the future. There they find that apes have evolved into the dominant race while human beings are their oppressed intellectual inferiors.The high concept premise (courtesy of the novel's author, Pierre Boulle) gets a thorough workout from screenwriters Michael Wilson &amp; Rod Serling. The celebrated twist ending has Serling written all over it but the script is also jam-packed with action, social commentary and some humour for good measure.I must say that the cast is pretty impressive for a science fiction film, too. The legendary Charlton Heston is the undisputed star of the film and he has the gravitas needed to represent mankind as a whole. True, some of his performance is ridiculously over the top but those are some of my favourite parts. Apart from Heston, veterans Roddy McDowall &amp; Kim Hunter also do a good job as a pair of apes sympathetic to our hero's plight. They and Maurice Evans (among others) had the unenviable task of having to convey emotions through a layer of prosthetic make-up.Speaking of make-up, John Chambers received an honourary Academy Award for his work on this film. While obviously (and understandably) not up to today's standards, his techniques went a long way in enabling audiences to believe in a world of highly intelligent apes.Other areas of the production were also handled surprisingly well. Franklin J. Shaffner's direction is both highly energetic and consistently inventive. The cinematography of four-time Oscar winner Leon Shamroy also captured some stunning images. Perhaps best of all, though, is Jerry Goldsmith's avant-garde score, which has since been recognized as one of the greatest in all of American cinema.Ultimately, "Planet of the Apes" succeeds on multiple levels. On one level it's a rousing action/adventure while on another it's a socially-conscious piece of speculative fiction. Wildly ambitious, it's a wonder that it turned out as well as it did. Myself and countless others are thankful that it did, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The movie is beautifully directed and still holds up even after all these years,the apes make up is incredible and very realistic.I find the movie quite terrifying,I don't know why but it feels so real to me,I feel like this could really happen some day,probably because apes are very intelligent and the closest species to human.The twist at the end is outstanding,I knew what was going to happen (because of constant parodies of the final scene) and I was still swept away by how intense the scene was,certainly frightening and Charlton Heston's dramatic acting is outstanding.Planet of the Apes is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great adventure or science fiction. A group of astronauts crash land on a planet were apes are the dominant species.Best Performance: Charlton Heston</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this at the Pictures at the time with my Mum ? during the climax with everyone smoking their heads off in the theatre she loudly blurted out the denouement that was coming. Back then at 8 years old I wasn't a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits aficionado like she was so it didn't spoil it for me but I've often wondered since how many people she did ruin it for! I also still wonder how dense Taylor (excellently played by Charlton Heston) was supposed to be to never wonder why the apes were speaking English!US space ship launched optimistically in 1972 travels to the outer reaches of the galaxy in 2006 Earth years, landing on a strange world of photogenic rocks under impossibly blue skies?and talking apes. The terse Heston is suitably unimpressed with his new situation, and is even left bereft of words for a time while he was finding his feet. He makes some important scientific friends (Drs Zira and Cornelius), showing inter-species amity is possible if not intra-. Roddy McDowell's finest performance is here, bar none. Heston's aim is to escape the clutches of the apes and make a new life in the puzzling new world for him and his ultra-demure mate. Another plus in this and the entire series is the continuous homage it pays to the adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs, who imho wrote some of the most important SF books ever. Beautiful photography, excellent cost effective sets and a marvellous storyline make this a memorable film, one that still holds up well after all these Earth decades have passed since blast off ? watching it I can hardly believe it was filmed in the Summer Of Love. From memory all of the sequels presented a steady decline in quality, but over the decades the franchise has been surprisingly resilient, with cgi cartoonery and gamers now taking it up.After witnessing much ape-like behaviour by humans over the years I wonder now about definitions used! However, it's powerful and thought provoking, with probably the best ending of any film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Twilight Zone Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? Both Planet of the Apes and The Twilight Zone were written by Rod Serling.While most documentaries about the making of the original Planet of the Apes in 68' downplay Rod Serling's script contributions to the final product, for some reason. It's obvious that Rod Serling's original vision for the Planet of the Apes is all over this film.Which is why the Planet of the Apes plays like a two-hour episode of the Twilight Zone, complete with twists of reality to serve as social commentary that includes the classic Rod Serling grandiose shock ending. Rod Serling's trademark form of story telling for his Twilight Zone series.Charlton Heston is perfectly cast as Rod Serling's protagonist astronaut Taylor for 'The Planet of the Apes' Twilight Zone episode. A character that resembles a futuristic Moses who is cynically arrogant, world weary, and idealizes the discovery of something better than a planet dominated by his own species. But, instead of talking to a burning bush for guidance, he blasts off into outer space to discover a idealized alien utopia that he desires to live in.However, what he discovers instead is a planet ruled by a civilization of Apes, with the antagonist human hating Orangutang Dr. Zaius at the top of the Apes societal pecking order. While humans occupy the absolute bottom of Ape society, and treated no better than wild animals to be hunted for sport, killed and experimented on. This forces Taylor to put aside his previous self-loathing cynical world views in a struggle for survival after being captured by the Apes. Taylor may not like the human species very much, but he definitely likes himself enough to prevent being lobotomized by the Apes.Taylor rediscovers what it means to be human during his struggle for survival on his new planet that he can't run away from this time. And is forced to kind of deal with it. However, unfortunately for Taylor, Ape society shares his previous opinion about his own species, and Dr. Zaius wants to eliminate him in order to destroy the last hope of the human race for the purpose of continuing the domination of his own Ape species on the planet. And, is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that end.I'll let everyone else interpret the meaning of Taylor's horrible discovery at the end of the movie, and what it means for him after his rediscovered sense of humanity after being reduced to a simple nomadic ancient species. Who can talk by the way.Truly, a Rod Serling Classic and only movie. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep satire on 'evolution' ? you will not like what you find.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a haunting mood in this original make that is missing in the subsequent remakes despite all of the new special effects in the remakes. So one point is already made ? more and more technology does not necessarily make art better, rather most of the time technology degrades art and humanity, and at best technology posits a greater and tougher challenge for art and to humanity in general. This is because technology, apart from producing weapons of greater destructive power also entices us with 'appearances' or 'virtual reality' in which we are more likely to get lost and lose sight of our nature and purpose as human beings. Technology is only a tool, a means, not an end in itself; it is a physical tool, just as language is a metaphysical tool for expression and communication.Therefore what may appear as 'evolution' may actually be 'devolution' in another sense.While we humans may 'appear' to have evolved from apes, in some ways we are worse off than apes in our behavior. "What is called human progress is purely an intellectual affair - not much development, however, is seen on the moral side. It is doubtful whether the methods of modern warfare are preferable to the big stones used for cracking the skulls of fellow-Neanderthals".(Ludwig Von Bertalanffy) The plot is simple: the crew of a spaceship crash lands on some unknown planet after having left Earth long ago. The planet has life on it but in a reversal of sorts, human like creatures are living in jungles, and hunted and enslaved by apes living in cities. Not only that, but the apes behave very much like modern day humans, and the humans are in all aspects of behavior very much like apes on our very own planet Earth. At a very superficial level it's all quite silly and 'cheesy', if not outrageous or atrocious. It would even seem blasphemous to the typical blockheaded scientist, if not assured of the fact that this is all harmless science fiction that is meant to be amusing for their kids. Let them rest assured that the formerly theory of evolution (which now, of course, according to scientists is an established irrefutable fact) is not being refuted here, only being made fun of. Who says that there is no humor to be found in 'hard as rock', 'facts' of evolution? 'But you are so ugly' says the ape to the human ? funny for some, but morbid for others.Yes, we humans will 'seek and ye shall find' (Jesus!), but we will not like what we find, for although we are much more intelligent than other primates (a huge gap or paradox in the 'fact' of evolution), we are even much more destructive proportionately ? a fact that we are yet to 'find' and acknowledge, and then also 'find' why and for what that is so ? and that is the significance of the last shots of the movie ? that it is our destiny to eventually 'find' our true nature, it's significance and to what purpose. Also significant is that like Taylor very, very few humans even want to do so, and even they will not like what they find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most amazing Apes movie of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad to say that nowadays the magnificence of the original Planet of the Apes has been overshadowed by the very bad remake made by Tim Burton in 2001. Unfortunately, many people don't appreciate the enormous level of innovation and freshness of the idea that was behind the first and, irrefutably, the best film in the Apes series. I have always admired science fiction pictures that didn't focus mostly on the excessive amounts of special effects, but were able to pass a deeply ideological, strange, interesting, and sometimes frightening in its realism, message to the viewers. And Planet of the Apes definitely has this amazing quality, with which it's able to grasp the attention from the first minute. Just like 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Star Wars a few years later, it was able to change the way people perceive this very authentic movie genre. When George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and two of his companions land on a distant planet in the far-away future, they realize that highly intelligent apes, which use humans as their slaves and guinea pigs, inhabit it. Right after a mounted army of apes captures them, they understand that people living there aren't able to speak. When two young scientists, Zira (Kim Hunter) and her husband Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), notice that Taylor is actually able to think and form sentences, and tells them where he came from, they gradually start to believe him. However, a very emphatic and strict Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) doesn't share their joy and wants to silence Taylor for good. It's as though he was hiding a mysterious and groundbreaking secret, which would probably be too serious and shocking to bear for the citizens of this planet. That's why he wants to keep the man in a cage, and experiment on his brain, just to make sure that he won't claim any more of the heresies. After a series of mistrials, Zira and Cornelius are finally able to help Taylor escape from the town and they all travel into the Forbidden Zone. It's a place where no ape is permitted to go to, as it's pronounced deadly. However, the true reason behind this injunction is that the overwhelming secret, which could destroy the apes' community, is hidden somewhere in the vast land of this deserted place. It's simply marvelous, how many grand and complex philosophical and religious connotations this movie possesses. It may really astound anyone that the notions and ideas stated in the picture are actually not that far from the truth. Looking at our civilization, and the way it's heading, it may be scary to realize that the vision that we see may some day be real, even 2000 years from now.The costume designs, characterization and make-up are perfect, making the apes look surprisingly humane, intelligent, and superior to our race in nearly every aspect.Fantastic cinematography accounts for many beautiful views in the beginning of the movie, as the travelers roam around the deserts and jungles of a planet that's not really that different from Earth. The movie has also probably one of the most astonishing ending sequences in the history of film. I know that some of the viewers were able to find out the truth somewhere in the middle, but it's still a discovery of the most shocking kind. All in all, I urge you to watch Planet of the Apes from 1968, and forget about any other versions or sequels, as they might only spoil the awesomeness of this first Apes production. It's an extremely serious, clever, and bizarre take on the future, which will definitely move and impress not only hard-core science fiction fans.</fullReview>

That is he could carry a film on his back , here he didn't need to do it alone as the cast was good as the story (ridly scott take notes ) The concept while not original , the time travel thing , iniates you into a concept with a real possibility it could happen , apes developing into the dominant species and treating us the way we treat every species on earth . It is a superb film , none of the others matched it and the remake flopped but all hail Planet of the Apes as a milestone in film history !!

		<fullReview>The "Planet of the Apes" remake was awful since it had horrible dialogue and a different storyline. But this film (aka. The first Planet of the Apes title) actually followed the elements of the novel. I had to say it was worth watching if you don't mind being annoyed by the corny lines. But what caught my attention was how unique the props and style the film incorporated. I especially loved the action in the film that made you feel like you're watching some sort of Armageddon-like battle between apes and mankind. Also, what made sense in this film was the fact that apes actually carried firearms, unlike in the remake, which made a big impact on its story. Bottom line: this is the one and only film in the "Planet of the Apes" series that actually stand out.</fullReview>

His transparency &amp; forced punction was quite obvious. Like I said, no disrespect intended, but I would have enjoyed it much more with a more believable performance by a different leading man.

		<fullReview>I seen just too many references and parodies of this movie to the point I just had to check it out, cause of curiosity. What is is, is a ridiculous and yet captivating sci-fi movie that will keep the interest of the audiences. Like I said the premise of this movie is just way too far-fetched and ridiculous but the movie as a whole is captivating because of the direction of it all, although it's silly. It was interesting to see the roles reversed between humans and animals such as apes, chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon. Yeah there are some plot holes but your gonna have to look past that to enjoy this flick. Some movies the plot holes makes the movie bad or even terrible but this is one of those movies where it's exceptional because of the direction it goes. Anyway one obvious thing that bugged me was how everyone including the apes speaks English and the way it portrayed the apes being civilized while humans are nothing but savage animals with hardly any intelligence wasn't crafted all that well. With it's evolution and devolution aspects in the film. But I guess they did the best with what they had for the film. Again silly at times but the premise and the direction of it all is still clever, not because of the theory but because of how it's executed. Some parts of this movie and ideas was ahead of it's time when it came to the plot in a film. It's a imaginative sci-fi movie that is interesting from beginning to end.7.8/10</fullReview>

Believe me, there are plenty of folks who haven't watched it....my wife being of them. When I first saw this movie, I had no idea what it was about much less the greatest sci fi ending of all time! When I saw that ending I was literally blown away! So, if someone wants to see this movie that has never seen it and looks at the cover...the wham bam ending effect is taken away.

		<fullReview>The whole movie reflects, in an entertaining and mesmerizing way, on how humans are building our future, on the assumptions that we have about our place within the natural world, on what makes us different from animals, on racial differences and superiority theories. There is a lot of philosophy embedded in the movie, a lot of issues discussed and presented in a digestible non-confronting way. Although there is a lot of action, thrill and mystery, and the movie is very entertaining, the dialogs and atmosphere of the film are permeated by a subtle restlessness that unsettles the viewer from the beginning to the very end.The actors are all terrific in their respective roles. Charlton Heston is good and believable in his role. However, the actors playing the main Apes (Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans) really steal the show, not because of their masks and dresses, but because the viewer forgets about them and sees them as real characters.The movie is visually impacting, still today, despite the lack of computerized special effects. The make-up and dresses are unbelievable. I mean, the end of this movie offers us one of the most iconic stunning shocking ends and images in the cinema history.The movie was filmed in 1868, therefore, some of the issues implicitly discussed in the film are out of date, but this does not rest value to a terrific entertaining film.An unforgettable classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best science fiction movie ever....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>despite being far, far away from the original Pierre Boulle's novel, this movie is undoubtedly the best exponent of science fiction, especially by critics as cruel and stark self-styled makes our civilization. Taylor at first shown a masterly monologue is indeed very happy to leave Earth, wondering if it exists something or someone better than mankind in the Universe. And it seems that . The fact that an inferior species dominate us and make us see our faults as clearly as did Dr Zaius in the minutes before Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty into rubble, is really the climax of the whole movie and is what he has to make us think really, to change our destiny. It is not science fiction that humanity is on the road to self destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you tend to avoid because you expect it to be cheesy and dated. Spread the word, fellow humans ? 'Planet of the Apes (1968)' is actually quite an intelligent sci-fi! John Chamber's make-up effects are still pretty good, even though the actors underneath have difficulty showing their emotion. The work was certainly deserving of an Honorary Oscar, though it beats me why the similar, superior ape make-up in '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' was completely ignored by the Academy.'Planet of the Apes' opens with a monologue by Charlton Heston that immediately reminded me of Rod Serling's narration for every episode of "The Twilight Zone." My suspicions were confirmed when Serling came up as co-screenwriter during the opening credits. In fact, the film revisits some of the ideas previously explored in "The Twilight Zone," particularly the Season 1 episodes "I Shot An Arrow into the Air" (three astronauts crash-land on a distant planetary body) and "People Are Alike All Over" (a visit to Mars distorts the conventional biological hierarchy).Astronaut Taylor (Heston) and two colleagues land on a distant planet after travelling forward several thousand years in time. They cross a desolate wasteland, but eventually come across life: a tribe of primitive mute humans, and a dominant civilisation of highly-evolved apes. For narrative convenience, these apes speak perfect English, with fragments of 1960s hippie-slang occasionally thrown in.Taylor is arrested by the apes, subjected to scientific testing, and his legitimacy as an intelligent being is put on trial. The ape society, falling into familiar twentieth-century traps, refuses to believe that apes may conceivably have evolved from Man, and clings stubbornly to their belief in sacred "Scriptures." This portion of the film resembles a bizarre reversal of the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial. I found the screenplay, by Serling and Michael Wilson, rather clever. It gets us barracking for Taylor as a representative of Mankind (the natural human reaction), and then unexpectedly switches its moral compass, suggesting that perhaps Mankind doesn't deserve to survive. The ending, even though I knew it was coming, is still a remarkably powerful moment. Rarely has Serling's distaste for humans and their propensity for destruction been so profound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Franklin J. Schaffner is never given enough credit when it comes to the genuine sci-fi classic Planet of the Apes. The talking points are usually the twist ending, or the late great Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowall.A philosophical sci-fi made in 1968 and nominated for two Oscars it still holds up today as a social parable, effective drama with a relevant and underlining social commentary. It's the primitive depiction of an ape civilisation rather than technologically society made Planet of the Apes standout as the iconic film it is haled as today. 'Apes builds up nicely, there's a wonderful score, (groundbreaking for the time) by Jerry Goldsmith, creating eerie and ominous atmosphere with the first exciting ape reveal at about 30 minutes in.The film is wonderfully directed and has a solicitous and thought proving screenplay by Michael Wilson &amp; Rod Serling. That said source material was from Pierre Boulle's very wry, whimsical and thoughtful novel. Astoundingly Boulle is also author of The Bridge over the River Kwai. The few visual effects are sufficient but the ape make up is admirable and star of the show. Recognisable only by their voices Kim Hunter as human conservationist Dr. Zira and the anxious Cornelius played by McDowall are splendidly magnificent as they assist Taylor played by the boldly cast film legend Heston to escape the command of the apes. The attractive Linda Harrison, who plays Nova is effective and the British classical actor, in orangutan make-up Maurice Evans is outstanding, giving a weight of believability to the subject matter.Planet of the Apes is an original science fiction must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twilight Zone: Episode 157: Planet of the Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many of us out there who wished that the Twilight Zone ran longer than it did. Rod Serling wrote the early script for this film so consider this the closest thing to a 2 hour Twilight Zone. The movie is about 3 pilots who crash land on a planet...of apes(who would have guessed.)They become suppressed by the apes and are not given equal rights unlike the apes. Charles Heston is great and perfect as Taylor in this movie, and Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall as Zira and Cornelius. Maurice Evans gives a great performance as Dr. Zauis, the leader of science and religion for the apes who is too stubborn to admit that humans were the dominant species and in the end he knew it all along. The ending(made by Serling) is one of the most shocking endings in film history. The make-up work is a triumph. It won an Honarary Academy Award for make-up. This movie succeeds at going against racism and how organized religion can really hinder the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say besides "Go out and see it if you haven't"? This movie shows how fascinating films can be when done right, particularly in the writing and cinematography. I am almost in disbelief as to why such genius film-making isn't on IMDb's top 250, so I hope mine and future votes of 10 will help to secure it a spot! Now, onto the movie: From the beginning to end, this film gripped me. I just viewed it again and was in trance by it's original plot, convincing and rich landscapes and environment, and the superb characters and acting. By now, most people know the plot and I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't seen it. So, to the unfortunate yet FORTUNATE (since you're in for a great escape and a grand surprise!) people who haven't seen this masterpiece classic slice of cinema pie, do yourself a favor! Because before you know it, your eyes will be glued to the screen from beginning to end... unless of course your mind lacks the imagination to be intrigued by such fascinating science fiction - then you might want to do yourself a favor and go to your local mall or let your new I-Phone entertain you! No need to give away anymore, just BUY it. Yes - don't rent it, BUY it because it will definitely get more than a few viewings!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler/plot- 1968, Planet of the Apes, Several astronauts find themselves stranded on a world where the dominant species are apes and humans are mute and dumb. The ape society comes off as a crude mockery of our own, where the creatures are given character of human qualities. Taylor is the counterpoint to this, and becomes the sole representative of his race with all it's attributes, good and bad.*Special Stars- Charlton Heston plays astronaut Taylor. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall are chimpanzee helpful scientists.*Theme- Time is just a ribbon in endless space.*Based on- Pierre Boulle's book, Monkey Planet.*Trivia/location/goofs- Linda Harrison, (the film producer's girlfriend) plays Talyor's love mute interest, Nova. Be sure to listen especially to the extraordinary sound track of this film with it's new use of very unusual percussion instruments to add to the outer worldly feel. Lake scenes shot just outside of Las Vegas in Lake Mead and the planetary desert red canyons around it. Green areas for the ape town was filmed in Malibu Canyon state park with it's waterfall and pond. The ape makeups were highly new and experimental for it's time.*Emotion- This is a very nice piece of satire. Direct Frank Schaffner has given us a concealed work of art here, because this is a fun movie and the satire is the collegiate zippy kind with a lot of humor. The end scene contains one of the classic images in the SF genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is one of the best films of the 60s. It has a lot of those elements that all films should have and has great acting from actors like the great Charlton Heston. But after watching this film numerous times, I have come to realize that there is no film like this, except the Tim Burton remake that stinks like rotten eggs.The makeup on the actors to make them into these great Hominoidea apes is incredible, and some of the other stunts and sets are awesome. The film also has it's share of comedy, and humor, especially with the apes. There are even scenes that weren't intended to be funny, but still manage to make you choke up.Overall, Planet of the Apes is a true classic, and one of my favorites. If only the Tim Burton film was like this, and maybe even better, but with remakes, you can always count on them being a flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science fiction classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish they made more films like this. Planet of the Apes is one of the all-time science fiction greats. It is an allegorical masterpiece that investigates a hypothetical world where apes dominate while humans live in savagery. We see the events from the perspective of a space explorer from our own era. As he criticizes the ape society, it turns out that the problems of his own human society become evident.The film suffers from a short list of problems. The special effects (mainly during the introduction segment) are dated, there are occasional plot issues, and some parts are cheesy. As far as complaints, thats all. The rest is only praise.Planet of the Apes is plain strange at first. The costume design and stage setup is eerily convincing. As we explore the world, things steadily get weirder. The reversal of society seems a bit out of place, but don't let it fool you. There is a hint of an explanation for the entire scenario, but it does not come until the very end.The characters are interesting, to say the least. George Taylor, the main human explorer, usually comes off as arrogant and short sighted. Nevertheless, we can relate to his emotions and he serves as an accurate icon. The friendly apes are wonderful characters, if not a bit unrealistic. At the end, I found myself most impacted by Dr. Zaius. I did not feel for him at all until the end, where my opinion completely reversed.It is interesting that two of the greatest science fiction movies of all time (this and 2001: A Space Odyssey) came out in the same year. They are both incredible experiences and leave an enduring aftertaste. If you like science fiction and haven't seen this yet, shame on you. Watch it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racial as well as religious commentary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the other user comments, some of which are pretty lengthy, so I don't know if anybody else picked up on this particular point. It has to do with the scene right after the famous 'take your filthy paws off me' sequence, where Taylor is talking to Nova. A number of gorillas enter the holding area where Taylor is being held. Julius turns a fire hose on Taylor, who is in the cage he shares with Nova, enabling a couple of other gorillas to enter the cage and remove Nova. She ends up in another cage. The point/question is this: might this not be a reference to 'Bull' Conner turning fire hoses on Civil Rights protesters in (I believe it was) Selma, Alabama, in what was then recent history? If so, this becomes another social comment in a movie which does a fine job of concealing social commentary in the context of one of the finest science-fiction stories ever thought of. This puts this series of these movies on an approximate par with 'Star Trek', the original series of which was going through it's first run at that time, and which also buried social commentary inside of it's stories. Something struck me as funny when I read the trivia section. I saw there how Roddy McDowell liked to drive home with his makeup on, evoking reaction from various motorists who would notice what appeared to be a chimpanzee driving a car. I could just picture the situation if he had been pulled over by one of LA's finest for some infraction or other. The cop steps up to the side of the vehicle to request to see the driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance coverage, and is greeted by what seems to be a chimpanzee operating a four wheeled motorized vehicle on a public road (or highway) in the State of California. "Is there a problem, officer?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Memorable Moment in Films History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>+++++++++ THIS COMMENT CONTAINS Spoilers +++++++++ I remember when I saw this film back in the late 60's. As the picture started and three crew members of a space ship traveling in the future survive a crash in a mysterious planet and decide to explore I thought the beginning was too slow; when the talking apes appeared as the rulers over primitive men in a world upside down the picture became interesting to me and I thought I was watching a very good sci-fi product (even the ape's make up was very good for that time) and the development from then on was unusual and "catching".But what "Planet of the Apes" will be always remembered for is no doubt its most impressive and disturbing last sequence when Taylor (Charlton Heston) finds out the hard way that he is back home and men have destroyed their civilization in a nuclear war. The scene when we see the half buried remainings of the one time symbolic Statue of Liberty is one of the great moments in movies, those that stay in your mind for ever (such as the airport final scenes in "Casablanca" or "Psycho"s sequence when Vera Miles discovers Norman's mother in the basement or Gary Cooper throwing his star in the dust at the end of "High Noon" and many others)."Planet of the Apes" is an excellent and most imaginative sci-fi film that turns into classic just for that final outcome. The recent remake by Tim Burton -even with its 30 years advantage in resources and movie techniques- does not match the original and stands as an inferior movie no doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my top 10 favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in 1966, so I didn't really become aware of the Planet of the Apes franchise until I was perhaps 7 or 8, about 5 years after the original movie premiered. However, it was still a real cultural phenomena around that time, and there were lots of toys, comic books, coloring books, sticker books, etc. etc. which I collected hungrily. And all this without having ever seen an Apes movie in the theater, even the last couple, Conquest and Battle. I saw the entire series on television. Even so, "Apes" was the centerpiece of my fantasy life as a young child, until Star Wars came along to replace it.The first film definitely remains the best. Plenty of people have had their say on it already and I really don't have anything to add. I do want to say, however, that I disagree with those who automatically trash the sequels. IMO all of them were very well done and quite thought-provoking, if a bit heavy-handed on the social commentary at times.One way in which the films are seriously dated, however, is that they present the Chimpanzees as the pacifists and the Gorillas as the aggressive, warlike types. Since then, of course, researchers have shown that Chimpanzees are far more aggressive and violent than Gorillas. (And chimpanzees are also more closely related to man than gorillas.) SPOILER: One thing I think lots of fans of the series have missed is that the character of Caesar is a wild card. He's a savior, a Christ figure. I've seen many post Battle for the Planet of the Apes timelines that lead to essentially the same future Taylor encounters in the year 3950.But Caesar's "purpose" is to be a savior. In the original history, it is the Gorilla, Aldo, who first speaks and then leads the Apes in rebellion against their human oppressors. In "Battle," Aldo is subordinate to Caesar, and Caesar kills him at the end of the movie. By bringing Apes and Humans together as equals (whereas Aldo probably made them slaves and humiliated them, then drove them out), Caesar introduces an element of hope by, at the end of the film, bringing Apes and Humans together as equals. The threat of the Earth's destruction via the Alpha-Omega Bomb remains, but there is also the possibility that Caesar's presence has introduced a subtle change that will alter the course of the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Cut Up his Brain, you Bloody Baboon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So yells the American male hero at his nemesis. But it wasn't a baboon that did the cutting; no, it was probably a chimp, under orders of an orangutan. Let's get things straight: baboons were in an initial draft, but they're not apes (also, the make-up would've been too expensive). What make-up there is was very impressive for the time (they didn't really improve upon it in the 2001 remake). It says something that the audience buys into the whole social structure of Orangutans, Chimps and Gorillas ruling a society without batting an eye as the film progresses. Of course, all 3 of these classes just stand in for ourselves - our politicians, our scientists and the police/military. This is one of the best science fiction films of all time. Viewers can enjoy its strong entertainment value (the action, the adventure) and also the political/social satire. Many people forget or are unaware that the film is based on a heavy satirical novel by French author Pierre Boulle. The film manages to retain some of those satirical elements, especially in the central trial sequence.The movie begins as an interesting but typical sf adventure, with 3 astronauts making a rough landing on a planet supposedly hundreds of light years from Earth. Just as the trio's leader and most arrogant member (Heston, well cast here) begins to make plans for running the planet of backward human-like natives, the tables are instantly turned and his 2 companions are eliminated in short order. As Heston's character falls victim to the overlords, the apes - humiliated and despised - viewers have the luxury of seeing his struggle as straightforward action and/or a commentary on the close-minded attitudes of a society's leadership. Heston, who represents usually the high-ranking powerful white male, finds himself on the lowest rung of the community, as the rulers close their eyes, ears, and mouths (literally at one point during his so-called trial) to the possibility of any intelligence existing outside their own limited domain (Ape City). There's much reference to 'The Sacred Scrolls,' the apes' old religious/historical document, which indeed turns out to not be worth the parchment it's written on. Despite the logic Heston and his chimp friends (McDowall &amp; Hunter - both excellent in the make-up) present, the ruling echelon (Evans as an orangutan policymaker - superb) prevails - the status quo must be kept, for the sake of 'simian survival.' To maintain it, such practices as lobotomizing a potential threat are approved.Heavy and deep concepts, yes? Not really, because they're nothing new to the landscape of our current global civilization. We just have a chance to see all these prevailing wisdoms and conceits attacked within a science fiction story. Of course, Heston will not be a victim for too long; even when still enslaved, he disregards the hierarchy - baboons or orangutans, it's all the same to him as he bellows his outrage - he'll have his gun in hand soon enough and there'll be some payback. You can keep an arrogant man down only for so long. But he'll always be very lonely; stuck on a planet far away (so he thinks), he also knows it's about 2000 years in the future. He'll never go home again. Then, at the very end, the story piles another shock on him; it's enough to drive even him to his knees, still one of the most memorable images in filmdom (you may wonder why he wasn't puzzled over the familiar language the apes were using, but remember, we are viewing a satire to some extent).The original Planet of the Apes movie was almost as influential in its time as the Star Trek and Star Wars sagas. The film spawned 4 film sequels (beginning with "Beneath the Planet of the Apes"), unheard of in that time, as well as a cartoon, a TV Series, and loads of merchandise. Marvel Comics published a magazine-format comic book for awhile - all of this petered out in the 2nd half of the seventies, but, for that 1st half of the decade, apes ruled!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night at the OKC art museum. This makes the 3rd time I've watched this movie all the way through. Some observations: The first time, I was maybe 12 years old and every bit of the movie worked, especially the ending (I had to stay up until 1:00am, but it was worth it). One of the best movie watching experiences of that time.I think I caught it sometime later in high school, and it was still good, although I was a bit surprised at how dated the whole 'evolution vs. religion' debate seemed to be, and how hard it was to watch C. Heston and not see C. Heston.2006: This movie dates from a time when movies, and sci-fi movies even, were being made for grown-ups. One of its center-pieces is a trial, even. People worked very hard on this movie and it showed- the sets and costumes and all. There is also a really keen shot right after the crash where the camera pans up from the spaceship in the water then rotates around, showing the incredibly bleak place they've found.It is amazing how thoroughly unlikable Capt. Taylor is. How refreshing! I grow weary of these bland good-guys. One gets the feeling that, once they lifted off from earth, he became an even bigger jerk.Ironically, Dr. Zaeus seems more sympathetic every time I watch the movie. Just how much does he know? HOw far is he willing to go to 'keep the faith'? He knows that they apes will eventually go into, or around, the forbidden zone.It is also amazing how the whole science vs religion, truth vs comfortable lies thing is suddenly so relevant again- at least in the U.S.I guess my major stumbling block was that Taylor should have been able to put together that he was on earth. After all, the language and writing of the apes is English. I can understand why they did it, but it would have been a stronger movie if they had worked around it a little better.</fullReview>

What if any being no matter how it'll look like 's really gonna come. How shall we behave? Nice question. We got two ways. Like apes or like humans. There's only one little difference in both 'fears'. Fear from future which brings disbelief and a great deal of pressure trying to change inevitable. On the other hand Apes kept ('ll keep) secret the fact that there used to be another civilization, because in case of its uncover all the things Lawgiver said and the hole system of the Apes would collapse. That's fear from history carrying out only the death of the 'prophet'. These reactions completely engaged my attention. I was thrilled and shivered after completely understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Rod Serling Credit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much that hasn't been already been written about Planet of the Apes, but I'll try to bring to light something that's not commonly known and could be of interest. Rod Serling co- wrote the screenplay, along with Michael Wilson, and his involvement has never been given the credit that it's due. Serling has always been known for clever themes infused with social commentary and his trademark ironic-twist endings. What he did with Planet of the Apes is particularly interesting. Basically, he reused a story he had originally screenwritten for an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled "I Shot an Arrow Into the Air." Tweaking it a bit and cutting it into halves, it became the beginning and ending of Planet of the Apes. I will not go into detail explaining. Those who are interested can rent the Twilight Zone DVD that contains this episode. It certain areas, it is reproduced almost verbatim. The "middle half" of the film is largely Michael Wilson, who basically interpreted the source material constraining it to the budget limitations of the film (the book took place in a futuristic society with flying cars and such, the film takes place in a more primitive society that was more affordable to represent). Hope you enjoyed this tidbit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic. It combines all its elements into a complete and thoroughly enjoyable two hours. The backdrops range from bleak and desolate, to lush and green. Ape City has an architectural style that is different and primitive, yet strangely familiar. The same can be said of the score, written by Jerry Goldsmith. The story revolves around a group of 4 astronauts that are sent into an 18 month space mission. They crash land on a planet that seems alien to them. Thats where the fun begins. Charlton Heston plays what most likely is his best role (a gun toting ape killer). All the actors do an excellent job in portraying an evolved simian. This movie has the elements of social criticism, action sequences and comedy. It is a reversal depiction of the way humans have been know to treat other creatures and other humans (the humans are now the mistreated). You are torn between your emotions. Taylor makes some good points at the beginning about the nature of man and people. At the same time you are cheering for him, you also have the feeling that this treatment of the humans isn't entirely undeserved. This movie gets better each and every time I see it. This movie is a must see movie. Coming up - Planet of the Apes : The Musical !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's go Ape! But, not too much...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review which attempts to compare the original movies to the latest one and to the TV series.Compared to the latest and "tragic" attempt at rehashing an old classic, "The Evolution" series of DVDs is a collector's masterpiece.While one may praise make-up artists' efforts in the latest installment of "Planet of the Apes", which is logically far superior than the "appliances" they had to work with, back in the sixties and the seventies, one may not find Pierre Boulle's original novel anywhere.I rate it at four stars, just because one can feel that the producers, not the cast and not even the crews, played the economic card. This is especially evident, starting with "Escape from the Planet of the Apes" and on to "Battle for the Planet of the Apes" which closely resembles a TV movie.Pity, because the entire franchise would have been worth a much bigger effort. Even though I may understand, for various strategical reasons, the choice of having "The Planet of the Apes" as a post nuclear holocaust backward society, in the the original 1968 movie, I still am wondering why the same choice was made by Tim Burton in his remake.Pierre Boulle's (the author) Apes' Planet, was far more advanced than human society on the Earth, the astronauts had left behind. This was meant to show that, no matter what man could destroy, other, probably more developed and advanced species (not necessarily Apes, but I guess this was a more poignant metaphor), could rebuild and by far, better than humans ever could.This is why, although in the 1968 version, as I already mentioned before, I could still conceive the post-nuclear theme, which was far more in the minds of people involved in the Cold War, than just a more generalized critique against human kind, in the new version I simply cannot accept it.Lack of imagination? Probably. Lack of means? Not at all.As the Star Wars franchise has shown, Cities and environments can be recreated through CG technology at much lower costs than ever before. So why then not opt for the Pierre Boulle's original novel? Your guess is as good as mine.Anyway, the classic "Planet of the Apes" is far better and original in contents and storyline and has the advantage of an excellent cast, one could only dream for nowadays.Even the music, of all five movies, reflected a much higher level at inventiveness and freshness. These restored versions, bring back the original flair they possessed when they appeared in movie theaters everywhere. Images are sharp and clear, colors are vivid.The sound is another matter. While every effort was made to restore "Planet of the Apes" in its most minute detail, including its sound, with an excellent Digital Dolby 5.1 remix, not so happened with the other four movies.Again, "Escape from the Planet of the Apes", is the most dubious example, being the only one that doesn't even sport a Dolby Surround Mono mix, but just a polished Mono one. I can only assume that the only original copy remaining is available like that. In which case, I think it was wise not to digitally attempt at "fussing" with the sound, as it was the case with other movies and in which it totally failed. But, should a "stereo" copy emerge, I would suggest to use that one to re-release this movie.And yet, I suspect that this particular movie was plagued by the same financial restrictions of the others, probably more and might therefore have had a "mono" treatment. The other ones, like "Beneath the Planet of the Apes", "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" and "Battle..." could have deserved the attention that their forerunner had.All in all, the five movies are more entertaining and well-made than the latest concoction by Tim Burton.If you truly want to be astonished and thrilled by a science fiction movie series, than I would suggest to stick to the originals. They had creativity, imagination, solid stories and excellent acting, all combined into a firework of surprises beyond which today's "remakes" pale miserably away.A note about the complete "Planet of the Apes" TV series. If you are really enjoying retro-spectacles, especially '70s style, then you may be well served. But, be warned, the series, having suffered the same financial restrictions as their movie counterparts, lack luster and are even dull in comparison. There is no more development of the characters (besides, the original ones, have long disappeared and been replaced by others) and the plots, except for two episodes out of fourteen, are always the same. The main conducting theme is "Escaping the the Planet of the Apes" and while it may be fun to watch for a couple of episodes, it starts to become weary and tiresome at the third one.The transfer was made, by just transferring the filmed material to DVD. No sound remix, no video cleansing. Evident scratches may be noticed almost in every episode. The sound is pure monaural seventies' TV style. No luster here.If you are a true "Planet of the Apes" fan, stick to "Planet of the Apes - The Evolution" DVD collection. It's the only valid choice and the only one worth the money.Included in the Evolution collection, is also the 2-hour documentary "Behind the Planet of the Apes" hosted by Roddy McDowall (who played the chimps Cornelius and Caesar in the movies and Galen in the TV series), which I truly recommend for its deep insight in the work behind such an immense effort and for its social studies' aspect, reflecting the mind-frame of society in those years.This collection is the only true gift one can make to a die-hard fan of "Planet of the Apes". All the rest would be wasted money and time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad to see this is in the top 250. It made it there not because it is a cult classic, infact I think it is not a cult classic style of movie. It is not at all cheesy like I was expecting. Yes there are a few things in there that date the movie, but this is well ahead of it's time. If it were not for "Fight Club" I would not have seen it. (Cornelius, Rupert, etc. names that Ed Norton uses as aliases are names from this movie). This movie talks about religion, culture, censorship, and calusness in a way that makes you think about how we might have been manipulated growing up in the cold war by our churches, schools, and government.Now that I have seen this I would like to see some of the TV shows. I was too young to remember anything other than apes fighting humans back then. I hope the remake with Marky Mark was 1/2 as good as this was (I liked the remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" more than I thought, it was better the the old sequels by far, so I have hope for newer remakes.)I truely recomend this to anyone that likes movies that make you think, as well as those that just like action mixed with drama. This movie has very little lacking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly intelligent sci-fi-adventure. Was surprised it had such a great premise (man travels in space three thousand years into future, lands on planet where apes are intelligent, superior species and humans are the mute animal species, yet he is shot in the throat and can not communicate to show his intelligence!), and more significantly I was surprised and impressed that this premise served to make such a wonderful, vivid comment on our own society. Probably the best, most effective portrayal of the dangers of religion. Charlton Heston is wonderful in his role, and a great action hero. I got really involved in this movie - at times i was so twisted up and fearful for Heston's life and frustrated by the repressive nature of the Ape state. A really well made movie, immensely watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning sci-fi with a hint of morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Heston classic is absolutely timeless. Sure, we all know how it ends, but that's half the point - it contains arguably the greatest and most poignant ending in cinema history.Planet of the Apes is the story of Taylor, the skipper of a manned mission in space whose goal isn't entirely clear, apart from the fact they've to return to earth 700 years after leaving, facilitated by deep sleep hibernation. Something goes hideously wrong, however, and they crash-land on an unidentified mystery planet, only to find one of their crew died while asleep and they're stranded with 3 days supplies' of food and water. They have to find life, and fast. They do find life, but the residents they encounter are not the friendly species they'd been hoping for...Indeed, on this planet it is apes who are the dominant race, who hunt human 'animals' for sport and experimentation, and they capture Taylor like they do other humans with a view to controlling him.From here the story truly takes its spellbinding grip on us, with Taylor emerging as the one the story follows, after his fellow crew are both vilified and destroyed by their aggressors and he is left alone as a 'subject' for the apes to scrutinise, analyse and experiment on. Only when he emerges as linguistic and literate do the apes who're in contact with him realise he's different and worth analysing in an alternative way. Only problem is their superiors despise the very notion of humans, and one which can talk, reason and think is their absolute nemesis.From here on in the story is a struggle between slightly liberated apes, Cornelius and Zira and their stuffy archaic bosses such as Dr Zaius, over Taylor's fate.Add Heston's extremely enjoyable performance as Taylor, portraying him as a caustic and slightly bitter man and this leads to some intelligent dialogue, particularly at the beginning, but in reality, throughout.With superb camera work, and amazing constumes in addition to the emotive and engaging performances, Planet of the Apes is an enthralling sci-fi classic which sucks you in completely to the despair and hopelessness of Taylor's situation and makes you feel completely involved with his plight.Everything about this movie is perfect, apart from the odd loose end here and there, but we can forgive such anomalies such is the vision and intellect of the story.An enduring classic whose remake isn't fit to clean its boots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living with the Apes: celebrating 35 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I became a dedicated fan of this movie during the early seventies when I first watched it as a young lad. The experience was so exciting I can still remember the tremendous impact it had on me. How can I ever forget that imaginative twist that was kept a secret, it was brilliant!A lot has been written and said about this story of three astronauts who crash on an alien planet run by intelligent apes. Why has it stood the test of time still captivating audiences 35 years after its release? Why should anyone watch this movie about talking monkeys? The most logical explanation is that it hits the bulls-eye and works on so many levels. It appeals to everyone's imagination- the young will be fascinated by the old fashioned adventure while the older thinking generation will be intrigued by the thought-provoking drama. But this isn't the only reason this film became a classic, many factors contributed to its success.Franklin Schaffner was given a great script by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson who had spent hundreds of hours perfecting their final draft. His direction was masterful. He managed to establish a strange unknown world by using mysterious locations. His cinematographer Leon Shamroy effectively used the bizarre landscape and his colour photography looks stunning. Adding effect to this strange atmosphere were the wonderful sets and the primitive looking architecture of the ape city.The acting and characterizations were memorable. Charlton Heston (Taylor) pulled off an outstanding performance. His forceful character and screen persona keeps the film involving and moving along at a good pace. We a rewarded with some great one-liners, he deserved an Oscar nomination at least. The rest of the main cast was excellent too. Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter who play the chimpanzee protagonists Cornelius and Zira balance out the stronger role of Heston's by supporting him with lighter performances. They bring a sense of reality by showing us how simians of this upside-down world have evolved from the apes that currently live on earth. Their movements and expressions are so exceptional that you can see their emotions coming through the prosthetics. Working under so much make-up and costumes was not easy. The main antagonist is played by Maurice Evans who plays an orangutan leader Dr. Zaius who knows the big secret about man right from the start. His role is pivotal in maintaining the hatred apes have towards humans.The striking image of the apes is the film's strong element. The remarkable make-up is innovative and very realistic. It was ground-breaking in 1968 and today is equally effective. John Chambers won a special Academy Award for his efforts. He and his team needed many hours to apply the make-up to each ape character. This was extremely tiring and stressful for the actors. The different clothing and colourization used also strongly symbolized the apes' social structure, it was very thoughtful.Jerry Goldsmith's score is unique and original. It's an uncomfortable collection of noise from various common and exotic instruments, sounds that you've never experienced before. It is very haunting and maximizes the eerie and mysterious mood of the film and contributes to the weird atmosphere of the strange world.An intellectual view of the movie reveals the social, political and religious issues which are still valid today. Whether the writers' intentions (especially Wilson's) were to criticize our society is anyone's guess. It's true that during the sixties America was facing many problems, among others the cold war and Vietnam and race relations between whites and blacks. The film holds up well today because it still manages to get these messages across in an accessible enjoyable way. It's telling us to look in the mirror and question our strengths and weaknesses, to ask ourselves if technology will dominate us in the future. Will it eventually lead to something horrible like our own destruction? It's ironic that Richard Zanuck the Fox chief who green-lighted the movie back then didn't see it as a message movie especially during its early years.Without a doubt the most popular reason this movie has achieved its classic status is simply because it is grand entertainment. The answer is in the script. The stylish story is a combination of exciting adventure with likeable characters and intelligent dialogue mixed with suspense and intrigue which maximizes the tension. Then when the pace slows down and you start to feel relaxed in your chair.bang it shocks you visually! Of course the biggest shock of all is the surprise ending. This was the ace that the producers kept for the last scene. It pushes the film from great to a classic masterpiece. The twist with its powerful visual sting ranks as the greatest ending to any motion picture in cinema history, you are left paralyzed! It created a milestone and a visionary accomplishment that changed Science Fiction movies.Sit back and enjoy this gem. You won't regret it!!A final tribute: Arthur P. Jacobs was responsible for the production (Mort Abrahams was his associate producer) which was based on an idea he conceived while reading Pierre Boulle's book Monkey Planet. Obtaining the rights he began his long and difficult struggle with the uninterested studios, eventually closing a deal with 20th Century Fox. The rest is movie history. In your memory I thank you for bringing your dream Planet of the Apes to the screen and for making it an unforgettable Science Fiction film deserving a place amongst the best cinema achievements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Astronaut George Taylor sets out from Earth with not much luggage except for a heavy case of cynicism. "I don't know what's out there, but it's got to be better than Man," he narrates before going into deep sleep. When he awakens to a strange world with cloud cover at night and no moon in the sky, he supposes that he and his two surviving shipmates have landed somewhere in the Orion constellation.As Taylor and his crew find first vegetable life and then animal life (primitive humans) Taylor finds many of his own words come back to haunt him. The first clue that something is not right comes when the tribe of humans they encounter become alarmed at the sound of a horn being blown. As the hunt begins, we're not allowed privvy to the hunters until Taylor sees them for himself and they are gorillas! The psychological shock is intense for those not knowing what to expect.Taylor is soon wounded and captured. His throat injury prevents him from speaking, yet none the less he makes communication with a sensitive chimpanzee named Zira. She presents Taylor to Cornelius, her fiancee, who is horrified at her finding. He over comes his prejudice to aid Zira in trying to gain Taylors freedom from the scientific counsel (little more than a board of cardinals upholding the faith.) The simply wonderful "see no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" part of the inquisition is one of motion picture histories finest moments!Ultimately, and with assistance, Taylor escapes and manages to proves human superiority to Zaius, his main nemesis. Feeling comfortable and smug with himself, Taylor and his hottie girlfriend set off up the beach to the future before him. A future that Zaius says "he won't like what he finds." A prophecy that holds all too true in one of filmdoms all time great shock endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A winking, cautionary masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A witty, cynical masterpiece that more than stands the test of time. Sure, some of the jokes are a bit creaky, but they reinforce that the film is not meant to be read as a realistic piece of speculative sci-fi. Rather, it's a winking, cautionary fable in the satiric tradition of `Animal Farm' (and that of screenwriter Rod Serling's other baby, `The Twilight Zone'). Coming from the late sixties, the beginning of that great cinematic age when mainstream movies simultaneously entertained and challenged, `Planet of the Apes' is still as fun as it is thought-provoking. The technical elements continue to impress: the stylish art direction, pioneering makeup, and wonderfully out-there score are all as enjoyable now as they were then. And though Roddy McDowell and Charlton Heston continue to be the actors most associated with this series, it's really Maurice Evans, non-actress Linda Harrison, and Kim Hunter who turn in the best performances. In particular, Hunter's work in this and the other `Apes' films has never been properly recognized. Her Zira is a full-blooded, completely believable creation; I would even call her the most human character in the film, and surely she is one of the great original female characters from this cinematic period. Highly recommended for everyone. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

It's probably among the smartest Sci-Fi filmes _ever_ made. 2001 is probably ahead of it, but this film is far more accessible than that one.Well worth a revisit.

		<shortDescription>A Sci-Fi Classic To GO Ape Over!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Planet of the Apes Is a classic. I won't go into the story too much but it deals with astronauts of the future ending up on a planet where apes rule and humans are ther equivalent of deer to be hunted. Charlton Heston plays Taylor the eventual lone surviving human who is basically a loner who really cannot stand or even like a lot of humanity but ironically ends up having to defend it. The story, the script, the acting by Heston, McDowall, Hunter and Evans is superb. Even Linda Harrison as Nova the mute female is good.Even without talking for the first part of the picture once he is captured by apes, Heston's Taylor is excellent in a world turned upside down. Even with the sequal, cartoons and remakes this movie stands out as an all-time classic. When this movie came out there really had been no other movie like it before.It is a shame they made the sequals because this movie has to be as a movie in the top ten of all time for science fiction movies.The two things I remember the most is Taylor telling the gorillas to "Get their stinking paws off of me, you damned dirty apes" and the very end where he curse mankind once again for what he learns it had done to his planet.Sorry a slight spoiler there. The ending is a classic that is frought with irony and humour.Then again irony and humour are throughout this sci-fi classic.This movie get four bananas out of four.This movie stands the test of time. A true classic!!!</fullReview>

Charlton Heston is a sympathetic hero whom we come to root for and Franklin J. Schaffner's direction looks inventive and would eventually go on to win him an Academy Award for 1970's 'Patton'. Rod Serling, made famous from 'The Twilight Zone' t.v. series, contributes masterfully to this film's screenplay with a philosophical anti-climax and an all too realistic ending which is the BEST ENDING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY FILM!

		<shortDescription>Great Cautionary Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard of this film for a long time, but never felt motivated enough to bother watching it. The remake came out, and I still wasn't motivated to watch it. LOL. I was a little biased, because I've seen clips of the sequels to 'Planet of the Apes', and seeing as those sucked, I figured this movie wouldn't be much better. But, today I actually sat down and watched the movie on cable.The special effects in Planet of the Apes are very dated, showing their age. But, the film is almost fourty years old, so, what do you expect? The ape costumes look great, though. It must've been very time and budget-consuming to dress all of the actors who played the apes and chimps every day. For its time, Planet of the Apes' special effects must've been mystifying, just from its ape costumes alone.The story is basically this... George Taylor (Charlton Heston) is an average man, who became dissenchanted with the world, and when offered an opportunity to take part in space travel, he jumped at the chance. He and three other astronauts remained in space for a long time, and they crash on a mysterious planet. One of them dies in the incident, and the rest survive to find they've aged slightly while in space. They explore this new world and find that a legion of advanced apes have taken over. I won't reveal any more, because, I don't want to spoil the movie for you.Unlike most science fiction movies (which run on plotlessly about cliche subjects like aliens, space travel, etc.), this one is thought provoking, bring up issues about the way we treat others, religion, and more. Despite the age of the film, these issues still remain relevant. And if we don't face them, things could turn out the way they did in 'Planet of the Apes'.Aside from a strong plot, great themes, and good special effects (for its time), the acting in 'Planet of the Apes' is very good. Heston pulls off a great performance. And the actors that portrayed the apes did well, despite being in tons of make up and costumes. Even "Nova" was great as the average female human in year 3978, who cannot talk and is relatively primitive.'Planet of the Apes' is a great, thought provoking movie.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of the Apes: A classic that you don't mess with!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic idea with 'Planet of the Apes' is fantastic, and the result also.The message is clear: Open your eyes, be gentle and don't look down on anyone. Give everybody and anything a fair chance, and listen! I don't see this as some critic against Sovjet, I see this as a warning to us; lets don't make war and stop destroying things and killing others. But of course it is critic against fanatic religion, I think, but that is hardly what is most important with 'Planet of the Apes', rather that religion can be used to serve a bad system. The Apes are not all the time so very smart, but in that way, they sure reminds of us. Was this how we was in some hundred of years ago? 'Planet of the Apes' doesn't want to show that we are better than apes, just show how stupid we or anybody can be. I think it is bad that there is so much spoilers about this movie - it has one of the greatest ends I ever seen and it is one of the best movies from the important film-year 1968.

		<shortDescription>Fabulous Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very thought provoking tale, giving birth to an enormously successful series of sequels, all cohesive in revealing the tale of the Planet of the Apes. Although there are some voids in between movies, they can be overlooked due to the powerful, unique story being told.Just seen this a couple weeks ago in it's entirety ( all 5 ape movies). Shame to say, I grew up during the '70's, yet I am one of the less than 5 percent of that age group that has not seen it in our childhood. Heck, if I knew what I was missing...Charlton Heston did a fantastic job in this move, as only he could. I could not imagine any of his contemporaries giving a comparable performance.I couldn't think of how they could have pulled this off more perfectly, althought the sequels have their flaws. But heck, we ignore the incongruencies and enjoy them just the same.The gripe I do have is the DVD cover. They have the Statue of Liberty on it as it appears in the movie. This kind of spoils it for a first time viewer, they can figure out the ending halfway through the movie.The mystery that surrounds this movie is what makes it intriguing. What lies in the forbidden zone? What is Zaius hiding? It seems he knows more than is apparent when he wipes away Heston's scrawlings in the sand.The grand daddy of sci fi of the '70's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A healthy dose of 60's Sci-cology.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sixties and early seventies seemed to be a great time for Sci-Fi movies to be made with a "social" message or metaphor. Kubrick had the chilling indifference of the computer with 2001, Soylent Green examined our compulsion with age, and Planet Of The Apes had monkeys ruling a warped apocalyptic future. It seems to me that prior to this, the main-stay of Sci-Fi movies was bug-eyed monsters threatening bikini clad space farers.POTA (Planet Of The Apes) does a good job of examining the inverted logic of apes keeping Man as slaves and treating him as a animal, with the Orang-utan hierarchy refusing to believe the possibility of a Darwian descent from these "creatures" or the existence of a soul within them. The more I thought about it, the more I thought it would make an unusual thesis for a University Dissertation - but I am sure there must be 100's of them by now from lovers of this fine film....I can't imagine that anyone reading this will not know the ending, but I will not reveal it just in case. The film is fairly slow in it's pacing, using mainly cinema shock tactics to keep the audience interested (the dead astronaut Stewart, the gorillas on horse-back, Taylor's first words to the apes, etc). The cinematography for the first segment of the film is really fantastic with superb shots of the "Forbidden Zone" land-scape, and the tension builds nicely as the astronaut survivors slowly realise that they are not alone on this world. This then escalates when they find out that Man is not the dominate species. The storyline then slows for the middle of the film as the apes judge Taylor (Heston's character) and consider where he comes from - as his explanation of a distant planet is too ridiculous. Scientific theories of mutation and illegal medical surgery are considered.Heston's performance as the cynical astronaut Taylor is used mainly to reaffirm the sense of isolation as the crew are sent 2, 000 years into the future - and to provide a central character that would be able to survive such a situation. I think he pulls this off well, and is very believable in his interaction with the apes that help and try to protect him. He has some corny dialogue to deliver at the beginning of the film about "man's inhumanity towards man" - but this can be forgiven against the back-drop of social conscious that must have been prevalent in 1968.The make-up, sets and costumes are fantastic - and set the look for the rest of the films in the series, along with the TV spin-off. There is just something very satisfying about seeing monkeys on screen, so perhaps this accounts for the longevity of the appeal of this franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the title you'd laugh at this film, but the film is done so well and realistically, that you believe there could be a world of apes. This film works best the first time you view it. It holds your interest till the end. When you first see the apes. It's a great shock, even though you know they're going to be apes. It's the great makeup and look of the apes. It doesn't look cheesy, instead it's natural and lived in. The acting in this film is terrific! Charlton Heston as Taylor is an A-hole and you'll love him for it. He steals every scene he's in and when he finally screams that classic line in the middle of the film, you cheer right along side with him and yell at those damn dirty apes! Yeah! Take that! Score 1 for the Humans! Arguably this film has the greatest ending of any movie in history. Which I hope no one here spoils. Folks, they just don't make films like this anymore, note the pacing of the film, for example when the astronauts start to explore their new world. You get nice quiet moments of them walking on the mountainous terrain. What will they discover? We don't know, our curiosity keeps us watching. The cinematography is great during these scenes. Today all movies are rushed and it's all about getting to the computer effects. That's so sad. The remake isn't even worth talking about and the sequels to the original are laughable. Planet of the Apes is a movie I recommend to anybody, especially young people who've never seen it, don't be distracted by the fact that it's an old movie, grab yourself the DVD and enjoy a unique classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet Of The Apes has got to be my favorite movie of all times. It is very touching, I love Cornelius, the Chimpanzee, played by Roddy McDowall. He, Kim Hunter,Marice Evans, and Lou Wagner do a brilliant job acting as Apes. As Kim Hunter said in "Behind the Planet of the Apes" that Chalton Heston was too serious off screen, as in, he really wanted there to be "NO SEQUELS" But, as good as the first one, in an amazing sequel , they still managed to make four more great sequels, a must see movies!They even came out with a TV show, in 1974, a premiere of "Back to the Planet of the Apes" TV series began. Sadly, after only thirteen episodes, they canceled it, due to the channel did not only want "Children" as their only veiwers.For Planet of the Apes, The Ending is like no other, it is remarkable, I totally love it. I will not give it away, but once you see it, you will want to see it again, and again.Before The Planet of the Apes movie, a book by Pierre Boulle called "Monkey Planet" began The Amazing Ape story. They Translated it into English, and made "Planet of the Apes" as a movie, and in 1968 the smashing hit came out. It is my favorite book.I totally recommend seeing this movie, and reading this book!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Science fiction was revived in 1968 with the release of Planet of the Apes and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Planet has a true 60's feel to it, but holds up well and is not dated. The script by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson is brilliant and contains lines still quoted today on TV shows like The X-Files and The Simpsons ("Take your stinkin' paws off me, you damn dirty ape.") The Jerry Goldsmith score really enhances the action sequences.The famous final scene is the most visually stunning ending ever and should be seen on widescreen/letterbox video or DVD.If it hadn't been for the unexpected financial success of Planet, 20th Century Fox would not have taken the gamble on Star Wars. Both projects had been turned down by all the other studios.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the film on TV and, although I already knew the ending (I'm a media student and this is a very famous shot), I was stunned.The film is quite above the average, certainly better than most contemporary sci-fi movies. Heston gives a powerful performance and many important topics are explored, such as the clash between science and religion, the exploitation of nature and human race's penchant for pointless destruction.But the ending is so terribly beautiful. No concessions to happy endings or to consoling explanations. I'm just sorry I haven't seen it at the cinema, that majestic Statue of Liberty must be so powerful an image on the big screen. That idea is worth all the movie and more. I was deeply touched... Go see it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone involved with this one rose to the occasion, from scenarists Rod Serling and Michael Wilson to superstar Charlton Heston to director Franklin Schaffner to cinematographer Leon Shamroy to Academy Award winning makeup artist John Chambers to composer Jerry Goldsmith (whose superb score REMAINS my personal favorite). The irony is that the misanthropic hero must defend the very people he so despised back on his own world (wink, wink). PLANET OF THE APES juxtaposes everything from ANIMAL FARM to Will Rogers, and there are times when the humor gets in the way (as in the infamous trial scene), but the drama is powerful enough to steamroll such minor moments. Charlton Heston is at his peak, here. It's easy to see why Laurence Olivier referred to him as "the greatest actor in the world." [Olivier was referring to Heston's stage work, I believe, but the statement could apply just as well to his screen work.] In an age when Koko the gorilla and other apes are now communicating with humans via sign language- and even making up their own words!- the "far-fetched" notions found in Pierre Boulle's MONKEY PLANET may not be so far-fetched, after all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original and by far the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" was Charlton Heston's best of the bunch of sci-fi films he made, and is probably one of the top five sci fi films of all time.It works as both social commentary (Apes in the place of humans, seeing us from the outside) and as an old fashioned adventure. The best way to appreciate if is if you've never seen it before, as it has a twist ending rivaling that of "The Sixth Sense."The musical score is also almost wholly unique, a disconcordant series of flutes, drums, hoots, and whistles that perfectly sets a different mood for the events tha transpire. The set design also stands out as highly original, accomplishing on perhaps a tenth of the budget of Tim Burton's 2001 remake and still making a more plausible world. The original costumes/sets are a style on their own, the Tim Burton ones are a mish mash of Paris fashion and historical armor that's easily identified where it came from. (In other words hokey as hell.)***********Minor spoilers***********(No, I will not ruin the conclusion)Two of my favorite scenes:The introduction of the Apes, which the viewer doesn't know what they are, only that Heston and company are being chased and shot at, until suddenly boom--they're riding in on horseback. A much simpler and more effective intro than the Tim Burton mess. (You can probably guess by now how I feel about the remake.)Cornelius's speech about "The beast, man" near the end. Simply one of the best moments in sci-fi, and a summing up of the social commentary of the movie.Movies like this always stand out to me as so much better than those of today. Modern movies have budgets greater than that of some small countries, perfect f/x, yet seem designed by committee to meet the lowest possible common denominator. "Planet of the Apes" and the ones like it seem like they were made by thinking adults who expected their audience to do the same.</fullReview>

Only in my later years did I come to understand Heston's role as a man who hated or resented the Human Race and then later in the film had to defend man. Perfectly casted, the studio could have cut corners by hiring unknowns in the ape makeup, but they filled the screen with veteran actors who could "act through" the make-ups perfectly. The action, the message and the impact are still there! Unfortunately, the 2001 re-make doesn't stack up against this classic.

		<shortDescription>the original classic which made science fiction look like something not so hokey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES was FOX films send up of a famous PIERRE BOULLE novel. The film which was produced in the Zanuck era was a non hokey cross between a reverse on "inherit the wind", a action movie and a high quality science fiction fantasy film. The film spawned four sequels, a tv series and a 2001 remake. the films success has lasted decades and was a prelude of things to come later in the 1970's when STAR WARS was released. PLANET OF THE APES has a gritty realism which helps convey a fantasy world to a domestic audience. Hugley popular, the film was a runaway smash in 1968 and was re-released several times, the last being circa 1976. This film is no normal space opera, but a film written by MICHAEL WILSON and ROD SERLING. The film has a trademark end, which was in the grand tradition of the "twlight zone"; one which is one of the most memorable in film history. A family film from a era in which "R" rated movie had not emerged in previlence yet. This film is watched today as much as it was back then. The make up effects and special effects are timeless..in league with harryhausen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. Never mind that, one of the greatest movies of all time. It still is enjoyable, even after 30+ years. You just can't not like it. The story is this: Four American astronauts, led by Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston), are returning home after a tour of the universe. They all go into suspended animation, and are awoken when their spacecraft crashes onto a distant world, light years from Earth. They are soon captured by a group of hunters who, surprisingly, are apes. On this backwards world, apes hunt humans, and put them in cages for amusement (Sound familiar?). Taylor must escape his captivity and find out a way to get home. All while trying to avoid the apes. The premise is based on a novel of the same name by Pierre Boulle, published in 1912. The screenplay, however, is written by Michael Wilson ('Lawrence of Arabia') and Rod Serling ('The Twilight Zone'), so the story's got good roots. But there's more than just that. Heston, Roddy McDowell (as Dr. Cornelius, a scientist), and Kim Hunter (as Dr. Zira, another scientist who feels sorry for Taylor) all give outstanding performances. The makeup, for 1968, is unbelievable. The art &amp; set direction is excellent. And most of all, the twist ending will blow you away. There are only a few minor flaws in Planet of the Apes. One, it was followed by four sequels, none of which even came close to the original. Two, it was remade by Tim Burton recently, who had Mark Wahlberg playing the lead. And three, it might seem too weird for first-time viewers. Other than that, its flawless. I gave this film 9/10. The only reason I didn't give it 10/10 is because it's from 1968, and I don't tend to like old movies. But you might. I don't know how else to say it. If you haven't already seen Planet of the Apes, see it now!</fullReview>

I remember marveling at the sight of the first gorilla on horseback through the windshield of my dad's car (miss them drive-in's!). And despite criticisms to the contrary, the makeup holds up remarkably well 35 years on.Performances are uniformally excellent, especially Roddy McDowell's and Kim Hunter's. The fact that Heston became such an NRA icon seems ironic in retrospect, since I came to view him as a liberal mouthpiece based upon his role as Taylor (hey, I was/am a dumb kid).That the movie became a part of pop culture --- what with the plethora lunch boxes, comic books and models --- doesn't negate its own merits. From the play on Will Rogers' epigramic "I never met a man I didn't like," to the visual "see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, see-no-evil", this is a movie that deserves repeated viewings to be fully appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the film opens to Charlton Heston's state of the world address, we know from the beginning that this is no childish b-movie about people dressed up as monkeys. The film continues to deliver concept after concept in true science fiction style, and creates a chilling world almost parallel to our own. The films ideas about religion, war and the future of the human race are as pertinent today as they were in the dark Cold War era of the film's creation - and as they have been since the dawn of history. The film delivers biting criticism of man's refusal to expand his horizons and break free from senseless dogma and tradition; his blunt refusal to listen to reason, his utter complacency. Concepts aside, the film features an inspired performance by Charlton Heston, who delivers every line with flawless style. His portrayal of 'Taylor' the man captured and then befriended by Simian 'animal psychologists' who experiment on the brains of humans (genius!), is a performance which could make even the worst plot and dialogue intensely watchable. Lines like "GET YOUR STINKING PAWS OFF OF ME YOU DAMN DIRTY APE!!" can never be repeated with such class. On the whole this film is absolutely excellent in every sense of the word, a true masterpiece. However, many people do not accept it for the genius it is, instead finding amusement in the slightly dated make up and special effects. That is unfortunate but I will always love this film. Heston may stand for guns, but hey, he's the man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes proved to be a very fascinating film in my opinion for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons why I personally enjoyed Planet of the Apes was because not only did it have a great cast with Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, and Kim Hunter, but it drew many comparisons to how humans mistreat nature/animals just like the apes severely mistreated and abused the helpless humans. The film convicted me of how I sometimes abuse nature/animals when I do not realize it. Another reason why I found Planet of the Apes so intriguing was because of the endless suspense that kept me on my toes the entire time I was watching the film. The way in which Planet of the Apes was directed kept me wanting to see what happened next in each of the following films after the original. Lastly, I just simply enjoyed the characters such as Dr. Cornelius and Dr. Zira and how they went out of their way to help Taylor despite the fact no one else wanted to help him and they knew they could be killed because of it. Dr. Cornelius and Dr. Zira were characters who promoted peace, and I enjoy watching characters in movies do what they feel is right even when nobody else around them chooses to do so. Because of these things, Planet of the Apes proved to be a entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!An eminent film that works on binary levels, that of a sci-fi piece de resistance and a query into the nature of man. The later theme is evinced through clever affinities between the human world and the fictitious ape world, and the deep questions of Taylor. Rod Sterling's touch on the movie is evident, as it has a `Twilight Zone'/'Night Gallery' feel to it that makes it compelling, yet enigmatic. Ancillary to this surrealistic milieu is the outstanding make-up work and Heston himself, who played this role in a way that few others could have pulled off. By the way I didn't mind the sequels (in fact I loved `Conquest') I just feel that the ending here is very powerful, and that any further delving is gratuitous (and that should answer you question as to if I have even bothered to see the remake). It is really the final scene that pushes this film from great to masterpiece. In fact I think the conclusion is so good I rank it in the top 5 movie endings of all time. The imagery of Taylor, sunk to his knees cursing humanity, in the shadows of the deteriorating Statue of Liberty, standing like a pyramid immemorial, is very profound. It may be taken for granted now but I'm sure that the lucky first viewers of this classic were very surprised.</fullReview>

It's still biting satire, quotable as heck, and, at the very least, you'll get all the references in "the Simpsons".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The spectacle of the talking apes should not blind us to impact of domination. Heston is over the top (what's new), Linda Harrison is WoW! (Film producers always get the best ones), and the apes are real special effects. And don't forget the music, which is probably one of the best soundtracks out there in terms of what it adds to the film. The difficult question this film raises is What should we be allowed to know about ourselves? The conservative forces of ape planet want to "protect" society from the knowledge of the past. There is a mild suggestion of the fear many humans have toward evolution. What would it mean if humans were confronted by the reality that they are animals and that they evolved from ape-like creatures? What would that mean for all the religions of the world? And talking. Humans pride themselves on being able construct sentences that animals are not capable of doing. The voice becomes a marker of superiority, almost as if God gave us the voice (that was in fact a product of evolution of certain lobes in the brain). Why are origins as frightening as if we had contacted aliens? In addition, why are the conservative forces of society always trying to "protect" information? Why did President Bush Jr. decide that Presidents should be allowed to declare their papers off-limits to scrutiny? Why does the C.I.A. operate in secrecy? Those groups in positions of power must conceal their actions that keep them in power and they call their censorship "protection"? Ever since Vietnam I don't believe that anyone falls for that old line "in the interests of national security." Dr. Zeus wants to destroy all evidence that the humans existed before and that they had a highly developed material culture. Heston screams, "They were better than you." And of course, the slap in the face comes with the realization of global warfare. With this ending, the cards are all thrown up once again: Does science really mean progress or is it an aid to state sponsored warfare and terrorism? Are religious fanatics right--is there a body of knowledge that we shouldn't have access to? And, does the "other"--either ape or human, mirror our own savagery to each other? In any case, this film is one at the crossroads of ideas and the zeitgeist of the sixties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first knew about this film, I thought it was a typical B movie of the sixties. But after seeing it several days ago, I Realize I was way off. Despite the absence of spectacular special effects, I quite enjoyed this movie. The director did such a powerful job of coordinating the movie that I was immensely pleased. Charlton Heston is a very dramatic actor, and sometimes seemed to be overdoing it. Otherwise, he was a fine actor. Nova is beautiful even in silence. Together with the good doctors, they attempt to reveal the horrifying truth about this Planet of the Apes. So, in summary, a very good movie, with snazzy suspense and evocative acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still entertaining after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last week I have the "Planet of the Apes"-DVD and the film was even better than I had remembered it.The film tells the story of the astronaut Taylor who is shipwrecked on a planet where man are nothing more than animals and apes rule the planet. The apes' society is shown as a dogmatic world where narrow-minded intellectuals seek to keep the status quo and supremacy of ape over man...This film is a satirical parable on modern society. You do not have to think hard about the apes' behaviour to recognize our own world. Such a point of view is not easy to realize well. It could have ended in a film that is as dogmatic as the society it wants to criticize or the message could have appeared banal. Here, neither of both has happened. The story is intelligent as well as exciting -- a perfect mixture.However, if you know that Charlton Heston, the star of "Planet of the Apes", is chairman of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and defends the right of every American to have a gun, the last fifteen minutes where Taylor moves around always carrying a gun with him, these scenes get a little strange smack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Champion Of Imagination in Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the apes is definitely one of the most revolutionary science fiction movies of all times. It skilfully deals with many diverse and significant issues such as evolution, human/animal rights, racism, prejudice, struggle between religion, science and political/military authority and anthropology, all within the context of a marvellous screenplay written by Rod Serling, who is the creator of Twilight Zone (let's not forget the Pierre Boulle who wrote the original book which the screenplay is based upon). Try to imagine a world-like planet where the evolution has worked mysteriously in such a way that apes have become the superior species and men are still in the elementary stages of evolution, much like early homo sapiens. And if you were to find yourself in such a planet how would you prove that it is possible for humans to be smarter than apes while you are the only example to justify that?I consider Planet Of The Apes in the same category with 2001: Space Odyssey in terms of inquiring the mysteries of evolution. Even though there is no mysterious monolith that makes apes smarter in an evil way, the connection is still there: something is making us evolve in a certain way. The movie presents a bizarre world where the mystery of evolution has favoured the species of the apes. A spacecraft, carrying 4 pilots on aboard, crashes into the sea on such a planet due to a malfunction. Soon, the main protagonist, Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston), falls captive to the apes who regularly hunt men to use them for medical researches and sports. It is interesting to see things from the opposite perspective where men is the vulnerable species and apes have all the power, which is referred to as the movie's defining famous motto: "upside down civilization".Will Taylor be able to prove that he is not guilty of being blasphemous against the ape society while at same time trying to prove that a human can be as smart as -in fact smarter than- an ape for he, too, can talk and even think? If he can prove the latter, then he is guilty of being blasphemous. If he remains silent, then he will live his life as a captive to apes, which is excruciating to a human who knows the meaning of freedom well. Will he be able to break free from the prison? Will he be able to make it to the "forbidden zone"? And why is it forbidden to the apes? What humanly secrets does the "forbidden zone" contain? Planet of the apes is a champion of imagination in science fiction with a shocking end that will absolutely blow your mind, ""You blew it; you finally blew it. Damn youuuuuuu!!!" It is also a movie with groundbreaking cinematic achievement in make-up. I was 100% sure that there would be a re-make for this movie sooner or later (because this movie had so much potential of being improved with more advanced cinema techniques) although I predicted that it would happen sooner.</fullReview>

Why?????If the moon has been jettisoned out of orbit, a la Space 1999, the Earth would also be torn apart. If not, then where is the moon???Someone please tell me, cos this is driving me mad lol.This film is a classic, I love watching it, plus to a lesser degree the first and second sequels - but Gawd what happened with films four and five??I still want to see a new Apes film, and not the Tim Burton "remake". I want to see the nuclear war that mutates mankind into 2 separate races, the mute and the telepathic; I want to see the rise of Ape Society, and I also want to see A planet of the apes, not just one city!!I keep dreaming........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love it or hate it... A Rare Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now matter how many attributes a film must have to be succesful, acting, script, direction, cinematograhoy etc etc there is only two that are required to be a "Classic". The two attributes of a "Classic" that is most important is relevant to the issue of time. Firstly that if it was made today it would still be as good a film and secondly that the issues it addresses are relevant at any point in time. "Planet of the apes" succeeds in both.The notion of re-releasing or re-making does not apply here but rather the idea of what if instead of being made in 1968 and released then it was made today and released now. If we translated its elements of good acting, strong scipt, good direction and great ending into a movie released today would if be as succesful. One would imagine it would be. This makes the story timeless and enables us to still enjoy watching it today. The concept of Apes was masterful and as original piece today it would work. There has been much written about the re-imagining by Tim Burton, however it is proof that people today are still obsessed with this old film and a good base to make the above claims about an original being released today.The second concept of still being relevant is also major aspect of a "Classic". The issues of treatment of animals, religion, evolution, and human nature and behaviour make this film relevant over a vast number of areas and a deep &amp; meaning commentary to something that people have always been interested in. Definately in todays world all these years on, the issues are more than relevant and this is one film that did so much to bring them to light originally that we cannot ignore it.So it is definately time-less, and fantastic to boot. I have not commented on the acting, script etc etc because it should be obvious to everyone that this is a unique film and one of the rare times in history when a great film has been created. It ranks up with "Star Wars', "The Godfather", "Gone with the Wind", "The Exorcist" and "Lord of the Rings" as a "Classic" for all time. Even if you hate 60's / 70's films, despise old film making techniques, hate the conept of walking talking monkeys, or think Heston is a sexist dinosaur, this film is still something worth watching and forming your own opinion on. Love it or hate it... A Rare Timeless Classic.</fullReview>

I 've come to enjoy and appreciate the movie more as I've grown older.The social commentary is so precise. The idea of classism, racism, militarism, and imperialism still be prevalent in a society that believes itself enlightened parallels the attitudes of the 20th Century.Beyond that the acting was superb. I've heard people criticize Heston's performance as hammy. They are missing the big picture. For a performance that demanded he be alienated from the other characters it was appropriate. Let's not forget that He also had to contend with the wonderful make up.As sci-fi, the movie is absolutely awesome. Compared to today, the special effects are obviously outdated, but they are still enjoyable.All in all, this movie will be remembered long after I'm dead and buried.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i recently saw this film for the umpteenth time and it still stands out as one of the top ten movies ever made.For a film made over 30 years ago the special effects and costume design still stand up today,and the soundtrack is compelling( it has been sampled by many modern acts, most notably Portishead). Charlton Heston, for my money is your quintessential leading man, and he needs to be, as for most of the film he is the only human we see speaking . As youve probably already read,he has some fantastic lines."Get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape"- his first words to his ape captors. The film also poses questions on ethics,religion and mans ability for self destruction,which as most of you will know becomes evident in the final breathtaking scene. If i have one complaint about the film its the questions it leaves unanswered.Just how did the apes and man swap places?, Was ape city the only inhabited place on the planet? and how did man lose the power of speech?.The four sequels which this film spawned are in my opinion very poor and look extremely dated compared to this masterpiece.I look forward to Tim Burtons update later this year, but although it will obviously have better make up and FX i cant see it matching this 1968 original.9 out of 10</fullReview>

In fact the movie plays and feels like a 2-hour Twilight Zone episode. I was absorbed in the plot and the special effects were entirely adequate to the storytelling. Here and there the ape masks have a little trouble "lip-synching" but 95% of the time are not distracting. It seems like this is one of those movies that people think they have seen but have not. If you liked the original "Twilight Zone" TV series you can't help but like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(MINOR SPOILERS)'Planet of the Apes' is an interesting science-fiction film with an obvious analysis on the human-race and religion to boot! Basically the apes have evolved and humans have vanquished losing their intelligence and are reduced to cave-dwellers after a few thousand years, with the exception of Charlton Heston who has traveled from the past to the future!Brilliant make-up effects for its time! Great performances from the cast especially Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter! There was no real mystery for me as I already knew the ending, some interesting commentary on evolution, religion and intelligence- a good film for animal rights displaying the role-reversal of humans and apes! Although, not the greatest science-fiction film, I can see why it has a cult following and now I guess I have to watch the sequels. 'Planet of the Apes' is a decent adventure film that may have set the standard, and still impresses audiences even today! ***1/2 out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently purchased the box set of the "Ape" films, not knowing much about the movies and relying on good reviews about them. Well, this first movie was fantastic. I was intrigued from the beginning right to the end! The story is quite simple. Col. George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and three crew members are traveling through space when they encounter a time warp while in hibernation. They land on a planet in the year 3955, where they are held prisoner by a civilization of apes who capture primitive humans and use them for studying. The movie has a number of questions that could be answered. How did the apes evolve? Why were the humans primitive? What planet were they exactly on? What really happened in the past for the future to be so different? The acting in this was outstanding. Heston at times did over act but for the most part he was really good. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell play the ape psychologists Dr. Zira and Cornelius, who try to help Taylor any way they can. Maurice Evans plays scientist Dr. Zaius, who wants Taylor captured and killed, while Linda Harrison plays a primitive woman named Nova as supporting characters. The only thing that strikes me about this movie is that it's rated G. If you saw some of the violence this movie has, you would think otherwise! There are also bare butts, apes shooting people and apes beating people with mini baseball bats! This doesn't really take any good qualities away from the movie, the best parts happened to be two classic lines Mr. Heston says ("Damn you all to hell!" "Take your stinking hands off me you damn, dirty ape!") and the ending, which I won't give away because it really is a shocker! Definitely see this film if you love sci-fi, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was when Chuck Heston was in his sci fi movie phase! This is right up there with The Omega Man in my opinion! Take yer stinking hands off me you damn dirty ape! Killer lines! Chuck was just as big a stud as Clint Eastwood when he was makin' movies like this. I also loved the 60's humor and the futuristic 1900's ape setting. Great costumes too. I like those leather tunics the apes wear, baby! See Planet Of The Apes and have a kickaxe moviegoing experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know we aren't supposed to comment on other people's comments, but I have to say I can't believe how many people here are blithely giving away the ending of this movie without any warning. I can understand what a casual thing it might seem, because it's already been spoiled by so many people elsewhere (from what I've seen, at least - I knew the ending before I knew the plot) and because it's not the hardest thing in the world for viewers to deduce, but come on, you guys! It still plays better if you have a little doubt about the outcome.I didn't even know PLANET OF THE APES was a mystery until I watched it, and when I realized how entertaining it was I kind of wished I had avoided all those jokes and comments I'd heard here and there that clued me to the solution. I'd advise anyone who hasn't seen it yet to do just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enduring classic...AND SO ARE ALL THE UNDERRATED SEQUELS!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MORD39 RATING: **** out of ****PLANET OF THE APES remains one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever lensed, not only as a science fiction masterpiece, but as an intelligent commentary on our own weaknesses.I'd like to take time here to defend the four sequels following the original. It is mind boggling to me that people continue to degrade them. True fans of the first film should be amazed at how intelligently the series progressed, thus forming an interesting circular timeline that gives us something new each chapter (with the possible exception of BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES).The ridiculous argument that the sequels got poor because the budget got lower each time only exposes how shallow a viewer can be. Bigger does not mean better, and more money doesn't always mean better. Besides, ESCAPE and BATTLE do not require a huge budget to be appreciated. They're simple tales, told simply.Perhaps I'm biased since I grew up with APES FEVER and even today I am a collector and chronic APES FAN (thank the Lawgiver!) but this modern-day trend of over-analyzing movies to the point of not enjoying them is a sad thing to me. The APES series as a whole is intelligent science fiction with a lesson and morals. It's also just a plain good time and lots of fun.I've wanted a new movie to be made for the APES for the past 25 years, and at this time we have one in the works. I don't expect it to be good (I despised remakes of GODZILLA, LOST IN SPACE, and THE MUMMY in the nineties), but it would be nice just to revive new interest in PLANET OF THE APES as a whole...Period. Recognition today is long overdue.I'll be reviewing the "remake" of PLANET OF THE APES when it finally comes out. Let's see if I can be wrong about how bad it probably will be. No matter what, we've got this classic original FOREVER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I saw this movie on cable a few days ago. i have to admit that before seeing this movie, I had always felt aloofness towards the "ape movies" that were released in the late 60's and 70's. This movie made my think of several things: Views on religion, politics, Darwin, etc. Charlton Heston made his part well, although he is not such a great actor. The ending scene is shocking, but there seems to be a flaw in the plot. How the hell didn't Chuck Heston realize he was on Earth when the apes spoke to him in US English??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the film's strong suits is the soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith. The best piece on the album is the "Hunt" score. This particular piece was achieved by using pieces of wood etc. to achieve it's distinctive sound. The Goldsmith score is a top quality job in addition to his work on PATTON and TORA TORA TORA. His scores exude a quality that surpasses most. However, there is a distictiveness achieved in the score for the original film. It's a piece of music that transceneds words...much the same way the Jedi combat music for the battle with darth maul in THE PHANTOM MENACE (by John Williams) shaped the whole sound of that films soundtrack. As I listen to this I feel a post apocalypse world being conveyed along with a sense of action and adventure and dread over the films shocking conclusion. As far as film soundtracks go this is a piece of beauty and beyond compare. It also has a innovativeness not often seen in film scores.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic little sci-fi flick. Serling's intelligent script makes the film more than just a movie about people in monkey suits. There is a little bit of everything in this story. Elements of Orwell's "Animal Farm", the Scopes Monkey Trial, the debates on nuclear disarmament, racism, and animal rights. The film is actually very deep intellectually even if on the surface it seems unintentionally funny at times. (Warning, spoiler ahead.) A major problem to its plot is that it never explains how spaceman Taylor doesn't realize he is back on Earth until he sees the Statue of Liberty. Surely he would know he was home as soon as he hears the apes speaking English!</fullReview>

The screenplay may have been adapted from a novel by Pierre Boulle, but as far as I'm concerned, this film has Rod Serling's stamp all over it, as the film's alternate reality and shocking ending make it play like an extremely well made episode of "The Twilight Zone". After 32 years, the film still retains a certain fascinating power, despite the fact that the makeup effects and costumes haven't dated very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a reaction to the comment left by Matthew A. Horn. First off I agree with all the sarcasm as to this film's lapses in logic, but this movie is not a morality play -- it's a socio-political allegory laced with satire, and attired in Sci-Fi drag. Taken for what it is it's one of the better science fiction films Hollywood's ever done. I don't think it should be knocked for being thought-provoking. Would you rather it had no ambitions to transcend its hokey premise, rather like the empty-headed "Star Wars" films? One of the great things about allegory is that either you get it, or you don't. Obviously, you don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Planet Of The Apes" (1968) is a sci-fi classic based upon Pierre Boulle's novel "Monkey Planet". The film's plot centers around modern day astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston), who crash-lands on a planet 2000 years into the future...a planet where humans are mute slaves and apes (philosophical orangutans, intelligent chimps and guerilla soldier gorillas) rule! And boy, do they rule! The ape makeup earned an honorary Oscar, and that final twist (scripted by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling of TV's "Twilight Zone") still packs a wallop after 30 years! Or should I say 2000 years! Heston was THE sci-fi actor of the late 60's and early 70's (starring in two "Apes" films, as well as "The Omega Man", "Soylent Green" and "Earthquake"). The rest of the cast is excellent: Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter as sympathetic chimpanzee doctors Cornelius and Zira; Maurice Evans as the pompous Dr. Zaius; and Linda Harrison (another one-hit wonder) as Taylor's beautiful mute mate Nova (the Eve of their new Millennium). "Apes" remains one of my favorite science fiction films ever, and brings back nostalgic memories of my childhood moviegoing experiences. Of its four sequels, "Escape From The Planet Of The Apes" (1971, third in the series) is by far the best. My score for this original: 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet Of The Apes" is one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made, certainly superior to the overrated "2001" that came out the same year. But to me, it's magnificence doesn't lie in what most others seem to think make it great. It is not the liberal social commentary (which I think is overhyped), nor even the so-called slams against religion that some people see in this film. I suggest that those people stop and think for a moment. Dr. Zaius the defender of Ape religion is ultimately proved correct about what his religion teaches about man as a result of the film's climax when Taylor finds the Statue of Liberty. The only comment I see in this film about religion is that it must be willing to adjust to proven scientific realities, and can in the end be strengthened. The end result of not doing this leaves us with the kinds of leaders that Christ preached against. Pharisees who claim to understand the law, but don't.What truly makes this a great movie is Charlton Heston and the character of Taylor. This is Heston's best performance in a non-epic film, bringing alive a character who at the outset is a misanthrope and then gets thrust into the role of defending his species, only to see his new found faith in man pulled out from under him at the film's climax. It is by far the most fascinating character study I have ever seen in a sci-fi movie, and the credit has to go to Heston for making it so compelling. It is a pity that Heston didn't realize the opportunities that could have been explored in sequels that focused on the further adventures of his character, and how he would adjust to dealing with the reality of being on his own planet again. The first sequel film only offered hints of what could have been and then gave us a depressing ending, and then the subseqent films, all lacking Heston's presence, proved to be weak efforts altogether.Pretend the sequels never happened and just focus on this first film, a true sci-fi masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all-time best SF films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in 1968 when I was eight years old. No other film I'd seen up to that point so sustained suspension of disbelief as this one did. The actors in ape make-up seemed utterly real, and after the conclusion I left the theatre speechless. The movie gripped my imagination and has never let go. I'm now almost forty-one and it's still my favorite movie. That's not to say I think it's perfect. The story has plot holes and the make-up, once so convincing, now looks somewhat primative. Still the movie holds up. It is extremely well-directed (this film put Franklin J. Schaffner on the map), the Panavision photography of Leon Shamroy is excellent, the performances of the actors in ape make-up is great (I don't think Roddy McDowall ever gave a better performance as an adult), the costumes deserved their Oscar nomination as did Jerry Goldsmith's landmark score. (In fact, Goldsmith's score is now probably the film's best element. Few other scores fit a film as well as this one does. The music soundtrack album has never not been in release on records, tape and now CD.) Even Charlton Heston is better than average here. Some claim he overacts, but I think he's just about perfect, esp. since his being the star is one of the movie's biggest jokes. If you can, rent this film in its THX transfer, and letterboxed since this is one of the best examples of what a Panavision film should look like, and Goldsmith's score is in stereo surround. I can't wait for it to come to DVD. I just wish 20th Century Fox didn't put the image of the 'surprise' ending on the box. And finally a word of warning, don't bother with the sequels -- none are as good as the first and at least two, esp. the last, are down right terrible. But if you must, "Escape From The Planet of the Apes" is the best. "Planet of the Apes" is such a great piece of Sci-Fi political and social allegory that a remake is on the way for 2001. I just hope they don't monkey around with it too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest -- I have seen the original, several of the sequels and even watched the tv series for a time, but not recently. I also watched much of the marathon. I seem to remember, however, that one of the sequels, I think "Escape" (the one which had the simian trio escaping the planet just before it blew up) has them arriving on Earth some time after COLONEL TAYLOR has left. There had been some sort of plague and most of our dogs and cats had died and jungle apes were being used as "replacements" for these. The ape child born before his parents were killed was hidden by Ricardo Montalban(please pardon the spelling) and that ape child (CAESAR) eventually came to lead all the apes. There was an interspecies war which, in combination with a number of other factors, resulted in the situation which COLONEL TAYLOR found in the first movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlton Heston has had many memorable lines of dialogue over the years: The opening monologue to Armageddon; that speech as a gas station attendant in Wayne's World 2 - oh, and countless historical epics such as The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur, but few were as memorable as: "Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!"No prizes for guessing that the movie was Planet of the Apes, the best of the simian film and TV series from the Sixties and Seventies.In those pre-Star Wars days, sci-fi smashes were a rare beast but thanks to a clever script by Twilight Zone's Rod Serling (among others), this tale of an astronaut who crash lands on an earth-like world ruled by simians was a sheer delight.The fact that Heston was the he man hero helped things enormously. Swarthy, tanned and oozing charisma, he was piping hot property and the perfect star for an audience to relate to. Especially as the premise was so outlandish.Roddy McDowall's performance was so impressive it kept him in work for years through all the sequels (and prequels) and the subsequent TV series.Roddy's character Galen in the TV spin off even graced a few patterned jumpers in the early Seventies when Ape fever was at its most contagious.Make-up artist John Chambers deserves a special mention for designing the masks and assorted oddments which transform this film's stars from humans to believable apes.A new Apes movie will be released next year and although there's no news of a cast yet, the production calibre looks great. Penned by Sleepy Hollow's Andrew Kevin Walker, Speed's Graham Yost and Batman's Sam Hamm - not to mention make-up effects by Terminator veteran Stan Winston - it looks like this is one load of monkey business that stands to make more than just peanuts at the box office in 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES was a achievement for FRANKLIN SCHAFFNER. Not only did he give us a interesting opening credit sequence but he gave us a "opening hook" sequence which featured Taylor's starship crashing into a lake from a OBJECTIVE VIEW (as if you are looking through the cockpit). This was done at the behest of ART CRUICKSHANK, the film's Art Director. The film, over all has a FUTURE PRIMATIVE look. The rugged landscape of a desert environment and the stark contrast of the "scarecrows" set up on a ridge by the apes is cool to look at and kind of creepy. A typed of "foreshadowing" if you will. One thing Schaffner does is delay the audience seeing the apes until the last possible second. Combined with a rams horn sound provided by Jerry Goldsmiths score, the scene is memorable. The opening "hunt" sequence is brutal, yet not gory. This shocks the audience and pulls them into the rest of the story, in which Taylor fights for his saftey and that of mankind. The sequences involving the corn fields and the ape city were filmed at a place called THE FOX RANCH, which was a vast parcel of California property owned by 20TH Century Fox film corp. I could go on and on but you get the idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie shows its being dated, it's an excellent masterpiece up to now. You'll notice that the apes are in a caste system. The gorillas do the grunt work, chimps are benign and pretty much peaceful, and orangutangs appear to be in the higher order. There is the question as to why humans in the movie can't speak, but it's something even one of the sympathetic chimps wonder. The apes are afraid of him because he can speak and think for himself.The tension in the story holds to the question how Taylor will survive in the ape colony. We sympathize his frustrations as he wish to be free and find answers as what truly happened. The ending may not come much of a surprise but it's still a powerful scene that it's probably entrenched in sci-fi movie history.The verdict: 4.5 of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great story. Chuck Heston is as good as one would expect in the role of a leader of a team of astronauts who believe they have landed on a distant planet. They soon learn that the role of man and ape has been reversed on this planet. Chuck is the only one to survive when he, his companions, and a tribe of humans are rounded up by a number of apes. Of course Chuck temporarily looses his voice due to a bullet wound and it is a little time before his captors learn of his intelligence. The scientist apes are eventually sympathetic and are eager to learn from him but the elders of the ape society are anxious to keep the knowledge he brings a continued secret - that man used to be the dominant species. Chuck escapes with a female companion and the friendly ape scientists and sets off for the "forbidden zone". After a confrontation with pursuing apes, he and his female companion are allowed to continue further until Chuck learns the awful truth. The planet is in fact Earth in the future. There is an interesting parallel with the story told in "The Time Machine". The future of mankind is a bleak one; in this case sadly Chuck is not in a position to put things right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The meaning of this film seems to be lost on many.Man's vain attempt at world domination was his own undoing. the fact that the film's star, Charlton Heston did not understand the meaning baffles me. he was asked in an interview what he thought about having made an anti-war film and his reply was "what anti-war film?" Heston's comment aside...this is a great film, a wonderful screenplay from Rod Serling and an incredible performance from Maurice Evans as Dr. Zaius are the highest of the films many high points.In fact Evan's as Zaius is the real core of the film. He humanizes (if you can apply that to an ape) the sheer paranoia of those in power who know too many secrets for the good of their society. Its a strong portrayal that should have earned him an Oscar nod. Kim Hunter as Dr. Zira and Roddy McDowall as her fiancée, Dr. Cornelius add some great moments of connection with Heston's Taylor as well. Hunter being the emotional heart of the film.Of course the picture also possesses one of the greatest shock endings in film history. Watch it again and feel the isolation .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As true today as when first released!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first introduction to the Planet of the Apes saga was as a small child watching the 1973 TV series. It was only years later when I viewed the movies on television (shown in random order to make the story more confusing no less!) that I came to appreciate that the first film was worthy of all of the accolades poured onto it, and also some accolades and Oscars that it didn't receive.The comments on man of the 20th century made by Charleton "Bright Eyes" HESTON at the start of the film strike just the right chord of where we went wrong "Does he still wage war with his brother?" .... unfortunately he does!The subject of heresay and doctrine is challenged in a very intelligent manner befitting the best court room drama motion picture of that era, but alas the monkey make-up would unfortunately stop some movie buffs from viewing this scene because of the film title. Indeed the trial scene would have been lauded by the general audience in another film of the same material, where the actors all represent humans instead of apes.The strength of this movie is that TAYLOR is a 20th century man, an astronaught no less who is educated and articulate. We see the apes' world through his eyes and we can all understand the pacing and plot in the same "real time" that he does. We, the audience don't understand why this world exists until the last frame because that's when TAYLOR understands it all (no, I don't believe in spoiling it, the film is more of a masterpiece when viewed as directed - giving nothing away).The latter films were a terrible joke (an unfunny one to be sure) with the characters reduced to A: Mutants (Too silly to contemplate!) or B: The apes themselves! In the first movie man was a threat to the apes because of his intelligence not because he had guns or neuclear arms! The latter movies became stupid gunplay tales with smaller and smaller doses of morality in each movie.2001: A Space Oddessy was a classic with a forgettable sequel, so is the Original Planet of the Apes! Watch this movie as a one off and forget that they even made a sequel at all!10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlton Heston is Moses in Apeland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw this at a Drive-In in the early 1970s that was notorious for fogging over during the main feature. You see, the genius who planned the Drive-In did not take into account the low lying swamp lands which produced gases that formed a thick mist when the temperature reached a certain level. Thus creating a feeling of dread much more suited to Christopher Lee's appearance in 'Horror of Dracula'.However, this film defined the paranoia of the nuclear age and the projected use of chemical warfare that would end the reign of man and thus provide a closure for those countless sci-fi genre films which dealt with invisibilty, largeness and mutation.Darwinian theory is turned on its head as apes evolve from the ashes of mankind. A clever and misanthropic twist of fate as Charlton Heston leads a team of hapless astronauts who leap into the future 2000 years only to discover that humanity has hiccuped and evolved into a race of articulate, yet ignorant chimps.Awkwardly dated, but enhanced by a new transfer that includes THX sound and behind the scenes footage which seems to indulge and ingratiate a genre of films hopelessly imbedded with the turgid miasma of scientific rationalism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Heston sci-fi flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlton Heston starred in this film in the late 1960's about mankinds future 2,000 years later on a "mysterious" planet (I won't give it away for those who are unfamiliar). The storyline is very original concerning apes as the master race and making commentaries on race, politics, and religion, but as sci-fi, it's a major insult. The spaceship Heston and his crew are in is very lacking in dimension and according to the time clock on his ship, it's set in 1972, like they would have all that technology for space travel 4 years in the future from when the film was made. The film reminds me of his other very dated sci-fi films including The Omega Man, set in the 1970's about him being one of the few people left on Earth and Soylent Green, made in 1973 when the energy crisis was a major concern and was set in severely overcrowded, underfed, New York City in the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of the many who grew up thinking "Planet of the Apes" was some lame, low-budget movie that would probably end up in a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. I was gravely mistaken. 1968 was an incredible year for sci-fi with this and "2001." This, not "Star Wars," should have been of the AFI's 100 Greatest list. However, that list has little meaning to me as films such as "E.T." and "The Sound of Music" (which I've heard Christopher Plummer refer to as "The Sound of Mucus") are on it. I saw this film on AMC back in September '98 when they were doing the 30th Anniversary celebration. I made certain to tape it when AMC was showing the widescreen presentation of this film. This and "Dr. Strangelove" are two most effective films I have seen that express the destructive path the nuclear arms race was leading man. The only shame is that Fox has the rights to this movie. They will not give this film the proper treatment it deserves on DVD (anamorphic transfer, commentary track). Hopefully things will change when that time comes. The ape makeup was very well done, especially Dr. Zaius'. Maurice Evans was able to convey very distinct facial expressions through it. Ahh, movies like this sure make it worthwhile to be a cynic. As Troi McClure said in "The Simpsons" when he was playing Taylor in the musical, "I love you Dr. Zaius!!!" The third and fourth movies of the series get bonus points because they featured Ricardo Montalban.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, not 2001: A Space Odyssey, was the best science fiction movie to come out in 1968, and remains one of the best ever. What elevates it into a genuine classic is it's literate script, direction, terrific set design, music and cinematography, and finally outstanding performances from a first rate cast. Charlton Heston, as the cynical Colonel George Taylor, delivers his finest performance in a non-epic film, while Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans make their ape characters plausible and realistic underneath all the makeup they were forced to wear.What makes the story fascinating is not so much the metaphors about 1960s society that some critics make too much of, but the fascinating odyssey that Heston goes through. At the outset, his Colonel Taylor is a cynical misanthrope who hates everything about his race, which is why he has left 20th Century Earth to find something better than man. Then, when he crashes on a planet of the apes where humans are the animals kept in cages, he finds himself becoming a defender of the species he always felt ashamed to be part of. Only to see it all pulled out from under him again at the shocking climax.It's too bad that the less than spectacular to downright awful sequels have tended to diminish the high quality of the original Planet Of The Apes movie, which thirty years later still holds up as perhaps the most literate sci-fi film ever made in terms of pure storytelling and character study. "2001" is all metaphor with cardboard characters and no story by contrast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was dragged to see this motion picture by some friends in 1968. I expected another low budget horror show made for adolescents. I was very wrong. This is one of the best motion pictures ever made. It combines elements of non-stop action, horror, satire, and tongue-in-cheek humor, with subtle comments on religion, racism, war, and the general arrogance of the human race. Even the background music is remarkable and unique.I later learned that Planet of the Apes was written by Rod Serling, creator of "The Twilight Zone" and master of the "plot twist". This film bears the mark of the master, with one especially well crafted scene that has the surprise impact of an artillery shell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Planet of the Apes uses an original idea that could have resulted in a very silly movie, and instead succeeds in creating an intelligent, provocative masterpiece. The writing and directing were superb, and the acting was pretty good most of the time, with flashes of brilliance every now and then. I cannot believe Maurice Evans wasn't nominated for best supporting actor, as I was very impressed with his performance as Dr. Zaius. There is one significant problem with this movie; a logic problem. Taylor was obviously a very intelligent man, and yet he never seemed to wonder why the language of the apes was English. This kind of bothered me through the entire first time I watched the movie, because I figured that it either meant that the movie makers compromised on logic for easier and more practical cinema, or that I had figured out something I wasn't supposed to yet. I didn't mind knowing the mystery, but I did mind the implausibility that Taylor couldn't figure it out til he saw the Statue of Liberty. With all of that being said, I have never seen a movie that did not have a significant flaw, and as far as flaws go, Planet of the Apes was very short on them, and very long on intelligence and excitement. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you have been missing out.</fullReview>

Now, these are the best reasons to watch "Planet of the apes" :1.the character of George Taylor aka Bright eye : a cynical and bitter utopian. (this is the same psychological profile as the main character of Herbert-George Wells' "The time machine")2.the plotline : the upside-down society concept (the same as The twilight zone's "The eye of the beholder")3.the theme of the reversed-evolution : regression4.the Jerry Goldsmith's music : an experimental score (the unusual use of the instruments combined with Echoplex) inspired by Bela Bartok and Igor Stravinsky5.the Leon Shamroy's cinematography : as the plotline, it is twisted (upside-down camera shots, hand-held camera shots, helicopter dolly shots, zoom shots as dramatic effects)6.the eerie barren landscape : the forbidden zone7.the Antonio Gaudi-like set-up : the village of the apes8.the John Chamber's outstanding apes make-ups9. the Truth about man's final destiny : the Adam bomb10.the hierarchy among apes11.the tone : pessimistic and realistic12.the Rod Serling's dialogues : a."I leave the twentieth century with no regrets...

		<shortDescription>Pierre Boule's prediction about nuclear warfare:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" was a novel by French war correspondent and writer Pierre Boule ("Bridge On the River Kwai".) When this novel debuted it startled his fans and literary critics, since Boule was known for his works based on fact. His reply to all this was that the nuclear arms race was a pending disaster that would someday become a fact. The film was true to its originator's concept: nuclear warfare has degraded the human branch of Primatae, leaving the other branch of the tree in charge. A great script, marvelous cast, very good special effects and an ending "punch line" that packed more wallop that Evander Holyfield made the movie a critical success and SciFi audience favorite - and it still works.The spin-offs, especially #2, "Beneath the Planet of the Apes", were loyal to the original's quality. "Beneath..." even follows Boule's original thesis of human devolution, mental and physical, due to radiation.I've seen this film at least four times. It makes its point each time, and supplies yet a new dimension for the relationship between "man" and "animal". We can see the use of humans as experimental animals in a perfect 180-turn from our practices today using animals for experimentation. This was an interesting point for Boule to have made at a time (early 60s) when society wasn't terribly concerned about cruelty towards "lab" animals.GSE/ WGAw</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing if you've read the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first encounter with Planet of the Apes was through an artistic, black-and-white comic adaptation. As a child, I loved it. Later, I read Pierre Boulle's original novel, and I thought that was fantastic, too. With that background, I was seriously disappointed with the 'classic' film. (To be fair, though, the later cinematic renditions weren't any better, either.)I understand some of the filmmakers' decisions, like changing the ape society into a less advanced one, as the novel was practically unfilmable with the then available technology, but the oversimplification extended to the story and the characters, as well, and because of that little remained of the spirit of the book. The design and makeup of the gorillas are cool, Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter give fine performances, and the last scene (being a clever twist on the book's ending) is very effective and memorable, but overall the film feels cheap and shallow, at least compared with the book. It could have been much much better.For me, the third movie in the franchise, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, proved to be the most enjoyable. By basically turning the original story inside out while remaining faithful to both the plot and the spirit of Boulle's excellent novel, that is the one that got closest to the mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't this movie be call Planet of the Simians?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I like the epic title of Planet of the Apes, but wasn't Planet of the Apes based on the novel by Pierre Boule whom most famous for his work on "Bridge on the River Kwai". Wasn't that novel at first call, La Plan?te des singes, known in English as Planet of the Apes or Monkey Planet? The French word Singes refers to both monkeys and apes. But there is no other word in the French language that I could find that refers to monkeys or apes. So I think that it literally means Simians. Franklin J. Schaffner has directed some of the most magnificent looking movies ever known for such works as Patton. I was excited to see the Blu-ray treatment given to arguably his most famous film Planet of the Apes. Sadly, this one misses the planet, but the movie was still a treat. The movie starts out with the story of an astronaut crew who crash land on a strange planet in the distant future. Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins. Nova (Linda Harrison) was hot and sexy. Considering the Apes supposed intelligence, it's enigmatic how their cities are built of stone and their only available means of transportation are primitive horse-and-buggies so unlike the novel. This film really needs to be made the way it was intended in the novel, with the astronauts landing on a parallel world, where the apes are technologically advanced. To save money on productions, the writers found a clever way to make the apes seems less advanced. This film is a blatant piece of evolutionary propaganda made to push the unproven and unprovable theory of evolution. It's hard to believe that, the apes evolve to human level in just 2000 years? In the movie, the apes have taken over and on an evolutionary timescale are just behind 20th century homo-sapiens. Their society has some differences of course, due to cost of religious leaders lead by Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) of this ape-society are portrayed as medieval like suppressors or scientific truth, with the young and humble seekers of truth like Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) only asking for honest answers. This perpetuates the commonly held myth that in our history, the Church of the Medieval West was opposed to truth and would have kept people in the darkness of superstition if it had not been for the heroes of the renaissance and the enlightenment, such as Galileo. The trial of George Taylor (Charlton Heston) mimics the very real trial of Dredd Scott's case for freedom. The movie speaks about the unjust treatment of the oppressed groups of people due to ethics reasoning. The movie might be a Sci-Fiction, but there are scenes in the movie that mirrors real life events such as Taylor getting hose down. Bull Conner turn the hose in the South at Civil Rights demonstrators in the 1960's. I love the Cold War aspects of this movie. They're just as fun to analyzes as the race aspects. Taylor left Earth because of his huge dislike of humanity's faults like war, but in the care of the apes, he find his humanity for his fellow man only to have it dashed away by what he sees in the ending. The screenplay was written by Rod Sterling of Twilight-Zone fame, who managed to inject enough of his show's trademark philosophical inventiveness and "what-if" creepiness into Planet. The twist ending is clearly written by him. Actually the ending of Tim Burton's remake stuck pretty true to Boulles version of Planet of the Apes. I like Sterling ending more. Too bad, I noticed that the cover of most of the DVD and VHS versions gives away the ending of the movie. Now this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. I guess some marketing genius at 20th Century Fox believes that everyone has already seen this movie and knows the ending, without thinking that there might be a whole generation of kids who have never seen the film. Thanks for spoiling it, Fox before I even put the disk in. The ending of this film sends a chill down my spine every time I see it. I have also notice that the film have similarities to other novels like H. G Wells 'Time Machine' with the Morlocks as the Apes. Another one is Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. Like Gulliver, Taylor is a misanthropist who leaves the civilized world behind and encounters an alien civilization that is a topsy turvy version of our own. Also there was an episode on Twilight Zone that Ron Sterling produce that called "I Shot an Arrow in the Air" that very familiar to this film. The acting and make up are great. Edward G. Robertson did the make up test for the movie. It's makes me wonder, how cooler the movie would have been if Edward G. Robertson continue to play Dr. Zaius. The cinematography is great. The whole cornfield scene was expertly shot and directed. The music is catchy and there is great one-liners. There is everything in this movie. Romance, thriller, reality and yes, lots of humor. Still, there is some faults to the film. The science in this science fiction doesn't make sense. It can be a bit hokie or camp at times. The movie is rated G, but it still have foul language and nudity so it can be a bit misleading for parents. There are many implicit ideas in the movie, that the average movie goer may not pick up on, but as far as plot and pacing, you get an exciting thrill ride of action and suspense. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Imagine the Dawn of Man sequence from 2001 as the beginning of Planet of the Apes. Next, play the Blue Danube while we watch Taylor's spacecraft floating around space. Now, do the whole fancy color thing while they are traveling. Keep everything else just the way it is. Now, imagine 2001 without these three sequences.The first scenario would make an already excellent movie even better. The second scenario would take the best stuff out of a film which many hail as the best sci-fi movie of all time and leave us with about forty-five minutes of emotionless dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the apes was released mere days after 2001: A space odyssey. It is unusual for two such films to be released in close proximity. I think that 2001 has a considerable advantage over this film. I don't by any means think it is a bad film. It has lots of elements and features of a good one, good music, a good story and an interesting plot. What I think brings it down is its lead actor Charlton Heston and its long winded and often irrelevant talking scenes.Obviously films need to use dialogue and conversation between characters to make the film work. The impossibility of this film without dialogue is obvious. However what I found is that many of the scenes were basically Heston sat talking to the camera and whatever other characters appeared on screen. The film made very little use of it's potential for large visual sequences, there were a couple of instances of this, but mainly I thought, in something like planet of the apes, which has so much potential for such scenes, it was lacking. Instead relying mainly on dialogue to push the story forward.&nbsp;There are exceptions to the above, like the child's doll which is found in the cave. When the doll makes the noise, it is a brilliant moment, the look of triumph on the humans faces, compared to that of shock and dismay on the Apes, is a great contrast. The soundtrack is also good, with the music almost always fitting the moment in question on scene, what I will say is that some of it could be quite repetitive, with the same music sequence being used for several scenes. However that barely matters, because I still maintain that the film would of lost some of its effect with no soundtrack.The cinematography is pretty standard, there is nothing paticyualy exciting about any of the shots. The camera Is often stationary, and I did sometimes think that the characters were just talking heads.I feel that my point on dialogue needs expanding. The things I enjoyed about this film were some of the more visual scenes. Whilst I accept that the film does need some dialogue to move the story forward and to explore the society and system, what I don't accept is that dialogue is the best way to do it. There are some films which solely rely on dialogue, but these are of a different sort and on a different sort of scale. With Planet of The Apes, which is essentially about exploration and discovering a new world, I would of expected more to be done with this. Yet what we get is essentially characters sat on screen and talking. This can work as other films I have seen have shown, but really here the talking is dull and unimaginative, with some of the characters spouting some terrible one liners. What I think the film needed was more scenes like the awesome chase scene, when Taylor tries to escape from the Apes custody. This scene is probably one of the best in the film, and all it is is Charlton Hedton running around the screen being pursued by a group of Apes. Yet it is more interesting than a lot of the dialogue which was mainly unimaginative and lacked anything to keep my interest.I want to mention the chase scene, which to me was one of the best bits about the film. Yes it's a tried and tested formula. But I really enjoyed it, I loved how the supposedly inferior human first escapes from the cell and then goes on to allude capture against a vastly larger force for far longer than expected. To me this is more telling than a lot of the dialogue, and is a direct demonstration of one of the ideas of the film which is the superiority of certain classes etc.&nbsp;I can appreciate that other people may find this film more entertaining than I and that they like the commentary on &nbsp;society that the film offers. I do accept that there is an awful lot of this, but in my eyes it is unsubtle and very obvious. Maybe it's meant to be obvious, but even so I don't think that this does the film any credit and I would rather have a more subtle commentary on our society. As in some ways the way the film is means that this part of the story takes over, and doesn't leave much room for manoeuvring other more minor plot points, and leaves little room for character development, with Charlton Hestons Taylor being an obvious example of this.The ending of the film, if you haven't seen the film is a shocker. As Heston rides along the beach, it leaves you wondering how the film is going to end. It is a good ploy, because the main action sequence has played put, and it feels like everything is coming to a close. In some ways I still expect to see the Horse ride off into the distance, and the credits roll. So when the real ending emerges it is definitely a shock. It is perhaps a cheeky trick by the director, and it is not acted in the best way. But nevertheless it is enjoyable, and that is what really counts7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply one of the greatest films ever made. From just about every standpoint this movie is brilliant. The story, the acting, the scenery, the make-up, the costumes, the music,and the classic ending. It is an amazing film, even now some 30 years later!!!! A must see for everyone. Charlton Heston was awesome as Taylor. Maurice Evans was perfect as the villain, Dr. Zaius. Chambers make-up was way ahead of its time. They don't make movies this good anymore. Unfortuntately, the sequels and television series did not quite measure up, although they were enjoyable. The Burton remake was really weak. There are rumors of a new apes film in the works. Lets hope it is better then the 2001 film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this one as a teen and I just finished watching all five of the POTA movies, this was by far the best one. The ending is legendary. Even though I knew what was coming, it still shocks after all of these years.Good Sci-Fi works have morals to tell and this one does it well - anti war, science vs religion, Man vs Nature, Time travel, is man evil or not are all explored here. Some of the messages get heavy handed at times, but it does not subtract from the overall quality of the movie.For me, the best part is how original the movie is. What a great idea and how well they put twists in here. You share in the hero's confusion, disbelief and ultimate disgust in himself and everything else. It's classic Sci Fi, you can see Rod Sterling's hand in this (yes, I am a fan of the Twilight Zone). Recommended viewing for all Sci Fi fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember "Hey,hey LBJ..how many kids did you kill today?".The Kent State Massacre,The Chicago Democratic Convention,the October Revolution here in little old England?Because that is the context "Planet of the Apes" should be placed in.The concept of "sexism" was barely nascent,"racism" was still called "colour prejudice" and "Animal Rights" was thought to be the province of little old ladies who didn't like to see retired British horses shipped off to Spain to be slaughtered for human consumption. Nobody thought it was sexist of Mr C.Heston to soliloquise about his love life back on Planet Earth or for the lady astronaut to be utilised as a brood mare.Today his speech seems embarrassingly inappropriate,something that Sammy Cahn might have written for Frank Sinatra at his most priapic. Indeed many of his pensees have a toe - curling quality that even forty years ago seemed a bit naff.He may be an unlikeable figure to 21st century viewers,but his brand of misanthropic cynicism was considered smart and trendy in its time.Remember Lenny Bruce,Mort Sahl,Don Rickles, Pauline Kael and the "Let's go dressed as the Sick Soul of America" parties? So whilst LBJ burned hundreds of babies before breakfast Hollywood made a movie about a planet ruled by monkeys.Only in America,folks. POTA has suffered the fate of any movie transformed into a cult(apart from being referred to only by its initials)in that it has come to mean whatever it's proponents want it to mean.It's anti - religion,anti - Darwin,anti - racist,anti - war,anti - imperialist,anti whatever you've got this week......it won't be long before some bright spark discovers a Gay sub - text,you mark my words.This is a great pity for someone who just wants to enjoy the movie per se without the political agenda subsequently thrust upon it. Sure it's a parable,but parables don't have to sledgehammered home.Ignore the aftermarket propaganda and basically you have an interesting and disconcerting take on a theme much used in 1950s Science Fiction. Mr Heston is magisterial as the stranded astronaut and spokesman for his time.He is the Noble Savage incarnate.However,in a remarkable performance Miss K.Stanley transcends her facial prosthesis,subtly suggesting deep intelligence and awareness with a few eye movements and gestures.She,ironically is by far the most "human" character in the movie(in a non species - specific way,naturally). You may find fault with the 1968 attitudes,but don't be blind to the movie's many merits. Extreme Apeys may be comforted by the fact that there are only 1970 years to go before Mr Heston's crew are due to land.Book your place in the front row now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes was certainly one of Charleton Heston's finest roles. Despite a slow beginning stretching over 15 minutes bordering on tedium and the quick loss of no less than three pivotal characters and the belated introduction of the major themes and characters in the screenplay, the film manages to portray two late 1960s era liberal themes peace and ecology surprisingly without excessive preaching or moralizations.What if the world turned upside down and simians ruled and humans kept away from the farms and used for medical experimentation? As constructed in this screen play there is an interesting side issue that successive civilisations hostile to the point of mutual exclusion take root in each other. This concept of mutually exclusive civilizations first broached in Planet is more fully developed in Beneath the Planet of The Apes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An odd film that is hard to dislike, even though there is much wrong with it. It is pretentious; Heston's performance is way over the top; hints at attraction between ape and human more than a little embarrassing; the satirical element is unsubtle and obvious.Yet for all this, "Planet of the Apes" is true to the original story by Pierre Boulle, and that saves the day: Boulle's story is more allegory than metaphor - intended to confront its audience rather than suggesting to it; and it does itself wear its satirical elements on its sleeve. And the story, just as story, is very neatly packaged - it's hard not to feel for the major players in this film, but the story moves too quickly to wallow in its undoubted tendency to over-sentimentalize. In the last analysis, we identify wholly with Heston's astronaut: we want to know what the real scoop is, and are willing to give up a lot, and suffer a bit, to join him in this discovery.Filmed with dash, very nicely yet ruggedly designed, with fine performances from all simians involved, this is at the very least high "Saturday Matinée" entertainment, and one not easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would think that a movie that was followed by four linear sequels, a live-action TV spin-off, and umpteen cartoons (plus a remake by Tim Burton) would come across, after almost forty years, as somewhat cheapened or dated. Well, I was nowhere near alive in 1968 to see this when it was released, but from what I understand, it was really quite something then, much like it is now.Starring Charlton Heston-- everybody's favorite gunslinger-- Franklin J. Schaffner's "Planet of the Apes" is one of the definitive science fiction events, and a cinematic marvel even to this day. With astonishing make-up work by John Chambers and hypnotic cinematography by Leon Shamroy, this fantastic exercise in monkey business is the story of an astronaut (Heston) who lands on an unknown planet in a distant future-- a planet controlled by advanced apes. He very soon gets the lay of the land, seeing the evil inherent in the ape leaders-- like Dr. Zaius (a gloriously wicked Maurice Evans)-- while throwing himself upon the mercy of the few apes who are humanitarians. Those humanitarians include Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter). Their performances (even through monstrously heavy make-up) are astoundingly good, and it makes one wish they could have given acting Oscars to everyone involved... especially Linda Harrison, who plays a mute human named Nova.In the sixties, this was an allegory for oppressive government and animal cruelty-- uses the film still maintains. "What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?" Well, I'm not sure that I can find one, but this film is proof that a divine spark exists in the Homo sapien brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say for sure why it took so long to get around to watching this film, I was around for it's original theatrical release in 1968. Perhaps it was for what some modern day viewers would consider cheesy special effects and men in monkey suits. But you know, the movie tosses around a host of thought provoking concepts, and challenges your perception of things by standing them on their head. Scenes are cleverly done, even when accompanied by the cliché-iest of clichés. As he did in 'The Twilight Zone' TV series of the early 1960's, Rod Serling lends his creative vision to a hodge podge mix of ideas like racial tolerance, equality, animal rights, and the 'insidious theory of evolution'. Thrown right into the middle of it all is Charlton Heston as a stranded astronaut on a planet ruled by apes who lord it over a subject race of mute humans. There's enough of the TV 'Star Trek' influence here as well, as the movie came out right in the middle of that show's run. The only way I can think of to make it better would have been to have Heston's character pick up from memory the reading of the '29th Scroll, 6th Verse' of the Apes' scientific discovery, like Captain Kirk did in the 'We The People' episode of his series. That would have blown Dr. Zaius' (Maurice Evans) mind well beyond Taylor's (Heston) ability to speak in plain English, ape talk, whatever.Some time ago I started watching the 2001 remake of the movie by Tim Burton, and had to turn it off at about midway, I was just too bored to stay with it. Just another example supporting the idea that you shouldn't tamper with the original, probably true of almost every film ever made. Still though, whenever I try to make sense of the whole time/space/speed of light connection and try to reconcile it with the idea of suspended aging it makes my head hurt. Just watch the film with some suspension of disbelief of your own and you'll only age about two hours in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outside of the allegory, this is still an incredibly entertaining and exciting sci-fi action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Planet of the Apes" is unfairly looked upon as a very campy and outdated film by some. This reputation stems from the bizarre sequels, none of which are in the league of the original. The first film is actually a very intelligently written and directed action film. It may be difficult to understand today, but the film addresses many hot topics and issues of the time (war, racism, class superiority). But unlike many other films, you don't have to look into the message to enjoy it. Remember, one of the writers was Rod Sterling, the man responsible for "The Twilight Zone". Outside of the allegory, this is still an incredibly entertaining and exciting sci-fi film. The pacing is brisk and the twist ending (which just about everyone knows by now) is still a classic. Plus, unlike the "Star Wars" trilogy, this is actual speculative science fiction. Its impressive how much appeal this film has to so many different audiences.Charlton Heston is a controversial figure because of his politics, but he can also be a fine actor, much more so than many folks estimate. He makes a fine and charismatic action hero and puts a lot of emotion into the final lines. Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, and James Whitmore are all very good in roles and manage to avoid going over the top. Linda Harrison isn't in the class of the rest of the actors, but is very easy on the eyes as Chuck's love interest. Franklin J. Schaffner, who had been up to this point known as a TV director, went on to make other classic films such as "Patton" and the underrated "Papillon". The ape makeup has been criticized by some, but remember these are humans evolving into apes. Overall, this is as much a classic as it is regarded by many as. Still one of the most entertaining sci-fi films ever made! (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film at a drive-in theater, I was impressed by the acting &amp; story. While Charlton Heston is the center character in this, it is a great script &amp; great support by folks like Maurice Evans, Kim Hunter, Roddy Mcdowell that carry the acting in this film over the top. Heston is OK, but has been better in other films.The script does carry this film. Tim Burton found this out to his chagrin when he tried &amp; failed to improve upon it. The story actually illustrates in a sense how absurd evolution theory can be viewed but at the same time makes it look extremely viable. Tim Burton's handicap is that he did not have a Rod Sterling to write for his version. A world where apes evolve from man, there has got to be an answer. It boggles the mind and the senses. While this film is not for the serious Scientist, the Science Fiction genre of film has never been done better than this outing. It holds viewers spellbound with wonder &amp; imagination upon the first viewing &amp; kept us that way long enough to produce a raft of sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Late Sixties Space Opera still has a powerful message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1968 film details the adventures of NASA astronaut George Taylor who crash-lands on a seemingly barren planet while on an interstellar mission. Though his total trip time has only been eighteen months, nearly two millenniums have passed back on Earth as a result of a relativity-type effect. He quickly discovers that he is not alone on this alien world, and that the evolutionary ladder has been turned upside down, with mute humans being hunted by talking apes. After surviving a hunter's bullet, Taylor is taken into Ape City where he is caged like an animal and the subject of 'animal psychology' experiments. Fortunately, Taylor is befriended by Nova, a mute but fetching human woman, and catches the attention of chimpanzee scientist Dr. Zira and her archaeologist fiancé Cornelius. Zira and Cornelius are shocked to discover that Taylor is unlike any other human they have seen, possessing both intelligence and the power of speech. Despite attempts by Dr. Zaius, the head of the Ape Assembly, to protect the status quo by having him destroyed, Taylor escapes, and rides off into the sunset with Nova. It is here that the film makes its earth-shattering and sobering revelation-- "SPOILER ALERT!" The cynical, misanthropic astronaut finds the upper half of the Statue of Liberty on a deserted beach, proof that he had returned to Earth and the 'upside-down' world he found was a result of man's own folly.Taking into consideration the cultural context in the film was made, it is not surprising the number of subtle allegories that can be found in "Planet of the Apes". A film that was a cinematic statement of the times, reflecting the climate of instability and discord of the late Sixties.It has been over four decades since "Planet of the Apes" stunned audiences with its grim portrayal of a world devastated by the scourge of intolerance and paranoia. The popularity of the film has continued to grow, making it a permanent fixture in the pantheon of popular culture. Including a number of the sobering themes found in the film, which still ring true today. Man's ability to inflict pain and suffering on his neighbor continues to be demonstrated, whether it be in Los Angeles in 1992, the former Yugoslavia for the bulk of the gloomier Nineties, Chechnya, or in Iraq. Like the hellish nightmare presented in the film, the planet of man is a world where the ideals of the few are still often silenced by the madness of many.</fullReview>

The three survivors traverse miles of desert before reaching signs of civilization. But the humans they encounter are incapable of speech, and seem to have the mentality of animals. Suddenly mounted apes on horseback appear, rounding the humans, their slaves like cattle. One of the astronauts is killed, another is put beneath the surgical knife, and the third, George Taylor(Charlton Heston) is struck on the head, causing him to temporarily lose his speech. The ape city is primitive compared to human settlements, and the apes are xenophobic to an extreme: they both fear and hate the humans, since their myths warn them of man's destructiveness. Taylor befriends two ape scientists, who help him escape when the ape leader sentences him to a frontal lobotomy. the human rides north into the forbidden lands, where he comes upon the head of the Statue of Liberty on a sandy beach. The Planet of the Apes is Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, thoughtful if dating sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A really good film. A product of its time (1968), it's unavoidably moral sandwiched by the social tectonic plates of Cuban missile crisis on the one hand and Vietnam war on the other. Despite being a sci-fi there's little in the way of special effects - indeed, with its Star Trek mix of small-scale studio interior and undisguised location shot the onus is firmly on the script and actors.Charlton Heston is excellent as the human in intelligent simian society. Rational but never 'clever' his actions are the result of wanting to (first) survive with understanding as an afterthought. Consequently he's quite an aggressive character. Equally the ape hierarchy are not cutout baddies, rather exhibiting all the strata of benightedness and disingenuity one would expect in any modern political system. James Whitmore's President is utterly convincing as the duplicitous but ultimately sympathetic clerical-political leader. A mention also for Linda Harrison who plays the mute Nova: it's an unforgiving role, designed to offset the rationale tussle betwixt man and beast, which she plays admirably.So a film that reaps the rich crop of placing its faith in its screenplay and acting talent. If you want better action sequences go and see Tim Burton's remake, but this is better in most other respects. 7/10</fullReview>

At times, the film is a little bit slow and unengaging, but it makes up for it by the end. The set design and acting is sometimes amusing in places, but this does not distract from the story. This is a must-see film, especially if you enjoy science fiction films. Do not give this one a miss, and do not bother with the 2001 'remake' of the film and think you've seen it.

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi Allegory For All Time; One Man Against a World of Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie, with all the elements for classic success. The problem I see with it as a writer is that the bravura production has obscured the script's values. People love this movie, for all the wrong reasons. In outline, it is simply another of those starship is sent out by hopeful, mentally-under-civilized humans narrative lines. Something goes wrong during its suspended animation voyage; of the four astronauts aboard, one, a woman, dies; the other three find themselves unable to control descent and having to land in a large lake. Their ship inks; they paddle their escape raft to shore with what gear they can save. Then they must cross a forbidding territory, in their space suits, without knowing what planet they are on, what its races and animal life are, and even where they ought to go. They find ape-skins nailed to X-shaped structures; and without knowing they are scare-humans, they continue on and find a verdant zone with a waterfall, fresh-flowing water and green growths. Forgetting their regrets, for the Earth of their time--only one, the leader Taylor has none since he never liked his time not trusted its leaders not to blow up the planet--they go swimming and hurry back to shore too late to find their clothes; someone or something has stolen them. Continuing on, they find humans, strangely silent, furtively stealing food; they are primitive, rather dirty and obviously frightened specimens. The viewer and the three astronauts soon hat they are watching for; gorilla's dressed in army uniforms riding horses come along, blow strange signal horns and use great nets to capture the food thieves, the astronauts along with them. Taylor tries to fight back but a whip is wrapped around his throat, depriving him of speech and he blacks out. He wakes up in a pen with many others; There he notes Cornelius, a young chimpanzee scientist and his fiancée, Zira, who are kinder to him; but they too regard the humans as an inferior species, under the watchful and hostile eye of their boss Dr. Zaius. Only Zira believes humans are not animals. Taylor tries to write her a message--she calls him "Bright Eyes"; but Dr. Zaius erases it. She has him brought indoors to a cell and introduces a pretty human girl for company. Finally, Taylor, frustrated and still unable to speak, escapes and leads the camera in a chase through the ape city, until he is finally caught and netted again, and cries, "Take your filthy paws off me--you damned dirty ape!" He is taken to Dr. Zaius. And he learns the history of the world. Weapons destroyed it, apparently atomic weapons, since there is a "Forbidden Zone". Gorillas are soldiers, chimpanzees are scientists and orangutans are the leaders. Taylor finds out one of his men is dead, the other had his brain removed by Dr. Zaius to hide his humanity--he is now an exhibit in the Museum. Once more, Taylor, who is interrogated by a group of leaders and not believed, has to escape. He takes Zaius with him and Cornelius and Zira have to go because they helped him avoid death. They travel into the "Forbidden Zone", to a cave where they seek evidence that in the past, man could talk and had a civilization; that they were those who built and destroyed the world's centers, and the apes only came afterward. Learning the truth, Taylor takes Nova, the girl, on horseback with him. They flee the apes and journey along the edge of the ocean. And there he makes a terrible discovery. "You finally did it--damn you!" he screams, as the camera pans back to reveal the Stature of liberty all-but-buried in the sand of a desolate shore; he and his crew mates have come back to the planet of the apes--and find it is Earth. Franklin Schaeffner directed this remarkable sci-fi work.The script from a thin Pierre Boulle novel was written by Michael Wilson and Serling. The cinematography by Leon Shamroy, the ape makeup designed by John Chambers and the costumes by Morton Haack are very-well realized; the art direction by William Creber and Jack Martin Smith with set decorations by Norman Rocket and Walter M. Scott are classically good. Jerry Goldsmith supplied the sensationally eerie music. In the surprisingly small cast are Charlton Heston quite good the acerbic Taylor, Kim Hunter as Zira, Roddy MacDowall as Cornelius, Maurice Evans toweringly fine as Dr. Zaius, and such luminaries as James Whitmore, Woodrow Parfrey, Wright King and James Daly as leaders of the apes. Sci-fi movie makers have seldom been given so much to work with. But all people remember about the film are the ending, the apes and the attempt by Taylor to talk without success for a long while. This is however not just another pseudo-religious anti-individualist "rocket takes off and crashes back to Earth movie"; It has a luminously-intelligent way of dealing with what ought to be human and what is not. Its writers give the negative human qualities they think are less-than-human to the apes; and introduced a rational man among them--Taylor...And this makes all the difference. The film was given three sequels, and it became a one-season brilliant television show. But as an allegory for the position of the man who thinks for himself in an empire of postmodernist public-dictator and unselfish-obedient minds operating by appearances and prejudices, it has seldom been equaled, never yet surpassed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. . . Charlton Heston, MOSES piloting a spacecraft! Amazing. Seeing this movie when it was in theaters in 1968 was a real treat! What memories! Seeing astronauts being suddenly thrust into racial turmoil was a real experience in 1968, particularly after seeing them launched into space many times during the Apollo era. I was eight, but was awestruck at the gall and nerve it took to show such reversal of bigotry circa 1968, the year of the MLK assassination. Having apes kill humans for SPORT was a bold step at that time. Today, that mindset is quite different. That aside, this movie was incredibly enjoyable then, and still is today. Only Rod Serling and Pierre Boulee could've come up with such a story, particularly the ending. It was pure "Twilight Zone"! The new version by Tim Burton is contrived and uninteresting. Kris Kristofferson (like in the 'Mad' Magazine satire) seems to have showed up on the set in ragged clothing and was used for any scenes which required old, crusty-looking weirdos. On the other hand, Mark Wahlberg is quite possibly the worst actor in the history of motion pictures. His idea of acting is keeping one eyebrow "up". What skill! Anyway, the original is MUCH better and much more contemplative. The sequel (Return to the POTA) is lame, but the third (Escape from the POTA) is great and is a true film of the 1970's, all the way down to the musical score with its wah-wahs, etc.Bloopers! Take a quick look at the NASA patches on the astronauts' space suits. They spell ANSA!Also, an ape sprays water on Heston's character 'Taylor'. The ape screams "Shut UP you freak!" Amazing how the apes have brass hose fittings, but they have to carve stairs out of solid stone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant in all aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard of the Planet of the Apes franchise but I had never seen any of the films. So when I picked up this DVD I had no idea what to expect. I was blown away. This film was brilliant in all aspects. First and foremost the story is set up so that the the suspense doesn't let up, at all, for the entire film. Thankfully, since no one had spoiled it for me, the ending retained all its intended shock value. And throughout the film there is a sense of discovery and adventure that is rarely ever seen, at least to such a degree. Along the way, important themes are explored such as ethics and religious and scientific explanations for the nature of all creation. What can be said about Charlton Heston that hasn't already been said? This film belongs with The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur as the best in his pantheon. It's sad that certain liberals attack him for his vocal participation in the NRA. The supporting cast is superb as well, though they are of course unrecognizable under their makeup. Linda Harrison who plays the love interest is also very easy on the eyes. The sets, special effects, costumes and makeup (which won an honorary Oscar) are all top notch and hold up perfectly today. I should also mention the beauty of the location photography. The natural landscapes are spectacular. This film is perfect in all aspects. Hopefully the other films in the franchise are as good as the original. Regardless the original deserves a perfect score, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been curious to see the original Planet Of The Apes since 2001, when I saw Tim Burton's remake. With time I'd begun to feel that the 2001 remake had got everything right with the sole exception of the story (not that this is unique to said remake). Some comments I have heard, however, lead me to believe that neither film captures the spirit of the novel.In 1968, however, Planet Of The Apes was among the few films that dared to speculate about the future of our world. Just over a decade later, it was a big trend to describe the future state of our society as bleak and miserable. Usually, this was accomplished by showing the world in perpetual night or with horrible pollution. Gattaca, for all its rubbish about the supposed evils of genetic engineering, reversed the trend by almost always having the lights on and showing a world that was eerily clean. Too clean, some would say, for humans to live on. But Planet Of The Apes could be credited with being where it all started.Yet for all the story elements that were well done in the original, there seemed to be something really missing. Maybe it was just the overblown state of the anti-war message in the film, or the fact that the formerly abused have become the abusers being delivered with such vulgarity that it utterly destroys one's faith in both human and simian nature. It's impossible to even root for the bad guy in this film because the bad guys (the Apes) are only slightly more likeable than the so-called good guys (the humans). At least this element was corrected in the remake - the line between the bad and the good is drawn so boldly in the remake that people who miss it should require a white cane and a guide dog.The idea that humans somehow lost the ability to speak during the thousand or so years Taylor was away is laughable. Speech is a near-instinct that parents instil in their children during the first year or two of the children's lives. Sure, the language might descend into a more Orc-like manner, but it is a skill that never goes away completely. Hell, this one point could have been used to highlight the fact that nobody ever spoke the way Shakespeare claimed they did, a notion that both films have missed.Portraying Taylor's malcontent with the world he left behind, however, was a stroke of genius. He is disillusioned with where the human race was when he left, and to watch his dream of there being something better out there being shattered when he comes back is great storytelling. It is a pattern that has been demonstrated over and over again within our society during the past hundred years - the abused become the abusers when left on their own without sufficient guidance. Ask the people of Cambodia, Israel, or what used to be the USSR if you don't believe it. So it stands to reason that apes would treat humans in a rather nasty manner after hundreds of years of being vivisected, drugged, and heaven knows what else. It is a part of human nature, and I suspect, since our DNA is almost identical, that it is a part of simian nature, too.In the end, however, the one fatal flaw with Planet Of The Apes circa 1968 is its pacing. Modern directors will tell you all the time that exposition stops a film dead in its tracks, and films that rely on it to a heavy extent, such as Hollow Man or the current Lord Of The Rings trilogy, deliberately break the exposition up as much as they can with displays of violence or intensely graphic special effects. The idea of this is so that the audience won't notice that their butts are going to sleep in the cramped cinema seats. The first half-hour of Planet Of The Apes, unfortunately, had me turning to a relative and asking if there is anything other than men walking around in the film. Things pick up slightly after that, with some interesting chase sequences that detail how Taylor comes to be in ape custody and how he tries to get out, but the whole thing goes at such a languid pace that the hundred and eleven minutes of the film becomes a case of clockwatching. A slow and languid pace actually helps some films, Michael Mann's Heat for example, but they have to have enough interesting story to tell in order to make it work. Planet Of The Apes doesn't have this, or rather, it doesn't translate the novel well enough for it to work.It's not that Planet Of The Apes circa 1968 is a bad film, and in spite of the fact that I haven't really "liked" anything I have seen Charlton Heston in (excepting True Lies and this film), it can be commended for having honourable intentions. It is just that after all the remarks I have heard about its brilliance, it just doesn't measure up as such a great film. If I were judging it on story alone, it would get a nine out of ten from me, but the pacing, special effects, make-up, and generally dated feel of the film bring that back down to about a six out of ten. Which is still more than what I would give a lot of other "great" films from this era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So over-the-top and genuinely entertaining that, had you taken out Charlton Heston's hammy acting and the overblown zoom-ins, it would have fallen flat and lost its cult appeal. The script is quite decent, and gently beats the audience's collective head into thinking about issues like race and class, religion and science.Without dwelling on Nova, the movie is good to look at: the ape make-up looks good even by today's standards; the dizzying crash sequence at the beginning is alright, and the presence of various artifacts from contemporary Earth (including a certain New York landmark made famous in numerous parodies from Spaceballs to The Simpsons) heightening the impact of the story's message.Though also released in 1968 and featuring hibernation in space travel, anthropomorphic apes, high-speed traveling shots of a desolate wasteland, numerous zooms, and an American astronaut seemingly traveling to a far and distant place only to find himself back home and substantially changed, this movie is nowhere near the accomplishment of cinematic genius Stanley Kubrick's (insert oft-used superlative here) 2001: A Space Odyssey. The similarities with "Apes" and what I consider to be a perfect work of art are there; my opinion is just that, but I would suggest that if you've only seen "Apes," please watch 2001. And to those "art-film" lovers who only watch "serious" pictures, get your pretentious selves off your high horse and give Planet of the Apes a viddy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Sided With the Monkeys...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flick was one of the most enjoyable pieces of schlock I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Monkies, time travel, and Charlton Heston's ass! He dines on the scenery with gusto; arching his brows, rolling his neck, raising his lip in a perpetual sneer-Heston is contemptuous of everyone in the film-be it simian turnkey or fellow astronaut. Roddy McDowell holds up his end as well. Being that he plays a "scientist", he is constantly making discoveries-nose a'twitching, head cocked, paws a fluttering. Mac-D just can't seem to help himself. Heston has less of a defense. Sure the dialogue is sub-human-note Chaz' scene with the gorgeous Nova, his mute yet firey mate. (Did it strike anyone else that she had quite a good smile for a primative hunter/gatherer?)The screenwriter offers his own opinion of the acting prowess of El President (of just the NRA, thank god) by having him shot in the throat by the Ape harriers, thus we are spared the ravings for at least twenty minutes. But while his deprived of speech, Heston continues his struggle for freedom-and on this, I gotta side with the apes. They try to pacify- the offering of Nova, clean straw, a nice bracing shower-courtesy of a fire hose-the best the could offer. But the ingrate keeps attacking his hosts. No wonder the tribunal thought he was a menace: as soon as Charlie is allowed out of his cage, he is wrapping his mitts around some monkey's throat. What would you do with such a savage? I would probably have him stuffed and placed in the national museum with big white marbles in his eyes so he looked like the picture of Homer on your tenth grade copy of the Iliad. I swear, Kim Hunter was really scared at times-she wanted no part of this madman, this sunburned with the John the Baptist look in his eye... But is precisely this ranting, the ceasless mugging that make the film so good, well fun at least Why watch a man say "release me, Ape" when the full when we can hear Chuck spit "Get your filthy paws off me, you damn dirty ape!" (I hope that is close to a verbatim quote). It gives us pride in our species-one man, armed with only his hyperinflated sense of importance (and a cool futuristic ape-gun that seems to only shoot richoceting bullets) can confound the entire ape inteligentsia and escape into the forbidden zone (roughly New Jersey)with his hottie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant art direction outshines acting performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The human mind can scarcely imagine a spaceship travelling at the speed of light, but in the "Planet of the Apes" it is set on "Automatic" and "Full speed ahead". What is more incredible is that they make a soft landing in a lake on a distant planet and (Would you believe it?) the atmosphere is just right for human life. The imaginative script introduces us to what seems a deserted planet at first, but soon we see figures scrurrying around the rocky landscape. The figures turn out to be apes and none too friendly. our three adventurers soon finding themselves imprisoned in sturdy cages. It's a very original approach that men and apes change places, the apes being the masters of the situation and the men living the lives of caged animals. It's interesting too that the apes have developed a judiciary system similar to the one we know. Our heroes have little chance in court and plan to make their escape from the cages. The story concerns mainly the escape and subsequent chase. I would like to be able to say how very exciting all this action is, but regrettably it fails to move me due mainly I think to the poor acting. The make-up, movement and general presentation is 100% effective, with Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter who show some sympathy towards the humans giving believable performances. This is not Charlton Heston's best film. Perhaps the biblical films suit his style of acting better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absolutely wonderful, much better than the uninspired Tim Burton re-imagining(that saddened me as I like Burton, well his early movies anyway). This though is the real deal, much better told in terms of story, and the script is clever and sly. Planet of the Apes certainly looks good, the special effects and cinematography are excellent for their time, and the ape make up is simply marvellous. And of course the twist ending still delights(and shocks). And I think the acting is good, with Charlton Heston appropriately square jawed in one of his more interesting film roles and as the apes Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter really do shine. The direction is engaging and focused as well, and the score is terrific. The film may start a little slow, but that is nothing compared to how pedestrian the whole of the 2001 film was. Overall, simply brilliant. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes (1968)This is like 2001: A Space Odyssey backwards. Same year, same premise, different results.And no matter how much you like the slicker effects of the remake, there is something just right here about the characters and plot and even the special effects, crude as they are. It's not a convincing movie, but it's a great one, a children's story in its elegance, and an eternal myth in its infancy, somehow.Yes, it's crude. I don't mean just the suits and space ship and architecture (which is meant to be crude, by the way). But the moralizing, the parallel philosophy and science of these apes to our own, with things wonderfully backwards enough to throw doubt on our doubts.Charlton Heston? A convincing cardboard hero. Flat as cardboard, but beefy and determined and stoic in that American way he is actually pretty famous for. He gets to shoot a few higher beings, he gets to have woman who doesn't talk back, and he doesn't burn in the sun. Not bad! And really, that's just what we want, a live version of a comic book hero in a make believe land.Except it isn't make believe at all. The last scene I have etched in my ten year old brain (I'm not ten now, but admit I was in 1968) and it gave me goosebumps again. Mind blowing then, amazingly simple and clever now. Is there more to this movie than this huge, stark, beautiful allegory? Why should there be? Watch it and be surprised. Or rewatch it...and be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those damned dirty apes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extraordinarily popular sci-fi adventure based on Pierre Boulle's book, itself followed by numerous sequels, a television spin-off, and a remake in 2001. Astronaut Charlton Heston is caught in a time-warp and returns to Earth far in the future, where intelligent apes are now the superior race. Quite gripping, despite a generally downbeat tone and a wayward adaptation by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling. Heston's clenched jaw serves him well here, and Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans (unrecognizable except for their voices) are each fabulous. Followed in 1970 by the overreaching "Beneath the Planet of the Apes", in 1971 by "Escape From the Planet of the Apes", in 1972 by "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes", and finally "Battle For the Planet of the Apes" in 1973. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Statue of Liberty is one tough lady!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat dated and dumb. The sets,costumes, and make up aren't even state of the art for 1968. In the same year, Kubrick's "2001" had actors playing apes more convincingly, and "Barbarella" had more interesting sets. Some of the exterior sets in "Planet of the Apes" looked like they were influenced by the "Flinstones".A clever premise has not been developed with interesting or convincing details. The script is uneven ,contains inconsistencies, and lacks a strong conflict and point of view. And except for Kim Hunter, you don't necessarily care about the characters. Heston seems a bit long in the tooth to be an astronaut. And these astronauts of the future are none too bright. Wouldn't Heston and crew have looked at the sun, the atmosphere, and the topography, and realized that they were back on earth? Can you say Utah? And wouldn't they have guarded their only possessions (clothes and backpacks) more carefully? I'm assuming their backpakcks contained something necessary and useful for their survival and protection.And it's never made clear what the apes plan to do with the humans. Why don't they lobotomize Heston as they did "Landon"? Why shoot Heston, and then nurse him back to health? Especially since he represents a truth the elders want to suppress. And in this ape society, who's in charge? The apes seem brutal at first, and then benign, like Disney characters. And is there a munitions factory somewhere on this planet? Where do they get their guns and amunition? And could the Statue of Liberty remain intact after the destruction of the world?Franklin Schaffner uses space and geography imaginatively. Some of the situations are interesting, and the dialogue is sometimes clever and witty. The film begins slowly, and too much time is wasted on scenes of the apes refusing to acknowledge or deal with the obvious;that Taylor is an intelligent being. Overall, it's reasonably entertaining and worth a look. Not a film that can stand repeated viewings or scrutiny. If you like "Planet of the Apes", try John Boorman's "Zardoz"(1974) which is weirder, more imaginative, and intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Astronauts fly through space at a speed fast enough for significant time dilation to happen, so time for them is much slower compared to time for other things. They land on a planet that turns out to be ruled by talking human-like apes. Human-like animals are hunted and studied by them. There are four astronauts. One dies on the ship, one is killed in an attack, and one has part of his brain cut out. The other meets one of the human like animals and they both leave with the help of friendly chimpanzee-like apes. On the beach, the astronaut sees the Statue of Liberty, revealing that the planet is Earth. There are some things that don't seem realistic in the movie. How did they end up back on Earth? Why didn't Taylor seem to think it was strange that the apes were speaking English? Any catastrophe big enough to change the landscape like that would have obliterated the Statue of Liberty. But the movie is very interesting.</fullReview>

I love how the director made the reactions of the apes to us humans speaking so "HOLY #############!!!!!!!!" like. I mean I and everyone would have the same reaction to a gorilla or a chimp or a baboon speaking. I didn't think the zookeepers when capturing a human would be so brutal and hard. I depicted that as what a hunter would do. But it is all right. ANYMOO!!! I'll just go through the greatness of the movie. I recommend to not just people that love science fiction but also to those who have animal domination thoughts. It doesn't almost have any visuals and has perfect costume design(But 2001's(THE MOVIE) apes were way more realistic). A few laughs and apes are as brutal to humans as humans are brutal to apes. Cool spaceship and perfect set for an ape land. I mean apes live in the savanna right(Right(RIGHT)). It was also very realistic the idea of different ape species having different occupations but I would depict chimps more as the warriors(Chimps are actually responsible for canibalism) and orangutangs as the scientists and smart guys.I rate this this movie 4/5 stars for creativity and no need for visual FX.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie for the first time, having seen the more recent "Rise of" and "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" films. I knew the basic gist of the movie, but there was quite a bit about the plot that I was unaware of.The thing that struck me most about this movie is that it's such a well made film for the early 70's. I won't go so far as to say that it's one of my favorite movies, and there certainly was a hokey feel to the picture--the apes look strange and much about the movie has a cheesy vibe to it. However, no sooner that I say that, I have to admit that it is refreshing in its approach. What modern movies would do with special effects, this movie does with a set and creative cinematography (I'm thinking especially of the opening scenes now). The film also is a great example of how a compelling narrative can be told without being overly complex. There are many details about the movie that are left up to the viewer to figure out--and indeed, the climax of the movie, and its most important detail of all, is not revealed until the final scene of the film. That scene is iconic and clever, and while I'd seen a clip of it at some point, seeing the entire film certainly adds to its poignancy.All in all I'm giving this movie 7/10 stars. It was well done and well made, and a film that I don't regret having watched at all--but not necessarily one I want to see over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening of The Planet of the Apes is strongly reminiscent of another sci-fi masterpiece from the same year, 2001: A Space Odyssey. The interiors of the human spacecraft are sleek by design and quiet; the stars outside drift by slowly before hyperspace is entered. Kubrick also made space travel slow, almost agonisingly so, as the spacecraft danced in rhythm to his score. And then in the same vein, as the vehicle nears impact, the camera dives into the earth, speeding over hills and lakes and spinning around chaotically. Goldsmith's soundtrack evokes a sense of alienation within the familiar surroundings; frantic harp glissandos as their technology plummets from the skies like a fallen angel, and sharp, high-pitched hisses that double as both the breaching of the craft's doors and the discovery of the death of one of the Astronauts. Nature is reclaiming what it is owed.The remaining three are hurtled back through the evolutionary timeline, sporting scraggly beards and forced to row along the river like savages. The early beginnings of the film are a masterclass in establishing atmosphere and setting. Water and dirt are made alien in the spectacular photography, wide shots presenting the desolate plains and undisturbed lake like some sort of twisted western. They wander through countless jagged mountain ranges; perhaps one of them was once Rushmore, bearing the faces of the presidents long vanished. And when they discover a waterfall and its oasis, they shriek happily and strip and dive in like...well, animals.The symbolic nature of the film emerges in two fronts. The crude caste system that discriminates based on species and colour attacked racism in a tumultuous social arena just two years shy of the Civil Rights Act, but in doing so somewhat re-emphasises the battle as merely skin-deep. The source of this system is never fully explained beyond a vague reference to their gospels and as a result prevents the message from being truly explored. The second front manifests as a condemnation on the what originally was the church's opposition to Darwinism. The elders are dismissive of such notions that man could ever write or show signs of intelligence even with the evidence right in front of their eyes. The screenplay employs a clever if not obvious reversal; Taylor shrieks at being handled by "dirty apes", and then later is afforded the same sub-human treatment. The church won't have it, of course; they remain willfully ignorant and even deliberately act to bury the truth. While its social messages are perhaps misguided and a tad heavy handed, Planet of the Apes emerged as a sci-fi classic because of the enduring appeal of its images. The framing and compositions elicit a fear and imagination far beyond what any conventional thriller could present; a pale hand snatching a pile of clothes, ominous, X-shaped 'scarecrows' perched high on the hills, and of course the brilliant triumph of the final twist ending. Most know it by now, but it does not lose its impact. Just a brief hint of an aged, derelict structure ravaged by time, and then the heart-stopping final zoom out, and merely the waves lapping on quietly, getting on with its job. No doubt time would have stepped in had the humans not finished themselves off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched both Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes and Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes recently I decided to re-watch this original version and see how it actually stacks up against the more 'modern' equivalents of the story. On the whole I have to say I was very impressed with it and I can easily see why a lot of people enjoyed it...In many ways this version of TPOTA is just a straight-forward adventure film albeit with possible subtexts about the old adage of 'all things being created equal'. The reversal here whereby apes are more intelligent than humans does make the film both amusing and interesting throughout its running time. I did find it quite funny to watch a film that seemed to go to town in making man seem really stupid (in this case Charlton Heston is made to appear to be as dumb as all the other humans when in actuality he can't speak because his vocal chords were damaged when he was attacked). Although it's clearly a fantasy film I did like the way that the film did address the issue of whether Charlton Heston's character should or could be considered as being an equal to the apes - this made it feel as though the writers had put both care and thought into the film and made it both satisfying as an adventure film and as a social critique on society (albeit in a fantasy setting).It's clear when watching this film in 2016 that it does look a little dated now and it certainly isn't as pretty to look at as later films. However, it is still satisfying in almost every other area. It is well-paced, it offers a fairly interesting exploration between humans and apes. The end of the film seemed a bit strange at first and the way I looked at it was that although Taylor was able to prove that man existed before apes it's very much suggested that the apes may have got the last laugh. An interesting shall we say open-ended conclusion to a very enjoyable film.Complaints I have with the film are few and far between and the only aspect of the film that probably could have been improved upon were parts of the narrative; we're not really given much information about the planet that the astronauts arrive on and we're not afforded a great deal of information about the way that humans and apes have evolved on this planet. In some ways this makes TPOTA a difficult film to make an emotional invest in and it's fortunate really that it is very strong in every other area.Many people regard this film as a classic and now that I've seen it again I can fully understand why it's regarding with such esteem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charlton Heston Movie That Remains Relevant Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late movie critic Roger Ebert stated that there are three films by Charlton Heston that would be seen by everyone. They are namely: The Ten Commandments,Ben Hur and The Planet Of The Apes. The first two were definitely great epics. But make no mistake about it. The third is obviously a classic. The Mark Wahlberg remake in 2001 only cemented its status.The Planet Of The Apes is a science fiction film that stars Heston together with Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison.The screenplay based on the French novel La Plan?te des Singes by Pierre Boulle.It tells a story of a group of astronauts led by Taylor whose spacecraft crash-land on a strange planet in the distant future.The crew thought of it as a desolate planet but later find themselves in a society of apes that have evolved and have developed human-like qualities.They witness the changes the have occurred as these apes have started to possess attributes similar to humans particularly culture and intelligence.Also,it was worth noticing that the apes have seen humans as lower-level creatures who are wearing animal skin.Taylor tried to know what has happened to humanity.The result was that of despair and anger when he saw the remains of the Statue of Liberty at the beach.It was definitely a film that has stood the test of time especially when it dealt with many issues that the world were facing during the time the film was made such as nuclear war,the environment and slavery.Charlton Heston provides us a great performance as Taylor as he depicted the role of an anti-hero extremely well.The issues that the world was facing in the 60's remains relevant while this review is being written at present so the viewer watching this film will surely appreciate the message it wants to convey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of something interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Planet of the Apes is a strange movie when you think about it. Based on a French novel La Plan?te des Singes by Pierre Boulle, its plot is ludicrous. A spaceship crashes onto a planet where the surviving crew quickly finds out that the planet is populated and controlled by different kinds of apes, who hold as their slaves a population that looks remarkably like humans. Well... okay, that's kind of forceful with its symbolism and undertone, but okay.To be fair, the film is actually pretty good with its themes and messages. Humans as slaves to a supposedly inferior lifeform is a theme we've seen before, but the film takes its time exploring the idea and its implications. The simian culture is also a fascinating one with heavy undercurrent of religious tyranny, strict cast system and conservative disdain for change. The movie is not really even an action film, or even an adventure one. Conversations take up much of the screen time, and they're good conversations at that. But that's actually fairly normal for a certain type of science fiction.The various characters are also great and it's nice that they showed the apes as people as well, just as capable for good and evil as we are. There are good, sympathetic apes, there are tyrants and then there are those that are neither.The cosmetics are also phenomenal, especially for their time. The ape mask are a little rubbery, but remarkably less so than I would have thought. I can see emotions on their faces almost as easily as I could on humans faces, making them much easier to identify with. The designs are also evocative and all apes are given clear identities. It also helps that their voices are done by some fantastic actors.Charlton Heston is also very good in the leading role and his blight and struggle carry the whole film. One of the great scifi heroes, a gruff survivor exterior hiding a sharp intellect.All in all Planet of the Apes is definitely worth a watch for pretty much everyone. It's intelligent, evocative, exciting and all around thought-provoking, with some great twists in the plot that are sure to keep you interested.</fullReview>

And to our superlative spurious superfluous species: naught.There are philosophical arguments...there are ways of bulldozing the people into a defensive mode and there also skeptics ploys and analysis by plays...republican nightmares hyperbole and concrete examples...alleged criminal acts torts and mysteries . Planet of the Apes has all this and lots if realized suspense .

		<fullReview>I just saw this for the first time. I have already seen the remakes and lots of parodies and references to it over the years, so I was confident that the story was mostly spoiled to me. But this movie is much more than the twist! The character of Dr. Zaius turns out the be the most interesting character, after you understand his motives.The locations shot at were really beautiful, and the opening was in that regard great. But the camera-work in this movie is a bit... odd. I'm sure they were going for something. Maybe trying something new? Or making you feel more into the situations? All it ends up doing is making it look like a movie shot by kids experimenting with a camera (or, sorry about this, monkeying around).The make-up was impressive too, even though it was clearly limiting the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently the original novel that the film is based on is not very good. Rod Serling and Michael Wilson has fashioned the story to turn it into an allegory as well as a satire on race relations and religion. It also has a pointed anti nuclear strand which has a big impact in its twist ending.I first watched this film as a kid and only watched the last few minutes of the film where the film ends at the beach with Charlton Heston in shock and dismay.Heston is Taylor a misanthropic astronaut in a four person crew on a long term space mission to deep space that crash lands in what seems a deserted planet. Given that they will never return to earth and may have to breed among themselves, its never explains why there were three males and one female!Because of cloud cover they have difficulties in tracking their whereabouts in space and soon run into They run into other humans who seem to be hunter and gatherers and unable to speak. However they are attacked by apes on horseback and they do speak and speak English.The humans are treated like animals in a zoo and Taylor is captured but as he suffered a throat injury he is unable to speak at first. However a female ape who is a zoologist and her fiancé are intrigued by him and then shocked when he speaks. However he is also seen as a threat to other apes who have reason to be wary of humans and the answer to this mystery lies in the forbidden zone.The movie raises a lot of points. Ranging from how we treat animals to race relations in the USA at the time and the reverence to sacred scriptures. Taylor being able to talk and think is against what the apes have been taught.The film still has a power to provoke and entertain. Heston who in several films played 'the last man on earth' does come across as rather fruity in his acting. I think it would had been better if he was more humanised here. Its Roddy McDowell as Cornelius and Kim Hunter as Zira who play the apes who come across as more human.There is some good location shooting in remote parts of Utah but the production design in the studio now looks cheap and basic, almost like an episode of Star Trek.The film spawned several sequels which were inferior and a 2001 remake that was misjudged. There have been several better prequels but the original film is still the master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Sci-fi with Great Underlying Meanings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is really a shame that movies often parody the iconic ending of this film because it takes away the shock factor from the conclusion of the film. I think that iconic ending is even portrayed on some DVD covers/posters.While the ending is easily the strongest aspect of the film, there are other great aspects throughout as well. There is clear commentary on race and social structure as the gorillas, the apes with the darkest skin tone, are at the bottom of the social pyramid while orangutans - the lightest-toned apes - compose the class of doctors/intellectuals.I personally think this movie is similar to Inherit the Wind in a way since when Heston's character is on "trial" the orangutans refuse to hear evidence that suggests man is an intelligent being. It is almost like they are rejecting the possibility that the apes may have evolved from man, just as in Inherit the Wind the judge and prosecutor reject the possibility of evolution while they consider the Bible and the story of creation as a truth rather than a belief. We realize it is BS to reject these possibilities when Heston's character points out that surely an ape would not make a doll of a human girl that could talk; surely man was intelligent on this planet at one point or another.The orangutans' trying to suppress the truth in this film connects to the possibility that our government keeps certain truths hidden from us, and like we believe to be the case in reality, the orangutans are successful at suppressing the truth; what a disappointing reality.Unfortunately the way the film looks makes it feel like a "B" movie when it clearly has "A" material. While the make-up is very impressive, it is excess at points since the ape lips do not match with the words that come out of their mouths. Also, there is some really corny dialogue in this movie, such as "well, you know what they say: human see, human do." ...Really? But I guess this is redeemed with "Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"This is a film with "A" status that could have achieved perfection with just a few tweaks in its style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic Film Is Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must disagree with those who acclaim this film as one of the greatest ever. The story is interesting and contains a final twist that would be dramatic if only it were not undermined by geography. Productions values are, in many ways, amateurish. This was probably due to budget constraints, but they show.And let's talk about the script. The dialogue is so unbelievable that the actors cannot voice it convincingly. The faux fights convey no passion or realistic conflict. Bottom line: Charlton Heston's character (Taylor) is not believable. And most of the others are likewise shallow. On the other hand, the film makes an important statement about separation of church and state.The makeup is the best part of the film and it deserves to be recognized.There are two aspects of the film that really drag it down for me. In one scene, Taylor runs through a natural history museum where there are small dioramas of human life. There are people posing as mannequins and it is so obvious, it is ridiculous. It is cheaper to pose people than mannequins, I suppose. The second aspect is the silly "speak no evil" tableau during the trial, for which I am downgrading my vote by one. In film, restraint is the better part of artistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>though meant to be loosely based on the 1963 novel by Pierre Boulee'it goes astray as we see in documentations there was an original Planet of the apes in the works with both Charlton Heston &amp; Edward G. Robinson. But not only did Robinson die before it could be completed but then the producers decided instead to make it more primitive than the way from the novel as well as the original plan for the movie as told on the Bravo Special.Everyone's taken away right from the beginning as I am from aboard the ship.Then the astronauts upon landing not only find that their lady astronaut companion of Stuart has aged to death but they do think that they've found paradise until a battalion of gorillas find their clothes in the bushes &amp; then clip them to near shreds.We'll see that Taylor's other 2 astronaut partners each meet mishaps one ends up dead in the museum &amp; the other with a lobotomy &amp; Taylor yells "You dirty baboons!".What takes most of us away is when Taylor upon being netted yells his famous quote to Zira "Take your stinking paws off of me you damned dirty ape!"Taylor is seen before the council &amp; later Zira arranges for her nephew Lucius to rescue Taylor of whom insists on taking Nova with him. After Taylor ties Zaius up He asks Zira "Do you mind if I do?" She then says "Yes but you're so damned ugly." &amp; get's him back for what he had said to her earlier.Then upon leaving warns that he's handy with the gun &amp; he then agrees with him afterwords he then say's untie me." They find a doll &amp; want to hide it &amp; blow up that with the other evidence of Human's past domination.After Taylor leaves &amp; only for Taylor to find the Statue of Liberty as well and then saying "Damn you all to hell!"Check out the Zpota website of Damn the continuity all to Hell! because that's just about all it comes to as well.

		<fullReview>The name of this franchise is now unfortunately stained after a few unnecessary sequels and a Tim Burton reboot. Fortunately, with the recent release of the excellent films Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the name of the franchise is starting to shine again.But some people forget the long-running franchise started back in 1968, a great year for science fiction with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes. The original film, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starring Charlton Heston. The plot is basically a group of astronauts go into hibernation in their spaceship traveling near the speed of light, until they wake up years later in an unknown planet, run by intelligent apes, which treat humans as inferior animals.I'll just start off by saying Charlton Heston is absolutely brilliant in the role, he steals every scene he's in. Watching this movie after over 45 years it came out I am pleasantly surprised to see the effects still look pretty good. I honestly have almost no complaints with Planet of the Apes, the acting is solid, the directing is pretty good and the costume design is amazing.The only minor complaints I have are the pacing may feel a bit slow at times, but that's it, and it really is minor.But story-wise, Planet of the Apes is brilliant. Now, I won't spoil anything in this review, but the widely known twist ending at the ending of the movie is one of the greatest twists in the history of cinema. As a first time viewer, not knowing anything about the movie, it's really necessary to allow that ending to sink in.Planet of the Apes is a landmark of science fiction cinema, not only a great movie, but an important one, a thought provoking masterpiece that raises important questions still relevant today. Are we headed in the right direction as a human race?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're monkeys. Monkeys on horseback.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The legendary monkey world classic, this more than stands up to the test of time. Charlton 'cold, dead hands' Heston plays George Taylor, an astronaut, part of a team placed in cryogenic suspension for exploratory purposes. When they are awoken, the ship is in distress and crash lands on an unknown planet. The survivors struggle from the craft before it sinks beneath the ocean waves and find themselves on a desolate world, barren, apparently lifeless. Lifeless, that is, until they encounter a primitive race, somewhat similar to humans, though without the gift of language. Suddenly, they are attacked by soldiers on horseback. Soldiers that are, quite literally, apes. Heston is taken prisoner and, from there, it is all about his attempts to convince the monkey overlords of the world that he is not merely a beast, but a thinking, sentient creature, deserving of both freedom and respect. Inevitably, those in charge take some convincing, eager as they are to maintain the status quo and reluctant as they are to acknowledge that humans can be thought of as anything but dumb animals.Considering that this movie is now more than forty years old, the visuals have to be seen to be believed. The simian suits and masks are a revelation, being mobile and full of expression, and even the spacecraft in the ocean and THAT final scene is breathtaking. Sumptuously directed, with real flair, this only drops a mark due to the loss of momentum as the dialogue does become slightly repetitive as the message of the movie is slammed home.A genuine sci-fi classic, with one of the most iconic endings going, this is essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is easy to make a sci-fi movie with the advanced technology we have today, but to make a movie like this one without it is a real achievement. This is a movie that I have seen many times, and I never tire of it. It has so much to think about in the dialog that to not have it in your consciousness shows a severe lack of movie knowledge.This film illustrates the lengths to which the religious right will go to deny scientific truth. They, like the apes, refuse to accept any evidence contrary to their hardened minds and dismiss it as hogwash.They will go to their graves without understanding the magnificence of this world, dreaming of some fantasy land to sooth their ignorance.This was a perfect role for Charlton Heston. His manner shows through in his characterization and makes the film. Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall, and newcomer Linda Harrison all contributed to a classic that is among the best movies of all time.And, the ending never ceases to amaze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This the Perfect Sci-Fi Flick?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many little things wrong with The Planet of the Apes, the cultural and scientific inconsistencies that can drive the critics amongst us ape (sorry, so very sorry!), but why do they matter? Here is the story, based on Pierre Boule's creepy and caustic critique of human bigotry, of a group of astronauts discovering a planet where the highest primates are hairy apes, and although Rod Serling homogenized it and dumbed it down for mass-consumption, Boule's unnerving look at apes being as big a group of jackasses as humans came through.Some folks just hate science fiction. I don't criticize them, but I do recognize that there are people who dislike the trickery of satire, the hidden meanings of parody, and the lack of straightforwardness that so often gums up space operas. That "John Carpenter" of The Day the Earth Stood Still is a Christ-like figure (JC--get it?) trying to warn humanity to make peace with itself before the robot Gort (God's anger) is unleashed is lost on viewers who, when confronted with a "message movie" want Hollywood to follow the advice of a studio exec back in the 40s who said, "If you want to send a message, use Western Union." There are folks who just don't like the genre because, I think, they think that movie makers are trying to mess 'em up. This probably explains why Serling made Boule's book more American, more palatable to the folks who would deliver the majority of the ticket receipts.POTA is so deeply ingrained in our culture that there are more people who recognize the often-quoted lines from Charlton Heston than actually saw the movie. Since all cultural allusions are eventually subject to mistreatment by The Simpsons, folks know "Get your stinkin' paws off me, you . . . " more than the film's darkly clever heart.That it is clever, I assert, is the reason why The Planet of the Apes is, possibly, the perfect Science Fiction adventure. Watching Chimpanzees, Orangatans, and Gorillas mirror groups in our society isn't overly sophisticated, but it is fun, and that's why POTA works so well. We can be poked and prodded, but not wounded by the movie. And, like other great Sci-Fi works, the aspect of adventure trumps the intellectualism. We may giggle at the humanisms spouted by the apes (and for the Creationists in the audience, there's some not-so-subtle digs at the Genesis vs. Darwin argument), but when Heston's George Taylor is tried by a nasty and bigoted tribunal of Orangatans, his arrogant character becomes us, stripped and humiliated by powers out of our control, and he and we start doing a slow burn that will carry the film to its shock-conclusion.There are weak spots in the film--the small scale TV-ishness of many of the settings, and those damned latex appliances that couldn't allow the actors to move their lips while they talked--but Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, and Maurice Evans are obviously having a ball, and this is transmitted very effectively. Throw in Heston, serious and angry, a misanthrope in a land ruled by sapient apes, and the tension is palpable! You want him to escape because he is one of us, and he's surrounded by more of us, regardless of them being in monkey suits.So, satire and action are the order of the day, served up by the creator of The Twilight Zone and Franklin J. Schaffner, the director of another, sillier Heston flick, The War Lord, a few years before. The jokes are labored and the socio-criticism is a bit too obvious, but the pace of the movie, its unfolding of the story, and that Holy Crap! ending make up for the weak spots.Enjoy the best that POTA has to offer and ignore the mistakes. Sci-Fi is an acquired taste, and I have always thought this movie will leave a good taste in one's mouth.</fullReview>

The hunt scene alone, with apes riding horses, carrying guns and killing humans was truly horrifying. The musical score was also unlike anything I had ever heard before and added an additional element of creepiness to the film. Everyone knows the story by now but it was a very good movie at the time. I saw it not long ago, and it has lost some of its edge. While the make up and the entire concept was brilliantly executed back in 1968, it looks a little worse for wear today.

		<shortDescription>The original, and still the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best-remembered for its then-shocking twist ending and John Chamber's pioneering prosthetic make-up, the original PLANET OF THE AOES remains a difficult-to-beat science fiction parable. The film takes the typical "stranger-in-a-strange-land" device that was used and reused in countless previous (and future) sci-fi films, but APES manages to successfully attach a level of social commentary that was largely missing from earlier attempts in this sub-genre. The racism/civil rights comparison is the most obvious metaphor at play, but this is not the only clever subtext of the film. The film drawls plenty of parallels to more generalized themes of desperation, alienation, and the social construction of society, while director Franklin J. Schaffner also makes certain that the film fulfills its various goals as a sci-fi adventure as well.The film is further grounded by Charlton Heston, who lends the film the benefit of his layered theatrics and his undeniable screen presence. Heston's trademark tough-skinned machismo is the perfect match for this larger-than-life film, and he remains on the genre's all-time greatest pulp heroes. No matter how outlandish or preposterous the proposed situation may be, Heston always manages to find the emotional core of the scene and believably relays it to the audience. While I personally feel that Heston became a bit of a sociopath later on in his life, I will always praise his exceptional work in classics like this film and BEN HUR (1959), as well as guilty pleasures favorites like THE OMEGA MAN (1971) and SOYLENT GREEN (1973).The supporting players are also well-cast, with Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter remaining particularly affecting even under all of those ape prosthetics. Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, and James Daly are all appropriately sinister, and Linda Harrison certainly looks good in a non-speaking role. Jerry Goldsmith's then-novel atonal score evokes just the right subtle feelings of primitivism, and the Chamber's aforementioned "ape" make-up is still respectable if not quite awe-inspiring anymore. Though followed by numerous sequels (and even a brief TV series) and latter remade by Tim Burton (in a shockingly unimaginative manner), everyone should do themselves a favor and stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is easily one of the best films from 1968, even if it does have a bit of wonky dialog in the first quarter and some silly monkey jokes (some intentionally funny, some accidentally funny).But does this kill the film? Not at all. It just makes it a bit of a guilty pleasure for some. The film is visually quite good, from the excellent make-up for the apes to their stony rock town to the epic ending which sadly has probably been spoiled for all viewers as it has been engraved into the cultural lexicon. It's a definite piece of Americana at it's best with some classic lines and very memorable characters. If you had too see only one movie that a friend might say "it sounds pretty dumb" from the title alone. This is the one to see. Also, if you find Planet of the Apes to not be as quality fun film as some may say, just try and sit through the unfortunate sequels that followed.</fullReview>

Avoid the remake at all costs.</fullReview>

Then another famous scene, which is about a minute later, is when Taylor and Nova(Linda Harrison) are in their cell and the apes come in and take Nova away and spray Taylor with a hose. Taylor says another famous line: "It's a madhouse!! A madhouse!!!!!!!Two more good scenes are at the end. One is when Taylor and Zira(Hunter)kiss. Zira says Taylor is "so damn ugly". You can see Cornelius(McDowell) get jealous. Then there's the final final scene, where Taylor and Nova see The Statue of Liberty.

		<fullReview>Some Spoilers...Recognize the scriptwriter's name in the credits? Yes, I'm talking about Rod Serling. He created the unfathomable Twilight Zone series, thus changing our public awareness of what irony really means. Here he goes one step better with the detail-laden plot of Planet of the Apes. Unfortunately, too much of the detail is hammered in the mind rather than unconsciously put forth. Subtlety is not in Planet's vocabulary.It's interesting how 20th Century Fox is responsible for three of the so-called greatest science fiction series of all time. This, Star Wars, and Alien. Alien was a mature concept, Star Wars was blatant heroic shenanigans, this is an experiment--much like the one Landon endures.No wonder Tim Burton remade this film, the principal guideline is turning actors into props (apes this time) which Burton does oh-so-often. Cliques and castes are created, but the level of interactivity between them is minimal. The second movie would expand upon that theme. Even funnier is how Charlton Heston is unable to speak half the time, because he can't speak he is no longer our biggest concern. The apes now are our focus...Franklin Schaffner uses a lot of techniques reminiscent of Patton and it's too bad that Goldsmith's usually phenomenal score wasn't able to keep up with the ideas. He creates what is, no more or no less, a feature-length TZ episode whose ending is already ruined by the box art. Shame on the Fox marketing industry!Planet of the Apes, as with the rest in the series, is for historical notice only. It has aged too far and then-current science is now obsolete. The only distinct purpose the film had was to create the bridge between the 50s space opera and disguised horror film (War of the Worlds, The Thing) and bring the public into the smarter here-and-now of 2001.Overall, halfway bright film. Funny how even in science fiction Heston winds up wearing rags. 2.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic SF film coming to DVD again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On February 3, 2004, just five days shy of this classic's 36th anniversary, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment will release on DVD the 35th Anniversary Edition of "Planet of the Apes" (1968). This edition will FINALLY present the film in 16x9 anamorphic widescreen, and hopefully with an improved stereo mix. It will also include a lot of extras, though many have been available on DVD elsewhere for some time, but what is really pleasing is that a Jerry Goldsmith commentary on his score will also be included. Goldsmith's score is a motion picture landmark and has never been out of print on LP, cassette, and CD. It's a dream come true to finally get some Goldsmith commentary on it. The DVD will also feature some twenty minutes of behind-the-scenes footage that the late actor Roddy McDowall, also an avid photographer, shot with a 16mm movie camera during production. All too brief snippets of it were used in the 1998 AMC documentary "Behind the Planet of the Apes." This should be fascinating to APES fans, but of course the enduring elements of a movie that has proved to be a timeless motion picture SF masterpiece will be the main attraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that science fiction films are supposed to do is to be thought provoking, and this film definitely does that on a lot of different levels. On one level it is a cautionary tale about how man is on the verge of destruction and what could happen if we were to push the button. On another level it is a strong look at race relations as we look at the three classes of apes and how the interact not only with one another but with the humans as well. Also, the performances made the film, especially a surprisingly strong one from Charleton Heston. Even though I'm not a big fan of his, I think he did manage to show that when given the right material he can be a great actor. Also, Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans show their abilities even when covered by the spectacular make-up. This film is truly a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't blame me, I voted for Zaius! [POSSIBLE SPOILERS]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLANET OF THE APES is a fundamentally conservative--even reactionary--film, though I'm not sure that even the filmmakers realized it.A basic insight of conservatism is that customs, traditions, and taboos should not be tampered with lightly. Even if they seem silly, or outmoded, or incomprehensible, there are reasons why they exist, and thoughtlessly discarding them is very dangerous.[POSSIBLE SPOILERS]Throughout the movie, Zaius and the church-state authorities are subjected to merciless ridicule for upholding religious traditions and taboos against Cornelius and Zira's newfangled theories. After all, we smugly know that the scientists are right and the priest-rulers are wrong. This is what cons a lot of people into thinking that this is just another self-congratulatory film about how liberals are so much more enlightened than everyone else (these people, of course, are mostly very enlightened liberals who then go on to make fun of Alzheimer's sufferers because they hate Heston so much).But in the end, it turns out that the reactionaries have got it right. APES, in fact, ventures far further right than any modern conservative I know, as it ends by taking the position that the state should suppress certain dangerous truths in the interests of preserving a stable society--or at least giving this position the film's final word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the most entertaining SF movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up on 'Planet Of The Apes'. I can't even remember exactly the first time I saw it, but I would have been less than ten years old. At that time it was one of the most amazing movies I'd ever seen, and had a massive impact on me. Of course many movies that knock you at as a child don't hold your interest when you're older and (hopefully!) wiser, but this movie is still as entertaining now as it was then. Charlton Heston's other big SF movie 'The Omega Man' is now a guilty pleasure. Silly but hugely enjoyable hokum. But 'Planet Of The Apes' is anything but an embarrassment. It really stands up well. The other great SF movie of 1968 was '2001'. '..Apes' isn't in the same intellectual or technical league, but I know which movie is better from a sheer entertainment value. Heston is perfectly cast as the blustery misanthrope Taylor, and the supporting ape cast of Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall, Maurice Evans, Buck Kartalian,etc. are all wonderful. The only really weak link is Linda Harrison as Nova, but she is only really included as eye candy, and on that score she does her job well. This movie has been sequalized to death, badly remade by Tim Burton, parodied countless times, and almost everybody in the world knows the famous shock ending whether they've seen the movie or not, but none of this detracts from the movie itself, which is a bona fide classic, and still one of the most entertaining SF movies ever made! Absolutely essential viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still The Classic Movie Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the "Apes" remake that came out a couple of years ago, but I have to say that the original version of this movie is still by far the better. It's a marvelous mix of well done science fiction, gripping drama and a healthy dose of parody that makes the whole thing a truly engrossing picture to watch. I wouldn't even want to guess how many times I've seen this, and I still am not tired of it.It's not really a film version of the book of the same name by Pierre Boulle. The story is quite different, although the basic elements of the book are found here. The story - if anyone really needs to know - is quite simple. Astronauts from the early 1970's travel through time and land on a mysterious planet that they discover is ruled by apes, and where mute humans are regarded as no better than nuisances and are hunted as animals and used for medical experiments.Charlton Heston plays the astronaut "Taylor," commander of the mission. His character is interesting and also quite tragic. Taylor is a cynic, who leaves earth believing that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. Finally he comes across this world where humans seem to live relatively idyllic and peaceful lives, only to discover that the apes of this world are just as bad as the humans he left behind. All the problems of human society are reflected in this ape society. There's bigotry (orangutans look down their noses at chimpanzees, and gorillas seem to be relegated to the status of soldiers), there's conflict between religion and science with a hearing that vaguely resembles an inquisition, and there's fear of anything new and unknown (ie, Taylor.)Heston was the only one of the human characters who was essential to the story, and his performance was excellent. Otherwise the biggest marks were left by those playing the apes. Roddy McDowell was a fine actor, but will he really be remembered for anything other than "Apes" in its various incarnations? Kim Hunter as Zira was wonderful and Maurice Evans put on a fine performance as Dr. Zaius (Minister of Science and Chief Defender of the Faith, in a wonderful combination of contradictory offices which Taylor points out.)I'll remember this movie always for some wonderful lines:"Human see, human do" (Julius to Zira as Taylor tries unsuccessfully to talk after his throat injury)"Get your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty ape!" (Taylor's first words to the apes after his capture)"Somehow, it makes you look less intelligent." (Cornelius to Taylor after the latter shaves his beard off)"God damn you all to hell!" (Taylor at the end of the movie, as he discovers the dark secret of this strange planet)It's not without flaws. The timeline bothers me. (SPOILER HERE)Only a little over 2,000 years has passed since Taylor left earth, yet in 2,000 years apes have evolved to the point at which they can speak? I thought the evolutionary process was a bit slower than that. And it's ironic (and convenient) that the language they developed was perfect English. (I know that this could be explained by the events of "Escape" and "Conquest" - numbers 3 &amp; 4 in the series - but surely human history in those movies is different than Taylor's history simply because of the arrival of the apes, and therefore we still have the problem of all the apes in installment 1 speaking perfect English.)Oh well, nothing is perfect, but this is close. If you liked the remake, you must watch the original. It's a bit dated, but still holds up.9/10</fullReview>

The original Planet of the Apes brings up so many taboo subjects of human insignificance, I'm surprised the religious right never said anything about this film. Thoughtful and intoxicating, this film really sends a chill down my spine, wondering what will happen to the human race in the years to come. Truly a ground breaking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This reminds me of an extended Twilight Zone episode. It is remarkable to look at. In it's day, the makeup was state of the art. I remember reading an article in Life magazine about the incredible amount of time it took to get the actors ready. Also, the whole premise of an evolutionary inversion is provocative. Chuck Heston is quite good. If you totally suspend science and disbelief, this is entertaining. I like the movie, so I'm not going to dismiss it, but there are things that bother me. Why does everyone speak the same English, despite centuries of syntactic aberrations and other languages. When Heston yells out, "Get you hands off me, you filthy ape," he is understood and then he becomes conversant with Kim Hunter and her associates. Why are the humans considered animals, yet they have the skills to clothe and support themselves. The monkey jokes (actually, I didn't see any monkeys). "Human see, human do." It doesn't wash. Why is the young girl attractive and dressed modestly? Who made her clothes? I guess she's just a sexual object, and you wouldn't want someone covered with dirt and leaves in her hair who doesn't smell too good. I wonder if she belongs to the NRA. I know. It's a satire. Get a sense of humor. But to be good sci fi, there should be some effort made to account for these issues.Still, it's a cute movie. It has a conclusion that explains what happened to the human race (although they are technically still there). I guess I won't ask any more questions. That way I'll feel less disappointed. I saw this film the day it came out. I was younger then and I really got a kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film as anti communist propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Planet of the Apes is Charlton Heston at his most brilliant. While it may at times wear its intentions on its sleeve, the movie is a sharp anti communist/anti hippie allegory, a cautionary tale of what would happen if Old Glory, and ultimately the world, were to fall under the big toe of the Red Menace. When the movie begins, we see man at his apex, engaging in interstellar travel, forging through space with true Capitalist zeal. Heston's character is not sorry to be far from the earth, away from its inhabitants, who clearly sicken him. This no doubt mirrors feelings Charlton had for the left side of the political spectrum in 1968. The spaceship crash lands, and we are quickly introduced into a three tiered pinko society: the orangatans, or the ruling class, which could be looked at as the old guard of the movement (as "communists" and "hippie" are superfluous in Heston's mind) People like Karl Marx, Lenin, Mao, Timothy Leary, Hubert Humphrey. the gorrillas, (or should I spell it guerillas?) are your militants, your revolutionaries. Che Guevera, Abbie Hoffman, Huey P. Newton, all represented by this order. last we have the chimps, the closest in demeanor to humans, although still appearing totally ape. The poseurs of the Planet of the Apes, if you will. Represented by this group are Jane Fonda, Yoko Ono, Bill Walton, each one dispicable for not even having conviction enough to go all way with their twisted commie leanings. Heston, a throat wound rendering him speechless, represents the everyman. Joe Six Pack, who has had his voice silenced by the yahoos covered in hair. He is repulsed by the way his fellow humans are living, like animals, or as the reds say, "communally". Finally,when the apes dare to turn Mr. Middle America's own water cannon back on him and rough up his woman, do we see him break free of their bonds and try to get the hell home in time to smoke an obscenely large cigar, eat a steak, shoot things for awhile, and then give it to his woman good. But what does he find, instead of his house? The Statue of Liberty, half buried in the sand. "You did it, you finally did it!" Heston screamed, meaning of course Joe Namath and his pinko muttonchops let the red army in through the back door.A startling image from a visionary actor. With lots of monkeys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first in a series of popular films that make us look at human nature from an upside down perspective. Did man evolve from apes, or did apes evolve from man. Are human beings really humane? When is insanity really sanity?In a science-fiction setting, we get a parable of late 1960s war protests and nuclear paranoia. Yet, the film has withstood the passage of time and transcends the period in which it was made.Freud, Darwin, and everything else we think of as intellectual signs of human enlightenment get totally trashed here -- both literally and figuratively. This is an interestingly distorted fun-house mirror into which we must look at ourselves. A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ham-fisted metaphors ruin a good idea (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is one of those classic sci-fi movies you assume everyone has seen. In fact, everyone assumes everyone has seen it so they don't mind giving away the ending on the front of the video or on t-shirts or posters or postcards. I hadn't seen it until very recently, so the surprise was ruined completely. Luckily, everything before the ending was so disappointing I didn't care by the time I reached it.Sci-fi can make subtle points about real life, but Apes has so many weak and obvious metaphors that they're barely metaphors at all. On this planet, the evolutionary path of apes and humans has been reversed, so humans are ignorant mutes and monkeys are remarkably intelligent. This set-up allows us to ask questions about ourselves, about our history and morality. If you're out of primary school you would have asked these questions already, and if you're in primary school you could come up with more intelligent answers than this movie provides.The Apes are repressive, shunning scientific research and preferring to stay with their traditional beliefs. Cue references to the Dark Ages and religion's fear of science. Cue monkeys shouting `heresy' every ten minutes. If these `metaphors' are too subtle for you, look out for the director's cut where we see an apple landing on Isaac Apeton's head and a bunch of monkeys in a boat trying to sail off the edge of the world.Charlton Heston plays Hammington Overact, an astronaut who travels to the planet, and it is with his underdog that we're supposed to side. To make sure there's no doubt as to who the bad guys are, the video comes with a wallchart saying `Monkeys bad, humans good'. Study this chart closely, because you may not understand the depths of this movie without it. True, the monkeys keep humans in cages, beat them, shoot them, and are outrageously repressive while the humans seem nice enough but let's pretend like there's some kind of ambiguity.The movie is so clear-cut that it loses any chance of making a serious point. It begins with Hammington criticising humans, saying, `I can't help thinking that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man.' This anti-human rhetoric doesn't last long, even with the `metaphors' firmly in place. It soon cops-out in having a human as the movie's hero and the monkeys' saviour. While it remembers it in time for the ending, it is too little, too late.If you're looking for a movie with the kind of deep philosophy Elmo sings about on Sesame Street, you've found it. Personally, I'll file it with the other over-rated classics and pull the flush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sc-Fi at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the nature of man in relationship to each other? To what extent does religion play a role in our society? How does science and discovery affect religion? These are just a few of the many philosophical questions addressed in this outstanding, ground-breaking adaptation of Pierre Boulle's marvelous book Plant of the Apes. The film is chock full of all kinds of social commentary about mankind through the actions of the apes, creatures very like men in attitudes, customs, and beliefs. A space ship is sent into the distant future and lands unwittingly on a planet ruled by apes. Soon only one astronaut survives, the cynical Taylor played with relish and perfection by Charlton Heston. Heston soon discovers that humans are treated as apes on this planet. He is rounded up like cattle, prodded, and generally mistreated by all concerned except two ape scientists that see that he is special and different. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell play the two friendly Chimps, and even though they are covered with some of the best make-up imaginable, their performances are of the highest caliber. Their facial expressions are very ape-like yet very human. The talking human is brought before an ape tribunal headed by a zealous religious orangutan named Dr. Zaius, whose duty is to protect the law of the Sacred Scrolls. Maurice Evans plays Zaius and is also outstanding in his portrayal. What happens in the rest of the film must be seen to be appreciated. The ending, if you don't know it is coming, will simply blow you away. This is a landmark film!</fullReview>

The soundtrack for this film was incredibly obtrusive and almost made me turn it off.

		<fullReview>This might just be the easiest movie ever to spoof, thanks to Chuck Heston's classic over-acting in a few key scenes, especially the last. The issues it confronts however, like most issues which affected the last half of the 60's, continue to have much relevance today. Science versus religion, youth versus the Establishment, racial bigotry and hatred. I think it's also fair to say that the writers of the movie have left the resolution of these issues in the movie fairly ambiguous, instead of forcing their own views into the movie's plot. Perhaps the biggest reason to NOT watch this movie is that it is filled with so many plot holes. Maybe some of the stuff is explained in the sequels but I'll be damned if I'm gonna watch those. How could Chuck not figure out where he was? The apes spoke ENGLISH for Christ's sake! I still wonder, too, where exactly the human space ship was expected to end up. What, they just sent a ship into the void of space hoping that it would end up on a planet? Although those two just scratch the surface of a deeply-flawed plot, this movie is still worth watching. It is not the experience visually that 2001 is, but for those who don't have the patience for Kubrick's (sometimes) painfully long scenes, try this movie instead.

He never recognizes America's most visited national park, which NO astronaut from ANY country could miss. He doesn't wonder why a 2,000-year-old beard growth is the same as 30 days. He can't put "two and two together:" IF a planet has Earth's breathable atmosphere, a "sun" the exact diameter of Earth's, and gravity equal to Earth's, you're sure as heck back on Earth; NOT on some planet you've never seen before "300 light years away in the Orion Constellation." Nonchalantly dismissing his assumed parallel evolution on BOTH planets from single-cell organisms to English-speaking primates as a "coincidence" rather than proof of his round trip is the height of absurdity. But as soon as he cocks an ape-rifle, Heston's Taylor character returns to a logical footing. Just as "Doonesbury" cartoonist Gary Trudeau proved in the 1980s that Ronald Reagan ran America in the late stages of Alzheimer's Disease by conflating his past movie roles with current reality, so too did Heston rule the N.R.A. in his own final stages of dementia (see Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 9-11). As PLANET OF THE APES illustrates, guns are too important to be left primarily in the hands of old rich actors with mental deficiencies. Therefore, please support your local chapter of B.A.N.G.S.

A giant "what if the shoe were on the other foot?" parable, the film finds a chauvinistic American astronaut (Charlton Heston) stranded on a planet ruled by apes. Here he's forced to experience racial discrimination of a type once reserved for blacks.Much of "Planet of the Apes" consisted of a hierarchical society of monkeys, apes and gorillas enslaving and persecuting white humans, actions which they justify along bio-genetic lines. Ironically, though it was intended to show support for African Americans, "Planet" came under attack from activists and black leaders. The film, some argued, re-inscribed racial conflict as species conflict (black/monkey vs white/human), and hinged on physical difference as the point of struggle. The film also played into issues of skin-colour hierarchy, making lighter apes more intelligent than their darker, more uncivilised counterparts. Others would argue that the film endorsed various racist "interpretations" of biological evolution; the belief that Africans are "closer to animal than man", and that primates occupy the border zones between mythic poles. In this view, apes and Africans are liminal creatures, simultaneously like and unlike human beings, located between nature and civilisation, origin and destination. These contradictions have led to the film being labelled either well-meaning or reactionary, pandering to white fears of black uprisings and loss of racial dominance. This, after all, was a period of time in which some believed that black liberation struggles would threaten the security of white racial hegemony.Regardless, Charlton Heston is fittingly cast as our "white hero". Heston made a career starring in epics in which Western and non-Western interests collide. In "Gunfighter Nation: The myth of the frontier in 20th century America", for example, cultural historian Richard Slotkin states that the typical Heston character was a "hard and self-willed White male hero", an ultra conservative "who stands for the highest values of civilisation and progress but who is typically besieged from without by non-white savages who greatly outnumber him and beset from within by the decadence, corruption and softness of his own society". Indeed, in the sixties Heston seemed to be perpetually fighting to defend an outpost on the margins of Western civilisation from barbaric onslaughts (The Naked Jungle, El City, 55 Days at Peking, Khartoum etc)."Planet of the Apes" was brilliantly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, who treats us to some wonderful widescreen photography and a couple fine action sequences. Its sequel was "Beneath the Planet of the Apes", directed by Ted Post. Filled with apocalyptic imagery (lots of radiation, nuclear war, disease), the film portrayed its society of apes, the winners in a war between monkey and man, as having become as classist, racist, warmongering and destructive as white humans. Rod Sterling's metaphors are henceforth complicated; both the white man and ape at different points of the franchise's time-line represent both white hegemony and persecuted blacks. Apes, we then learn, were once slaves to humans, just as humans are now slaves to apes. The first two films in the franchise also hinge on a big secret: the ape society is covering up the fact that human civilisation existed before ape civilisations and that apes are "descended" from humans. The implication, depending how literally you regard the film's dubious ape/minority metaphors and reversals, is that whites shamefully regard themselves as having "evolved" from blacks.The next film in the franchise, "Escape from the Planet of the Apes" sees a group of intellectual apes travelling back in time. They arrive on Earth, where they are abused by a paranoid military industrial complex which kills them all, except for one ape child, Caesar.J. Lee Thompson's "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" followed. The best sequel in the franchise, the film sees a now adult Caesar leading a revolution (based on the Watts race riots) against a humanity which is attempting to turn apes into slaves. Significantly, Caesar's army of apes learns to talk. Their first word is "no", a command which refers to the apes' abhorrence of weapons and violence. Next came "Battle for the Planet of the Apes", again directed by Thompson. Here, within a post-nuclear society, an ageing Caesar struggles to combat ape factions which want to wipe out all of humanity. Caesar, in contrast, fights for peaceful coexistence. Caesar wins, leading to a long period of peace between man and monkey.So each ape film film is built around the conflict between a racially dominant oppressive group and a racially subordinate oppressed group seeking survival, harmony or reversal of domination. Each film also presents mediating figures ? typically marginalised and at odds with the oppressing group - who intervene in the conflict, challenge systems and act as advocates of harmony. The advocates of peace rarely prevail and hostility always results in apocalyptic violence.The ape franchise would be rebooted in 2011 with "Rise of the Planet of the Apes". A post-racial film, "Rise's" cast is filled with a cocktail of African Americans, whites and Indo-Americans. For the first time in the franchise, metaphor is replaced by literalism. Here, "literal apes" are "literally rebelling" against the "literal animal cruelty" (chemical testing) directed against them by "literal scientists". Typically (mis?)read in light of post-financial crisis protests, the film ends with apes, led by Caesar, escaping their cages for the trees of local forests. Here, segregation is "in everyone's best interest" and Caesar concludes that separation is "natural". The apes, now free, have returned to their correct, natural and separate place. For now.8/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie poster ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why, why, why would they put the Statue of Liberty on the cover of the VHS or whatever it is that advertises this film? I don't think many people would dispute that it's the final frame that makes this movie -- so use of that American icon is an egregious spoiler.I loved the first 20 minutes of "Planet." The notions of time travel espoused don't seem so far-fetched these days. It's just that the world Taylor and crew find is so cheesily predictable.Man has blasted himself back to the Stone Age, allowing evolution to push runner-up apes into the position of lords of the planet. Inexplicably, they speak English. They also ride horses, shoot guns, smoke cigars, and feel superior just like people did. Oh wow, clever.I haven't seen Charleton Heston for ages in a film and I have to admit he did OK with a hokey script. The fact he immediately hooks up with the prettiest female in sight I presume was a sop for the romantics in the 1968 audience.Alhough the ending of this film was the only part I remembered from when I was 12 years old, it remains just as powerful today. Except for this movie's bookends, I'd say, it pretty much reeks. ---------- EPILOGUE: In re-reading this review on Dec. 15, 2012, I see that IMDb, at least, is displaying a movie poster that lacks the you-know-what.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is to the people who aren't worried about global warming...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the past few months, I have developed a habit to save water in my house by consuming less of it while brushing my teeth, bathing or using it for other purposes. I also have started to use lesser plastic and stuff all the things that I purchase into a huge bag. I may not even be so good at contributing to the global warming reduction but at least I'm trying to aid the innumerable organizations that have been formed to spread awareness about global warming. But alas, I am not being helped much by my family who tend to use a bit more than required.I think that I'll have to make them watch this movie. This is one of the best examples that showcases what would happen due to the evil deeds by humans. Humans would destroy their own civilization is the world continues to be like this. Planet of the Apes is one of the most intelligent movies that I have ever seen. "Bravo!' to it, especially to the climax which is iconic and mesmerizing and shocking!The acting is flawless especially by the lead actor who is brutally tortured by the apes. The apes too look real, okay, not that real now but for a movie made in 1960, they surely are charming. The best thing that I felt abut the movie was that the whole planet of theirs was normal and I didn't feel that the directors want to over exaggerate just because they were apes. Therefore, a viewer would watch somewhat a similar kind of lifestyle followed by the apes just like the humans. This is a must watch, especially for the ones who are ignorant about global warming. 8 out of 10 and Kudos for this fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was directed by Franklin Schaffner, who went on to success with the Oscar-winning biopic Patton. It is the tale of a misanthropic astronaut, and his three comrades, sent on the first interstellar flight, somewhere towards Alpha Centauri. The tale follows Heston's character, Colonel George Taylor, and his two surviving male underlings, Dodge and Landon, after they crash land on a seemingly deserted Earth-like world. The female member of the crew, Stewart, has died due to an air leak in her hibernation capsule.While they think they are in a different solar system, and have traveled over two thousand years into the future, it not too slowly becomes apparent that they are back on Earth. The willful suspension of disbelief is needed, of course, because the chances that astronauts could not tell that they were under our sun, moon, and constellations- even a few millennia hence, is unlikely. Then there is the terrestrial flora, then the encounter with mute humans (how unlikely is that?), and then being captured by English speaking gorillas on a hunt. I mean- they speak English, and American astronauts cannot piece things together? Yet, if one can give in to that initial act, all the rest of the film- and subsequent series, unfolds with quite a bit of logic, although at times seeming at odds.Dodge ends up killed and stuffed in an ape museum while Landon is lobotomized so he cannot speak. Taylor cannot speak, initially, because he has been shot in the throat by a gorilla. He is mended by two chimpanzee scientists, Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell), an archaeologist, who believe he is 'bright.' She calls him Bright Eyes. They are under the tutelage of Dr. Zaius, an orangutan bureaucrat who knows the secret that his world is earth, and that taking humans once ruled it.Eventually, Taylor regains his voice, after being put on by trial with Zira and Cornelius, who are charged with heresy, and one of the film's many signature moments comes when Taylor is netted and captured after escaping, and rails to the apes who catch him, 'Get your stinkin' paws off me you damn dirty ape!' Yet, by the time that line is uttered the viewer has so bought into the film's suspension of disbelief, that when we see the shock on the faces of the apes, upon hearing a human speak, it mirrors the viewers' shock. Later, at the trial comes the great sequence where the three orangutan inquisitors will hear no more, and cover their eyes, mouths, and ears, in the classic see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil pose.What some forget, in all the manifest political analogies the film and series put forth- such as the three ape races corresponding with the three main Classical stocks of Man: Negroid/Gorilla, Caucasoid/Chimpanzee, and Mongoloid/Orangutan, is that Planet Of The Apes was also a devastating critique of organized religion and its deliberate deceits. Zira and Cornelius, with Zira's nephew, free Taylor, and he and Nova (Linda Harrison)- the female human given to him as a mate, escape with them to The Forbidden Zone- the desert where Taylor first landed. Zaius and the gorillas follow, on horseback, and Cornelius shows proof that humans preceded apes on the planet, including a human doll that could speak. Taylor asks if an ape would make a doll that speaks. They also find dentures and an artificial heart valve. The gorillas attack and Taylor takes Zaius hostage, gets food, water, a rifle and ammo, and he and Nova are allowed to escape along the shoreline, after scorning the man with a citation from Ape scripture: 'Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death.' Zaius then blows up the cave and the secret of human history predating ape culture.One might think that Taylor should have pieced things together by now, but the film ends with him finally linking things up, when he comes across the deteriorated upper half of the Statue Of Liberty, and curses his ancestors. Whether the statue has been blown up or simply buried in sand is unclear. What is clear is that it is not only a great twist ending to the film, thought up by the film's original screenwriter, Rod Serling of The Twilight Zone fame, but an iconic political image- and the most devastating of the 1960s to come from film. Here is Heston, the embodiment of intelligent macho American goodness- far more so than the more one dimensional icon of John Wayne, on his knees and wailing, pounding the sand impotently, as all that was America is in ruins. Given that this was released not long after the Tet Offensive showed that America was losing in Vietnam, its impact was enormous.The film was one of the two great science fiction films released that year, which made sci fi a more respectable subject for serious drama. The other, of course, was Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose iconic imagery was on a par with this film's. Serling's original script, which more closely followed the novel's futuristic themes, was redone by Michael Wilson, who for budgetary reasons had to primitivize the ape society. The film won three Oscars- for best score, by Jerry Goldsmith, Best Costume Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Makeup- an honorary award specifically for the film's historic impact. It is the truly otherworldly and spooky score by Goldsmith that- along with Serling's original screenplay, make the film such a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Man Still an Ape?--Or Rather Yet to Become One? Either Way, It's--A Madhouse!--A Madhouse!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many insolently skeptical apes, with their religion of biological evolution, and, thus, by extension, anti-social Darwinism, too, might still be cynically, insultingly sneering that they need to see a "miracle," before they'll ever agree to capitulate, and acknowledge the authority of the Lord; in the only real way there is to verify it, through the most rationally sound and morally sober kind of insight, which leaves even them with fundamentally no excuse, particularly if their only real intent is to violate the Golden Rule without ever expecting to have to answer for it. However, by the time their "miracle" arrives, which it inevitably shall, and shortly, by now, in this world; they "might" just wish it hadn't, as those who insist upon tempting the Lord, and taking it so mockingly, belittlingly, scornfully out, even on the flesh of His servants. Gene Kelly, as E.K. Hornbeck, was so right, from Inherit the Wind, when he said, to Spencer Tracy, as Henry Drummond, "Face it, Darwin was wrong, man's still an ape!" But, then, who knows??For, if Charlton Heston is right, it may be a bit more loosely accurate to say he's not quite an ape?yet! I could seriously entertain this view a bit more plausibly, were it not for the fact that the words are always just about to come out of my mouth: "Get even your eyes, indeed, even your very 'thoughts,' off me, you filthy ape!" In other words, I feel I'm already here, as I continue screaming, at least internally, that "It's a Madhouse!?A Madhouse!" . . . Seriously, though, is there really any solidly scientific proof that any species transforms into another, rather than their being as separate as the Bible says they were originally created to be (Genesis 1:24-25)? I'm not referring to just evidence, either, with its yet insufficient support of such a possible conclusion. Even God is good at helping provide such misleading "evidence," for the sake of those who insist upon it, even with anything, at bottom, but the most "neutrally scientific" of motives (Isaiah 28:9-13) (Matthew 13:10-17); when He likewise helps it to be "arguable," for instance, that even Genesis 1:20-22 supports the notion that all life began in the sea, although never-mind the birds. Moreover, there's no doubt even the way many animals are structured would seem to indicate that, comparatively speaking, either it had to have happened the evolutionary way, or else God designed it deliberately to look as if it did. The atheist will sneer that he doesn't like it, that such would be a stupid idea, of any such "incompetently bungling" God. Yet, while the real God is about as fundamentally lovable, and animated by a sense of humor, as George Burns; He can also be as "difficult," when irreverently taunted and mocked into provocation (Romans 1:17-32) (Hebrews 11:6), as Jose Perez, in the Steambath; and, in the words of this enigmatic "Attendant," just as "whimsically," harrowingly unpredictable! If one doesn't like it, that's just tough luck, pal; especially if he truly insists, again, upon getting too inordinately insolent about it! . . . And where's their supposed proof, by the way, that life even spontaneously generates, from dead matter, whatever that is (Hebrews 12:25-28) (II Peter 3:10-12), if only the conditions are right? Indeed, even modern science cannot find any "solid stuff" called "matter," which is "apparently" created from nothing. Even Job was smarter than most such contemporary "educators," although he had no answer, when God reminded him that he simply hadn't been there, at the Creation; and that even he wasn't nearly as smart as he thought he was (Job, Chapters 38-41), let-alone his "Christianly comforting friends," despite even their most characteristically, perennially eloquent sermons, to this very day (Job 42:7-9), along with their basically Darwinian instincts against Job! The skeptics also emphasize statistical probabilities, and the odds against earth being the only place which contains life. But, again, it has first to be proved, short of actually discovering any extraterrestrial life, that it does, in fact, self-generate, merely given the right physical conditions. . . . And, let's be honest, for that's at least one basic reason why the skeptics really want to find life out there?not just because the prospect is so "neutrally fascinating." They feel, at least instinctively, that such a discovery will also help shatter the Biblically "primitive myth." They don't want God to exist, and just the fact that one can no less instinctively smell as much, despite all their "pious" denials, even and especially to themselves, often enough, should be more than sufficient, all by itself, in confirming this fact, even though it's not the only evidence to support as much. Also, I'm really not trying to attack or ridicule them, the way they characteristically do to their opponents. I understand their pain! I personally experience every instinct in their bodies, unlike the kind of typically religious people who smell no less intolerantly and provocatively foul! For my part, however, it's not a question of what I wish to be true! To the contrary, the notion of everlasting sleep, beyond the grave, is hardly the most discomforting thought, and would be preferable, in one irreducibly ever-relieving sense, to even the possibility of going to a place of everlasting torment, let-alone one too "eternally blissful" to imagine! It's simply a question of what I do, in fact, believe to be objectively the case, along with my arguments in support of it, which are hardly being exhausted here!

		<shortDescription>Cheesy, but clever sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Possible Spoilers-The unfortunate thing about films with great endings, particularly films that have been around for awhile, is that some great endings become ingrained in pop culture, and therefore hinder the viewing of said film for the first time. 'Planet of the Apes' is one of those films, and while watching it for the first time, I couldn't help but feel I was just plowing through an hour and a half of film to get to that one great shot (the 'money shot' if you will) on the beach. In between the first frame and the last, however, there are some good (albeit cheesy) scenes, and actually a pretty decent and innovative script, not to mention a bizarre score that at times sounds like a cross between progressive jazz and a two year old experimenting with a Casio keyboard, 'Planet of the Apes' suffers from some pretty awful paper mache sets that look like they could have been borrowed from the set of The Flintstones (let's not apply logic to that statement, shall we?), mod 1960's outfits, and too many buffalo shots of Charlton Heston, but in all was a fun film made even more classic by it's treatment during the subsequent nearly four decades, and the evolution of Mr. Chuck Heston himself. How can one refrain from at least smiling when we hear him spit out the words 'Damn dirty ape' (seemingly forty times) or laugh when Chuck, president of the NRA, stands bare-chested, greased up and cocks his gun with the perpetual grimace that seems to always be on his face. On its own merits, 'Planet of the Apes' is a good sci-fi flick, and fairly groundbreaking in terms of its premise, but it has only improved with age because of the iconic status it has been awarded and its firm place in our pop culture. I know that I for one certainly was internally singing the songs from The Simpsons' take on the film, a stage musical which, if you didn't already know the ending to the film, gives us the astronaut brilliantly portrayed by the great Troy McClure) singing, 'Oh my god, I was wrong, it was earth all along ? you've finally made a monkey out of me.' It takes a film with a certain degree of mettle to inspire this kind of idolatry and 'Planet of the Apes' is a classic film that has it in spades. --Shelly</fullReview>

Darwin's theory of evolution meets "The Twilight Zone" : Square-jawed American astronaut commander Taylor (Heston in this his other iconic role) finds himself in the future on a distant planet ruled by simians after he crashes his spaceship into hell. Wiggy dialogue despite some Orwellian undertones and some all too familiar sequences make for a unique sci-fi flick which spawned four more films and a short-lived tv series. A special Oscar was given to make-up guru John Chambers for his startingly realistic creations. Co-scripted by Rod Serling. One of cinema's greatest and chilling endings: I won't give it away but I relish and actually felt my spine-chill when Heston screams: "You Maniacs! Damn you! Damn you all to HELL!!!"

		<shortDescription>Clumsy and unscientific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Warning! Spoilers below!This film isn't a true classic, even if its reputation to some extent makes it so. Let me explain why. A true classic, whether it's a novel or a film, relies on two things; quality and substance. Planet of the Apes has got neither of these things. The technical quality is average, with Schaffner's rather clumsy story telling. The three astronauts are not interacting, not giving the audience any base for compassion or deeper understanding. Heston is the main character and apparently some sort of a leader, but acts if he were a sarcastic teenager in a stolen car. It is not convincing nor appropriate.As for substance, the plot is in its essence intriguing, but displayed as a farse. Why were they on this mission? Who sent them? And the role of the fourth, female astronaut as some kind of ant-queen is ridiculous! The scientific grounds are also wrongly treated. How could these three men not realise that they were in fact on earth all the time. Did they really expect alien life forms to be shaped like the ones on earth? Come on! And the transition from man to ape dominance is not likely to occur in only 2000 years. Evolution (mutations) is much slower than that, but the writer obviously did not care about basic Darwinism, since he is a religious man.There's more to tell, but all in all, it is a rather bad film. Still, it is oddly enough an interesting object of discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Chimps/Apes, I agree with you. The human race is awful. Though i wonder why the director/writers selected you guys to rule the planet. I mean, you guys are as violent as humans. But yeah, you did not invent bombs and missiles.Manoj Night Shyamalan was almost certainly inspired by this film when he made The Village. The sci-fi genre has often been used to express reservations about human nature - THE TIME MACHINE, FORBIDDEN PLANET, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE etc come to mind.Anyway, some doors are best left shut. Is that what the film tries to tell us? There are some areas which are best left to the powers that be. Isn't that what the ending suggested? I mean, a lot of these writers who seem to be writing satire about human society are total fascists. They simply convey their idea of the way things ought to be in the guise of satire.Charlton Heston was great with his raw physicality, how fit was this guy. I wouldn't have completed this movie if it weren't for him. Linda Harrison looked so out of place among all the ugly humans. She is like the token beautiful woman kept for the sole civilized male.I liked the the grand vistas and especially the way the final scene was shot. It was a great idea to set the ending on the beach.Despite all the interesting ideas expressed in the film, I did not enjoy watching it. And the reason is you chimps. It is tough to watch a movie where humans are dressed up as chimps and you are aware of this fact. The make up was awful.Best Regards, Pimpin.(4/10)</fullReview>

One time Charston Heston moved quick and the Monkey/Person's eyes couldn't follow him. Yeah, that act would fly over real quick in the Jungle, or should I say, Monkeyland.And the special effects were like watching an episode of South Park, but with worse writing. Who wrote this thing, Monkeys? Probably not, or it would have been more realistic.If you're looking for a good DVD to spend you hard earned money on, I'd suggest getting Season 1 and 2 of Everyone Loves Raymond, or picking up a copy of Earth Girls are Easy, with the real Julie Brown, not that Wubba, Wubba, Wubba, faker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the apes is an overrated film. When i saw the movie all the way through for the first time in 1998 on the films 30th anniversary it's faults became glaringly evident. First off if a nuclear war occurred in 2000 years humans would have rebuilt their society. So why were the humans dumb brutes? You can't just throw away 100,000 years of evolution. Secondly Manhattan island would have been intact only the buildings would have been destroyed there is no coastline in New York. Also how did the apes develop the power of speech? If anything they should have developed their own language. The book by Pierre Boulle is actually more accurate scientifically because the protagonist actually travels to another planet. Since he approaches the speed of light when he finally returns to earth several hundred thousand years have gone by and apes are the dominant species there too. More realistic. What i would have preferred to see is a film with 2 dominant species apes and man and Heston sides with the apes thus lending credence to the film's tagline "somewhere in the universe there is something better than man. Interestingly enough some of the weaker Twilight Zone episodes written by Rod Serling had these same inaccuracies scientifically. Serling was better when he wrote about "ordinary" people facing the unknown instead of hard science fiction</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The image of Charlton Heston kissing a monkey is nearly as priceless as watching Charlton Heston play a Mexican in 'Touch of Evil.' There's something about him that tickles my generation, or maybe it's just me. But watching Heston act in an ensemble of ape-people seems too appropriate. It's about what you expect when you press play. Absurd, ultra- masculine, and the plot line is about ankle deep. Watching the film this week was the first time I'd made an effort to see 'Plant of the Apes,' somehow I feel as though, as a child, watching it on TNT or PBS or whatever channel that plays the same 4 B movies every month, that there was more going on, that the film made sense, but that feeling is now gone. 'Planet of the Apes' just kind of ends at one point, nothing really happens, a lot of tension building for nothing. The famous Statue of Liberty scene ("You Maniacs! You blew it up!) just kind of appears and you wonder, what happened to the rest of the plot? Some people may argue that the plot isn't the point, that it's really a B-movie cloaked as an early blockbuster and that the campy qualities of the film are the point of watching it. OK. I can dig that. Because it's really an awful film. Irredeemably awful. But that's just if you take it seriously, with a grain of salt, it's OK, two and half stars. That's like 5 out of ten, and that's half way to perfect. It's funny. Heston is really just classic Heston, Stallone-funny before steroids were chic. I mean, I guess how else do you take it, he's with a bunch of talking apes, but the film seems to want to take itself more seriously, like it should have some resonating message about America and humanity. But it doesn't, it's all lost and muddled in the mediocre plot that just never really develops. The new version (Tim Burton and Mark Wahlberg) tries to resolve those issues, tie up the plot, give it a message, and in that context it's a more successful film, but it's a worse film. I just don't think America (or possibly the world) is ready to receive a message from talking apes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good acting by Heston, good make-up, more or less original story. In the other hand, some awful actings by other members of the cast (the old apes don't know another way of giving their lines but shouting all the time), a lot of plot holes and several very long, slow and completely unnecessary scenes. Probably this is the main problem: continuous discussions and discussions about nonsense (and framed by scenes of Heston being beaten by the monkeys... and being beaten again... and being beaten again...)Surely, this is an artwork in comparison to Burton's remake. But that is like saying Keanu Reeves acts fine if you compare him to Bon Jovi.And yes, this is a classic, but one of the boring ones. Good for being watched once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to post apocalyptic Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first and best of the Planet of the Apes movies.A spaceship with a crew of four passes through a strange vortex and crash lands on a strange planet, which turns out to be Earth after a nuclear war. One of the crew is killed and the three survivors, lead by Taylor start searching for signs of life. When they do, they get a huge shock. This nuclear war has made apes act like humans and the humans act like the apes. The apes hunt humans for sport. The crew are captured and one of them is put on display in the museum, one is used for experiments and Taylor manages to survive due to him being able to talk. He makes friends with a chimpanzee couple and along with his lady friend Nova, they help them to escape 'Ape City'. The chimpanzee couple join them as one of them has found some artefacts, including a doll, in the Forbidden Zone. The gorillas catch up with them and Taylor and Nova set off after Taylor threatens the ape leader. As they make their way, Taylor comes across the ruins of a very familiar landmark and gets the shock of his life...Now to the cast. Taylor is played by the excellent Charlton Heston and the chimpanzee couple are played by Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall. James Whitmore (Them!) and Maurice Evans also appear as apes. Planet of the Apes has an excellent, haunting music score, along with some nice scenery. Four sequels followed.This movie is a must see, especially for sci fi fans like myself.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Planet of the Apes is an absolute classic of 60's cinema. It is exciting and frightening in the same breath. This is mainly due to the skilled direction of Franklin Schafner, and the superb lead performance of Charlton Heston as the doomed Taylor. Others like Roddy McDowell and Kim Novak as Cornelius and Zera do extremely well and add to the fun. The real fun is to be had in John Chambers genius of Ape make-up and the haunting themes of Jerry Goldsmith's score. This movie proved to be hard to top. Lets hope that Tim Burton, Mark Wahlberg and co can do justice to a great film by providing us with a skilled remake. A pure delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, once you get past the over dramatic delivered lines by Charleton Heston, you have nothing but a good time with this marvelous sci-fi classic. I swear, I think I've almost heard every reference of this movie. May I say also, please stick to this original instead of the remake, you'll thank me later. Charlton plays an American astronaut who travels to the future with his colleges, and they crash on an "unknown" planet where apes are in charge and treat humans like zoo creatures.The plot gets more amusing as Charlton is the only human that can speak and communicate as the apes do. Only three apes are on his side and believe his incredible journey and some hot mute chick. :) Which by the way, her legs are shaved, her body is in great shape, and her teeth are perfectly white. I love these plot holes. But Planet of the Apes is a classic that should not be missed! It's a little corny, but for it's time, this was incredible and still to this day I think everyone can enjoy the story. To Dr. Zieus! The Ape who knew too much! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlton Heston is an astronaut whose ships crashes on a planet. Apes on horseback packing guns capture him. He's kept in a zoo with other pre-humans who can't talk. Kindly apes Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunterbefriend him and try to help him when they discover he is one human who can talk.The film is part social satire, part exploration of science versus superstition and part anti-prejudice message film. The movie's message seems like tootsie-pop philosophy today. It might have been "heavy" in the stoned 60s but not any more. The ending of the movie is ridiculous. The book has a completely different ending. Remade by Tim Burton.Unfortunately, Heston once again ruins the film with his wooden acting and the stilted delivery of his lines. His ending lines of the film are atrocious and laughable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlton Heston dons a loincloth and impersonates a human in this cheezy cult classic about a future world where apes walk upright and speak in clipped British accents.What a fun movie this is, thanks mostly to Heston's inability to deliver a line in a manner that even remotely resembles the way an actual human being would deliver it ("You bloody baboon!!") The film makes a nice companion piece with another 1968 release in which apes figure heavily, "2001: A Space Odyssey," though neither film will leave you feeling especially rosy about the eventual fate of man (we're apparently going to be either personal valets to gorillas or abstract fetuses floating through space).A host of classy actors appears in this, but you won't recognize any of them, thanks to the truly impressive makeup effects of John Chambers.

		<fullReview>There are, I think, several genres hiding under the title of science fiction. The basic technique is to take us out of the world in which we live, but the intent of the author determines. Why. I like Phil Dick's intent, which is first to fold and twist the very fabric of those worlds well before he gets to moralizing, even when he thinks that is the primary thing he is doing.But others take the science fiction route merely to focus on a specific foible. I find these incredibly tiring because usually the pattern is that of Jonathon Swift, which is make the point bold, clear and simple. But in his case, the idea was to challenge in such a way that well after the story ends, you start to weave your own, new stories because the root of what you previously had was destroyed.This is the "Star Trek" tradition. Boring.In this case, they added two extra attractions: monkey suits that for the time were pretty impressive and that Rod Serling type twist at the end, which is a bit ruined because we guess it long before.So, I will report that in my estimation, this is not worth watching. Charlton Heston is something of a blot in film history, and the point of this ? though laudable ? is as blunt and useless as he is.Now, the inevitable game: comparison with the Burton remake, which is generally panned. Burton isn't interest in morals; he does not believe in them. He doesn't intend to deliver a useful story at all, rather a mood, a world. All of his movies are science fiction movies in this respect. I saw this with "Sweeny Todd," to help me with the comparison. I think I value Burton's attempt more, because he at least allowed us to get past the costumes and believe. Its not much, but it doesn't hurt. This one does.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off, I am a *HUGE* Charlton Heston fan! Seriously, Heston has given much better performances in films such as "The Greatest Show On Earth", "BEN-HUR" &amp; "The Ten Commandments". I reckon you check those out before you see this overrated pile of worthless nothing. Believe me when I say this flick is over-hyped &amp; overrated as HECK! The fact is... I DON'T GET IT! Why is this film so popular? Did I watch the exact same movie that everybody else is raving about??? I'm really surprised the end credits didn't say this motion picture was a work of FICTION, or that the characters were fiction! 'Causer I pretty much don't like this FRANCHISE as a whole! And I don't care a SPECK that it's based off a book (because I'm never reading that.) And don't even bring up the RECENT films - those apes look so fake. An animated ape will NEVER look like a real ape, no matter whole long you work on animating it! But the ape masks in this film looked *so* fake, it was hard to take those characters seriously! (LULZ) That's why I have to shamelessly give credit to the 2001 Tim Burton version, because the makeup looked a WHOLE lot more impressive, convincing, and well-done. Also, for most of the movie, Heston doesn't talk for some reason just because he gets shot in the neck (???) And a lot of times he often stands around with his clothes off (naked), and screams the H-word and the D-word. Seriously, how is this a G-rated film!? (Suggested MPAA: PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, nudity, language, and menace) I am certainly GLAD I did not grow up with his film! Because, I would've likely lost half of my brain if I did! I mean, not only do I hate the fact that Charlton Heston, one of the greatest actors of all time, took part in this confusing &amp; uncomfortable stinker, nor that it started a whole career of bad film choices for him, nor that I believe this film is mostly just loved by the sweaty-nerd, Darwinist-brainwashed, junky bozos who have a rather BAD taste in film... ...but the theory of evolutionism is existent in this flick, and even tries to be RAMMED down our throats. How?? It's all in the visuals, rather than dialogue. Darwin's theory as a whole is NOT true! And it isn't Science! Too many buy into it, &amp; it's not true because the "majority" believes it, like they used to believe the sun went around the earth. Don't believe me?? Science says so! 2/10 "2" for one of my favorite actors being IN the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleeping for two thousand years yeah that's real believable. Now I'm a fan of science fiction movies but this one just did not make any sense to me. With only one crew member dying in the ship while the other three survived. The way all the water started spraying in the ship was not very believable, since the ship would have been air tight so nothing from space could get in or out of the ship. The acting was not very believable throughout the movie like when they were coming down the hill at the beginning of the movie and fell when they got to the bottom. Come on now that hill was not even that steep for them to fall when they got to the bottom. The apes did not even look like real apes. When they get attacked all the humans are running around in different directions while the apes are on horseback with guns shooting humans that are running away. They also have nets that they throw on the humans and drag them so they can not get away. The scientist apes all have nice clothing to wear while the humans have pretty much nothing to wear. It shows that the humans really are at the bottom in this world. The humans are made to do work for the apes while they are locked in cages and buildings. The movie ends with George Taylor and a lady riding horse back across the beach and seeing the Statue of Liberty under sand. George realizes that he was on planet Earth along just two thousand years in the future. I personally recommend seeing the new release of Planet of the Apes because the storyline seems easier to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the Tim Burton remake, I think it's alright, and then I saw this original version from director Franklin J. Schaffner (Patton). George Taylor (Ben-Hur's Charlton Heston) is an astronaut thinking he and his team are returning to Earth, but they crash in a forbidden land somewhere else. When they do come across civilisation, one is killed and Taylor and his friend taken prisoner by talking apes! When captured Taylor was shot in the neck, so he can't speak. While in prison though he befriends and interests Dr. Zira (A Matter of Life and Death's Kim Hunter). On the planet all humans are dumb and can't think, but Zira believes this "creature" is unique when she learns he can write. She convinces her fiancé Cornelius (Fright Night's Roddy McDowall) eventually too. After a long while Taylor does speak a great movie line, and the apes including Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) are sort of afraid of him, and they have a court case to debate his existence as a superior human being. The ending of the film is the most disturbing (almost like Burton's), when Taylor discovers he was on Earth all along, and you see the Statue of Liberty in the sand. Also starring Linda Harrison as Nova. Heston, with special effects make-up covered McDowall and Hunter make fantastic performances, and it is a fantastic futuristic film with a witty and clever script that grips you all the way, it definitely deserves to be in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith and an Honorary Award for John Chambers (make up). It was number 18 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 66 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape.") and it was number 59 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills.

I think apes are the most interesting in their natural habitats. Let's not make them climb buildings or wield guns - unless it's cheap laughs we're after.It is almost frightening to think how many people found this exciting and believable. Actually, no... take that back. In all honesty, I am really just very jealous that I don't possess the kind of mind that can appreciate sci-fi in which most actors are dressed as monkeys. Fans of "Planet of the Apes" are probably quite easily impressed and find it easy to believe almost any world that is offered to them on the big screen, and that is a mind-set that must be nice to live with.In fact, since so many people love dressed, talking apes, how about doing a monkey version of "Pride &amp; Prejudice"? This should thrill Jane Austen fans, and finally get them to watch sci-fi.POTA is a visually unattractive bundle of nonsense, with a dull story, dull characters, and a premise that would barely work in a 25-cent comic-book targeted at 4 year-olds. Why this silly movie serial isn't widely regarded as a camp classic is beyond me.It doesn't exactly help matters to hear Roddy's voice behind one of those ugly/laughable primate suits. Neither do dumb names, such as Cornelius, Zaius and some other name starting with "Z", I forget which. (Rule 128b in the "Sci-Fi Movies &amp; Novels How-To Manual" says: "letters X and Z lend an otherworldly quality to the otherwise inane proceedings. Use those letters as much as possible.")The major twist ending doesn't help matters much, either. Having Heston shout at the sky pathetically is hardly a noteworthy end to a movie.Some critic called this "a hysterical parable on race relations". I, on the other hand, just prefer to call it "a bunch of crap". You can find meaning in a dog turd if you look hard enough...Do yourself a favour and watch an episode of "Monkey World" on "Animal Planet" instead of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This parody of a moronic, extremely conservative American landscape of the 60's was extremely comical, I particularly enjoyed how the Anglo-Saxon Protestants were portrayed as arrogant demagogic chimps, but it eventually fails as a sci-fi medium though. Most of the messages come from the "hippie mentality", a closed era sectarian movement of the time, complete with the same bland, homogeneity and conformist attitude found in the corrupt, feeble minded Nixon-era regime. Their "roam free, roam naked" simplistic take on politics caused most of the narcissistic yuppie infestation of the 1980's that followed the collapse of societal norms in the 70's. In the film they were portrayed as the wild people.Heston, although conservative and passé at the time, not to mention dull, was to play the anti-hero, a hapless yoke who falls into a time zone and comes out nude in the end while cursing monkey paws. He gets incarcerated and eventually rides bareback with a half-nude waif who mumbles and yet is articulate enough to wear clothing. The ape mentality is clichéd, drawn from thug-like caricatures of noted historic figures, most notably "Boss Tweed" of New York fame. It's all very annoying to watch unless you are on drugs or blind. Avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

There were memorable quotes in this film, like "Get your stinkin' paws off me you damn dirty ape!" and "It's a madhouse in here," both said by Charlton Heston, the star in this film. I must say that i did NOT like this film at first, but watching it over again for the second time, it made me appreciate the film more for what it was.
